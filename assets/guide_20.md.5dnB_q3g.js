The lighthouse is located within Fire Island National Seashore and just to the east of Robert Moses State Park. It is part of the Fire Island Light Station which contains the light, keepers quarters, the lens building containing the original first-order Fresnel lens, and a boat house. History The original first order Fresnel lens The current lighthouse is a stone tower that began operation in 1858 to replace the tower originally built in 1826. The United States Coast Guard decommissioned the light in 1974. In 1982 the Fire Island Lighthouse Preservation Society (FILPS) was formed to preserve the lighthouse. FILPS raised over $1.2 million to restore the tower and light. On May 25, 1986 the United States Coast Guard returned the Fire Island Lighthouse to an active aid to navigation. On February 22, 2006, the light became a private aid to navigation. It continues to be on the nautical charts, but is operated and maintained by the Fire Island Lighthouse Preservation Society and not the USCG. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1981 and a boundary increase for the national historic district occurred in 2010. See also: See also: It is listed as Fire Island Light, number 695, in the USCG light lists. When the lighthouse was built it was on the edge of Fire Island Inlet and marked the western end of Fire Island. However Fire Island has extended itself through accumulating sand so that the lighthouse is now nearly from the western end of the island at Democrat Point. The Archives Center at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History has a collection (#1055) of souvenir postcards of lighthouses and has digitized 272 of these and made them available online. These include postcards of Fire Island LightSmithsonian lighthouse postcards with links to customized nautical charts provided by National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration. The lighthouse celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2008, the same year as the 100th anniversary of Robert Moses State Park. Access Fire Island Lighthouse The lighthouse can be accessed by a short walk from Robert Moses State Park ‚Äì Field 5. It is open to the public daily. Tower tours are available for a small fee. In popular culture From 1970 to 1975, the lighthouse and its surrounding area were seen in the opening and closing credits sequences of the CBS television soap opera The Guiding Light.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KZ2G4KJFUMhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYrWeRDrktc Some of the final episode of season 1 of TV show The Following was filmed at Fire Island Lighthouse and surrounding buildings. Men in Black II also included some filming on the island in the immediate vicinity of the lighthouse. A 1999 Channel 4 TV series featuring Stephen Fry and called Fire Island included filming of the lighthouse.

She was the first ship of the Navy to bear the name, and was the name ship of her class. She saw active service from 1782 to 1811, in Europe and the West Indies. Origins The British East India Company had Randall build a 74-gun ship under the name Bengal. They then presented (donated) her to the Royal Navy, which renamed her HMS Ganges.Hackman (2001), p.224. The Royal Navy commissioned Ganges in February 1782 under the command of Captain Charles Fielding. She was paid-off in March, but immediately recommissioned under Captain J. Lutterell as a guardship at Portsmouth. Between 1784 and 1787, she was under the command of Captain Sir Roger Curtis. In October 1787 she became the flagship of Rear-Admiral Sir Francis Drake. She was recommissioned in December 1790 under Captain Anthony Molloy.Winfield (2008), p.458. French Revolutionary Wars In 1794, whilst under the command of Captain William Truscott, she and captured the French corvette Jacobine. Jacobin was armed with twenty-four 12-pounder guns, and had a crew of 220 men; she was nine days out of Brest and taken nothing. The Royal Navy took Jacobin into service as HMS Matilda. Ganges was part of the squadron commanded by Admiral John Gell, which escorted a Spanish ship they had captured from the French back to Portsmouth. The ownership of the ship was a matter of some debate and was not settled until 4 February 1795, when the value of the cargo was put at ¬£935,000. At this time all the crew, captains, officers and admirals received a share of the prize money, Admiral Hood taking away ¬£50,000. Besides Ganges, the ships that conveyed the Spanish prize to Portsmouth were , , and .Annual Register (1795), Chronicle, p. 6. Ganges shared in the prize money from the capture of the French supply ship Marsouin by on 11 March 1796. Ganges was one of the ships at Spithead in 1797 Ganges was under the command of Captain Thomas Fremantle at the Battle of Copenhagen. She had on board a contingent of soldiers from the 49th Foot, commanded by Isaac Brock. Their mission was to storm the forts at Copenhagen, but the outcome of the naval battle made the assault unnecessary. Napoleonic Wars Ganges was one of six British warships that shared in the capture on 23 August 1807 of the Danish vessel Speculation. Ganges was also present at the Second Battle of Copenhagen. She bore the flag of Commodore Richard Goodwin Keats, and was commanded by Captain Peter Halkett. During the battle Keats placed a portrait of Admiral Nelson on the mizzen mast where it was said to have encouraged officers and men alike despite being covered in the blood and brains of an unfortunate seaman. In September 1810, two row-boat luggers, one from , under the command of Lieutenant Robert Streatfield, and one from Ganges, under the command Lieutenants Stackpole, captured two Danish armed vessels off Lessoe. There were no British casualties. Fate She was commissioned as a prison ship on 12 December 1811 for holding prisoners of war. Then in 1814 she was transferred to the Transport Board. Ganges was broken up at Plymouth in 1816. Notes References *Lavery, Brian (2003) The Ship of the Line - Volume 1: The development of the battlefleet 1650-1850. Conway Maritime Press. . * *J.

In general, such a solution assumes a power series with unknown coefficients, then substitutes that solution into the differential equation to find a recurrence relation for the coefficients.  Method  Consider the second-order linear differential equation : a_2(z)f(z)+a_1(z)f'(z)+a_0(z)f(z)=0.\\\\;\\\\\\\\! Suppose a2 is nonzero for all z. Then we can divide throughout to obtain : f+{a_1(z)\\\\over a_2(z)}f'+{a_0(z)\\\\over a_2(z)}f=0. Suppose further that a1/a2 and a0/a2 are analytic functions. The power series method calls for the construction of a power series solution :f=\\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty A_kz^k. If a2 is zero for some z, then the Frobenius method, a variation on this method, is suited to deal with so called \\"singular points\\".

A simpler way using Taylor series  A much simpler way of solving this equation (and power series solution in general) using the Taylor series form of the expansion. Here we assume the answer is of the form : f=\\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty {A_kz^k\\\\over {k!}} If we do this, the general rule for obtaining the recurrence relationship for the coefficients is :y^{[n]} \\\\to A_{k+n} and :x^m y^{[n]} \\\\to (k)(k-1)\\\\cdots(k-m+1)A_{k+n-m} In this case we can solve the Hermite equation in fewer steps: : f-2zf'+\\\\lambda f=0;\\\\;\\\\lambda=1 becomes : A_{k+2} -2kA_k +\\\\lambda A_k=0 or : A_{k+2} = (2k-\\\\lambda) A_k in the series : f=\\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty {A_kz^k\\\\over {k!}} Nonlinear equations The power series method can be applied to certain nonlinear differential equations, though with less flexibility. A very large class of nonlinear equations can be solved analytically by using the Parker‚ÄìSochacki method. Since the Parker‚ÄìSochacki method involves an expansion of the original system of ordinary differential equations through auxiliary equations, it is not simply referred to as the power series method. The Parker‚ÄìSochacki method is done before the power series method to make the power series method possible on many nonlinear problems. An ODE problem can be expanded with the auxiliary variables which make the power series method trivial for an equivalent, larger system. Expanding the ODE problem with auxiliary variables produces the same coefficients (since the power series for a function is unique) at the cost of also calculating the coefficients of auxiliary equations. Many times, without using auxiliary variables, there is no known way to get the power series for the solution to a system, hence the power series method alone is difficult to apply to most nonlinear equations. The power series method will give solutions only to initial value problems (opposed to boundary value problems), this is not an issue when dealing with linear equations since the solution may turn up multiple linearly independent solutions which may be combined (by superposition) to solve boundary value problems as well. A further restriction is that the series coefficients will be specified by a nonlinear recurrence (the nonlinearities are inherited from the differential equation). In order for the solution method to work, as in linear equations, it is necessary to express every term in the nonlinear equation as a power series so that all of the terms may be combined into one power series. As an example, consider the initial value problem :F F + 2 F'^2 + \\\\eta F' = 0 \\\\quad ; \\\\quad F(1) = 0 \\\\ , \\\\ F'(1) = -\\\\frac{1}{2} which describes a solution to capillary-driven flow in a groove. There are two nonlinearities: the first and second terms involve products. The initial values are given at \\\\eta = 1, which hints that the power series must be set up as: :F(\\\\eta) = \\\\sum_{i = 0}^{\\\\infty} c_i (\\\\eta - 1)^i since in this way :\\\\frac{d^n F}{d \\\\eta^n} \\\\Bigg_{\\\\eta = 1} = n! \\\\ c_n which makes the initial values very easy to evaluate. It is necessary to rewrite the equation slightly in light of the definition of the power series, :F F + 2 F'^2 + (\\\\eta - 1) F' + F' = 0 \\\\quad ; \\\\quad F(1) = 0 \\\\ , \\\\ F'(1) = -\\\\frac{1}{2} so that the third term contains the same form \\\\eta - 1 that shows in the power series. The last consideration is what to do with the products; substituting the power series in would result in products of power series when it's necessary that each term be its own power series. This is where the Cauchy product :\\\\left(\\\\sum_{i = 0}^{\\\\infty} a_i x^i\\\\right) \\\\left(\\\\sum_{i = 0}^{\\\\infty} b_i x^i\\\\right) = \\\\sum_{i = 0}^{\\\\infty} x^i \\\\sum_{j = 0}^i a_{i - j} b_j is useful; substituting the power series into the differential equation and applying this identity leads to an equation where every term is a power series. After much rearrangement, the recurrence : \\\\sum_{j = 0}^i \\\\left((j + 1) (j + 2) c_{i - j} c_{j + 2} + 2 (i - j + 1) (j + 1) c_{i - j + 1} c_{j + 1}\\\\right) + i c_i + (i + 1) c_{i + 1} = 0 is obtained, specifying exact values of the series coefficients. From the initial values, c_0 = 0 and c_1 = -1/2, thereafter the above recurrence is used. For example, the next few coefficients: : c_2 = -\\\\frac{1}{6} \\\\quad ; \\\\quad c_3 = -\\\\frac{1}{108} \\\\quad ; \\\\quad c_4 = \\\\frac{7}{3240} \\\\quad ; \\\\quad c_5 = -\\\\frac{19}{48600} \\\\ \\\\dots A limitation of the power series solution shows itself in this example. A numeric solution of the problem shows that the function is smooth and always decreasing to the left of \\\\eta = 1, and zero to the right. At \\\\eta = 1, a slope discontinuity exists, a feature which the power series is incapable of rendering, for this reason the series solution continues decreasing to the right of \\\\eta = 1 instead of suddenly becoming zero.

It is 28 miles (45 km) in length, and is much branched; many of the significant tributaries are of a similar size to the main river. The catchment area is bounded to the east by the Aran Fawddwy massif and to the west and north by the Harlech dome which forms a watershed just south of Llyn Trawsfynydd. The Mawddach has been the site of significant industrialisation and land management. Gold mining and subsequently gold panning have had major impacts but forestry, the preparation of animal skins, the storage of old munitions and the use of hill-sides as artillery ranges have all added to the legacy of pollution. The river is also very flashy - prone to very rapid rise and fall in level depending on rainfall. Rainfall can also be very heavy and it falls on very base-poor soils leading to episodes of strongly depressed pH. Despite this, the river sustains an important salmon and trout fishery and the countryside through which it flows is some of the most spectacular and scenic in the UK. The main tributaries starting in the west and working clockwise are: *Afon Cwm Mynach which drains Llyn Cwm Mynach on the Rhinogydd. *Afon Gamlan which joins at Ganllwyd after following a tumultuous valley through ancient oak woods before descending towards the main river down Rhaeadr Ddu (Black waterfalls). This valley has one of the more important moss and liverwort communities in the southern UK. *Afon Eden - its headwaters known as Afon Crawcwellt - a large tributary draining from below Llyn Trawsfynydd and closely following the A470 through the Coed-y-Brenin forest. This tributary has been severely affected by industrialisation in the past, including gold mining and its use as an ordnance range. *Afon Gain, a large tributary which has also been impacted by similar problems to the Eden and is very acidic and peaty. *Afon Wen which joins south of the Gain is similar but smaller. *Afon Wnion is a major tributary joining from the east and which drains a large area out towards Aran Fawddwy Estuary Below Dolgellau the river enters a wide and sandy estuary of great beauty. At its mouth is the town of Barmouth and its railway bridge. The southern bank of the Mawddach estuary, along which used to run a section of the GWR branch line from Ruabon to Barmouth, has now been designated the Mawddach Trail, an 8-mile cycle path running from Dolgellau to Morfa Mawddach, at the south side of the Barmouth railway bridge. It is managed by the Snowdonia National Park Authority as a leisure route for walkers and cyclists, and is part of the Sustrans Cross-Wales Cycling Route. The estuary of the Mawddach was a great centre of ship building in the 18th century and probably for some centuries before. There is no evidence remaining of this activity in the estuary today.

The museum was created as part of the Arkansas Territorial Capitol Restoration Commission, by Act 388 of the 1939 Arkansas General Assembly. The act named Louise Loughborough as chairwoman of the commission. Loughborough had been named to the Little Rock Planning Commission in 1935. Several houses near Cumberland and East 3rd Streets in downtown Little Rock were going to be condemned, including the Hinderliter House, the oldest building in Little Rock. Loughborough started a public relations campaign around Little Rock as a \\"town of three Capitols\\": the Hinderliter House, the Old State House, and the current Arkansas State Capitol Building. Use of the Hinderliter House as the last meeting place of the Arkansas Territorial Legislature has remained part of popular folklore, though it is not known if it was used for this purpose. Loughborough then gained support from the Works Progress Administration, the Arkansas General Assembly, and private donors. Loughborough worked with architect Max Mayer to restore the half-block of houses at Cumberland and East 3rd Street in downtown Little Rock. The Museum opened on July 19, 1941. The museum maintains gallery space and a number of historic buildings original to the site, as well as log structures transported from around the state. It was previously known as the Arkansas Territorial Restoration, but the name was changed in 2001 when new exhibit space and renovations were completed.

Life Goeyvaerts was born in Antwerp, where he studied at the Royal Flemish Music Conservatory; he later studied composition in Paris with Darius Milhaud and analysis with Olivier Messiaen. He also studied ondes Martenot with Maurice Martenot, who invented the instrument . In 1951, Goeyvaerts attended the famous Darmstadt New Music Summer School where he met Karlheinz Stockhausen, who was five years younger. Both were devout Catholics and found ways of integrating religious numerology into their serial compositions. They found themselves deep in conversation, and performed a movement from Goeyvaerts's \\"Nummer 1\\", Sonata for Two Pianos, in the composition course by Theodor Adorno there. They were both astonished upon hearing for the first time Messiaen's \\"Mode de valeurs et d'intensit√©s\\" (from Quatre √©tudes de rythme), in a recording by the composer which Antoine Gol√©a played at a lecture. These experiences together convinced Stockhausen he should study with Messiaen. Goeyvaerts became very excited in 1952 when he learned that Stockhausen had access in Paris to a generator of sine waves. Goeyvaerts saw them as an important discovery for music: the purest sound possible. At the time, Stockhausen did not share his enthusiasm, owing partly to the inability with the equipment at hand to superimpose sine tones. Only later, after taking up his new post at the NWDR Electronic Music Studio in Cologne, did Stockhausen find more suitable equipment, in July 1953 . One of the first works produced there was Goeyvaerts's Nr. 5 with Pure Tones, which Stockhausen helped his friend to realize. (When Stockhausen seemingly abandoned his work with sine waves and returned to writing compositions for solo piano, Goeyvaerts felt that Stockhausen was abandoning an important discovery and took up the matter from a philosophical point of view himself.) There has been some controversy about who wrote the first European \\"total\\" serial composition. His Nummer 2 (1951) for 13 instruments is one of the contenders , as is his Nummer 1 (1950) Sonata for Two Pianos, and the Sonata for Two Pianos by Michel Fano (1950), depending on definitions of \\"total serialism\\" . After withdrawing from the musical world for a while, he accepted a position in 1970 at the Institute for Psychoacoustic and Electronic Music (IPEM) in Ghent, which led to several other prestigious appointments in Belgium. His works from after 1975 take on aspects of minimalism, the best- known examples being his series of five Litanies (1979‚Äì82) and his final work, the opera Aquarius (1983‚Äì92). Though minimalism is ordinarily thought of as a reaction against serialism, for Goeyvaerts both techniques were merely subcategories of a non-dynamic, \\"static music\\" .

Biography Alda Lara was born on 9 June 1930 in Benguela, Angola. She came from a wealthy family and received a Christian education, which gave her a spirit of liberalism according to one commentator. Her brother was the noted poet Ernesto Lara Filho. Lara attended a women's school in S√° da Bandeira (now Lubango) before moving to Portugal to finisher her secondary schooling. She attended Lisbon University and resided at the Casa dos Estudantes do Imperio (House of the Students of the Empire). She had an active student life and began her writing career by publishing poetry in the literary journal Mensagem, a publication specifically for Africans. Lara later attended the University of Coimbra and earned a degree in medicine. Lara wrote for several newspapers and magazines such as the Jornal de Benguela, the Jornal de Angola, and the ABC e Ci√™ncia. She married the Mozambican-Portuguese writer Orlando Albuquerque and gave birth to four children. After living in Portugal for 13 years, Lara moved back to Angola in 1961. However, her return would be short- lived, as she died on 30 January 1962 in Cambambe. Her husband set about publishing her collected works after her death, including Poemas in 1966 and Tempo de Chuva in 1973. Lara's poems and short stories mostly deal with themes of motherhood and children as well as liberty and justice. Much of her poetry reflect a dissatisfaction with the colonial status quo. The Alda Lara Prize (in Portuguese, Pr√©mio Alda Lara) was established in her honour by the city of Lubango. Paulo de Carvalho, a famed Portuguese singer, who has had a strong artistic career, recorded \\"Preludio/M√£e Negra\\", a poem written by Alda Lara.

Personal life McDonell was born in 1984 in New York City and raised there. McDonell attended the Buckley School, the Riverdale Country School, and graduated from Harvard College in January 2007. In June 2012, he received a graduate degree in International Relations from Oxford University. His mother, Joanie, is a writer, and his father, Terry McDonell, is managing editor of Sports Illustrated. His brother is actor Thomas McDonell. His father was once managing editor of Rolling Stone, where Hunter S. Thompson was a contributing editor and a friend; Thompson gave a blurb to McDonell when Twelve was published, as did writers Richard Price and Joan Didion, both personal friends of the family. Morgan Entrekin, president and publisher of Grove/Atlantic, which published the book, is also a friend of the family. Works =Twelve= McDonell wrote the novel Twelve in 2002, when he was very young at 17. The subject of the novel is disaffection, despair, drug use and violence among a group of wealthy Manhattan teenagers during Winter break. The publication of the novel at such a young age was the subject of many articles in high-profile publications such The New Yorker and Entertainment Weekly. Twelve has been translated into over twenty languages, was on all major American best-seller lists, UK bestseller lists and was number one on German bestseller lists. A motion picture adaptation of the same name was released in 2010. The film was directed by Joel Schumacher and starred Kiefer Sutherland and Chace Crawford. =The Third Brother= Also published in the UK and translated into many languages, Nick McDonell's second novel, The Third Brother (), was released in September 2005. The New York Times called it \\"a haunting tale of brotherly love.\\" Divided into three parts the first describes the 19-year-old protagonist Mike on a revelatory assignment in Bangkok. Mike is working for an old friend of his father. (McDonell himself interned for Karl Taro Greenfeld of Time Asia. Greenfeld later worked for McDonell's father at Sports Illustrated.) The second part of the novel takes place on September 11, 2001, as Mike searches for his brother; in the final part Mike returns to college after tragedy strikes his family. =Guerre a Harvard= Published by Flammarion in 2008, this work recorded the reactions of university students from 2003 to 2008 to the Iraq War involving American armed forces. =An Expensive Education= With the publication in August 2009 of his third novel, An Expensive Education, reviewers compared McDonell to both Graham Greene and John le Carr√©. Amazon.com recommended the novel and all three of McDonell's books were praised in a profile which appeared in The New York Times on August 2, 2009. The review in The Washington Post on August 12, 2009 said: \\"Now 25, McDonell has reached an age at which it is not so freakish to write a good book which is fortunate because he has done it again.\\" The review goes on to say, \\"As he's shown in his previous novels he can be a ruthless chronicler of America's aristocratic culture.\\" And: \\"One of the fascinations of this novel is how effectively it tracks distant events that resonate with one another around the world.\\" =The End of Major Combat Operations= Published in April 2010, Mc Donell's fourth book reports about the war in Iraq. =Green on Blue= A TIME e-book published in 2013 about the war in Afghanistan and numerous stark instances of American military casualties there. It was described as being reminiscent of Sebastian Junger and Jim Frederick. =White City= AMC, the cable television network, decided in 2015 to cancel production of this proposed television series from McDonell, Stephen Gaghan, Tom Freston, and John Dempsey. The AMC series was planned to be a fictional television series about expats in the capital city Kabul, Afghanistan during times of foreign military activity in the region based on McDonell and Dempsey's own experiences. McDonell was credited as a screenwriter and producer on this proposed television series. White City was already used as the name for other Hollywood projects in the past so the title of the series was deemed too confusing to television and film audiences. White City did not move forward because network executives viewed it as being too similar to concurrent Hollywood projects like the hit Showtime premium cable series Homeland, the popular FX cable series Tyrant, and NBC series State of Affairs. A lack of star power among the cast appearing in the pilot led to production being shut down without any episodes airing. =The Civilization of Perpetual Movement: Nomadism in World Politics= Arriving in April 2016, McDonell's book published by Hurst in the UK is a work of non-fiction examining the experiences of nomads in remote locations from Africa to Asia. McDonell has spent years researching and studying such peoples to understand their circumstances. He traveled all around the world for research to rural locations in developing countries such as the Rift Valley, Afghanistan and more. =The Bodies in Person= Published by Blue Rider Press in 2018, The Bodies in Person is subtitled An Account of Civilian Casualties in American Wars and has been written from many hours of oral history interviews with soldiers and others involved in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Praise New York Times book critic and Pulitzer Prize winner Michiko Kakutani described McDonell's debut novel Twelve as being \\"As fast as speed, as relentless as acid.\\" Referring to his second book, Jennifer Egan in The New York Times Book Review wrote, \\"In The Third Brother, McDonell delivers another remarkable novel.\\" The first pre-publication review of McDonell's third novel An Expensive Education, appeared in Publishers Weekly where it was compared to \\"le Carr√©'s better works.\\" McDonell has also been acclaimed for his book La Guerre a Harvard published in France in 2009, and articles from Darfur for Harper's Magazine 2009, and for Time from Iraq.

Background After releasing their debut album, which consisted mostly of cover songs, the band intended to write some strong original new material; Dennis DeYoung was particularly in favor of this. DeYoung had written a song by himself on an electric piano in the band's garage, and had originally intended for it to be on the first album. He later decided to play it on an acoustic piano. However, Bill Traut wanted to save it for the second album. The result was Lady, written about DeYoung's wife Suzanne. \\"Lady\\" failed to be a hit when it was first released in 1973; however, after the band released their fourth album \\"Man of Miracles\\" in 1974, they went to WLS, the most powerful Chicago radio station at the time, and convinced the program director (Jim Smith) to replay this song. It wound up being played frequently on the air in Chicago. In May 1975, the song broke out nationally, eventually peaking at no. 6 on the Billboard charts. Besides Lady, the album contained some upbeat and prog rock songs, such as rockers \\"You Need Love\\" and \\"I'm Gonna Make You Feel It,\\" which was written by DeYoung and sung by James \\"JY\\" Young. This is also the first album on which John Curulewski wrote and sang on two songs: the proggish, jazzy \\"A Day\\" which has an unusual sound for the band, and the boogie humor song \\"You Better Ask,\\" whose outro features a snippet of Strangers in the Night on calliope organ and an evil laugh. Side 2 opens with a DeYoung rendition of Little Fugue in G by Bach, played on pipe organ at a Chicago cathedral, and segues into the mellow prog rocker \\"Father O.S.A.\\" The rocker \\"Earl of Roseland\\" was written by DeYoung based on early memories from when he grew up in Chicago's Roseland neighborhood, where he had formed the band with the Panozzo brothers. After Styx moved to A&M; Records and achieved national success in the US, Styx II went Gold shortly before the success of The Grand Illusion (1977) and the only big seller album from Wooden Nickel era, because of \\"Lady.\\" The album was reissued in 1980 by their prior label, Wooden Nickel. Under the title Lady, the reissue had new artwork (though it is not to be confused with a Styx compilation album that was later released with the same name). It is also the only Styx album to not feature material written or co-written by Young (apart from their covers 2005 album, Big Bang Theory).

She studied at Eduardo Mondlane University, Maputo. She was born to a Protestant family that moved from Gaza to the capital Maputo (then Louren√ßo Marques) during the writer's early childhood. At home she spoke Chopi and Ronga. Chiziane was the first woman in Mozambique to publish a novel. Her writing has generated some polemical discussions about social issues, such as the practice of polygamy in the country. For example, her first novel, Balada do Amor ao Vento (1990), discusses polygamy in southern Mozambique during the colonial period. Related to her active involvement in the politics of Frelimo (Liberation Front of Mozambique), her narrative often reflects the social uneasiness of a country ravaged and divided by the war of liberation and the civil conflicts that followed independence. Her novel Niketche: Uma Hist√≥ria de Poligamia (translated into English as The First Wife: A Tale of Polygamy) won the Jos√© Craveirinha Prize in 2003.  Interpretation  Chiziane's writing has often been defined as political and feminist. Writing for this author is a mission. It is a way to express the difficulties that women encounter when faced with the heterogeneity of Mozambican cultural traditions and the newly developed legal and administrative systems. Chiziane's writing addresses regional differences in cultural and political aspects of gender relations. In her novel Niketche, for instance, she depicts the Mozambican South as dominated by a patriarchal culture, whereas the North is shaped by traditions of matriarchal rule. She also alludes to the fact that Frelimo itself assumed an ambiguous attitude with regard to polygamy, making it illegal at first, but then tolerating its continuing practice. Throughout her work, Chiziane's attention has focused on broad social issues related to women's rights and concerns, such as monogamy and polygamy, but also on subjective and intimate relationships between individual men and women. Chiziane has stated that, in accordance with the tradition of her land, she considers herself a storyteller rather than a novelist. In 2016, she announced that she was retiring from writing.

Wilson was the youngest member of the band until bassist Alessandro Venturella and drummer Jay Weinberg, who were born in 1984 and 1990 respectively, joined the band. Biography Sid Wilson was born and raised in Des Moines, Iowa. His parents are both from England. He performs in the American band Slipknot, and also tours as DJ Starscream, a name which is derived from the Transformers character of the same name. He is a fan of the Transformers franchise, and has Transformer tattoos. Musically within Slipknot, Wilson contributes scratching, sound effects, horrorlike noises as well as background noises/effects. When numbers were being assigned to each band member, he insisted on being the number zero since it epitomized filth. He is also known to stage dive in Slipknot's early years, and in 2008, he broke both his heels when he jumped ten feet from the stage. Outside Slipknot, Wilson has made a following in Japan as a jungle musician, under the pseudonym DJ Starscream, and is currently signed to the Japanese record label N2O Records. He collaborated with The Mad Capsule Markets vocalist Hiroshi Kyono on a song called \\"HAKAI (Deathtroy)\\" released on The Songs for Death Note the movieÔΩûthe Last name TributeÔΩû, a tribute album dedicated to the live action movie for the second Death Note film. A remix of the track also appeared on the Wagdug Futuristic Unity mini-album Nu Riot and 2008 album Hakai. As of August 2010, he is touring with his solo band SID. He is the lead vocalist of the band. Wilson went on tour with his solo band, his last tour date was on September 5, 2010 at a music venue called Another Hole In The Wall, located in Steger, Illinois. He stated, \\"This is the best stop on the tour, I loved the crowd reaction. It really made me feel like I got back to my roots.\\" He also said that he will be touring with his solo project for a year or two. The debut album \\"SID\\" was released on September 13, 2011 for digital download. In 2013 he was a support act for Vamps at their shows in Los Angeles and New York. Mask During his time with Slipknot, Wilson's mask has been, for the most part, based on gas masks. During the tour for Iowa, he wore gas masks that had been customised to resemble skulls. During the Subliminal Verses World Tour, Wilson grew his hair long and began to wear various masks that simply resembled skulls, shying away from the gas-mask concept. In promotional photos for All Hope is Gone and the tour for the album, Wilson changed his mask once again, this time, to resemble a robot, dedicated also for his love of the Transformers franchise. Later, he once again cut his hair short, this time into a Fauxhawk style, and dyed it red. The eyebrows of the mask are able to be animatronically controlled, allowing him to make various expressions. After the death of bassist Paul Gray in 2010, and during the subsequent Memorial World Tour, Wilson, in keeping with the rest of the band, reverted to his old mask and red jump suit, worn during the self-titled album tour, as a tribute to Gray. In 2013 Wilson announced a new mask which he debuted over the weekend at Ozzfest Japan in Tokyo. The mask was made by Ukrainian design studio Bob Basset. This and the subsequent masks made by Basset are all made of leather and have a style reminiscent of his earlier gas masks. The music video for Slipknot's single \\"The Devil in I\\" from their 2014 album .5: The Gray Chapter, features a mask with circular eye holes similar to those from his Iowa era mask, however these are covered by metal grills that resemble spatulas. The mask also has a removable metal plate that can be placed over the mouth, in which he has a sharp golden grill. Wilson's mask was drastically changed once again for the release of Slipknot's sixth album We Are Not Your Kind, becoming an animatronic death mask of his own face, covered partly by a large black hood and robe. This mask drew significant attention, though mostly positive, for being a drastic leap from the designs of any previous Slipknot masks and for being reminiscent of Emperor Palpatine AKA Darth Sidious or a slasher villain.

History Cosina Hi-Lite Cosina 19‚Äì35 f/3.5-4.5 AF lens Cosina is the successor to Nik≈ç (or \\"Nikoh\\"), a company set up as a lens processing factory in February 1959, which was a pioneer in optical polishing and lens grinding in Japan. In 1966, it also started to manufacture 35 mm compact cameras and 8 mm cine cameras, and a year later started the manufacture of 35mm film SLR cameras; in 1968 it started a glass melting factory. Nik≈ç changed its name to Cosina in 1973. (The first part of the name is a reference to the Koshi area within Nakano, where the founder came from; while the 'Na' represents Nakano.) The name Cosina has previously appeared on compact and SLR cameras for 135 film. The CS-2 and CS-3 SLRs were introduced in 1978, followed in 1980 by the CT-1, CT-7 (the world's first all‚Äîpush-button SLR), CT-10 and CT-20, the CT-1G in 1982 and the CT-9 in 1986. Cosina SLR cameras used either the M42 (Praktica/Pentax) lens mount or the Pentax K (bayonet) lens mount. However, Cosina is probably better known as a manufacturer of cameras and camera components for other brands. During the late 1970s, Cosina made a name for itself in 35 mm rangefinder cameras with a well-built, high quality fixed-lens camera using an aluminum body and a simple shutter-priority autoexposure system. This rangefinder camera was adopted as the basic chassis for several excellent camera models, including the Minolta 7SII, Revue 400 SE, Prinz 35 ER, and Vivitar 35 ES. In 1982, Cosina began to manufacture lenses in a variety of SLR manufacturers' lens mounts. In 1991, it started to produce glass molded aspheric lenses, and in 1996 plastic molded aspherical lenses. Cosina began producing digital cameras in 1997. =Voigtl√§nder brand acquisition= At about this time, plans were started to produce a new high-quality rangefinder 35 mm film camera, complete with wide and ultrawide lenses for the Leica screw mount, and also a standard 35 mm film camera for the amateur film photography sector ‚Äî similar to a rangefinder camera, but without a rangefinder or viewfinder ‚Äî for mounting these lenses. In 1999, Cosina secured partial rights to the German, once Austrian, classic camera brand \\"Voigtl√§nder\\", acquired from RINGFOTO GmbH & Co. ALFO Marketing KG in Germany, to produce the Classic Collection (high-quality lenses with both M39 screw thread and Leica M bayonet, 35mm film cameras Bessa R, Bessa L, Bessa T, and medium format cameras Bessa III). Cosina first introduced the Voigtl√§nder 15 mm f/4.5 and 25 mm f/4 lens (neither of them rangefinder- coupled) and the Voigtl√§nder Bessa-L standard camera body. It quickly followed with a wider range of Voigtl√§nder cameras (starting with the Bessa-R, with viewfinder and rangefinder, and the Bessa-T, with rangefinder, but no viewfinder), and a set of lenses, including the Heliar 12 mm f/5.6 lens, which on its introduction was the widest rectilinear lens ever marketed for still photography. On April 26, 2010, Cosina joined the Micro Four Thirds System Standard Group.COSINA CO., Ltd. Joins the Micro Four Thirds System Standard Group. Voigtl√§nder Wide angle lens Cosina Voigtl√§nder 20mm f/3.5 Color- Skopar SL II Aspherical Cosina's \\"Voigtl√§nder\\" products are sometimes referred to as Cosina Voigtl√§nder. The Cosina Voigtl√§nder cameras and lenses have been of great personal interest to Kobayashi Hirofumi Â∞èÊûóÂçöÊñá (b. 1953), the President of Cosina since the death in 1988 of his father Kobayashi Bunjir≈ç (Â∞èÊûóÊñáÊ≤ªÈÉé), the founder. The name Cosina now appears (conspicuously) on lenses for various SLR mounts, and less conspicuously on a widening range of cameras and lenses with the Voigtl√§nder brand. Cosina manufactured the rangefinder camera Rollei 35 RF for Rollei Fototechnic, and is acknowledged to have manufactured (and to have helped design) the Epson digital rangefinder camera R-D1 as well. Its manufacture of a new Zeiss Ikon rangefinder camera with Leica M-mount, and Zeiss lenses in Leica bayonet mount, was announced in October 2004, and it is already (April 2006) producing these. All these cameras use film, showing Cosina's unique position in the market of filling the gap in demand for high quality film cameras and support for technology that is still evolving. Other manufacturers =Cameras= Cosina is also well known for manufacturing 35 mm SLR cameras to the specifications of other manufacturers and distributors, such as the Canon T60, the Yashica FX-3 (1979), FX-3 Super, and Super 2000, the Nikon FM10 and FE10, the Olympus OM2000, Konica TC-X, and various Vivitar models. A Cosina design, the 1982 Cosina CX-2, was copied by the Russian optical firm LOMO as the popular Lomo LC-A. =Lenses= Cosina manufactures manual focus SLR lenses for Carl Zeiss AG with: Leica (ZM), Nikon (ZF), Pentax (ZK), Canon EOS (ZE), and M42 (ZS) lens screw mounts.

Rooty Hill is located 42 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Blacktown and is part of the Greater Western Sydney region. History The earliest exploration of the area was led by Captain Watkin Tench in 1789. The origin of this name puzzled historians for many years because the clue lay not in Blacktown City but on Norfolk Island. Governor Philip Gidley King had been in charge of the first settlement there in early 1788 and had noted that the hillside where he had built his Government House had been difficult to dig owing to the amount of tree roots beneath the surface. The hill on Norfolk became known as Rooty Hill and the name is now official.Rooty Hill Road, Kingston, Norfolk Island, Google Maps, accessed 7 March 2013 When King returned to New South Wales he built the headquarters for his government reserve of 1802 at the foot of a hill that reminded him of the Norfolk Island Rooty Hill and used the same name. The name Rooty Hill first appeared on a map in 1803. The early development of the area came when Captain William Minchin was given a grant of in 1819, leading to the development of the Minchinbury estate. Dr Charles McKay purchased the estate in 1859 and subdivided it in the 1880s. Afterwards, the Watts family built Watts Cottage in Watt Street. It combines Italianate elements with a bullnose verandah and is almost unique in the Blacktown Municipality. It is locally heritage-listed. In 1890, the Imperial Hotel was built north of the railway station by F.J. Weston. It was intended to cater for the crowds who attended the greyhound racing at Lamb's Woodstock Coursing Track at Plumpton. By the early 1970s it had become semi-derelict, but was acquired by a local dentist in 1977. It reopened in 1982 and is now state heritage-listed. In 1891, the Pioneer Memorial Church, located on Rooty Hill Road South, was built on land donated by Dr Charles McKay. It was originally a Baptist church, but was later acquired for the Presbyterian community by James Angus, owner of the Minchinbury estate from 1895. It is still in use and is locally heritage- listed. In 1902‚Äì1903, the School of Arts, located in Rooty Hill Road South, was built by the residents for community activities. The foundation stone was laid 1 November 1902, by Miss Angus, daughter of James Angus. It is locally heritage-listed. On 13 April 1916, James Angus was killed at Rooty Hill railway crossing, as a result of being hit by that morning's express train. He was survived by his wife, his son James (of Adelaide), his son John (a pastoralist in New South Wales) and his daughter, who by that time was the widow Mrs Fleming. The name of James Angus is preserved in Angus Avenue; Charles McKay's name survives in Dr Charles McKay Reserve; the name of the Evans family, who built Fairholme, survives in Evans Road. Fairholme, now part of the St Agnes Catholic High School, is locally heritage-listed.

It is the only species of Erythrina that naturally occurs there. It is typically found in Hawaiian tropical dry forests on leeward island slopes up to an elevation of . Wiliwili means \\"repeatedly twisted\\" in the Hawaiian language and refers to the seedpods, which dehisce, or twist open, to reveal the seeds. Description Wiliwili trees grow to a height of with a gnarled and stout trunk that reaches in diameter. The bark is smooth, slightly fissured, and covered in gray or black spines up to in length. The bark on the main trunk of mature trees has a distinct orange cast, which is caused by a terrestrial alga. The wiliwili is summer (dry season) drought deciduous. The dry season usually begins in late April or in May, and trees in the wild typically lose all of their leaves before they bloom. Trees in cultivation may retain much of their foliage through blooming time.George W. Staples and Derral R. Herbst. 2005. \\"A Tropical Garden Flora\\" Bishop Museum Press: Honolulu, HI, USA. The flowers appear in the first half of the dry season, from April through July. They form on horizontal or nearly horizontal racemes that are long. The flower color may be orange, yellow, salmon, greenish or whitish. Sometimes all of these colors occur in a single population. The standard petal is erect, not enclosing the other petals. Like all of the erythrinas, the wiliwili is pollinated by birds.Anne Bruneau. 1996. \\"Phylogenetic and Biogeographical Patterns in Erythrina (Leguminosae: Phaseoleae) as Inferred from Morphological and Chloroplast DNA Characters\\". Systematic Botany 21(4):587-605. The horizontal raceme and the erect standard are adaptations to pollination by passerine birds.Anne Bruneau. 1997. \\"Evolution and Homology of Bird Pollination Syndromes in Erythrina (Leguminosae). American Journal of Botany 84(1):54-71. Many other erythrinas are pollinated by hummingbirds. Pods develop and persist on the tree, with the seeds remaining attached long after the pods have opened. The seeds are dislodged by heavy downpours that generally start around November in the islands. Many seeds germinate quickly, and a well-established seedling can grow to in height before the start of the next dry season. The wiliwili is an unusual spine-bearer because this is a species that has evolved in the isolated Hawaiian Islands without the presence of ungulates or other large herbivores. It is thought to be closely related to E. tahitensis, a tree endemic to the Tahitian Archipelago, and E. velutina, a widespread species found in tropical South America and the Caribbean. Distribution Wiliwili is occasionally seen in cultivation in Hawaii. It is easily propagated from cuttings.Otto Degener. 1932. Flora Hawaiiensis book 5, family 169. (no page numbers). Seven other species of Erythrina were under general cultivation in the Hawaiian Islands, but have been mostly extirpated by the alien gall wasp (see Conservation, below). They were popular street trees in dry areas and windbreaks on fields. At least 80 others have been known in botanical gardens there.Clyde T. Imada, George W. Staples, and Derral R. Herbst. undated. Erythrina At: \\"Annotated Checklist of Cultivated Plants of Hawaii\\" At: Botany Databases At: Hawaii Biological Survey (see External links below.) No species of Erythrina is known to be naturalized in Hawaii.Warren L. Wagner, Derral R. Herbst, and Sy H. Sohmer. Manual of the Flowering Plants of Hawaii, Revised Edition, 1999. Bishop Museum Press: Hololulu The wiliwili is distinguished from the other seven cultivated species by a pod with only one to three red or yellow-orange seeds, which sink in water;Carlquist, S. 1966. The Biota of Long-Distance Dispersal. III. Loss of Dispersibility in the Hawaiian Flora. Brittonia 18(4):310-335 non-native Erythrina have pods with larger numbers of brown seeds, which float in water. Uses Native Hawaiians made a number of items from wiliwili wood because of its low density, such as mouo (fishing net floats), ama (outrigger canoe floats, and extremely long papa hee nalu (surfboards) called olo. Olo, which averaged , were exclusively ridden by alii (royalty). The wood was sometimes used for the waa (hull) of outrigger canoes intended to be used near-shore, for recreation, or for training. The shiny orange-red seeds were strung into lei. Conservation Like other indigenous species in Hawaii, the wiliwili is threatened by competition with non-native species that are free of the diseases, parasites, and herbivores that constrain them in their original habitats. It was reported in December 2005 that the Hawaiian wiliwili population was under immediate threat due to an infestation by a gall wasp, Quadrastichus erythrinae, which had been first reported in Hawaii in April of that year. This invasive species appears to have arrived in Hawaii via southern Taiwan, Singapore and southern China within only two years. This species was not known to science and was formally named and described in 2004.I.K. Kim, G. Delvare, and J. La Salle. 2004. \\"A new species of Quadrastichus (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae): A gall-inducing pest on Erythrina (Fabaceae)\\". Journal of Hymenoptera Research 13:243-249. It is thought to have originated in Africa, and the means of its rapid dispersal across South Asia, the Pacific, and southern North America is not understood.Daniel Rubinoff, Brenden S. Holland, Alexandra Shibata, Russell H. Messing, and Mark G. Wright. 2010. \\"Rapid Invasion Despite Lack of Genetic Variation in the Erythrina Gall Wasp (Quadrastichus erythrinae Kim)\\" Pacific Science 64(1):23-31. The majority of trees of introduced Erythrina species have died as a result of gall wasp infestation. Native wiliwili forests have also been hard hit, particularly Puu o Kali on the island of Maui - prior to 2001, the best remaining example of a Hawai'i low elevation dryland forest ecosystem. The USGS-Pacific Island Ecosystems Research Center study site now documents the destructive impact of two invasive insect species (African bruchid beetle Specularius impressithorax and erythrina gall wasp) on Erythrina sandwicensis. A parasitoid second wasp, Eurytoma erythrinae, was released by the Hawaii Department of Agriculture in December 2008 as a biocontrol to minimize the damaging effects of Quadrastichus. Eurytoma wasps lay their eggs in the galls created by Quadrastichus wasps. Eurytoma larvae hatch faster than Quadrastichus larvae, on which they exclusively feed. History The genus Erythrina was established by Linnaeus in 1753 in his book, Species Plantarum.Carolus Linnaeus. 1753. Species Plantarum 2:706. Laurentii Salvii. (see External Links below). The name means \\"red\\", a reference to the flower color of some of the well-known species. In 1786, in his book Encyclop√©die M√©thodique: Botanique, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck originated the name Erythrina monosperma for a Leguminous tree from India and Southeast Asia.Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. 1786. Encyclop√©die M√©thodique: Botanique 2(1):391-392. In: Encyclop√©die M√©thodique par ordre de matieres. (see External links below). That tree has been known as Butea monosperma ever since William Roxburgh created the genus Butea in 1795. Unaware of Lamarck's name, Charles Gaudichaud-Beaupr√© created the name Erythrina monosperma for the Hawaiian Erythrina in 1830 in his book Voyage of the Uranus.Charles Gaudichaud-Beaupr√©. 1830. Voyage de l'Uranie. Botanique (full title: Voyage autour du Monde, entrepris par Ordre du Roi, . . . Execute sur les Corvettes de S.M. l'Uranie et la Physicienne . . . par M. Louis de Freycinet. Botanique . . .) page 486 and table 114. In 1841, William Jackson Hooker and George Arnott used Gaudichaud's name in their book, The Botany of Captain Beechey's Voyage.William Jackson Hooker and George Arnott Walker-Arnott. 1841. The Botany of Captain Beechey's Voyage part 2, page 81. (see External links below). Gaudichaud's name, Erythrina monosperma, was used by most of those who described the Hawaiian species of Erythrina throughout the nineteenth century, including William Hillebrand.William Hillebrand. 1888. Flora of the Hawaiian Islands: ***:99. (reprinted by Lubrecht & Cramer in 1981). (see External links below.) In 1932, Otto Degener created the name Erythrina sandwicensis to replace Erythrina monosperma. He stated no reason for the name change. He presented a more complete synonymy than the one given here. Erythrina sandwicensis is the name that has been used since 1932. =Wiliwili hula chant= : Auwe!

The son of Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and Julia the Elder, Augustus' only daughter, Lucius was adopted by his grandfather along with his older brother, Gaius Caesar. As the emperor's adopted sons and joint-heirs to the Roman Empire, Lucius and Gaius had promising political and military careers. However, Lucius died of a sudden illness on 20 August AD 2, in Massilia, Gaul, while traveling to meet the Roman army in Hispania. His brother Gaius also died at a relatively young age on 21 February, AD 4. The untimely loss of both heirs compelled Augustus to redraw the line of succession by adopting Lucius' younger brother, Agrippa Postumus as well as his stepson, Tiberius on 26 June AD 4. Background Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa was an early supporter of Augustus (then \\"Octavius\\") during the Final War of the Roman Republic that ensued as a result of the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BC. His father was a key general in Augustus' armies, commanding troops in pivotal battles against Mark Antony and Sextus Pompeius. From early in the emperor's reign, Agrippa was trusted to handle affairs in the eastern provinces and was even given the signet ring of Augustus, who was seemingly on his deathbed in 23 BC, a sign that he would become princeps were Augustus to die. It is probable that he was to rule until the emperor's nephew, Marcus Claudius Marcellus, came of age. However, Marcellus died of an illness that had spread throughout the city of Rome that year. With Marcellus gone, Augustus arranged for the marriage of Agrippa to his daughter Julia the Elder, who was previously the wife of Marcellus. Agrippa was given tribunicia potestas (\\"the tribunician power\\") in 18 BC, a power that only the emperor and his immediate heir could hope to attain. The tribunician power allowed him to control the Senate, and it was first given to Julius Caesar. Agrippa acted as tribune in the Senate to pass important legislation and, though he lacked some of the emperor's power and authority, he was approaching the position of co- regent. Early life and family Lucius was born in Rome in 17 BC to Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and Julia. He was part of the imperial family of Augustus, known as the Julio-Claudian dynasty, and was related to all the Julio-Claudian emperors. On his mother's side, he was the second oldest grandson of emperor Augustus after his brother Gaius. He was the brother-in-law of Tiberius by his half-sister Vipsania Agrippina, and Claudius by his sister Agrippina the Elder's marriage to Germanicus. Lucius' nephew was the future emperor Caligula, who was Germanicus' son. Having no heir since the death of Marcellus, Augustus immediately adopted Lucius and his brother from their father by a symbolic sale following Lucius' birth, and named the two boys his heirs.Cassius Dio, Roman History, LIV.18.1 It is unknown what their father thought of the adoption. Shortly after their adoption in the summer, Augustus held the fifth ever Ludi Saeculares (\\"Secular Games\\"). The adoption of the boys coupled with the games served to introduce a new era of peace ‚Äì the Pax Augusta. Augustus, mostly by himself, taught Gaius and Lucius how to read and swim, as well as how to imitate his own handwriting. He insisted that they earn the applause of people, instead of allowing them to receive it freely. Their adoptive father initiated them into administrative life when they were still young, and sent them to the provinces as consuls-elect. That year (17 BC) Lucius' family left for the province of Syria, because his father was given command of the eastern provinces with proconsular authority (imperium maius). In 13 BC, his father returned to Rome and was promptly sent to Pannonia to suppress a rebellion. Agrippa arrived there that winter (in 12 BC), but the Pannonians gave up their plans. Agrippa returned to Campania in Italy, where he fell ill and died soon after.Cassius Dio, Roman History, LIV.28.1‚Äì2 The death of Lucius' father made succession a pressing issue. The aurei and denarii issued in 13‚Äì12 BC made clear the Emperor's dynastic plans for Lucius and Gaius. Their father was no longer available to assume the reins of power if the Emperor were to die, and Augustus had to make it clear who his intended heirs were in case anything should happen. Career The Maison Carr√©e (French: \\"square house\\") was dedicated in Nemausus to Gaius and Lucius. Augustus brought Lucius to the Forum Romanum in 2 BC to enroll him as a citizen. The event was made into a ceremony the same as Gaius' enrollment had been three years prior. Lucius assumed the toga virilis (\\"toga of manhood\\"), marking the beginning of his adulthood, and he too was made princeps iuventutis (\\"leader of the youth\\"). Like Gaius, he was elected consul designatus, with the intent that he assume the consulship at the age of nineteen. There was only one difference in his titles from those of Gaius: that he was made a member of the college of augurs whereas Gaius was made a pontifex (\\"pontiff\\"). Augustus distributed 60 denarii to each Roman citizen to mark the occasion. That same year, before his brother Gaius left for the east, Lucius and Gaius were given the authority to consecrate buildings, and they did, with their management of the games held to celebrate the dedication of the Temple of Mars Ultor (1 August 2 BC). Their younger brother, Postumus, participated in the Trojan games with the rest of the equestrian youth. 260 lions were slaughtered in the Circus Maximus, there was gladiatorial combat, a naval battle between the \\"Persians\\" and the \\"Athenians\\", and 36 crocodiles were slaughtered in the Circus Flaminius.Cassius Dio, Roman History, LV.10 While Gaius was in Armenia, Lucius had been sent by Augustus to complete his military training in Hispania. While on the way to his post, he fell ill and died on 20 August AD 2 in Massalia, Gaul. His death was followed by that of Gaius on 21 February AD 4. In the span of 18 months, the succession of Rome was shaken.Suetonius, The Lives of the Twelve Caesars, Life of Augustus, 65 The death of both Gaius and Lucius, the Emperor's two most favored heirs, led Augustus to adopt his stepson, Tiberius, and his sole remaining grandson, Postumus Agrippa as his new heirs on 26 June AD 4. Post mortem The two heirs received many honours by citizens and city officials of the Empire, including Colonia Obsequens Iulia Pisana (Pisa), where it was decreed that proper rites must be observed by matrons to lament their passing. Temples, public baths, and shops shut their doors as women wept inconsolably. Posthumously the Senate voted honours for the young Caesars, and arranged for the golden spears and shields the boys had received on achieving the age of military service to be hung in the Senate House. The caskets containing their ashes were stored in the Mausoleum of Augustus alongside those of their father Agrippa and other members of the imperial family. Tacitus and Cassius Dio both suggested that there may have been foul play involved in the death of Gaius and Lucius and that Lucius's step-grandmother Livia may have had a hand in their deaths. Livia's presumed motive may have been to orchestrate the accession of her own son Tiberius as heir to Augustus. Tiberius was named the heir of Augustus in AD 4.Cassius Dio, Roman History, LV.10aTacitus, The Annals, I.3 Ancestry See also *Agrippa Postumus *Julio-Claudian family tree References Bibliography =Ancient sources= * Cassius Dio, Roman History Book 55, English translation * Suetonius, Lives of the Twelve Caesars, Life of Augustus, Latin text with English translation * Tacitus, Annals, I, English translation =Modern sources=      External links *statue of Lucius Caesar Category:17 BC births Category:AD 2 deaths Lucius Agrippa, Lucius Category:1st-century BC Romans Category:1st-century Romans Category:Roman consuls designate Category:Burials at the Mausoleum of Augustus Category:Ancient Roman adoptees Category:Adoptees adopted by relations Category:Children of Augustus Category:Children of Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa ","title":"Lucius Caesar"},{"id":"1151359","title":"Christopher Meloni"},{"id":"1151369","text":"Aly Dia (born 20 August 1965), commonly known as Ali Dia, is a Senegalese former professional footballer who played as a striker. In November 1996, Dia convinced Graeme Souness, then Southampton manager, that he was the cousin of FIFA World Player of the Year and Ballon d'Or winner George Weah, which led to him signing a one-month contract with Southampton days later. Dia played only one match in his short spell at the club. He came on as a substitute in a league game, but was then himself substituted. He was subsequently released, 14 days into his contract.  Career  After a playing career at the lower levels in France and Germany, and having already failed trials at Gillingham and Bournemouth, Dia joined non-league club Blyth Spartans, where he made only one substitute appearance ‚Äì on 9 November 1996 in a Northern Premier League game against Boston United. Days later, Dia was signed by Southampton manager Graeme Souness, after Souness received a phone call purporting to be from Liberian international and then-FIFA World Player of the Year, George Weah. \\"Weah\\" told Souness that Dia was his cousin, had played for Paris Saint- Germain, and had played 13 times for his country. None of this was true, and the phone call to Souness was made by a fellow university student of Dia's, suggesting that he should give Dia a chance with Southampton. Souness was convinced, and Dia was signed on a one-month contract. Dia played just one game for Southampton, wearing the number 33 shirt, against Leeds United on 23 November 1996; he had originally been scheduled to play in a reserve team friendly against Arsenal, but the match was cancelled due to a waterlogged pitch. In the match against Leeds, he came on as a substitute for the injured Matthew Le Tissier after 32 minutes, but was later substituted himself (for Ken Monkou) in the 85th minute; Leeds won the match 2‚Äì0. Le Tissier said: \\"He ran around the pitch like Bambi on ice; it was very embarrassing to watch.\\" Dia was released by Southampton two weeks into his contract. He briefly played for non-league Gateshead, before leaving in February 1997. Dia only played eight games for the North East outfit, including scoring on his debut in a 5‚Äì0 win over Bath City. Personal life Dia studied business at Northumbria University in Newcastle, graduating in 2001. He received a Master of Business Administration from San Francisco State University in 2003. He has a son, named Simon, who plays football for Police Tero.  Legacy  Dia has regularly featured in lists of bad players or bad transfers.

Canadian nationalism has been a significant political force since the 19th century and has typically manifested itself as seeking to advance Canada's independence from influence of the United Kingdom and the United States. Since the 1960s, most proponents of Canadian nationalism have advocated a civic nationalism due to Canada's cultural diversity that specifically has sought to equalize citizenship, especially for Qu√©b√©cois and French-speaking Canadians, who historically faced cultural and economic discrimination and assimilationist pressure from English Canadian-dominated governments.Recent social trends in Canada, 1960-2000. Pp. 415. Canadian nationalism became an important issue during the 1988 Canadian general election that focused on the then-proposed Canada‚ÄìUnited States Free Trade Agreement, with Canadian nationalists opposing the agreement - saying that the agreement would lead to inevitable complete assimilation and domination of Canada by the United States. During the 1995 Quebec referendum on sovereignty that sought to determine whether Quebec would become a sovereign state or whether it would remain in Canada, Canadian nationalists and federalists supported the \\"no\\" side while Quebec nationalists supported the \\"yes\\" side, resulting in a razor-thin majority in favour of the \\"no\\" side that supported Quebec remaining in Canada. The aforementioned version opts for a certain level of sovereignty, while remaining within the Commonwealth of Nations. The Canadian Tories are such example. Canadian Tories were also strongly opposed to free trade with the US, fearing economic and cultural assimilation. On the other hand, French Canadian nationalism has its roots as early as pre- confederation. Although a more accurate portrait of French Canadian nationalism is illustrated by such figures as Henri Bourassa during the first half of the twentieth century. Bourassa advocated for a nation less reliant on Great Britain whether politically, economically or militarily, although he was not, at the same time, opting for a republic which was the case for the radical French-speaking reformers in the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837. Nor were Bourassa or others necessarily advocating for a provincial nationalism, i.e. for the separation of Quebec from Canada which became a strong component in Quebec politics during the Quiet Revolution and especially through the rise of the Parti Qu√©b√©cois in 1968.  History  The goal of all economic and political nationalists has been the creation and then maintenance of Canadian sovereignty. During Canada's colonial past there were various movements in both Upper Canada (present day Ontario) and Lower Canada (present day Quebec) to achieve independence from the British Empire. These culminated in the failed Rebellions of 1837. These movements had republican and pro-American tendencies and many of the rebels fled to the US following the failure of the rebellion. Afterwards Canadian patriots began focusing on self-government and political reform within the British Empire. This was a cause championed by early Liberals such as the Reform Party (pre-Confederation) and the Clear Grits, while Canada's early Conservatives, supported by loyalist institutions and big business, supported stronger links to Britain. Following the achievement of constitutional independence in 1867 (Confederation) both of Canada's main parties followed separate nationalistic themes. The early Liberal Party of Canada generally favoured greater diplomatic and military independence from the British Empire while the early Conservative Party of Canada fought for economic independence from the United States. = Free trade with the US = Representatives of the governments of Canada, Mexico, and the United States sign the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1992 Starting before Confederation in 1867 the debate between free trade and protectionism was a defining issue in Canadian politics. Nationalists, along with British loyalists, were opposed to the idea of free trade or reciprocity for fear of having to compete with American industry and losing sovereignty to the United States. This issue dominated Canadian politics during the late 19th and early 20th centuries with the Tories taking a populist, anti-free trade stance. Conservative leader Sir John A. Macdonald advocated an agenda of economic nationalism, known as the National Policy. This was very popular in the industrialized Canadian east. While the Liberal Party of Canada took a more classical liberal approach and supported the idea of an \\"open market\\" with the United States, something feared in eastern Canada but popular with farmers in western Canada.B√©langer, Claude (April 2005). \\"The National Policy and Canadian Federalism\\". Studies on the Canadian Constitution and Canadian Federalism. Marianopolis College. The National Policy also included plans to expand Canadian territory into the western prairies and populate the west with immigrants. In each \\"free trade election\\", the Liberals were defeated, forcing them to give up on the idea. The issue was revisited in the 1980s by Progressive Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. Mulroney reversed his party's protectionist tradition, and, after claiming to be against free trade during his leadership campaign in 1983, went forward with negotiations for a free trade agreement with the United States. His government believed that this would cure Canada's ills and unemployment, which had been caused by a growing deficit and a terrible economic recession during the late 1980s and early 1990s. The agreement was drawn up in 1987 and an election was held on the issue in 1988. The Liberals, in a reversal of their traditional role, campaigned against free trade under former Prime Minister John Turner. The Tories won the election with a large majority, partially due to Mulroney's support in Quebec among Quebec nationalists to whom he promised \\"distinct society\\" status for their province. After the election of 1988, opponents of free trade pointed to the fact that the PC Party of Brian Mulroney received a majority of seats in parliament with only 43% of the vote while together the Liberal Party and New Democratic Party both of whom opposed the agreement received 51% of the vote, showing opposition from a clear majority of the population. = World wars = \\"Keep All Canadians Busy Buy 1918 Victory Bonds\\" The impact of World War I on the evolution of Canada's identity is debated by historians. While there is a consensus that on the eve of the war, most English speaking Canadians had a hybrid imperial-national identity, the war's effects on Canada's emergence as a nation are complex. The Canadian media often refers to the First World War and, in particular, the Battle of Vimy Ridge, as marking \\"the birth of a nation.\\"Nersessian, Mary (April 9, 2007). Vimy battle marks birth of Canadian nationalism . CTV.ca Some historians consider the First World War to be Canada's \\"war of independence.\\"Cook, Tim (2008). Shock troops: Canadians fighting the Great War, 1917-1918. Toronto: Viking. They argue that the war decreased the extent to which Canadians identified with the British Empire and intensified their sense of being Canadians first and British subjects second. This sense was expressed during the Chanak crisis when, for the first time, the Canadian government stated that a decision by the British government to go to war would not automatically entail Canadian participation. Other historians robustly dispute the view that World War I undermined the hybrid imperial-national identity of English-speaking Canada. Phillip Buckner states that: \\"The First World War shook but did not destroy this Britannic vision of Canada. It is a myth that Canadians emerged from the war alienated from, and disillusioned with, the imperial connection.\\" He argues that most English-speaking Canadians \\"continued to believe that Canada was, and should continue to be, a 'British' nation and that it should cooperate with the other members of the British family in the British Commonwealth of Nations.\\"Buckner, Philip, ed. (2006). Canada and the British World: Culture, Migration, and Identity. p. 1. Vancouver, BC: UBC Press. Nevertheless, there are two possible mechanisms whereby World War I may have intensified Canadian nationalism: 1) Pride in Canada's accomplishments on the battlefield demonstrably promoted Canadian patriotism, and 2) the war distanced Canada from Britain in that Canadians reacted to the sheer slaughter on the Western Front by adopting an increasingly anti-British attitude. Still, Governor General The Lord Tweedsmuir raised the ire of imperialists when he said in Montreal in 1937: \\"a Canadian's first loyalty is not to the British Commonwealth of Nations, but to Canada and Canada's King.\\"Smith, Janet Adam; John Buchanan, a Biography; London, 1965; p. 423 The Montreal Gazette dubbed the statement \\"disloyal.\\"Time: Roya Visit; October 21, 1957 = Qu√©b√©cois nationalism = F√™te Nationale du Qu√©bec (or Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day) celebrated here in June 2006 Another early source of pan-Canadian nationalism came from Quebec in the early 20th century. Henri Bourassa, Mayor of Montebello and one-time Liberal Member of Parliament created the Canadian Nationalist League (Ligue nationaliste canadienne) supporting an independent role for Canada in foreign affairs opposed to both British and American imperialism.Levitt, Joseph. Bourassa, Henri. The Canadian Encyclopedia. Historica.ca. Bourassa also supported Canadian economic autonomy. Bourassa was instrumental in defeating Sir Wilfrid Laurier in the federal election of 1911 over the issue of a Canadian Navy controlled by the British Empire, something he furiously opposed. In so doing, he aided the Conservative Party of Sir Robert Borden in that election, a party with strong British imperialist sympathies.Neatby, H. Blair (1973). Laurier and a Liberal Quebec: A Study in Political Management. Richard T. Clippingdale., ed. McClelland and Steward Limited. Questia.com. In the federal election of 1917 he was also instrumental in opposing the Borden government's plan for conscription and as a result assisted the Laurier Liberals in Quebec. His vision of a unified, bi-cultural, tolerant and sovereign Canada remains an ideological inspiration to many Canadian nationalists. Alternatively his French Canadian nationalism and support for maintaining French Canadian culture would inspire Quebec nationalists many of whom were supporters of the Quebec sovereignty movement. = Nationalist politics = Modern attempts at forming a popular Canadian nationalist party have failed. The National Party of Canada was the most successful of recent attempts. Led by former publisher Mel Hurtig the Nationals received more than 183,000 votes or 1.38% of the popular vote in the 1993 election. Infighting however led to the party's demise shortly afterwards. This was followed by the formation of the Canadian Action Party in 1997. Created by a former Liberal Minister of Defence, Paul Hellyer, the CAP has failed to attract significant attention from the electorate since that time. An organic farmer and nationalist activist from Saskatchewan named David Orchard attempted to bring a nationalist agenda to the forefront of the former Progressive Conservative Party of Canada. In spite of attracting thousands of new members to a declining party he was unsuccessful in taking over the leadership and preventing the merger with the former Canadian Alliance. Various activist/lobby groups such as the Council of Canadians, along with other progressive, environmentalist and labour groups have campaigned tirelessly against attempts to integrate the Canadian economy and harmonize government policies with that of the United States. They point to threats allegedly posed to Canada's environment, natural resources, social programs, the rights of Canadian workers and cultural institutions. These echo the concerns of a large segment of the Canadian population. The nationalist Council of Canadians took a role of leadership in protesting discussions on the Security and Prosperity Partnership and earlier talks between previous Canadian and US governments on \\"deep integration\\". concerns regarding national unity have ebbed to a some degree and nationalist sentiment among the population overall has increased. Even in Quebec, long a hotbed of secessionist sentiment, a large majority has emerged that expresses pride and loyalty toward Canada as a whole. He has, in fact, described Canada as post-national, a description that some critics have argued runs counter to current trends in Europe and the United States. Prime Minister Trudeau, elected in 2015, has however espoused distinctly anti- nationalist sentiments during his tenure (or at least sentiments that are contrary to traditional nationalism). To the extent Canadians have embraced nationalism in recent years, it has been a more inclusive nationalism, as contrasted with the exclusive nationalism that has arisen recently in the US and some other Western nations.

History  Qianxun Pagoda of Chonegsheng Temple, exhibited at Yunnan Provincial Museum. =Origins= Nanzhao was overthrown in 902 and three dynasties followed in quick succession before Duan Siping seized power in 937, establishing himself at Dali. The Duan clan professed to have Han ancestry. The Yuan dynasty records said the Duan family came from Wuwei in Gansu. =Relations with the Song dynasty= Dali's relationship with the Song was cordial throughout its entire existence. Dali congratulated the Song dynasty on the conquest of Later Shu in 965 and voluntarily established tribute relations in 982. It was however essentially an independent state. At times the Song even declined offers of tribute. The Song founder Song Taizu declared all land south of the Dadu River to be Dali territory and did not desire to pursue any further claims to avoid the Tang dynasty's disastrous efforts against Nanzhao. Dali's primary importance to the Song dynasty was its horses, which were highly prized and sought after as military assets, especially after the fall of the Northern Song. They were described by a Song official in the following passage: =Dazhong Kingdom (1094-1096)= In 1094, the former prime minister Gao Shengtai forced King Duan Zhengming to relinquish the throne to him and renamed the Dali Kingdom to \\"Dazhong Kingdom\\". Gao Shengtai ruled briefly until his death in 1096, after which the throne was returned to the Duan family. Duan Zhengming's younger brother, Duan Zhengchun, became the new ruler and restored the kingdom's former name. =Fall= In 1252 M√∂ngke Khan placed his brother Kublai in charge of invading Dali. In 1253 Kublai's army crossed the Jinsha River and received the surrender of Duan Xingzhi, who presented to M√∂ngke in 1256 maps of Yunnan. Duan Xingzhi of Dali was enfeoffed as Maharaja (Êë©ËØÉÁΩóÂµØ) by Kublai Khan, and the Duan royal family continued to hold the title of Maharaja in Yunnan as vassals to the Mongols under the supervision of Mongolian imperial princes and Muslim governors. The Duan family reigned in Dali while the governors served in Kunming. After the Ming conquest of Yunnan, The Duan royals were scattered in various distant areas of China by the Hongwu Emperor. = Yunnan under the Mongols = The Duan family governed Yunnan's various indigenous peoples for eleven generations until the end of Mongol rule. They willingly contributed soldiers to the Mongol campaign against the Song dynasty. In 1271, they aided the Yuan dynasty in putting down a Mongol rebellion in Yunnan. In 1274, Ajall Shams al-Din Omar was assigned by Kublai to stabilize Yunnan. He instituted a native chieftain system that came to be known as tusi which assigned ranks and posts to native chieftains. Under this institution of \\"rule based on native customs\\" the locals retained much of their autonomy with the exception of three obligations. One, they would provide surrendered troops to the Yuan government. Two, local chieftains would provide tribute to the Yuan court. Three, they would follow the rules of appointment, succession, promotion, degradation, reward, and punishment of native chieftains created by the Yuan court. Yuan rule also introduced a significant Muslim influence into Yunnan. The King of Dali Duan Gong was married to the Mongol Borjigin princess Agai, daughter of the Yuan dynasty Mongol Prince of Liang, Basalawarmi. They had a son and a daughter, Duan Sengnu. their children were also called Duan Qiangna amd Duan Bao. However the Mongols feared the power of Duan Gong and killed him. Duan Sengnu raised Duan Bao to take revenge against Basalawarmi for the killing of Duan Gong. A play was made based on these events. According to Yuan documents, the Duan family were originally Han Chinese from Wuwei commamdery, Gansu. Other Duan families also originated from Wuwei. = Conquest by Ming = In 1381, the Ming dynasty dispatched 300,000 troops to crush the Yuan remnants in Yunnan. The House of Duan, who helped the Mongols against a Red Turban Rebellion attack from Sichuan, also fought against the Ming army. The ruler Duan Gong refused to surrender by writing to Fu Youde, making it clear that Dali could only be a tributary to the Ming. Fu Youde attacked and crushed Duan Gong's realm after a fierce battle. The Duan brothers were taken captive and escorted back to the Ming capital. Religion A version of Buddhism known as Azhali existed in Yunnan since the 9th century. The last king of Nanzhao established Buddhism as a state religion and many Dali kings continued the tradition. Ten of Dali's 22 kings retired to become monks.  Governance  Under the influence of Chinese officials present from early times, the Dali elite used Chinese script supplemented by Bai characters that were constructed based on Chinese characters. The Dali court granted hereditary fiefs to pre-existing clan chiefs to win over support, as well as autonomous military divisions. Similarly to the Nanzhao military, the Dali military consisted of a standing army, townsfolk peasant-soldiers and indigenous militia.

The film tells the story of John Hobbes, a Philadelphia police detective who is investigating murders committed by an apparent copycat killer. Denzel Washington, John Goodman, Donald Sutherland, Embeth Davidtz, James Gandolfini and Elias Koteas star. Fallen was released on January 16, 1998, by Warner Bros. The film grossed $25.2 million against its budget of $46 million.  Plot  An opening voiceover announces \\"I want to tell you about the time I almost died.\\" Philadelphia Police Detective John Hobbes visits serial killer Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas), whom he helped capture, on death row. Reese is in high spirits, which seems odd in light of the fate that awaits him, and during conversation he grabs Hobbes' hand and delivers a spiteful monologue in an unknown language, assumed to be gibberish but later identified as Aramaic. As he is executed in the gas chamber, Reese mocks the spectators and sings \\"Time is on My Side\\" by the Rolling Stones. Later, Hobbes and his partner Jonesy (John Goodman) investigate a string of new murders that have begun and are reminiscent of Reese's style, and it is assumed to be the work of a copycat killer, since Reese committed his crimes alone and had no connections. Hobbes, through hints given by Reese and later by the apparent copycat killer, tracks down a woman named Gretta Milano. Gretta explains that her father, a former detective, killed himself in an isolated cabin in the woods after being accused of a series of demonic-themed murders similar to the ones Hobbes and Jonesy are currently investigating. Hobbes goes to the Milano family's lake-house, which has been left abandoned for 30 years. In the basement he finds several books, with unsettling illustrations, concerning demonic possession. He also discovers the name \\"Azazel\\" written on a wall, obscured under layers of grime. Hobbes meets up with Gretta again and mentions the name to her, but she strongly urges him to drop the case to protect his life and the lives of his friends and family. However, she reconsiders after a terrifying encounter with Azazel, who confronts her in the guise of several strangers on the street and attempts to possess her. Seeking sanctuary in a church, Gretta explains to Hobbes that Azazel is a fallen angel with the power to possess human beings by touch. Hobbes realises that Azazel, while possessing Edgar Reese, shook his hand before the execution, but was not able to possess him. Gretta explains that the demon will try to ruin his life by any and all means, and warns him of the inevitability of Azazel's victory. Azazel visits Hobbes at his precinct and possesses his friend Lou (James Gandolfini), asking him about his investigation and taunting him by humming \\"Time is on My Side\\" and then moving from person to person, continuing with the lyrics after each transfer. Hobbes asks Lou and several others why they were singing the song, but they have no recollection of their actions during the time Azazel was using their bodies. Hobbes runs outside and calls out to Azazel in Aramaic. The demon, now moving among people in the street, praises Hobbes for his cleverness. Hobbes confesses that he knows of Azazel's true identity, to which the demon responds \\"beware my wrath\\" and disappears. To provoke Hobbes, Azazel possesses his nephew Sam and attacks John's intellectually disabled brother Art in their home. He again flees into other people on the street, ending up in a schoolteacher. As the teacher, Azazel draws a gun and forces Hobbes to shoot his host in front of a group of bystanders. Azazel boasts to Hobbes that even if his current host is killed, he can transfer to another host in the surrounding area without even needing to touch them, as he did during Reese's execution. Lieutenant Stanton (Donald Sutherland) informs Hobbes that his fingerprints were found at one of the murder scenes, and in light of the bizarre circumstances of the shooting of the teacher, he has become a suspect for all the murders. Azazel inhabits several of the witnesses and gives false accounts that the shooting was unprovoked, throwing further suspicion on Hobbes. He also comes into his home and murders his brother, whilst also marking Sam. Hobbes then takes his nephew to Gretta's house, to keep him safe. Gretta explains that, if forced out of a host body, Azazel can only travel in spirit form for as long as \\"one breath\\" can sustain him. If he does not possess another host within a certain amount of time, he will expire permanently. Hobbes goes to the Milano cabin and calls Jonesy, knowing he will trace the call. Stanton and Jonesy arrive to arrest Hobbes; however, Jonesy kills Stanton, revealing himself to be possessed by Azazel. Azazel prepares to shoot himself, which will allow him to possess Hobbes, the only other person for miles around. Hobbes wrestles Jonesy for his gun and Jonesy is accidentally shot and wounded in the struggle. Hobbes then smokes cigarettes which he explains have been laced with poison, the same poison that Azazel used to kill his brother, which will leave Azazel stranded in the wilderness without a host. An enraged Azazel insults as Hobbes taunts him, proclaiming that \\"time is on my side\\" before shooting and killing Jonesy. Azazel then takes possession of Hobbes' body and frantically attempts to flee, but succumbs to the poison and dies. The opening voiceover, in the voice of Hobbes, reminds the viewer this is the story of how he almost died, revealing that he is in fact Azazel. A cat, which has been possessed by Azazel, emerges from beneath the cabin and begins heading back to civilization.

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, an expressman was someone whose responsibility it was to ensure the safe delivery of gold or currency, being shipped by railroad, and which was secured in the \\"express car\\". This job included guarding the safe or other strongboxes or coffers against outlaws, and memorizing the safe's combination to use at delivery. Origins For decades stagecoach drivers and baggage-wagoners performed many of the tasks that would be later formalized under the title expressman.Lovett, A. (1858). History of the Express Companies and the Origin of American Railroads. Second Edition. The first express companies, which developed in the early 19th century, contracted with stagecoach lines to carry their goods. By 1900 there were four major express companies. As express services matured into an industry, the tasks of stage- coach driver were divided among specialties, such as driver, expressman, agent, clerk, and others, rendering them outmoded. Many of the stage-coach drivers transitioned into the express industry. Some became expressmen; some became agents, managers, and company owners. With the expansion of the railroads, express companies shifted to use that faster form of transportation. On the railroads, the men who later were called expressmen were initially referred to as conductors, as they were responsible for managing all or part of the express rail car. The title expressman was adopted later, as the specialty became more recognized. Role of expressman in the United States The express industry came about with the onset of the Industrial Revolution. It served a vital role in enabling companies to do business at regional and national levels. The expressman served not only as a courier, but as a highly ethical agent of currency, documents and other high- value items, and was considered a highly valuable employee.Pinkerton, A (1874). The Expressman and the Detective. W. B. KEEN, COOKE & CO. =Dangers= The inherent danger in their job led some to arm themselves.Tucker, T.W. (1891). Waifs from the Way-Bills. Lee & Shepard Publishers. On major routes whole passenger cars were reserved for the expressmen, mainly for their security, as these agents would sit away from passengers as much as possible. In one incident, an expressman in a reserved car was shot in the head three times and robbed by a man pretending to be another expressman. He survived, and later aided in the prosecution of his attacker. On some routes, serial robberies were a serious concern. The expressmen would sometimes be accompanied by armed men for additional security, and some enlisted the Pinkerton Agency, which became established in this era. Expressmen in Europe The success of express shipping in the United States was quickly adopted by Great Britain and Europe. Harnden & Co. established the Liverpool to Paris line, thus bringing the role of expressman with it. Within a decade, express routes had been extended to most principal cities on the European continent. 20th century and decline The expressman as an occupation in the United States continued until President Woodrow Wilson's government nationalized the railroads on December 26, 1917, after the United States entered World War I. The United States Railroad Administration introduced changes to support the war effort. It standardized rolling stock and steam locomotive designs. The railroads were returned to private owners in 1920, after the war. Federal postal workers and eventually parcel workers took over the management of US mail and packages on trains. At times railroads have used special freight conductors, to ride with trains to ensure the care and security of special cargo. Representation in other media Mark Twain featured expressmen in his short tale, \\"The Invalid's Story.\\"  References  Category:Obsolete occupations Category:Railway occupations ","title":"Expressman"},{"id":"1151475","text":"Park Monroe Trammell (April 9, 1876 ‚Äì May 8, 1936), was an American attorney and politician from the state of Florida. Trammell represented Florida in the United States Senate from 1917 until his death in 1936. As chair of the Senate Naval Affairs Committee, Trammell was essential in the creation of several naval bills that revitalized the United States Navy. Trammell previously served as the Governor of Florida and Florida Attorney General.  Early life and education  Trammell was born on April 9, 1876 in Macon County, Alabama. When he was a young child, Trammell and his parents moved to a citrus farm near Lakeland, Florida. Trammell attended Vanderbilt University in 1898, before enlisting in the United States Army during the Spanish-American War. Trammell served in the Quartermaster Corps, and was stationed in Tampa, Florida. After the war, Trammell enrolled at Cumberland University, graduating in 1899. He was admitted into the Florida Bar the same year.  Early career  Trammell, a Democrat, was elected mayor of Lakeland in 1900 and re-elected to a second term in 1901. In 1902, Trammell was elected to the Florida House of Representatives, representing Polk County. He served in the Florida House until 1904, when he was elected to the Florida Senate for Polk County. From 1905 until 1907, Trammell was the President of the Florida Senate. He resigned from the senate the following year, and returned to private practice. In 1909, Trammell was appointed to serve as the 19th Florida Attorney General by Governor Albert W. Gilchrist. = Florida Governor = In the 1912 gubernatorial election, Trammell ran to succeed Gilchrist as Governor of Florida. After securing the Democratic nomination, Trammell defeated four other candidates in the general election, receiving 80% of the vote. His closest competitor was Socialist Thomas W. Cox. As governor, Trammell endorsed a law in the Florida Legislature that would control spending in election campaigns, and also established a state tax commission in order to equalize property assessments across various counties. However, Trammell's governorship is most known for his blatant racism, endorsing racial segregation and overlooking the lynching of African Americans through the state. While Trammell was state attorney general, none of the 29 lynchings of black men during his term were prosecuted, nor were the 21 that occurred while he was governor.  United States Senate  With the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment on April 8, 1913, U.S. Senators were to be popularly elected, rather than being elected by their state legislatures. Trammell ran for the U.S. Senate in the 1916 election, defeating incumbent Nathan P. Bryan in the Democratic primary. He went on to defeat his Republican opponent, newsman William R. O'Neal, with nearly 83% of the vote. During his tenure as senator, Trammell was not afraid to deviate from his party. In 1916, Trammell, a member of the Old Right, an informal group of paleoconservatives in both major parties, staunchly opposed President Woodrow Wilson's call for conscription in World War I. Additionally, he opposed U.S. Supreme Court nominees Harlan F. Stone in 1925 and John J. Parker in 1930, the prior being successfully appointed to the court. During the Great Depression, Trammell joined the Conservative Coalition, a group of conservative congressmen opposed to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, claiming it was too liberal, despite his overall support for Roosevelt. Opinions on the New Deal were additionally changing across the South, with many Southern Democrats who initially supported the legislation beginning to vote against it. In Florida, the test of voters' approval of the New Deal was the Democratic primary of the 1934 U.S. Senate election, in which Trammell, who generally ran unopposed in the primaries, faced the stiffest competition of his entire career. Trammell faced former State Representative Claude Pepper, attorney Charles A. Mitchell, State Senator James F. Sikes, and Florida Democratic Committeewoman Hortense K. Wells. Though the race was mostly a competition between Trammell and Pepper, a social liberal, the latter three candidates pulled enough votes from Trammell to send the race into a runoff election between Trammell and Pepper. Trammell defeated Pepper in the runoff, winning by just a 2% margin. Trammell was unopposed in the general election. Earlier in 1934, Trammell co-sponsored the Vinson-Trammell Act, along with House Naval Affairs Committee Chair Carl Vinson, which authorized the replacement of obsolete ship by construction of new ships in order to compete with the Japanese Empire. During his time in the Senate, Trammell was often referred to as the most useless member of the body, having missed 642 out of 3,168 roll call votes across his entire tenure. Despite this, he was still popular among Florida voters. Trammell was the chairman of the Senate Expenditures in the Treasury Department Committee from 1917 until 1919, and of the Senate Naval Affairs Committee from 1933 until his death in 1936.  Death and legacy  Trammell died at his home in Washington, D.C. on May 8, 1936. He is buried in Lakeland's Roselawn Cemetery. Trammell's senatorial papers were donated to the Lakeland Public Library and the University of Florida after his death. His gubernatorial papers reside in the Florida State Archives. In 1955, the Lakeland Public Library building was named the Park Trammell Building. It now houses the Greater Lakeland Chamber of Commerce. Built in 1955, the Park Trammell Building is a nine-story low- rise building in Tampa, which houses the Greater Tampa Chamber of Commerce. The Park Trammell Building at the Florida State Mental Hospital in Chattahoochee, Florida, dedicated in 1956, is used to house the geriatric population of the institution.  Personal life  Trammell married Virginia Darby on November 21, 1900. They were married until her death in 1922. He later married Beatrice Padgett, a divorced woman with a son, in 1934. Trammell had no children of his own with either woman. Trammell was a member of the Freemasons, the Knights of Pythias, and the Woodmen of the World.

He was enormously influential as a lutenist in his time, and renowned as a virtuoso on the instrument. Life He was born in Brass√≥, Transylvania, Kingdom of Hungary (today Bra»ôov in Romania), into a family of Transylvanian Saxon origin. An orphan, he was brought up by the Greff family and was educated in Buda at the court of John Z√°polya. Bakfark remained there until 1540, though he possibly traveled to Italy once during this time. Sometime in the 1540s he traveled to Paris, but, finding the position of lutenist to the king filled, he left for Jagiellon Poland in 1549, where he was employed as a court lutenist by Sigismund II Augustus. From then until 1566, he traveled extensively around Europe, with his renown increasing, but remained faithful to his employer in spite of numerous efforts by other monarchs to win him away; the riches bestowed on him by Sigismund may have affected his decision to remain attached to the court of Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania in Vilnius. What happened to him in 1566 is not precisely known, but he clearly did something to provoke the wrath of the king, and scarcely had time to flee before Polish army troops ransacked his house and destroyed his possessions. After this, he lived for a while in Vienna and then returned to Transylvania, but not for long; in 1571 he moved to Padua in Italy, where he remained until his death during the plague of 1576. As was common practice at the time, all the possessions of plague victims were destroyed by fire, so most of his manuscript music was lost. Music and influence French tablature While Bakfark almost certainly wrote an enormous amount of music, very little was printed: a commonly given reason was that it was simply too difficult for others to play. His surviving works include ten fantasies, seven madrigals, eight chansons, and fourteen motets‚Äîall in amazingly faithful polyphonic arrangements for lute alone. Additionally, he transcribed vocal motets by contemporary composers such as Josquin des Prez, Clemens non Papa, Nicolas Gombert, and Orlando di Lasso into arrangements for the lute.

Ecology Puku are found almost exclusively in marshy grassland and dambos of the Kilombero Valley of Tanzania, where they eat grasses. The Puku diet is flexible in regards to type of grasses consumed, there is also little dietary competition with other bovids. Crepuscular, active in the early morning and late afternoon. When scared, puku repeat a shrill whistle sound. Females gather in herds of up to 20 individuals. During the rainy season, many herds will come together for added safety, typically reaching around 50 females. Males hold territories and attempt to persuade herds of females to stay within their territories for as long as possible. In the wet season, due to large floods in their habitat they migrate to a high elevation and in dry seasons remain near water.

Club career =Crew= In 2002, Szetela entered USSF's Bradenton Academy, graduating in May 2004. He then signed with Major League Soccer, but because he signed after the annual draft had taken place, his rights were made available to teams in a weighted lottery instead, with Columbus Crew ending up with his rights. His desire to play for his hometown club, the MetroStars, went unfulfilled. Joining in mid-season, Szetela appeared in eight regular season and two playoff games, while recording a solitary assist. In 2005, Szetela struggled to get on the field with the Crew. During 2006, he was beset by injury troubles and only saw four games for Columbus. =Europe= On August 31, 2007, Szetela was signed by Racing de Santander, in the Spanish Primera Divisi√≥n. Szetela made his official debut with the Spanish club on November 14, in a scoreless draw against M√°laga CF in the Copa del Rey. On January 29, 2008, Szetela was loaned out to Serie B side Brescia Calcio until June 30, 2008, with the option to purchase at the end. Szetela made his debut for Brescia Calcio on February 9, playing the last five minutes in a 4-2 comeback victory. He made ten appearances total in Serie B. Szetela extended his loan to Brescia Calcio through June 2009 on July 18, 2008. He scored his first goal for Brescia, his first professional goal in league play, on October 18, 2008, against Triestina. He returned to Spain on July 13, 2009. However, the Spanish side decided against renewing his contract. =Major League Soccer= Szetela opted not to continue a career in Europe and returned to the States, signing a contract with Major League Soccer. His contract was picked up by D.C. United, who were second in the allocation order to sign returning U.S. international players. After suffering a severe knee injury in training camp prior to the 2010 MLS Season, Szetela underwent a partial menisectomy on February 3, 2010, to repair a torn meniscus in his right knee; however, it was unsuccessful. Shortly thereafter, on March 16, 2010, he was released by D.C. United. =New York Cosmos= He underwent a second failed operation in 2011 before having a third surgery later that year involving a meniscus transplant from a donor, which proved successful. Following two years of rehabilitation, Szetela returned to organized soccer in 2013, joining Icon FC, who at the time competed in the Garden State Soccer League of the USASA, the fifth-tier of American soccer. After impressing in U.S. Open Cup play with Icon FC, Szetela earned a tryout with New York Cosmos of the NASL. After a successful tryout, Szetela signed a contract with the Cosmos on July 1, 2013. Szetela appeared in 13 games for the Cosmos during the 2013 season and scored his first goal with the Cosmos in a 4‚Äì0 victory against the Carolina Railhawks on October 12, 2013. Szetela was named to the NASL Team of the Week in Week 8 and 11 of the 2013 season. He was in the starting lineup for the 2013 NASL Soccer Bowl and helped the Cosmos capture their sixth NASL title of all-time, defeating the Atlanta Silverbacks 1‚Äì0. On January 7, 2014, Szetela signed a contract extension with the Cosmos. During the 2014 Spring season, Szetela scored one goal in eight appearances for the club and was named to the Spring Week 8 NASL Team of the Week. He scored the game-winning goal in the team's 3‚Äì2 home victory over the Atlanta Silverbacks on September 13, 2014, earning NASL Team of the Week honors and scored again two weeks later in the team's 1‚Äì1 draw with FC Edmonton while once again being named to the NASL Team of the Week for his performance. He finished the 2014 regular season with three goals and one assist in 23 appearances (21 starts). Szetela finished the 2015 regular season with 29 appearances for the Cosmos. After five years with the Cosmos, Danny mulled retirement after the NASL suspended play for 2018. After announcing that he would sign with NPSL side FC Motown in New Jersey, Danny instead re- signed with the Cosmos. International In 2003, Szetela burst onto the world's stage during the Under-17 World Cup in Finland. The second-youngest player on the United States roster, he started all four American games, scoring two goals. In 2005, he was called up to the U.S. U-20 national team for the 2005 2005 World Youth Championship in the Netherlands. He played two games in that tournament. On June 30, 2007, Szetela scored the opening goal in the United States' match against South Korea in the U-20 World Cup. Three days later he recorded two goals in a winning effort over Poland, the country of both his parents. Szetela made his debut for the USA on October 17, 2007, as a late-match substitute against Switzerland, and set up Michael Bradley's game- winning goal. The win snapped a five-game losing streak for the national team, and provided their first win over Switzerland in seven matches. For a while, Szetela, who has a Polish passport and speaks Polish, was unsure of his international allegiances, as his parents wanted him to play for Poland. However, after the former coach of Polish national team, Pawel Janas, stated publicly that \\"in Poland we have 200 players like Szetela,\\" he decided to play for the U.S. In July 2008, Szetela was named to the U.S. team that competed in the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

(2009). Tracks across continents, paths through history: the economic dynamics of standardization in railway gauge. Chicago : University of Chicago Press. . p 182 and neighbouring states. History Proposed route map 1943 (postwar drawing with borders of 1937). Since reparations due after World War I had to be paid, the Germany railway company Deutsche Reichsbahn lacked money for appropriate expansion and sufficient maintenance of their track network and rolling stock. After the seizure of power of Hitler and the NSDAP, commercial and civilian traffic increased due to economic stimulation. Deutsche Reichsbahn was now faced with a serious capacity problem. As a result, in part driven by its military objectives, the government began to prepare plans to modernize the railway network and increase transport capacity. Hitler believed that the standard Stephenson gauge was obsolete and was too narrow for the full development of railways. Also, as Hitler envisioned the future German empire as essentially a land-based Empire, the new German railways were imagined as a land-based equivalent of the ocean liners and freighters connecting the maritime British Empire. Hitler embraced a suggestion from Fritz Todt to build a new high-capacity Reichsspurbahn (Imperial Gauge Railway) with notably increased gauge. Objections from railway experts ‚Äì who foresaw difficulties in introducing a new, incompatible gauge (and proposed quadruple track standard gauge lines instead), and who could not imagine any use for the vast transport capacity of such a railway ‚Äì were ignored, and Hitler ordered the Breitspurbahn to be built with initial lines between Hamburg, Berlin, Nuremberg, Munich and Linz. The project engaged commercial partners Krauss-Maffei, Henschel, Borsig, Brown, Boveri & Cie and Krupp, but did not develop beyond line planning and initial survey. Throughout World War II, 100 officials and 80 engineers continued to work on the project.Housden, K. (2000). Hitler : Biography of a Revolutionary. Routledge. p. 156  Tracks  Standard and Russian gauge. Originally proposed to run on a track, the Breitspurbahn was ultimately developed with a track gauge of , over double the width of the common standard gauge track, and three times the width of the common semi-narrow metre gauge track. Planning called for a ballastless track (much as was developed 30 years later for San Francisco BART and 40 years later for German high-speed lines) which consisted of two parallel pre- stressed concrete \\"walls\\" sunk into the ground, joined at the top by a flat transverse slab. The rails were fixed on top of the \\"walls\\", with an elastic material between rail and concrete. Because it did not have conventional railway sleepers, this track would also have formed an ideal road for maintenance and military purposes. The rails would be either 155lb/yd (Pennsylvania special; height of 8 inches) rails or proposed 190lb/yd (height- width ratio of 1:1) rails. The passing loop length would be more than a mile. The intended Russian territory included within Hitler's Lebensraum (sub- Breitspurbahn system) plans already used the slightly wider 1.52 meter rail gauge since mid-19th century, barely half the width of the 3.0 meter gauge that was eventually decided. The 2.14 meter rail gauge, formerly used by the Great Western Railway in Great Britain in 19th century, was roughly three- quarters the width of the compromise. It was halfway between the 1.52 meter rail gauge and the 3.0 meter rail gauge. The 1.95 meter rail gauge, briefly used in the Netherlands prior to 1866, was roughly two-thirds the width of the compromise three meter rail gauge of the proposed Breitspurbahn system. Vehicles Models of double-deck wagons at the DB Museum, Nuremberg. =Locomotives= 41 different locomotive designs were suggested by the industry partners. These ranged from classical steam locomotives through steam turbine, gas turbine-electric and diesel-hydraulic to electric locomotives. The designs ranged from 12 axles (UIC: 3'Fo3', Whyte: 6-12-6) to 52 axles (UIC: 2'Fo'Fo'2' + 5T5 + 5T5 + 2'Fo'Fo'2', Whyte: 4-12-12-4 + 10-10 + 10-10 + 4-12-12-4). Power ranged from . All locomotives would have automatic couplers, ranged from Janney couplers to SA3 couplers. Several designs were short listed with passenger locomotives to be mainly electric and diesel-hydraulic with SA3 couplers, and freight locomotives to be mainly conventional steam with Janney couplers. =Multiple units= Diesel and electric multiple units of between 5 and 8 vehicles were proposed for shorter distance journeys. Despite being of somewhat lower standard, proposed designs included promenades, bars, lounges and large dining rooms. =Carriages= The proposal was that high-performance locomotives should pull 8-axle double-floor carriages with a length of , width of and height of . The carriages would have Dutch doors (with retractable staircase). The trains would be fitted with a restaurant, cinema, swimming pool, barbershop and sauna. The whole train would have a length of about , allowing a capacity of between 2,000 and 4,000 passengers, travelling at speeds of .

Proposed routes Early plans for routes considered India and Vladivostok as the ultimate goals of the railways, but by 1943 the planning was focused exclusively on European cities. Ukraine and the Volga Basin were seen as especially important targets, as these areas were viewed as the future granaries of the Nazi empire, potentially through the \\"settlement strings\\", or Siedlungsperlen of the proposed Wehrbauer settlements within the conquered territories, which would also be linked by the planned easternmost reaches of the Reichsautobahn freeway network.Norman Rich, Hitler's War Aims Volume 2 The Establishment of the New Order, New York: Norton, 1974, , p. 356.

It lies immediately to the west of the much larger Lake Tekapo and further to the east of Lake Pukaki, located to the north of Lake Tekapo township. It is a shallow lake with distinct indications of glacial origin and is spring fed with an outlet on its eastern shore midway down the lake. The outlet feeds into a smaller lake, Lake MacGregor before feeding into Lake Tekapo described as ‚ÄúOpaque and milky blue‚Äù in colour. In the desert terrain of the Mackenzie Plains, Lake Alexandrina is considered as an ‚Äúoasis of life‚Äù. Lake Alexandrina is a Wildlife Refuge and a delight to a fisherman, well documented for its brown and rainbow trout and salmon. Geography Landscape near the lake Categorised as a Canterbury High County lake in the Mackenzie Basin, it lies a short distance from Lake Tekapo while also being connected to it. Lake Alexandrina is approached from the State Highway 8 via the Godley Peaks Road. The lake, located at an altitude of , covers an area of with width of and extending to a length of . Its shores are flat. The maximum water depth in the lake is reported to be . The lake catchment has landscape that provides for plentiful wildlife but also has extensive cultivation which brings in a lot of nutrients, enriching the lake's with phosphorus. The lake's annual balance is contributed by surface streams: 5.72 million m3 (27%), overland flows: 1.11 million m3 (5%), ground water sources: 10.1 million m3 (48%) and precipitation: 4.11 million m3 (20%). The storage in the lake lasts four years. Chemical properties Map The lake has been classified as mesotrophic type. Chlorophyll levels of 0.4‚Äì3.8 mg/1 have recorded during observations carried out between November 1978 and March 1979. The total phosphorus at 1 m depth was 0.009‚Äì0.015 mg/L as measured in March 1979. The reasons attributed to high nutrient content and consequent high degree of phosphorus levels are due to nutrients entering from the lake catchment, underground sources, grazing on the periphery of the lake, human habitations around the lake, aerial spray and stocking in the trout-spawning streams. Ecology The lake catchment is biologically rich, with 45 species of birds, which include the southern crested grebe, shoveler and scaup. The Australian shoveller is a common bird seen in the lake area, as well as pelicans, black swans and ducks. Six species of waterbirds have been recorded in total. Paradise shelducks flock here during the summer season, seeking sanctuary when they become flightless during their moult. Freshwater snails Potamopyrgus antipodarum have also been analysed in the basin area. For example, studies in 1994 found that there are more male snails in the lake's shallow water than females, and that snails are sicker in shallow water than deep water. ;Vegetation The breeding of the Elodea canadensis species has been inhibited at Lake Alexandrina because of the steep slopes on the east and west sides of the lake, as well as turbulence caused by high winds of 10‚Äì14 m/s. ;Aqua fauna The lake has plentiful stocks of brown trout, rainbow trout and salmon, which are well known to fishing enthusiasts. The trout are not found in abundance because of overfishing and inadequate spawning duration. However, the fish do grow to a large size, especially the trout, each weighing as much as on an average. Some of prize catch could be of weight for rainbows and for brown variety trout (which generally are found along the shores of the lake where flies and insects abound). Conservation Lake Alexandrina is one of New Zealand's Scenic Reserves, a valid Crown Protected Area. ;Threats The threats to the lake waters that were identified in the 1980s were the regular occurrence of algal (Anabaena) blooms, which were a result of high nutrient levels of phosphorus, survival of wildlife, and recreational fishery. It was assessed by measurements that nearly 50% of the phosphorus was contributed by groundwater, with 32% from surface water inflows and only 3‚Äì9% from hut settlements. This resulted in poor quality of the lake waters and subsequently, measures to check the phosphorus content in the lake received priority attention of the Government of New Zealand. ;Conservation measures In order to take adequate remedial measures to check the inflow of nutrients into the lake, which had raised the phosphorus content in the lake waters to unacceptable levels, in 1984, the \\"Lake Alexandrina Steering Committee\\" was set up which identified the problem areas causing deterioration of water quality as due to phosphorus as also from the hut settlements at the outlet and south end, and from agricultural sources. The Taranaki Catchment Commission and the Waitaki Catchment Commission, who examined this issue in 1987, also concluded that though the inflows exceeded outflows, but they did not contribute to the storage due to the high sediment contribution which vitiated the storage. Consequent to their study of recorded high total phosphorus levels causing the blooms and creating threats to wildlife and the recreational fisheries, the Commission prescribed interim management guidelines such as: Total cessation of aerial top dressing within of the eastern shore and of the western shore and around the flow sources into the lake; restrictions on fertiliser use for agriculture; access to streams for spawning activities and to establish a \\"deer fence\\" on the northern end of the wetland; stop all activities related to cultivation on the shores of the lake; stop building of the hut settlements around the lake; install individual household effluent storage or septic tanks; and diversion of sewage outside the catchment. These measures were implemented by the Mackenzie District Council under a District Plan 1997, under the title \\"Lake Side Protection Area around Lake Alexandrina\\". Progressively implemented since 1985, the redeeming feature of these actions is that the heavy algal blooms of the 1980s are now infrequent and limited to a frequency occurrence of once in three years. Tourism In 1881, 10,000 trout were brought to Mackenzie country and released into Lake Alexandrina, as well as some other lakes, creeks and streams. After the trout grew and prospered, fishing licenses were issued. Lake Alexandrina, now known for its attraction to fisherman, has a small number of fisherman's huts clustered at each end of the lake and near the outlet. Rowing boats are the only mode of transport on the lake as sail and motor boats are prohibited.

The concept is run as a commercial venture in Spain and Italy, Poland, Hungary, and is quasi-governmental in South Korea (see below). Spain The first English Village experience was in July 2001 in Valdelavilla, Soria, Spain.morethanenglish.com Valdelavilla has been recreated in cyberspace in the Second Life game, populated by English and Spanish avatars who all have English as a common language. Italy The first Italian English Village was in Umbria in 2005.morethanenglish.com The current village is in the Umbria region, in the Tevere valley. Poland The first Polish English Village program was launched in 2010 by Anglovilleangloville.pl and has since spread to a four locations in the East and South West of Poland. Both adult and junior programmes are organized. The second English immersion programme in Poland, AngloBridge, opened in 2016, and courses primarily organised in the South and Centre of the country. Hungary Angloville Hungaryangloville.hu was launched in 2014 with programmes branded \\"language island\\" organized near Budapest and lake Balaton, plus a summer junior programme near Gy≈ër. Romania Angloville Romaniaangloville.ro opened in 2015. Week-long language immersion programmes are held in the mountain resort of Bu»ôteni in the Prahova valley, north of Bucharest. Turkey EEC-Anglo has been offering English Village projects since 2006. Intensive residential English programmes are organised in an isolated mountain-top venue near ƒ∞stanbul South Korea English villages in South Korea provide a short-term immersion English experience in a live-in environment where only English is spoken. This is intended to promote English learning and to build students' Anglo-American cultural awareness. The first English village was opened in August 2004 in Ansan, Gyeonggi-do province. Additional English villages have been opened in both Gyeonggi-do and Seoul. As of September 2012, there are 32 of such mini towns in suburban areas. English villages employ a mixture of foreign native speakers of English and fluent English-speaking Korean staff. They are intended to help students face the particular challenges of speaking English in the Korean context. Many families seek to improve their children's English ability by sending them to several expensive after-school programs and by sending them to study abroad in English-speaking countries. Study abroad results in a substantial amount of money leaving the country. The English villages are intended to reduce this loss, and make the immersion experience accessible to students from low-income families as well. However, many questions remain whether the English villages will be cost-effective. In fact, most have been privatized due to operating losses. The English village concept is to be expanded in the near future as financially it has not been a complete failure. The government will begin to use money for projects like this in the future in addition to sending students on scholarships overseas, despite spending money on short term construction projects. =Gyeonggi-do= The English villages of Gyeonggi province are overseen by the Gyeonggi English Culture Foundation, a quasi-governmental body established on the initiative of provincial governor Son Hak-Gyu. The original Ansan Camp was spun off in 2007, and is currently leased to a Christian organization. The much larger Paju Camp opened in 2006. In addition to the week-long residential programs, the facility also hosts many day visitors. Day visitors may be individuals, families, or large groups. English Village Paju Camp offers many special programs including a month-long vacation program, Family Programs, Military Programs, teacher training, and the Civil Servants Program. In addition to the current villages, the foundation established another in Yangpyeong County in 2008. Thereafter, the foundation hopes to franchise the English village concept to other cities. = Current Developments = One Month Program (Vacation Intensive Program) Two week programs were combined to form the One Month Program, the first of its kind in Korea. It is presented twice a year as a summer camp during July and winter camp during January. It was highly successful with students returning. This was a result of highly motivated teachers. Long Term Program (LTP) The Long Term Program is a 10-week intensive adult program that offers a great opportunity to practice and enhance their English skills in and outside of class by speaking with foreign teachers around English Village. The students live there so they are encouraged to participate in the many extracurricular activities with the foreigners that are in and outside of English Village. =Ansan= Ansan English Village was established in 2004 on Daebu Island on the coast of the Yellow Sea. Built on the site of a former government complex, the campus covers an area of 184,800 m2, including athletic facilities. It has approximately 50 full-time staff. It employs a content-based curriculum, with English-medium courses on topics including world music and dance, global awareness, cooking, and broadcasting. The village provides weekend and weekday programs, with a month-long program planned for school vacations. The weekend program works with families, training parents in how to encourage their children to speak English. The weekday program takes in about 200 middle school students per week, drawn each week from a different school in Gyeonggi province. The village is currently run by the Seventh-day Adventist Church, although religion is not taught. =Seoul= Seoul English Village was contracted by the Seoul government to a consortium of companies including Herald Media publisher of the Korea Herald English newspaper. Herald Media manages the daily operations, curriculum development, and implementation of programs at SEV. It opened in late November 2004.

The 92,746-seat stadium is the tenth-largest stadium in the NCAA. Architecturally, the stadium is known for its numerous expansions over the years that have been carefully planned to fit with the existing \\"look\\" of the stadium. The view of Georgia's campus and rolling hills from the open west end-zone has led many to refer to Sanford Stadium as college football's \\"most beautiful on-campus stadium\\", while the surrounding pageantry has made it noteworthy as one of college football's \\"best, loudest, and most intimidating atmospheres\\". Games played there are said to be played \\"between the hedges\\" due to the field being surrounded by privet hedges, which have been a part of the design of the stadium since it opened in 1929. The current hedges were planted in 1996 after the originals were taken out to accommodate soccer tournament for the 1996 Summer Olympics. The stadium is the 11th largest stadium in the United States and the 17th-largest such stadium in the world. Unlike most stadiums that have artificial playing surfaces, Sanford Stadium from the outset had, and continues to have, a natural grass surface, planted with Tifton 419 Bermuda Grass. History The stadium is named for Dr. Steadman Vincent Sanford, an early major force behind UGA athletics.Steadman Vincent Sanford Sanford arrived at the University of Georgia as an English instructor in 1903. He later became the faculty representative to the athletics committee and would eventually become president of the University and Chancellor of the entire University System of Georgia. In 1911, he moved the university's football venue from its first location, Herty Field, to a location at the center of campus which was named Sanford Field in his honor. Early postcard of Sanford Stadium, In those early years of football, Georgia played a series of controversial games against in-state rival Georgia Tech. Sanford Field was too small to accommodate the large crowds, forcing Georgia to travel to Tech's Grant Field in Atlanta every year. Sanford wanted Georgia to have a venue that would equal Tech's, and the \\"final straw\\" came in 1927 when UGA's undefeated (9‚Äì0) team traveled to Tech and lost 12‚Äì0. It was alleged that Tech watered the field all night to slow UGA's running backs. Afterwards, Sanford vowed to \\"build a stadium bigger than Tech\\", and play the game at Athens every other year. To fund his vision, Sanford had an idea that members of the athletic association would sign notes guaranteeing a bank loan to fund the stadium construction. Those guarantors would be granted lifetime seats. The response was overwhelming, and in 1928 a loan of $150,000 supported by fans and alumni allowed construction to begin on a stadium whose total cost was $360,000. Near the existing Sanford Field was a low area between the historic North Campus and the Science Campus (to the south) with a small creek (Tanyard Creek) running through it, creating a clearly preferable choice for the location of the new stadium. This natural valley containing Tanyard Creek would result in reduced costs, as stands could be built on the rising sides of the hill, while the creek could be enclosed in a concrete culvert, on top of which the field would be constructed. The architect for the stadium was TC Atwood of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where North Carolina's Kenan Memorial Stadium had just been completed with a similar design. The 30,000-seat stadium was built in large part with convict labor, as were many public works projects of that era. While the location was, then as now, preferable for construction, the result is an uphill walk in any direction leaving the stadium. Georgia fans \\"light up\\" Sanford Stadium with their cell phones at night during a game against Mississippi State in 2017. The stadium was completed on time, and UGA convinced perennial powerhouse Yale, which has historically maintained close ties with UGA, to be their first opponent in the new stadium. (This also was Yale's first ever football game played in the South.) On October 12, 1929, a capacity crowd of over 30,000 paid $3 per ticket to watch the Bulldogs, under coach Harry Mehre, beat Yale 15‚Äì0 in Sanford Stadium's dedication game. The crowd was at the time the largest to witness a college football game in the South, and governors from all nine southern states also were in attendance. Yale donated its half of the game receipts to UGA to help pay off the construction loans, which would subsequently be completely repaid in just five years. Dr. Sanford also was at this game, and attended many Georgia games at the stadium named in his honor until his death on September 15, 1945. Sanford Stadium's hedges have encircled the field since the stadium's first game against Yale in 1929. The idea to put hedges around the field came from the Business Manager of the UGA Athletic Department, Charlie Martin. Martin claimed to have received inspiration for the idea during a visit to the Rose Bowl, where he saw the hedge of roses in that stadium. Roses were not a suitable choice for the climate in Athens, so privet hedges were used instead. Six other SEC stadiums have copied UGA and now have hedges, making this feature no longer unique to UGA, but Georgia has the only one that completely surrounds the playing field. There is a disagreement as to the exact type of hedge planted at Sanford Stadium. The UGA Media Guide claims that the hedge is an \\"English privet hedge\\". A county extension agent in Athens, however, claims online that the hedge is composed of Chinese privet, Ligustrum sinense. In addition to being a cosmetic touch, the hedges have proven to be an effective (though perhaps unintended) measure of crowd control. While not apparent in photos, the hedges are growing around a chain link fence which stops people who try to push through to the field. Even though a major traffic path to exit the stadium from both stands runs directly alongside the hedges, fans have only stormed the field and torn down the goalposts once in the entire history of Sanford Stadium. This occurred after the Georgia vs. Tennessee game on Oct. 7, 2000. In May 2019, university officials announced that the playing surface of Sanford Stadium would be named in honor of former long time Bulldog head coach and athletic director Vince Dooley. Official dedication of Dooley Field took place in a pregame ceremony on the Bulldogs' 2019 home opener on September 7. On September 21, 2019, Sanford Stadium would set an attendance record of 93,246 in the Bulldogs victory against #7 Notre Dame. Aluminum bleachers were added to raise the capacity of the stadium by 500 due to the agreement between both UGA and the University of Notre Dame to allocate 8,000 visitor tickets for the each game in the home and home series. Stadium expansions The original stadium consisted of the lower half of the current facility's grandstand seats. In 1940, field-level lights were added, and Georgia played its first night game against Kentucky to a 7‚Äì7 tie. The stadium's first major expansion took place in 1949, with the addition of 6,000 seats on the south side, bringing total capacity to 36,000. During the 1960s, many universities in the South were significantly expanding their stadiums, and Georgia was no different. Soon after the arrival of head coach Vince Dooley in 1964, UGA began updating Sanford Stadium, removing the field-level lighting (which obstructed views from the stands) and adding 7,621 bleacher seats in the end zones, which brought total capacity to 43,621. Architects Heery and Heery of Atlanta were then hired to plan a major expansion. This expansion planning was very tricky, since by that time the stadium was encroached by academic buildings. The plans went forward, however, and the grandstand seats were double-decked in 1967 without the need to demolish or alter any of the surrounding buildings. In addition to the new upper decks, this first major addition included a new pressbox and club seating. In total, 19,640 seats were added to the stadium (bringing total capacity to 59,000), at a cost of $3 million. The new addition was christened with a victory over Mississippi State in 1967. In 1981, the east endzone was enclosed at a cost of $11.5 million, turning the stadium into a \\"horseshoe\\" and eliminating the free view enjoyed by the \\"Track People\\". This addition added 19,000 seats, bringing total stadium capacity to 82,122. The first game in the newly expanded stadium was on September 5, 1981, against Tennessee, with Georgia delivering a 44‚Äì0 drubbing. Lights were re-installed in the stadium in 1981. This time, the lights were not located at field level, but built above the upper level, thus not obscuring views of the field. The first game under the \\"new lights\\" was a 13‚Äì7 victory against Clemson on September 6, 1982. In 1991, a portion of the west endzone was enclosed, creating a \\"partial bowl\\" around the lower level of Sanford Stadium. The west stands could not be completely enclosed due to the proximity of Gillis Bridge (usually called \\"Sanford Bridge\\"), a major campus transportation artery, to the stadium. This expansion cost $3.7 million and added 4,205 new seats, bringing total capacity to 85,434. 30 luxury suites were added above the south stands in 1994, and were expanded to 50 suites in 2000. These expansions cost a total of $18 million, and raised total capacity to 86,520. In 2003, another upper deck was added to the north side of the stadium. It added 5,500 new seats at a cost of $25 million, bringing total stadium capacity to 92,058. Most of these \\"upper-upper deck\\" seats are reserved for the fans of the visiting team. In 2005, installation of a new video display above the west end zone was completed. Ribbon boards were also added along the sides of the stadium. These additions, constructed and maintained by Daktronics, established Sanford Stadium as one of the most visually media intensive venues in the SEC. The stadium reached its capacity of 92,746 in 2004, when 27 SkySuites were added to the north side of the stadium at a cost of $8 million. The video board installed from 2005 underwent a $1.4 million overhaul before the 2011 season. The screen size expanded from 25√ó46 feet to the full scoreboard size of the 52√ó76 feet. The new video board has full high definition (HD) capability. On February 14, 2017, the UGA Athletic Board approved a $63 million expansion to renovate the west side of the stadium. The approved design relocated the locker room from the east side to the west side and added a new plaza and recruiting pavilion. Construction began following the 2017 season and was officially opened with a ribbon- cutting ceremony on August 31, 2018, a day before Georgia's first home game of the 2018 season.

Volume 1. p. 543.1996 Summer Olympics official report. Volume 3. p. 455. Because the required dimensions of a soccer field are wider than those of an American football field, the hedges surrounding the field had to be removed. This proved to be a controversial measure, as it had not been general public knowledge that the hedges would have to be removed to accommodate the Olympic football competition. In preparation for this necessity, cuttings were taken from the original hedges, three years prior to the Olympics, and cultivated at a secret, off-campus site. It was later discovered that this 'secret site' was away at R.A. Dudley Nurseries in Thomson, Georgia. During the Olympics, Nigeria and the United States won the men's and women's football gold medals, respectively, at the hedge-less stadium. Once the Olympics were over, the newly grown hedges were transplanted from Dudley Nursery to the stadium. Sanford Stadium told the United States Soccer Federation it would not be interested in holding a possible World Cup match if the US gets the nod.The north stands of Sanford Stadium seen in July 2020 Features * Georgia's deceased Uga mascots are entombed in a mausoleum in the southwest corner of the stadium. * Sanford Stadium is one of the few college stadiums, and one of only two in the Southeastern Conference, in which the football field is oriented to face east‚Äìwest as opposed to north‚Äìsouth (the other is Kroger Field). Many of UGA's opponents have found it difficult to see as the west end zone is still open and the sun shines in the players' faces. * Until the end of the era of rail travel, executives of the Central of Georgia Railway Co. would park the company president's luxury office rail car on the tracks overlooking the end zone for an excellent view of the spectacle. With food served on china by white-coated porters to the Central of Georgia executives and their guests, the rail car \\"Atlanta\\" could be considered Sanford Stadium's original luxury skybox. * In the 1970s, a multitude of fans began watching games from the railroad tracks that overlooked the end zone. These \\"Track People\\", as they came to be known, were able to watch the game for free and became a tradition. The 1981 expansion, however, enclosed the end zone stands and eliminated the view of the field, thus ending the tradition. * Georgia's fans have only rushed the field and torn down the goal posts once in the stadium's history. It happened on October 7, 2000, after the Bulldogs beat rival Tennessee for the first time since 1988. This statistic is usually credited to the fact that the hedges serve not only cosmetic purposes, but also help with crowd control. Aiding this cause is that the hedges surround, and largely conceal, a low chain-link fence running through their branches around the circumference of the field. * Through the 1994 season, the field only had the basic markings required for play. There weren't any logos at midfield or writing in the end zone, as had become commonplace in many stadiums. * The goal line markers on each endzone is marked with the famous oval \\"G\\" logo.

It consists of a church, built between 1883 and 1884, and an attached minister's house, and provides a centre for the Liverpool International Nordic Community. The combined church and minister's house is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. History During the later part of the 19th century, large numbers of Scandinavian emigrants were passing through Liverpool, and there was a need to serve their spiritual needs. The first Scandinavian priest was appointed in 1870, who visited the emigrants in ships and boarding houses. There was perceived to be a need for a permanent centre. The commission to design a church and minister's house was gained by W. D. Car√∂e, whose father, Anders Kruuse Car√∂e, was the Danish Consul in the city. It was Car√∂e's first independent commission to design a church. Building started in 1883 and was completed the following year, at a cost of ¬£15,000 (). During the 1960s the interior of the church was divided horizontally, when the gallery was removed and a mezzanine floor was added. This was to provide an area for social activity, between the basement and the church itself. At the same time the minister's house was converted from a single-storey building to one with two storeys. Further changes were made in the early 1990s. The lower area was converted into a community meeting room with a kitchen, a caf√©, and other facilities. Architecture =Exterior= The building is constructed in red brick, with a roof of tiles and copper sheathing, and consists of a church with a minister's house attached to the southeast. The entrance front on Park Lane is in seven bays, and is in two and three storeys with basements. The central bay consists of a three-storey stair tower, containing windows with pointed arches, and surmounted by a lead- covered spire. At the midpoint of the spire are lucarnes with wooden bargeboards. To the right of this, the middle of the three bays rises to a greater height, and has a crowstepped gable containing three stepped lancet windows. The windows in the ground floor of these three bays have segmental heads, those in the middle storey have pointed heads, and the two lateral bays contain quatrefoil windows. Behind the gable, and rising to a greater height is an octagonal lantern. Around this are four gablets, and on its roof are four small dormers. The lantern is surmounted by a lead finial and cross. The dormers and gablets are decorated with Scandinavian carvings. To the left of the central tower is a modern entrance porch, and to the left of this is the two-storey minister's house, which contains a crowstepped gable on its left side. =Interior= left The lower floor contains a meeting room, a kitchen, bedrooms, toilet facilities, showers, an office, and a television room. The upper floor, under the central octagonal lantern, comprises the church. Inside the church are five plaster reliefs by Robert Anning Bell. These originally formed a reredos, but are now hung separately in the church. Also in the church are two sculptures by the local sculptor, Arthur Dooley, which depict Christ, and the Madonna.

Triphenylmethane is the basic skeleton of many synthetic dyes called triarylmethane dyes, many of them are pH indicators, and some display fluorescence. A trityl group in organic chemistry is a triphenylmethyl group Ph3C, e.g. triphenylmethyl chloride (trityl chloride) and the triphenylmethyl radical (trityl radical). Preparation Triphenylmethane was first synthesized in 1872 by the German chemist August Kekul√© and his Belgian student Antoine Paul Nicolas Franchimont (1844‚Äì1919) by heating diphenylmercury (Hg(C6H5)2, Quecksilberdiphenyl) with benzal chloride (C6H5CHCl2, Benzylenchlorid).Aug. Kekul√© and A. Franchimont (1872) \\"Ueber das Triphenylmethan\\" (On triphenylmethane), Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft, 5 : 906‚Äì908. Triphenylmethane can be synthesized by Friedel‚ÄìCrafts reaction from benzene and chloroform with aluminium chloride catalyst: :3 C6H6 \\\\+ CHCl3 ‚Üí Ph3CH + 3 HCl Alternatively, benzene may react with carbon tetrachloride using the same catalyst to obtain the triphenylmethyl chloride‚Äìaluminium chloride adduct, which is hydrolyzed with dilute acid: :3 C6H6 \\\\+ CCl4 \\\\+ AlCl3 ‚Üí Ph3CCl*AlCl3 :Ph3CCl*AlCl3 \\\\+ HCl ‚Üí Ph3CH Synthesis from benzylidene chloride, prepared from benzaldehyde and phosphorus pentachloride, is used as well. Acidity The pKa is 33.3. Triphenylmethane is significantly more acidic than most other hydrocarbons because the charge is delocalized over three phenyl rings. Steric effects however prevent all three phenyl rings from achieving coplanarity simultaneously. Consequently diphenylmethane is even more acidic, because in its anion the charge is spread over two phenyl rings at the same time. The trityl anion is red. This colour can be used as an indicator in acid‚Äìbase titrations.

(Ursus arctos crowtheri) have been applied to an extinct population or populations of the Cantabrian brown bear in North Africa. The Cantabrian brown bear likely was introduced to Africa from Spain by the Romans who imported the bears for spectacles. Range and description The Atlas bear was Africa's only native bear that survived into modern times. Once inhabiting the Atlas Mountains and neighbouring areas, from Morocco to Libya, the animal is now thought to be extinct. The Atlas bear was brownish-black in colour and lacked a white mark on the muzzle. The fur on the underparts was reddish-orange. The fur was long. The muzzle and claws were shorter than those of the American black bear, though it was stouter and thicker in body. The Atlas bear was said to have been long and weighed up to . It apparently fed on roots, acorns and nuts. The Atlas bear was said to have been mostly herbivorous, but since most bears today are omnivores, the Atlas bear is believed to have been able to eat meat as well. If it did eat meat, it was believed to eat small mammals as well as carrion while scavenging. Origin Where the Atlas bear actually originated from is unknown; one genetic study was unable to link it to any brown bear, although it had weak but significant mtDNA links to the polar bear. Polar bears appear in Paleolithic cave paintings in Andalucia.. Ecology The Atlas bear's ecology is presumed to be similar to that of the other brown bears. Sympatric predators included the Barbary leopard and Barbary lion. Extinction The decline of the Atlas bear can be partly attributed to the Roman Empire; as the empire expanded into North Africa, the Romans intensely hunted and captured the Atlas bear and many other animals and used them as sport for many of their games. This went on for centuries, during which time thousands of bears were used in the arenas to fight against gladiators, lions, tigers and other animals. They were cruelly treated, often starved and malnourished to increase their desperation, and hence their aggression, within the arena.Ortega, Joseph J. \\"The Atlas Bear.\\" PlanetEarthScience. Web. 24 October 2014. . Thousands of these bears were also hunted for sport, venatio games, or execution of criminals ad bestias.Strauss, Bob. \\"Atlas Bear.\\" About Education. 1 January 2014. Web. 22 Oct. 2014 The Atlas bear became extinct shortly after modern firearms were developed. Over- hunting may have contributed to their decline. Pressure from zoo collectors sealed their fate, with the animals being taken away from one another and unable to reproduce and flourish. The Atlas bear finally became extinct in the late 19th century; the last one recorded to be killed by hunters was in 1870 in the Tetouan Mountains in northern Morocco. Human activity can definitely be said to have played a large role in causing the extinction of the Atlas bear.The Great Bear Almanac. Guilford, CT, 1993, pg. 281. References * * Day, David (1981).

It includes an interactive geometry editor, ray tracing support for graphics rendering and geometric analysis, computer network distributed framebuffer support, scripting, image-processing and signal- processing tools. The entire package is distributed in source code and binary form. Although BRL-CAD can be used for a variety of engineering and graphics applications, the package's primary purpose continues to be the support of ballistic and electromagnetic analyses. In keeping with the Unix philosophy of developing independent tools to perform single, specific tasks and then linking the tools together in a package, BRL-CAD is basically a collection of libraries, tools, and utilities that work together to create, raytrace, and interrogate geometry and manipulate files and data. In contrast to many other 3D modelling applications, BRL-CAD primarily uses CSG rather than boundary representation. This means BRL-CAD can \\"study physical phenomena such as ballistic penetration and thermal, radiative, neutron, and other types of transport\\". It does also support boundary representation. The BRL-CAD libraries are designed primarily for the geometric modeler who also wants to tinker with software and design custom tools. Each library is designed for a specific purpose: creating, editing, and ray tracing geometry, and image handling. The application side of BRL-CAD also offers a number of tools and utilities that are primarily concerned with geometric conversion, interrogation, image format conversion, and command-line-oriented image manipulation. BRL-CAD data flow structure History Lead developer Mike Muuss works on the XM-1 tank in BRL‚ÄëCAD on a PDP‚Äë11/70 computer system, circa 1980. In 1979, the U.S. Army Ballistic Research Laboratory (BRL) ‚Äì now the United States Army Research Laboratory ‚Äì expressed a need for tools that could assist with the computer simulation and engineering analysis of combat vehicle systems and environments. When no CAD package was found to be adequate for this purpose, BRL software developers ‚Äì led by Mike Muuss ‚Äì began assembling a suite of utilities capable of interactively displaying, editing, and interrogating geometric models. This suite became known as BRL-CAD. Development on BRL-CAD as a package subsequently began in 1983; the first public release was made in 1984. BRL-CAD became an open-source project in December 2004. The BRL-CAD source code repository is the oldest known public version-controlled codebase in the world that's still under active development, dating back to 1983-12-16 00:10:31 UTC.

Early life Crawshaw was born in Salford, the son of Percy Crawshaw and Beatrice (n√©e Barrett). He attended Pendleton Grammar School, before leaving to train as an engineer at the age of 16. Prior to World War II he had been a theological student, but soon after its outbreak he enlisted in the Royal Artillery and Parachute Regiment. Upon demobilisation he matriculated as an undergraduate at Pembroke College, Cambridge, taking a special two-year 'war degree'. He then studied at the University of London for a Bachelor of Laws (LLB) degree, and took his pupillage at the Inner Temple. In 1948 he was called to the bar, serving on the Northern Circuit. Politics Crawshaw became active in Liverpool politics after the war, representing the Dingle ward on Liverpool Borough Council from 1948. His council ward was very safe for the Labour Party, although the constituency that it was situated in ‚Äì Liverpool Toxteth ‚Äì was a marginal seat for the Conservatives from its creation in 1950. He campaigned for issues such as better standard of council housing and state schools. Crawshaw was elected as MP for Liverpool Toxteth in 1964, beating the sitting Conservative Reginald Bevins by 2,784 votes. In parliament he was a strong supporter of the Territorial Army, and on one occasion voted against the annual Defence Estimates because they failed to make a large enough provision for it. He was reported to have been a very diligent MP, who called on constituents' homes in several streets each week, often to the surprise of the residents. In March 1981 Crawshaw was one of the initial group of 13 Labour MPs who founded the SDP. Unlike the other defectors, his participation was considered \\"something of a surprise to journalists.\\"Ivor Crewe and Anthony King, SDP: The Birth, Life and Death of the Social Democratic Party (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995), p. 93. After Liverpool Toxteth was abolished he stood in 1983 for the new constituency of Liverpool Broadgreen, which did not contain any part of his former seat. Notionally a safe Labour constituency, Crawshaw's candidacy was further complicated by the existence of an Independent Liberal on the ballot. He received 5,169 votes (11.24%), but was beaten into last place. Crawshaw was created a life peer as Baron Crawshaw of Aintree, of Salford in the County of Greater Manchester on 17 May 1985. Personal life Crawshaw married Audrey Lima in 1960; they had no children. He lived for most of his life in Aintree, a very safe Conservative area in the Ormskirk constituency. During his time in Parliament he lived in the Chelsea area of London with fellow MP James Dunn.

Holland is best remembered for his time with the bands Trapeze from 1969 to 1979 and Judas Priest from 1979 to 1989. Early life At the age of six Holland began piano lessons, but soon developed a \\"mania for the drums\\" in his own words and begged his parents to let him have a set. After his first appearance as a stand-in for a local band, Holland realised he wanted to be a musician. When he was 14 years old, he supplemented his pocket money by playing with another local band called The Drumbeats, and selling furniture and carpets. As a youngster, Holland listened to traditional jazz. He cited his first rock influence as Johnny Kidd and the Pirates. Later, he became interested in funk music in the vein of Booker T & the MG's, the blues rock of Free and progressive‚Äìpsychedelic music of Traffic. Career =Early bands= In early 1965 he was with Northampton band Dorian Gray. Later that year Holland was persuaded to leave and join The Liberators who had recording and management contracts ready within a few weeks to evolve into Pinkerton's Assorted Colours, a pop band that put autoharp to good use, taking after The Loving Spoonful. In 1966 a single, \\"Mirror Mirror\\" (released 15 January 1966 on Decca, produced by future The Moody Blues producer Tony Clarke), peaked at No. 8 in the UK Singles Chart. =Finders Keepers= Holland stayed with the band until August 1968, when he joined Finders Keepers, a pop cover outfit. However, Holland continued studio session work. He did not play on a 1969 No. 5 hit single \\"Smile a Little Smile for Me\\" released by the band that used to be Pinkerton's Assorted Colours under the name of The Flying Machine. Finders Keepers, who were soon joined by Mel Galley (guitar) and Glenn Hughes (bass), recorded several singles, with some of the songs now available on various compilations. Soon afterwards the threesome joined forces with vocalist and winds player John Jones and multi- instrumentalist Terry Rowley of The Montanas fame to form a quintet called Trapeze (the band name was Terry Rowley's idea). =Trapeze= Trapeze appeared in the British TV show Colour Me Pop and soon was swamped with offers of recording contracts, including one from The Beatles' Apple. Trapeze, however, settled for the newly formed Threshold label, belonging to The Moody Blues members. The band would soon open for The Moodies and other well-known acts. On Threshold, the band released three records, the debut as a quintet and the rest as a power trio. Trapeze were gaining momentum at the time, especially in the southern United States, but lost a major contributor as Glenn Hughes decided to leave the band and join Deep Purple for the recording of their Burn album. Mel Galley and Dave Holland added a bass player and a second guitarist. Dave Holland and Mel Galley also toured as part of John Lodge (musician) ‚Äì Justin Hayward (of The Moody Blues fame) band The Blue Jays (Blue Jays (album)). In 1978 Trapeze recorded their last studio LP, Running/Hold On. Earlier on, both Galley and Holland lent a hand in the recording of Glenn Hughes' first solo album, Play Me Out, offering a unique blend of psychedelic jazz funk. Holland was assisted by Mark Nauseef on percussion. In 1979 and 1980, Holland recorded some drum parts for Justin Hayward's solo albums, Songwriter and Night Flight. =Judas Priest= Holland left Trapeze and joined Judas Priest in August 1979. He played drums on many of Judas Priest's platinum albums, such as British Steel, Screaming for Vengeance, Defenders of the Faith, Turbo and Ram It Down. During the 1980s, Holland also collaborated with guitarist Robin George, as part of his band Life and on George's solo project, Dangerous Music. In 1989, personal problems (health and family issues) and musical differences forced Holland to leave Judas Priest. He was replaced by original Saints Or Sinners drummer Scott Travis, who had also previously played in the band Racer X. =Later career= Throughout the 1990s, besides touring with briefly reformed Trapeze and filling in for various bands like The Screaming Jets during their European tours, at the band's official site Holland gave drum clinics and private lessons, managed and produced bands such as UK band The Love Garden and the Swedish \\"teen funk trio\\" Shutlanger Sam (fronted by Kim Fransson who later had a solo career where he collaborated with among others hit songwriters Andreas Carlsson and Desmond Child) whom Holland introduced in person at a show with his former Trapeze bandmate Glenn Hughes in V√§nersborg 1996, and played on various recordings of his former mates. In 1996, he participated in sessions that involved Glenn Hughes, Tony Iommi of Black Sabbath fame, and keyboardist Don Airey. In 1998, a collaboration with Al Atkins, Judas Priest's original singer, was released, featuring a few covers of early Priest songs that Holland did not originally play on. Judas Priest with Atkins at the helm had supported Trapeze in 1971. Imprisonment In 2004, Holland was arrested and later found guilty by a jury at Northampton Crown Court of one count of attempted rape and five counts of indecent assault against a 17-year-old male with learning difficulties. The offences occurred at Holland's rural English home in 2002 against a boy to whom he had been hired to give drum lessons. The jury also found a co-accused, 22-year-old Spiros Laouitaris, not guilty of four counts of indecent assault. Following the verdict, Judge Charles Wide told the court that Holland had \\"deliberately and calculatedly planned a strategy to abuse a boy who he knew was exceptionally vulnerable\\". Holland had steadfastly denied all charges, telling the court \\"There might have been the odd hug or something like that. I know it is politically incorrect nowadays, but kids like to be shown a bit of affection.\\" It was revealed at trial that the victim had occasionally spent the night at Holland's house while taking lessons, and his parents learned of what Holland was doing when they received a letter from their son detailing the sexual abuse. He was sentenced to eight years in prison. In an interview during the criminal proceedings, Holland revealed publicly for the first time that he was bisexual. Holland had recently completed some recording sessions with guitarist Tony Iommi. When word of his arrest became public, Iommi had Holland's drum tracks removed and re-recorded by Jimmy Copley, not wanting any association with a convicted sex offender. Holland was scheduled for release from prison in 2012 and had reportedly served his full sentence that year. In late 2006, Holland told author Neil Daniels in a letter from prison that he was in the process of writing his autobiography. Holland also stated his intent to appeal his conviction, saying \\"I was convicted of a crime that I didn't commit, and like so many others in similar situations to the one in which I find myself, an offense that never even existed in the first place...\\". He also railed against the legal system itself, telling Daniels \\"There is absolutely no difference whatsoever between the criteria that is permitted to be applied in sex offenses now and that which was applied in cases of witchcraft in the 17th century.\\" Death On 18 January 2018 it was announced that Holland had died a few days previously. No cause of death was provided. On 22 January 2018, Spanish newspaper El Progreso reported that Holland had died on 16 January at Hospital Universitario Lucus Augusti in Lugo, Spain. Holland had been living in the nearby town of A Fonsagrada. The newspaper reported that Holland's remains had been cremated. However, a doctor had said that the death was due to lung cancer.

He is a former American political consultant, who has worked on numerous Democratic campaigns, including as senior advisor to the Kerry- Edwards campaign in 2004 and to the Gore-Lieberman campaign in 2000. Shrum wrote the famous speech Ted Kennedy gave at the 1980 Democratic National Convention conceding to and supporting President Jimmy Carter.American Rhetoric In spite of his involvement with many losing campaigns, he has been described as \\"the most sought-after consultant in the Democratic Party.\\" Shrum served as speechwriter to New York Mayor John V. Lindsay from 1970 to 1971, speechwriter to Senator George McGovern's 1972 Presidential campaign and speechwriter and press secretary to Senator Edward M. Kennedy from 1980 to 1984 and political consultant until 2009. Shrum's book, No Excuses: Concessions of a Serial Campaigner, was published in June 2007 by Simon and Schuster. Early life Shrum was born in Connellsville, Pennsylvania on July 21, 1943,https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1987/07/22/personalities/d10ca853-ebb8-48db-b12a-10af572b5f38/ the son of Cecilia (Welsh) and Clarence Shrum. His father was a tool-and-die maker and his maternal grandfather was a member of the Pennsylvania State Senate.https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/27/nyregion/27profile.html?_r=0 His mother was from an Irish immigrant family. Shrum was raised in Los Angeles. He is a graduate of Loyola High School of Los Angeles and Georgetown University (where he was named the outstanding debater at the 1965 national policy debate championship, the National Debate Tournament). He later received a J.D. degree from Harvard Law School. Political career =Speechwriter= Shrum began his political career as a speechwriter in 1970, first for Republican New York City Mayor John Lindsay, and then for United States Senators Edmund Muskie and Ted Kennedy. Shrum was also a speechwriter for 1972 Democratic Party presidential nominee George McGovern as well as for 1976 Democratic Party presidential nominee Jimmy Carter. Shrum worked for Governor Carter for a total of ten days, and quit the night Carter won the Pennsylvania Primary. In his resignation letter to Carter, Shrum wrote \\"I am not sure what you believe in, other than yourself.\\" Shrum later worked for Ted Kennedy and wrote the famous speech Kennedy gave at the 1980 Democratic National Convention. After Kennedy's unsuccessful bid for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination in 1980, Shrum returned to work in his Senate office as his press secretary until 1984, after which he became director of Kennedy's Fund for a Democratic Majority Political Action Committee until 1985. =Political consultant= Non-Presidential campaigns In 1986, Shrum began work as a political consultant, designing campaign advertising and message strategy for Democratic candidates at the presidential, congressional, and gubernatorial levels, partnering with Pat Caddell and David Doak. Their first client was Jerry Baliles, who was running to succeed Chuck Robb as governor of Virginia. The partnership with Pat Caddell dissolved in 1986, and Doak and Shrum continued to work together through a new firm for nine years. During their partnership, they served as strategic consultants and ad-makers for the successful campaigns of Bob Casey for Governor of Pennsylvania, Alan Cranston for reelection to the Senate in California, and Barbara Mikulski for Senate in Maryland. Mikulski would go on to become the first woman who was elected to the Senate who did not have a husband or father who served in high political office. The firm continued to grow, acquiring new partners such as Peter Harris, Michelle Carrier, and Mike Donilon, while political consultants Joe Trippi and Steve McMahon began their media consulting careers at the firm. Doak, Shrum, and Associates worked on the following campaigns, among others: * The reelection of United States Senator Alan Cranston in 1986 * Ted Kennedy's United States Senate campaign in 1988 * David Dinkins for mayor of New York in 1989 * The reelection of United States Senator Paul Simon * David Walters for Governor of Oklahoma * Zell Miller for Governor of Georgia * Richard Gephardt for election to Congress and Presidential bid * The reelection of Denver mayor Federico Pe√±a * Art Agnos for mayor of San Francisco * Tom Bradley for mayor of Los Angeles * Alex Pinellas for mayor of Miami-Dade County * The reelection of Chicago mayor Harold Washington * The reelection of Philadelphia mayor Wilson Goode * John D.

He worked for the Dick Gephardt campaign during the 1988 Democratic primaries, including Gephardt's surprise victory in the Iowa caucus, but after Gephardt's defeat, Shrum helped Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis in preparing for his debates against Vice President George Bush. Dukakis lost the general election. In 1992, Shrum worked for Nebraska Senator Bob Kerrey, who was defeated for the nomination by Bill Clinton. In 2000, Shrum helped Al Gore beat back a primary challenge from former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley, and win the Democratic nomination. Gore won the popular vote in the November presidential election versus George W. Bush, but lost the electoral vote. In 2004, Shrum worked on John Kerry's campaign, guiding him to a victory in the crucial Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, and soon after, the Democratic presidential nomination, only for Kerry to be defeated in the general election by George W. Bush. Critics often point out Shrum's long losing streak, since he has yet to claim victory for any of his candidates in eight presidential elections.Washington Post 9 September 2004 Foreign campaigns Shrum has also consulted on a number of foreign campaigns, including as a strategic advisor for the British Labour Party elections from 1989 to 2005, Ehud Barak's campaign for Israeli prime minister against Benjamin Netanyahu in 1999 and 2001, the Irish Republican Party Fianna F√°il in the 1997 and 2002 national elections, and the successful Bolivian presidential campaigns of Gonzalo S√°nchez de Lozada in 1993 and 2002. Journalism Shrum was a columnist for The Week magazine's website along with his conservative counterpart, David Frum. As a journalist, Shrum‚Äôs work appeared in New York Magazine, Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, and The New Republic, among other publications. He was a columnist for the on-line magazine Slate. Academic career Shrum has been a Senior Fellow at New York University's Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, where he taught a class on domestic policy formation and analysis.

From 1967, Beaver collaborated with Bernie Krause as the recording duo Beaver & Krause. Early life and career Born in Columbiana, Ohio, Paul Beaver studied classical music and learned the organ, before acquiring technical knowledge of electronics while serving in the US Navy in World War II. After the war, he played the organ at the Angelus Temple in Los Angeles, made music and special effects for movies such as The Magnetic Monster (1953), and became a technical consultant to the Hammond Organ Company. He also became a successful session musician, had his own recording studio, and rented out musical instruments from his collection. Work with Bernie Krause Beaver was the electronic half of a 1965 experimental free- form album for Dunhill Records with studio drummer Hal Blaine called \\"Psychedelic Percussion\\". In 1966, he was approached by Jac Holzman of Elektra Records, who wished to make an album that used electronic music in a format that would appeal to the emerging hippie culture. Holzman introduced Beaver to Bernie Krause, another synthesizer enthusiast. They decided to pool their savings to buy a Moog synthesizer, and agreed to work together on the project, alongside composer and arranger Mort Garson. The result was the album The Zodiac: Cosmic Sounds. They continued to work together in a project to master the new Moog synthesizer and present it as a viable instrument for film and recording work. From 1967, Beaver collaborated with Krause as the recording duo Beaver & Krause. They were one of the first groups to record pop- commercial electronic music, which later became known as electronica. Their double album The Nonesuch Guide to Electronic Music, issued on Jac Holzman's Nonesuch record label, was a landmark work, introducing the public to the full range of individual sounds that the Moog could make, and in great detail. As Robert Moog's sales representatives on the U.S. West Coast, they attracted limited industry interest until the Monterey Pop Festival in June 1967, when musicians and artists' representatives visited their stall and began placing orders for Moogs. Over the next two years, Beaver played a key role in popularizing the instrument in rock music and in film and television. During that time, he undertook a steady stream of session work for their Moog customers and led workshops attended by film composers and session keyboardists. Among his many appearances on recordings by pop and rock acts, Beaver played the Moog on \\"Star Collector\\", the final song on The Monkees' Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones Ltd. album, released in November 1967, and on The Byrds' \\"Goin' Back\\", from their 1968 album The Notorious Byrd Brothers. He also contributed to the Elektra Records 1966 release The Zodiac: Cosmic Sounds, an album that is widely recognised as the first recording in the genre to feature the Moog synthesizer. Beaver was a friend and associate of George Martin, and he aided in the production of The Beatles' Magical Mystery Tour album, supplying the first-generation Hammond B3 organ which provided the strange sound effect at the end of \\"Blue Jay Way\\" (accomplished by switching the motorized 'tone wheel' off and on). During this time he and musician- engineer Phil Davis built a custom polyphonic Moog modular synthesizer, based on the Moog Apollo prototype, for Keith Emerson of Emerson, Lake & Palmer that was one of the first electronic instruments to have programmable preset sounds, controlled by an auxiliary 8-bit computer which used a TV monitor. In addition, Beaver, together with associates Phil Davis and Dan Wyman, worked alongside composer Alexander Courage, composing and performing incidental ambient music (\\"The Cage\\" and others) and creating several sound effects for the original Star Trek television series. Beaver & Krause continued releasing electronic albums, first for Mercury Records' spin-off label, Limelight, with their album Ragnarok (1968), then three albums for Warner Bros. Records: In a Wild Sanctuary (1970), Gandharva (1971), and All Good Men (1972). Combining the Moog with acoustic instruments, these albums were effectively the beginning of the \\"New Age\\" musical movement. The ending of the track \\"Spaced\\", from the Wild Sanctuary album, which features two synthesizers simultaneously gliding up and down to merge into a final single chord, was later re-performed to become the musical soundtrack for the original THX logo used in movie theatres. With Ruth White, Beaver established the Electronic Music Association in the 1970s. Personal life and death Beaver was a Scientologist, a right- wing Republican, unmarried, and a bisexual proponent of sexual liberation. His health began to deteriorate in 1973.

He also served as Mayor of Jacksonville, Florida, from 1917 to 1923. Born in Plainfield in Marion County, Florida, Martin and his family moved to Jacksonville in 1899. Despite only about four years of formal education, he studied law and was admitted to the Florida Bar in 1914. Three years later, Martin ran for Mayor of Jacksonville and easily defeated incumbent J. E. T. Bowden, becoming the city's youngest mayor at age 32. He was easily re-elected twice in landslide victories and served three consecutive terms. Martin declined to seek a fourth term in 1923 and instead ran for Governor of Florida in 1924. In the Democratic Party primary, he defeated four other candidates, including former Governor Sidney Johnston Catts. With the Democratic primary then being tantamount to election, Martin won the general election with nearly 83% of the vote against Republican William R. O'Neal. During his tenure, tourism, land speculation, and road development increased, despite the collapse of the land boom in the mid-1920s. The contemporaneous Constitution of Florida barred Martin from seeking a second consecutive term in 1928. He unsuccessfully ran for United States Senator in 1928 and Governor of Florida again in 1932. Martin died on February 22, 1958, about a month after having a severe heart attack. Early life Martin was born in Plainfield in Marion County, Florida, one of five children born to John M. Martin and Willie Owens Martin. During his childhood, Martin worked on his father's plantation and received a country school education, but estimated that he had only about four years of formal education. Martin and his family moved to Jacksonville in 1899. He married Lottie Pepper in 1907. The couple had one child, John Wellborn Martin, Jr., but he died during infancy. Martin had studied law since his family moved to Jacksonville and passed the Florida Bar exam in 1914, before establishing a law career. Prior to seeking public office, Martin toured the state and gave a number of speeches in favor of President Woodrow Wilson's policies. Mayor of Jacksonville and Governor of Florida In 1917, he was elected Mayor of Jacksonville at age 32, becoming the youngest mayor in the city's history. Martin easily defeated incumbent J. E. T. Bowden by a vote of 2,890 to 2,056. He would easily be re-elected twice, winning 14 out of 15 of the city's wards in his third and final campaign for the office. During his tenure as Mayor of Jacksonville, Martin supported a progressive program of public improvements and sought reform for the fire and police departments. Toward the end of his third term as Mayor of Jacksonville, Martin announced he would not seek re-election and instead declared his candidacy for 1924 Florida gubernatorial election. In the Democratic Party on June 3, Martin defeated former Governor Sidney Johnston Catts, Frank E. Jennings, Worth W. Trammell (brother of Senator and former Governor Park Trammell), and Charles H. Spencer. There were 55,715 votes for Martin, 43,230 votes for Catts, 37,962 votes for Jennings, 8,381 votes for Trammell, and 1,408 votes for Spencer. Because no candidate received a majority, the second choice of Jennings, Trammell, and Spencer voters were added to the totals for Martin and Catts. Martin won with 73,054 votes versus 49,297 votes for Catts. With the Democratic primary then being tantamount to election, Martin won the general election. He defeated Republican William R. O'Neal by a vote of 84,181 to 17,499, a margin of 65.58%. Martin was inaugurated on January 6, 1925, and served until January 8, 1929. On May 30, 1925, the Florida Legislature established Martin County ‚Äì named after Governor Martin while he was in office ‚Äì created from about of land from southern St. Lucie County and northern Palm Beach County; the city of Stuart was designated the county seat. Indian River County was established on the same day. Later in 1925, the state's newest counties were established ‚Äì Gulf and Gilchrist. During his tenure, tourism and land speculation purchases increased, road and highway developments were advanced, and an industrial plant for physically disabled prisoners was created. Martin also advocated for state-funded public schools and for granting free schoolbooks to all students through sixth grade. Despite the growth, Martin also presided over the collapse of the Florida land boom of the 1920s. In a failed attempt to fight bad publicity about real estate scams, Martin and a delegation went to the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, owned by T. Coleman du Pont (an investor in Addison Mizner's projects), in New York City and held a seminar called \\"The Truth About Florida\\". Two of the worst hurricanes in the history of the state ‚Äì the 1926 Miami and 1928 Okeechobee hurricanes ‚Äì also occurred during Martin's tenure. The former devastated the areas in the vicinity of Miami and towns along the western shores of Lake Okeechobee, such as Clewiston and Moore Haven, leaving at least 372 fatalities and up to $125 million (1926 USD) in damage. The hurricane also resulted in further discussion between Martin and officials across the state about drainage projects around Lake Okeechobee. However, disputes about financing the projects left many residents along the lake vulnerable to flooding. After wreaking havoc in coastal Palm Beach County, the 1928 hurricane caused Lake Okeechobee to breach the then- mud dikes at its southeastern shores, inundating areas with as much as of water. The cities of Belle Glade, Chosen, Miami Locks (today Lake Harbor), Pahokee, and South Bay were devastated, with the loss of more than 2,500 lives. After personally assessing the damage with Florida Attorney General Fred Henry Davis, chief engineer Fred C. Elliott, and Florida Adjutant General Vivian B. Collins, Martin telegraphed all mayors of Florida cities to send aid to the victims. Discussion about drainage and dikes along Lake Okeechobee re-commenced, but the projects did not begin until after the passage of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1930, after Martin left office. Post-governorship The Florida Constitution at the time barred a governor from serving two consecutive terms, with Martin being succeeded by Doyle E. Carlton in January 1929. Martin decided to run for United States Senator in 1928. However, he was defeated by incumbent Park Trammell in the Democratic primary, losing by a vote of 138,534 to 100,454. Martin made his final run for political office in 1932, seeking the governorship of Florida again. He received the most votes in a seven candidate field that included state's attorney David Sholtz and former Governor Cary A. Hardee. However, he garnered only 24.19% of the vote, well short of a majority. Martin thus advanced to a run-off election against Sholtz, but was defeated by a wide margin of 62.8%‚Äî37.2%. After retiring from politics, Martin built his own house in Tallahassee in 1933, which has been listed as a National Historic Place since 1986. After living at the property for about seven or eight years, Martin sold the house to local developers in 1941. He returned to Jacksonville, where he continued to practice law and became an investment broker. Martin was appointed a co-trustee of the Florida East Coast Railway, along with former Senator Scott Loftin. Upon Loftin's death in 1953, Martin became the sole trustee. On February 22, 1958, Martin died of a heart attack at East Coast Hospital in St. Augustine. He was buried at Evergreen Cemetery in Jacksonville.

A caricature portrays him as Lohengrin. Escapism is mental diversion from unpleasant or boring aspects of daily life, typically through activities involving imagination or entertainment. Escapism may be used to occupy one's self away from persistent feelings of depression or general sadness. Perceptions Entire industries have sprung up to foster a growing tendency of people to remove themselves from the rigors of daily life ‚Äì especially into the digital world.G. Kainer, Grace and the Great Controversy (2010) p. 35 Many activities that are normal parts of a healthy existence (e.g., eating, sleeping, exercise, sexual activity) can also become avenues of escapism when taken to extremes or out of proper context; and as a result the word \\"escapism\\" often carries a negative connotation, suggesting that escapists are unhappy, with an inability or unwillingness to connect meaningfully with the world and to take necessary action.D. Baggett et al, C. S. Lewis as Philosopher (2009) p. 260 Indeed, the Oxford English Dictionary defined escapism as \\"The tendency to seek, or the practice of seeking, distraction from what normally has to be endured\\".Quoted in T. A. Shipley, The Road to Middle-Earth (1992) p. 285 However, many challenge the idea that escapism is fundamentally and exclusively negative. C. S. Lewis was fond of humorously remarking that the usual enemies of escape were jailers;G. Kainer, Grace and the Great Controversy (2010) p. 34 and considered that used in moderation escapism could serve both to refresh and to expand the imaginative powers.D. Baggett et al, C. S. Lewis as Philosopher (2009) p. 260 Similarly J. R. R. Tolkien argued for escapism in fantasy literature as the creative expression of reality within a secondary (imaginative) world, (but also emphasised that they required an element of horror in them, if they were not to be 'mere escapism').Konzack, Lars. 2018. Escapism. In: Wolf (ed.) The Routledge Companion to Imaginary Worlds. Routledge. pp. 246-55.T. F. Nicolay, Tolkien and the Modernists (2014) p. 79 and p. 66 Terry Pratchett considered that the twentieth century had seen the development over time of a more positive view of escapist literature.Terry Pratchett & Stephen Briggs, The Discworld Companion (2012) p. 329 Apart from literature, music and video games have been seen and valued as artistic media of escape, too.Andreas Dorschel, Der Welt abhanden kommen. √úber musikalischen Eskapismus. In: Merkur 66 (2012), no. 2, pp. 135‚Äì142 Psychological escapes Freud considers a quota of escapist fantasy a necessary element in the life of humans: \\"[T]hey cannot subsist on the scanty satisfaction they can extort from reality. 'We simply cannot do without auxiliary constructions', Theodor Fontane once said\\".S, Freud, Introductory lectures on Psychoanalysis (PFL1) p. 419 His followers saw rest and wish fulfilment (in small measures) as useful tools in adjusting to traumatic upset;Otto Fenichel, The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis (1946), p. 554 while later psychologists have highlighted the role of vicarious distractions in shifting unwanted moods, especially anger and sadness.D. Goleman, Emotional Intelligence (1996) p. 73 However, if permanent residence is taken up in some such psychic retreats, the results will often be negative and even pathological.R. Britton, Belief and Imagination (2003) p. 119 Drugs cause some forms of escapism which can occur when certain mind-altering drugs are taken which make the participant forget the reality of where they are or what they are meant to be doing. Escapist societies Some social critics warn of attempts by the powers that control society to provide means of escapism instead of bettering the condition of the people ‚Äì what Juvenal called ‚Äúbread and the games‚Äù.Juvenal, The Sixteen Satires (1982) p. 207 Escapist societies appear often in literature. The Time Machine depicts the Eloi, a lackadaisical, insouciant race of the future, and the horror of their happy lifestyle beliefs. The novel subtly criticizes capitalism, or at least classism, as a means of escape. Escapist societies are common in dystopian novels; for example, in the Fahrenheit 451 society, television and \\"seashell radios\\" are used to escape a life with strict regulations and the threat of a forthcoming war. In science fiction media escapism is often depicted as an extension of social evolution, as society becomes detached from physical reality and processing into a virtual one, examples include the virtual world of Oz in the 2009 Japanese animated science fiction film Summer Wars and the game \\"Society\\" in the 2009 American science fiction film Gamer, a play on the real-life MMO game Second Life. Other escapist societies in literature include The Reality Bug by D. J. McHale, where an entire civilization leaves their world in ruin while they 'jump' into their perfect realities. The aim of the anti-hero becomes a quest to make their realities seemingly less perfect to regain control over their dying planet. Social philosopher Ernst Bloch wrote that utopias and images of fulfillment, however regressive they might be, also included an impetus for a radical social change. According to Bloch, social justice could not be realized without seeing things fundamentally differently. Something that is mere \\"daydreaming\\" or \\"escapism\\" from the viewpoint of a technological-rational society might be a seed for a new and more humane social order, as it can be seen as an \\"immature, but honest substitute for revolution\\". Escape scale The Norwegian psychologist Frode Stenseng has presented a dualistic model of escapism in relation to different types of activity engagements. He discusses the paradox that the flow state (Csikszentmihalyi) resembles psychological states obtainable through actions such as drug abuse, sexual masochism, and suicide ideation (Baumeister). Accordingly, he deduces that the state of escape can have both positive and negative meanings and outcomes. Stenseng argues that there exist two forms of escapism with different affective outcomes dependent on the motivational focus that lies behind the immersion in the activity. Escapism in the form of self- suppression stems from motives to run away from unpleasant thoughts, self- perceptions, and emotions, whereas self-expansion stems from motives to gain positive experiences through the activity and to discover new aspects of self. Stenseng has developed the \\"escape scale\\" to measure self-suppression and self-expansion in people's favorite activities, such as sports, arts, and gaming. Empirical investigations of the model have shown that: * the two dimensions are distinctively different with regard to affective outcomes * some individuals are more prone to engage through one type of escapism * situational levels of well-being affect the type of escapism that becomes dominant at a specific time During the Great Depression Alan Brinkley, author of Culture and Politics in the Great Depression, presents how escapism became the new trend for dealing with the hardships created by the stock market crash in 1929: magazines, radio and movies, all were aimed to help people mentally escape from the mass poverty and economic downturn. Life magazine, which became hugely popular during the 1930s, was said to have pictures that give \\"no indication that there was such a thing as depression; most of the pictures are of bathing beauties and ship launchings and building projects and sports heroes ‚Äì of almost anything but poverty and unemployment‚Äù. Famous director Preston Sturges aimed to validate this notion by creating a film called Sullivan's Travels. The film ends with a group of poor destitute men in jail watching a comedic Mickey Mouse cartoon that ultimately lifts their spirits. Sturges aims to point out how \\"foolish and vain and self- indulgent\\" it would be to make a film about suffering. Therefore, movies of the time more often than not focused on comedic plot lines that distanced people emotionally from the horrors that were occurring all around them. These films \\"consciously, deliberately set out to divert people from their problems\\", but it also diverted them from the problems of those around them.Brinkley, Alan.

It is one of the three main fluorides of silver, the others being silver subfluoride and silver(II) fluoride. AgF has relatively few niche applications; it has been employed as a fluorination and desilylation reagent in organic synthesis and in aqueous solution as a topical caries treatment in dentistry. The hydrates of AgF present as colourless, while pure anhydrous samples are yellow.  Preparation  High-purity silver(I) fluoride can be produced by the heating of silver carbonate to 310 ¬∞C under a hydrogen fluoride environment, in a platinum tube: :Ag2CO3 \\\\+ 2 HF ‚Üí 2 AgF + H2O + CO2 Laboratory routes to the compound typically avoid the use of gaseous hydrogen fluoride. One method is the thermal decomposition of silver tetrafluoroborate: :AgBF4 ‚Üí AgF + BF3 In an alternative route, silver(I) oxide is dissolved in concentrated aqueous hydrofluoric acid, and the silver fluoride is precipitated out of the resulting solution by acetone. :Ag2O + 2 HF ‚Üí 2 AgF + H2O  Properties  = Structure= The structure of AgF has been determined by X-ray diffraction. At ambient temperature and pressure, silver(I) fluoride exists as the polymorph AgF-I, which adopts a cubic crystal system with space group Fmm in the Hermann‚ÄìMauguin notation. The rock salt structure is adopted by the other silver monohalides. The lattice parameter is 4.936(1) √Ö, significantly lower than those of AgCl and AgBr. Neutron and X-ray diffraction studies have further shown that at 2.70(2) GPa, a structural transition occurs to a second polymorph (AgF-II) with the caesium chloride structure, and lattice parameter 2.945 √Ö. The associated decrease in volume is approximately ten percent. A third polymorph, AgF-III, forms on reducing the pressure to 2.59(2) GPa, and has an inverse nickel arsenide structure. The lattice parameters are a = 3.244(2) √Ö and c = 6.24(1) √Ö; the rock salt structure is regained only on reduction of the pressure to 0.9(1) GPa. Non-stochiometric behaviour is exhibited by all three polymorphs under extreme pressures. = Spectroscopy = Silver(I) fluoride exhibits unusual optical properties. Simple electronic band theory predicts that the fundamental exciton absorption for AgF would lie higher than that of AgCl (5.10 eV) and would correspond to a transition from an anionic valence band as for the other silver halides. Experimentally, the fundamental exciton for AgF lies at 4.63 eV. This discrepancy can be explained by positing transition from a valence band with largely silver 4d-orbital character. The high frequency refractive index is 1.73(2). = Photosensitivity = In contrast with the other silver halides, anhydrous silver(I) fluoride is not appreciably photosensitive, although the dihydrate is. With this and the material's solubility in water considered, it is unsurprising that it has found little application in photography but may have been one of the salts used by Levi Hill in his \\"heliochromy\\", although a US patent for an experimental AgF-based method was granted in 1970. = Solubility = Unlike the other silver halides, AgF is highly soluble in water (1800 g/L), and it even has some solubility in acetonitrile. It is also unique among silver(I) compounds and the silver halides in that it forms the hydrates AgF¬∑(H2O)2 and AgF¬∑(H2O)4 on precipitation from aqueous solution. Like the alkali metal fluorides, it dissolves in hydrogen fluoride to give a conducting solution.  Applications  = Organic synthesis = Silver(I) fluoride finds application in organofluorine chemistry for addition of fluoride across multiple bonds. For example, AgF adds to perfluoroalkenes in acetonitrile to give perfluoroalkylsilver(I) derivatives. It can also be used as a desulfuration-fluorination reagent on thiourea derived substrates. Due to its high solubility in water and organic solvents, it is a convenient source of fluoride ions, and can be used to fluorinate alkyl halides under mild conditions. An example is given by the following reaction: :300px Another organic synthetic method using silver(I) fluoride is the BINAP-AgF complex catalyzed enantioselective protonation of silyl enol ethers: :300px = Inorganic synthesis = The reaction of silver acetylide with a concentrated solution of silver(I) fluoride results in the formation of a chandelier-like [Ag10]2+ cluster with endohedral acetylenediide. Tetralkylammonium fluorides can be conveniently prepared in the laboratory by the reaction of the tetralkylammonium bromide with an aqueous AgF solution. = Other = It is possible to coat a silicon surface with a uniform silver microlayer (0.1 to 1 Œºm thickness) by passing AgF vapour over it at 60‚Äì800 ¬∞C. The relevant reaction is: :4 AgF + Si ‚Üí 4 Ag + SiF4 Multiple studies have shown silver(I) fluoride to be an effective anti-caries agent, although the mechanism is the subject of current research. Treatment is typically by the \\"atraumatic\\" method, in which 40% by mass aqueous silver(I) fluoride solution is applied to carious leisons, followed by sealing of the dentine with glass ionomer cement. Although the treatment is generally recognised to be safe, fluoride toxicity has been a significant clinical concern in paediatric applications, especially as some commercial preparations have had considerable silver(II) fluoride contamination in the past. Due to the instability of concentrated AgF solutions, silver diamine fluoride (Ag(NH3)2F) is now more commonly used. Preparation is by the addition of ammonia to aqueous silver fluoride solution or by the dissolution of silver fluoride in aqueous ammonia.

Early life Doyle Elam Carlton, the son of Albert and Martha Winfield McEwen Carlton, was born in Wauchula, Florida on July 6, 1885. He was born eighth out of ten children. He received his primary education in Wauchula and, as there was then no local high school, attended Stetson Academy where he served as an editor for the school newspaper and officer of the Phi Kappa Delta Society (later to become Delta Sigma Phi). He subsequently graduated from the Liberal Arts College of Stetson University with an A.B. in 1909. Doyle then attended The University of Chicago where he received an A.B. in 1910. He earned his L.L.B. in 1912 from Columbia University of the city of New York. In 1912, he was admitted to the practice of law in Florida and practiced law in Tampa beginning in that year. On July 30, 1912, in Tampa, Doyle married Nell Ray, daughter of Edward Dennis and Mary Ellen Smith Ray. Early political career His political career began in 1916 when he was elected to the Florida state senate for a two-year term as the State Senator from the 11th District, composed of Hillsborough and Pinellas counties. Governor In the Democratic primary on June 5, 1928 he received 77,569 first choice and 28,471 second choice votes to win in a field of five candidates, who included former Governor Sidney J. Catts. In November 1928, Doyle defeated his Republican opponent, William John Howey, by a margin of 148,455 votes to 95,018 votes. He assumed the office of governor on January 8, 1929. During his term, he faced several financial problems caused by the Great Depression. He had to reduce payrolls and cut many state jobs in an attempt to reduce the state's budget. He also faced other problems, helping the state through them all. The collapse of the state's land boom, a violent hurricane hit the state, a Mediterranean Tephritidae infestation, and the Great Depression began during his term. He left office on January 3, 1933, returning to Tampa, Florida. In 1936 Governor Carlton ran for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senator. Although he was endorsed by the Democratic executive committee and most state newspapers, Charles O. Andrews lined up a powerful bloc of forces opposed to Carlton, and by a margin of 67,387 votes to 62,530 votes defeated Governor Carlton in the primary of August 11, 1936. Personal life On July 30, 1912, Carlton married Nell Ray in Tampa. He died in Tampa in 1972 and was buried at Myrtle Hill Memorial Park in Tampa. They had three children, Martha Katharine Carlton Ward, Mary Ellen Carlton Ott, and Doyle Elam Carlton, Jr., all of whom are deceased. The latter served as a state senator and ran for Governor of Florida in 1960, but was defeated in the Democratic primary run-off election by C. Farris Bryant.

It was a predominant style of the German Baroque era and reached its culmination in the works of J.S. Bach, who wrote 46 (with a 47th unfinished) examples of the form in his Orgelb√ºchlein,Grout, Donald J. & Claude V. Palisca, A History of the Western Music 7th edition, Norton, London, 2006. along with multiple other works of the type in other collections. Function The liturgical function of a chorale prelude in the Baroque period is debated. One possibility is that they were used to introduce the hymn about to be sung by the congregation, usually in a Protestant, and originally in a Lutheran, church. Style Chorale preludes are typically polyphonic settings, with a chorale tune, plainly audible and often ornamented, used as cantus firmus. Accompanying motifs are usually derived from contrapuntal manipulations of the chorale melody. Notable composers of chorale preludes during the Baroque period include Dieterich Buxtehude, Johann Pachelbel and Johann Sebastian Bach. Examples also exist from the late 19th century, including works by Johannes Brahms and Max Reger. Baroque period Title page of Scheidt's Tabulatura Nova The only known painting of Buxtehude (detail, Johannes Voorhout, 1674) Among the old masters who wrote chorale preludes is Samuel Scheidt. His Tabulatura Nova, containing several such works, was published in 1624. Sweelinck is also typical of the early Baroque period. Chorale preludes also appear in the works of Dieterich Buxtehude and Georg B√∂hm. Over 40 chorale preludes by Buxtehude have survived to this day.Snyder, Kerala J. Dieterich Buxtehude: Organist in L√ºbeck. New York: Schirmer Books, 1987.Sadie, Stanley and John Tyrell (eds.). The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 2nd edition, Oxford University Press, 2001. Johann Pachelbel's compositions are another example of the form, with many of his chorale preludes elaborating upon Protestant chorale melodies.Melville, Ruth. The Chorale Preludes of Johann Pachelbel. \\"Bulletin of the American Musicological Society, N¬∫3, pp.11‚Äì12. Apr., 1939. The best-known composer of chorale preludes is Johann Sebastian Bach. His earliest extant compositions, works for organ which he possibly wrote before his fifteenth birthday, include the chorale preludes BWV 700, 724, 1091, 1094, 1097, 1112, 1113 and 1119.Works , , , , , , and at Bach Digital website In Bach's early Orgelb√ºchlein (1708-1717), the chorale melody is usually in the upper part and the accompanying lower parts, while being highly elaborate in their harmonic and contrapuntal detail, the beginnings and endings of phrases generally coincide with those of the chorale. An example is \\"Jesu, meine Freude\\", where the chorale melody in the upper part is supported by a closely woven and harmonically subtle counterpoint in three parts:Jesu meine Freude (BWV 610) Peter Williams (1972, p. 27) says of the Orgelb√ºchlein: ‚ÄúEach approach to Bach‚Äôs organ chorales ‚Äì their beauty, their ‚Äòsymbolism‚Äô, their mastery- is rewarding.‚Äù Williams, P. Bach Organ Music. London, BBC. Williams continues (1972, p29) ‚ÄúOne of the most remarkable features of most of the settings is that the accompaniment and the motifs from which it is composed are newly invented and are not related thematically to the melody.‚Äù By contrast, in the prelude on ' (BWV 645) from the set of six Sch√ºbler Chorales, taken from earlier cantata movements, the accompaniment is a free-flowing obbligato which both derives from the chorale melody, yet seems to float independently over it. \\"The achieving of a melody independent of the cantus firmus, though in principle it is familiar in obbligato arias, is here unusually complete.\\" Williams, P. (1980, p.112) The Organ Music of J.S. Bach: Vol. II, Works based on Chorales. Cambridge University Press. Julian Mincham (2010) sees an asymmetry here that is possibly rooted in the chorale itself ‚Äúwith its slightly puzzling mixture of different phrase lengths‚Äù: Chorale melody (cantus firmus) of Wachet auf. Two melodic ideas from the chorale, labelled (a) and (b) above are embedded in the obbligato line: ' (BWV 645) Mincham says that while ‚Äútheme and chorale are not designed to begin and end together‚Ä¶ [they] fit together perfectly. Get to know the chorale and ritornello melodies well and the apparently effortless ways in which they inter-relate will become obvious. The important point is that they seem not to fit; but they do.‚Äù Romantic period and twentieth century There are several examples of 19th- and 20th-century chorale preludes, such as the Eleven Chorale Preludes by Johannes Brahms, C√©sar Franck, Max Reger's and Samuel Barber's.Barber, Samuel. Dei Natali (Chorale Preludes for Christmas), 1960. Works such as these continue to be produced nowadays such as Helmut Walcha's four volumesChorale Prelude by Helmut Walcha - recordings, Cat.

Newsfield Publications Ltd was founded by Roger Kean, Franco Frey and Oliver Frey in 1983. Based in Ludlow, Shropshire, Newsfield published a number of popular computer game magazines from the mid-1980s to early 1990s. This line-up was later supplemented by a number of less successful magazines covering role-playing games, film, horror and youth culture. Faced with financial difficulties, the company went bankrupt towards the end of 1991. This didn't spell the immediate end for some of their magazines though. Another magazine publisher, Europress, continued to publish Newsfield's flagship publications, Zzap!64 and Crash, for a further six months before the former was relaunched as Commodore Force and the latter sold to rival publisher EMAP and merged with Sinclair User. Thalamus Ltd, Newsfield's sister company, was set up in 1985 to publish a number of computer games on various 8-bit and 16-bit platforms, with a slant towards the Commodore 64. Thalamus initially survived the demise of Newsfield before it too finally went bankrupt in 1993. Roger Kean, Franco Frey and Oliver Frey operated Thalamus Publishing, an independent book publisher, until it closed in 2009. Magazines =Crash= Crash began life in 1983 as a software catalogue, offering reviews of games and a mail order service. The first issue of the dedicated monthly magazine was published in February 1984. Focusing exclusively on the ZX Spectrum, it was a lively, colourful magazine that soon attracted a considerable cult following. It remained in print, as a Newsfield publication, until October 1991. When Europress Impact took over publication of the magazine, it lasted for a further six months before finally being sold in 1992 to rival publisher EMAP and merged with Sinclair User. The May 1992 issue was the only merged issue published. Sinclair User ceased publication in 1993. =Zzap!64= Zzap!64 was launched in May, 1985 as the sister magazine to Crash. It focused on the C64, but later incorporated Amiga game news and reviews. Like Crash, it had a dedicated cult following amongst C64 owners, but extensive changes prompted a relaunch of the magazine, this time published by Europress Impact. Issue 91 of Zzap!64 would become issue 1 of Commodore Force, a magazine that itself lasted until March 1994. Special issues in digital format were later made in March 2002 and July 2005, the latter celebrating the 20th anniversary of its creation and included with issue 18 of Retro Gamer. =Amtix!= Amtix! was Newsfield's short-lived gaming magazine dedicated to the Amstrad CPC platform. Launched in November 1985 (although a special \\"issue zero\\" was given away with Crash and Zzap!64), it offered as much in-depth coverage of the Amstrad gaming scene as its sister magazines did for the Spectrum and C64. Amtix! was unable to compete with Amstrad Action, the leading publication for Amstrad CPC users; only 18 issues of Amtix! were published before Newsfield sold the magazine to Database Publications, who merged Amtix! features into their own publication, Computing With The Amstrad. CWTA was a general Amstrad CPC/PCW/PC magazine, which used Amtix as the brand for its games review section. CWTA later split into three single-format magazines including Computing with the Amstrad CPC, and it was CWTACPC which continued using the Amtix name for its games section. =LM= LM (variously said to be short for Leisure Magazine, Leisure Monthly, or Lloyd Mangram - a pseudonym used by editors in Newsfield's computer magazines) was launched in December 1986. It was a bold move for Newsfield, attempting to capture a youth market within the 18-30 demographic with a wide range of pop-culture coverage. The magazine failed to attract sufficient advertising revenue and was discontinued after four issues. =The Games Machine= The Games Machine launched in the autumn of 1987. It was Newsfield's first multi-format games magazine, intended to be a much more informative, serious rival to the popular Computer and Video Games publication. The first batch of issues attempted to broaden its appeal by featuring articles on non-gaming products, such as remote controlled cars and high-tech gadgets, but it soon narrowed its focus to concentrate exclusively on games. The magazine continued for thirty-four issues before finally folding in 1990, having been consigned to the margins by Future Publishing's more robust ACE publication. An Italian version of the magazine was launched around the same time, which initially translated much of the English version's content. It still continues to thrive today as one of Italy's best selling multi-format games magazines. =Fear= Fear ran between 1988 and 1991. It began life as a full-colour newsstand magazine edited by former deputy editor of Sinclair User John Gilbert. Newsfield, keen to find publishing ventures outside the volatile computer game market, agreed to publish Fear with Gilbert as managing editor. The first issue of the magazine, which would be dedicated to horror book/film reviews and original horror, fantasy and science fiction, was published in June 1988. Despite relatively low sales it managed to survive for the duration of Newsfield's business operations, seeing off rivals such as Skeleton Crew and Phantasmagoria, which entered the market midway through its run. Mark Kermode wrote several film reviews for the magazine. Fear reviews have been quoted on the back cover of books by authors including Peter F. Hamilton. =Movie= Newsfield's next venture was Movie - The Video Magazine. The market for commercial/sell-through pre-recorded VHS tapes was beginning to bloom and Newsfield decided it would be wise to try to capture a slice of this market. Launched in September 1988, Movie managed to attract the interest of advertisers within the video industry, but circulation of the magazine remained low and it failed to make a profit. It lasted for seven issues before Newsfield reluctantly discontinued publication. =Prepress= Prepress with the Macintosh was launched in September 1989, a trade magazine aimed at the publishing industry. It was well regarded within the industry but struggled to find sufficient advertising revenue until it later expanded to cover non-Macintosh platforms and was renamed simply Prepress. After Newsfield's closure it was sold to Hertford- based publisher Macro and survived until that firm in turn collapsed in 1993. =Complete Computer Entertainment Guide= With their financial resources running low, Newsfield attempted to launch a new computer magazine that would be produced by staff working for their existing titles. Launched in November 1989, it was intended to be a quarterly production, but the second issue wasn't published until November 1990. The magazine nevertheless continued to be published until Newsfield's demise in 1991. =Games Master International= In July 1990 Newsfield took over publication of Croftward Publishing's GM magazine. Aimed at fantasy role-playing gamers, GM had been a successful production with high circulation and strong advertising revenue. Unfortunately, as Newsfield relaunched it as Games Master International, the role-playing market was hit by a recession strong enough to force even Games Workshop's White Dwarf and Warlock magazines to dip in sales. (The latter would only last for 13 issues.) =Raze= With Newsfield's multi-format games magazine The Games Machine floundering, the publisher decided to rebrand it as Raze in October 1990 and move the editorial within the direction of the new Japanese games consoles, the Sega Master System and Nintendo Entertainment System, which were growing in popularity. Once again, poor advertising revenue and an expensive out-of-house editorial team meant that the magazine failed to reap the profits Newsfield were hoping to see. The editorial work for Raze was contracted out to Words Works Limited, which was head by Richard Monteiro. The magazine itself was planned to be replaced after its initial 12-month run with two separate titles that would concentrate on the Sega and Nintendo consoles (Sega Force and Nintendo Force), however, those plans were put on hold when Newsfield entered liquidation in 1991. Content of Raze covered the 16-bit computer and console machines, with news on US and Japanese videogaming. Roger Kean, co-owner of Newsfield Publications, granted the magazine preservation project, Out-of-Print Archive, permission to scan, edit and release the back issues of Raze. =Frighteners= In an attempt to gain some much needed revenue, Newsfield decided to publish a spin-off of Fear magazine. Launched in June 1991, Frighteners was intended to be a monthly fiction magazine, showcasing up and coming new talent within the horror genre. Unfortunately the first issue had to be pulled from the shelves after receiving consumer complaints about the blood-dripping cover painted by Oliver Frey, which featured a story by novelist Graham Masterton. The issue was subsequently re- issued with a less offensive image. Only three more issues were printed. =Sega Force and Nintendo Force= With their flagship titles, Crash and Zzap!64, no longer attracting sufficient advertising revenue or circulation, due to the fading 8-bit gaming market, Newsfield were in severe financial difficulty. As a last-ditch attempt to capitalise on the rising popularity of the new generation of video game consoles, Newsfield planned to split Raze into two separate publications, Sega Force and Nintendo Force. However, following an audit during the autumn of 1991, it became clear that Newsfield would no longer remain solvent beyond March 1992. The company's directors signed for voluntary liquidation in September 1991.

Life Albert II was born at Habsburg Castle in Swabia, a younger son of King Albert I of Germany and his wife Elizabeth of Carinthia, a member of the House of Gorizia (Meinhardiner). He initially prepared for an ecclesiastical career and, though still a minor, was elected Bishop of Passau in 1313. However, he had to rival with an opposing candidate and finally renounced the office in 1317. After the death of their elder brother Frederick the Fair in 1330, the surviving sons Albert II and Otto the Merry became joint rulers of all Habsburg dominions in Austria and Styria. Albert was able to further increase his possessions by the inheritance of his wife Joanna of Pfirt, which was made up of the Alsatian county of Pfirt and several cities. Furthermore, upon the death of his maternal uncle Duke Henry of Carinthia in 1335, Albert succeeded in establishing his claims on the Duchy of Carinthia and the March of Carniola, when he reached his enfeoffment by Emperor Louis IV against the claims raised by his mighty Luxembourg rival King John of Bohemia. Reflecting his high reputation among the secular and church leaders of Europe, in 1335 Pope Benedict XII asked him to mediate in the church's conflict with Emperor Louis. Two years later, King Philip VI of France 1337 asked him for help against the Wittelsbach emperor and King Edward III of England. Nevertheless, Albert remained faithful to the emperor until Louis' death in 1347; he also was a close ally of his son Duke Louis V of Bavaria. After the demolition of Rapperswil Castle by the forces of Rudolf Brun in 1350, the Austrian duke marched against the Swiss Confederacy and laid siege to the city of Z√ºrich, though to no avail. In Austria, Duke Albert had the construction of the Gothic Choir begun in St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna, known as the Albertinian Choir. He established the \\"Albertinian House Rule\\" (Albertinische Hausordnung) to predetermine the rules of succession in the Habsburg lands according to the principle of primogeniture. Although the rule was disregarded after his death, it was re-assumed under Emperor Maximilian. Adopted as part of the Pragmatic Sanction in 1713, the Albertinian House Rule effectively remained one of the basic laws of Austria until 1918. Styria owes him its (former) constitution, the so-called \\"Mountain Book\\" (Bergb√ºchel); the same is true for Carinthia. It has been speculated that Albert suffered from temporal paralysis (explaining his nickname \\"Albert the Lame\\") caused by polyarthritis. If so, however, it did not prevent him from fathering numerous children, of whom six survived childhood. Albert died at Vienna in 1358 and was buried in a monastery of his own foundation, Gaming Charterhouse in present-day Lower Austria. According to his House Rule, he was succeeded by his eldest son Rudolf IV whose younger brothers acted as regents. However, after Rudolf's death in 1365, the Habsburg lands were divided among Albert's younger sons Albert III and Leopold III by the 1379 Treaty of Neuberg. Family and children On 15 February 1324 Albert married Countess Johanna of Pfirt, daughter of Count Ulrich III of Pfirt, in Vienna. The couple had the following children: # Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria (1 November 1339, Vienna - 27 July 1365, Milan), who succeeded his father as Duke of Austria, Styria and Carinthia. His marriage with Catherine of Luxembourg remained childless; upon his death, he was succeeded by his younger brothers Albert III and Leopold III. # Catherine (1342, Vienna - 10 January 1381, Vienna), Abbess of St. Klara in Vienna. # Margaret (1346, Vienna - 14 January 1366, Brno), married: ## in Passau 4 September 1359 Count Meinhard III of Gorizia-Tyrol; ## in Vienna 1364 Margrave John Henry of Moravia. # Frederick III, Duke of Austria (1347, Vienna - 1362, Vienna). Died unmarried. # Albert III, Duke of Austria (9 September 1349, Vienna - 29 August 1395, Castle Laxenburg). His first marriage with Elisabeth of Bohemia, a daughter of the Luxembourg emperor Charles IV remained childless; secondly, he married Beatrix of Nuremberg, a daughter of the Hohenzollern burgrave Frederick V.

Life Adelaide was the daughter of William III, Duke of Aquitaine and Adele of Normandy, daughter of Rollo of Normandy. Her father used her as security for a truce with Hugh Capet, whom she married in 969. In 987, after the death of Louis V, the last Carolingian king of France, Hugh was elected the new king with Adelaide as queen. The couple were proclaimed as the new monarchs at Senlis and blessed at Noyon. As such, they had become the founders of the Capetian dynasty of France.

In 1868 he moved to Paris where he established himself as one of the premier French luthiers of his day. His instruments were considered superior over other new violins. Collin-Mezin was friends with influential people who helped popularize his instruments. He was also connected to musical luminaries of his day, whose opinions he sought out. A number of famous violinists played on his instruments, and praised their quality and playability, including Joseph Joachim, Sivori, Scott Tixier, L√©onard, Marie Tayau, and Jules Armingaud, who considered a Collin-Mezin equal to a Stradivari for flexibility of sound. The famous cellists Franchomme and Jacquard played on Collin-Mezins.  Characteristics of his instruments and craftsmanship  Like the best French luthiers, his designs followed in the tradition of the famous Italian schools Stradivarius, Guarnerius, and Amati, although he developed his own unique varnish. * varnish tends to be thick and dull, ranging in colour from yellow to brownish yellow * they typically have a black outline along the edges of the body and scroll * no artificial process of heating or chemically treating the wood * constructed of old wood that was dried naturally * the bass barring (as well as other aspects) adjusted according to the age and type of wood he used * his best work is approximately from 1875‚Äì1910 His instruments are also characterized by a powerful and unusually brilliant tone, but also possessed a harshness when new. Musical historian William Henley, in his Universal Dictionary of Violin and Bow Makers (1959), suggests that this harshness could be eliminated with \\"many years of strenuous playing,\\" which would then certainly enable the instrument to be played by an active soloist. Henley records that ‚ÄúBenjamin Godard's Concerto Romantique was first performed at a Pasedeloup Concert, Paris, 1876, by Marie Tayau on a Collin-M√©zin violin with (what was then an innovation) E and A steel strings suggested by the maker, which rather points to the fact that he is attempting to get brilliance and clearness at the expense of purity.\\" Steel strings are more popular today, though they tend to be used more by students. (More advanced players and professionals prefer synthetic or gut core strings wound with metal, and an all-metal E string.)  How to recognize an authentic Collin-Mezin  * Many but not all authentic Collin-Mezins have a hand-written signature in addition to a label (according to Henley). * Violins with later dates have a Grand Prix label in addition to the hand written signature. * On the side of his original sound posts there is a stamp of \\"Collin-M√©zin,\\" a copyright facsimile of his signature. * His labels are not to be confused with the violins of his son and collaborator Charles Collin-Mezin, Jr., whose instruments are also of high quality but priced more moderately. The labels of Collin-Mezin, Jr's instruments still contain labels with his father‚Äôs name, and indicate that they are ‚Äúpar Ch J. B.

Until 2016, it also published a print edition. History It was founded in 1997 by a group of journalists who left Izvestia newspaper, with the financial backing of Boris Berezovsky. After Vladimir Putin's election as President of Russia in 2000, Novye Izvestia became a frequent critic of the new government, especially over the Kremlin's influence on democratic freedoms for Russian citizens and the war in Chechnya. As Boris Berezovsky had fled to London, Oleg Mitvol obtained a 76% share in the newspaper from him, but Berezovsky effectively continued to support the newspaper financially. However, on 20 February 2003, Oleg Mitvol, being the chairman of the Board of Directors (1997-2003) and citing a decision of a meeting of the board, kept secret from the journalists despite their 24% share, accused Director General of Novye Izvestia Igor Golembiovsky of misappropriation of funds and fired him. The publication was suspended. Boris Berezovsky claimed that Mitvol's move was politically motivated,MN Russia as the newspaper was opposed to President Vladimir Putin and on that very day had published an article by Vladimir Pribylovsky about the allegedly emerging cult of Putin's personality.Anti Compromat Several leading journalists of Novye Izvestia, including Golembiovsky, in two months formed a new smaller and more cautious daily, Russkii Kurier. Novye Izvestia was resumed under Director General Valery Yakov, former Deputy Director General, who had been opposed to the dismissal of Golembiovsky as well, but had decided not to leave. However, its criticism of the government became much more subdued. In May 2016 Novye Izvestia ceased print publication and became an online-only publication.

Start of a dynasty Tower at Hacienda Santa Ana Fern√°ndez, was born in Bayamon, Puerto Rico. He was the owner of the Santa Ana plantation located in the city of his birth. The Santa Ana plantation is located on land which was granted to his grandfather (whose name was also Fernando Fern√°ndez) by the Spanish Royal Crown in 1797. Fern√°ndez's grandfather was a naval captain who fought against pirates and English merchant ships. The Spanish Royal Crown granted him this land in recognition of his service to Spain, here he planted sugarcane and raised cattle. In 1804, the elder Fern√°ndez used a mixture of sugar and honey to process and distill rum. He aged his product in special barrels which were imported from Europe. The rum he produced was only for his own personal use and that of his family. In 1821, various slaves from his plantation were involved in a conspiracy. A slave from another plantation by the name of Marcos Xiorro planned and organized a revolt against the slave masters. The plans of the revolt were discovered by the Spanish authorities and never took place.Conspiracy of Marcos Xiorro In 1827, he ordered his 127 slaves to build an enormous windmill shaped like a tower. The windmill helped to extract the juice from the sugarcane. He would still resort to the use of manpower whenever the wind wasn't strong enough to operate the windmill. Puerto Rico Herald In 1846, Fern√°ndez's father, Manuel Fern√°ndez (birth name: Manuel Fern√°ndez y Mart√≠nez), inherited the plantation; Manuel Fern√°ndez developed the land which consisted of over . Manuel Fern√°ndez eventually purchased much of the property adjoining his land and soon became the richest man in Bayamon. Pedro Fernando Fern√°ndez takes charge In 1880, Pedro F. Fern√°ndez, became the owner of the plantation. Fern√°ndez imported a still from Europe and started to produce rum using the sugar and honey from his land. He developed two different formulas for his rums and he used the same barrels which his grandfather had used before, believing that the rum's unique flavor would be contained in these barrels. Soon the word spread about Fernandez's rum and many friends and nearby families would visit the Santa Ana Hacienda to \\"sample\\" the rum. His son went to France to continue his university education; while there he discovered cognac. Upon returning to Puerto Rico, he developed a rum recipe that rivaled the best French cognacs. People started calling Fernando's rum \\"Ron del Barrilito\\" (Rum from the little Barrel). In Puerto Rico, families began switching from \\"brandy\\" and \\"cognac\\", to \\"Ron del Barrilito\\". Fern√°ndez also produced \\"Alcoholado Santa Ana\\" which is a product derived from alcohol and eucaliptic leaves and is greenish in color. Unlike pure alcohol, Alcoholado Santa Ana does not sting. It is principally used for rub-downs and to refresh the body. Edmundo B. Fern√°ndez, Inc. Fernando Fern√°ndez died in 1940 in Bayamon. His great-grandson, who is also named Fernando Fern√°ndez, organized the company (which is now called \\"Edmundo B. Fern√°ndez, Inc.\\") and continues to distribute two brands of \\"Ron del Barrilito\\" and \\"Alcholado Santa Ana\\" worldwide. The company's main offices are still located in the Hacienda Santa Ana with manufacturing facilities in Puerto Rico and in the Dominican Republic. Edmundo Fern√°ndez's office is located in the windmill tower built by his ancestor.  Freedom barrel  In 1942, a single barrel, which is stored in the \\"cellar\\", was put aside with orders that it should only be opened when Puerto Rico becomes a free and independent nation. When and if that ever happens, the cask (barrel) will be taken to the town square in the center of Bayamon and its contents will be offered free to all those who wish to drink from it.

Early life Frederick Preston Cone was born in the Benton community of northern Columbia County, Florida to William Henry Cone and Sarah Emily Branch on September 28, 1871. His father was a state senator prior to the American Civil War. He received his education at the Florida Agricultural College (precursor of the University of Florida) and Jasper Normal College. Although he never received a law degree, in 1892 he passed the Florida bar exam and began a successful law practice in Lake City, Florida. In 1911 Cone and eight other prominent Lake Citians decided to open a bank. With $50,000 in capital, the Columbia County Bank opened in February 1912 and grew with the community. Cone retained his leadership role on the board of directors until shortly before his death. The bank celebrated its centennial in 2012. =Personal= Cone married his first wife, Ruby Scarborough, and the union bore one child in 1902, a daughter named Jessie. Ruby died in 1923. He wed again in 1930 to Mildred Victoria Thompson. He held membership in Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, Freemasonry, Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine and Rotary International. Politics Cone began his political career as Mayor of Lake City, and served three terms there. He was elected to and served in the Florida Senate from 1907 to 1913, serving as the senate president in 1911. Cone was active in national politics, attending the 1924 and 1928 Democratic National Conventions as a delegate before chairing the Florida delegation in 1932. =Governor= Cone was elected as Florida governor in November 1936 and was inaugurated on January 5, 1937. He had just turned 65, and he had problems with his health. Subsequent Governor Spessard Holland thought he was too old for the job. It was the height of the Great Depression in the United States, and Florida was suffering like every other state. During Cone's tenure, Florida A & M University President J. R. E. Lee was able to secure higher salaries for teachers and administrators at the university despite the statement by Gov. Cone, a Democrat and a strict segregationist, that \\"no Negro was worth $4000 a year.\\" At that time, Florida governors held little real power; they were primarily figureheads for the state. The 1885 state constitution severely limited the governor's power ‚Äì a reaction to the bitter memories of the reconstruction era following the Civil War. The governor was just one of seven elected cabinet members; only the governor was limited to a single 4-year term. Political scientist V. O. Key, Jr. described politics in Florida as \\"every man for himself\\". Many state boards, commissions and departments answered to a specific cabinet member or to the legislature directly. The cabinet as a whole also decided many issues. The governor's power was vested in three tools: *Patronage: Under the spoils system, the governor spent more than half his time appointing commissioners, officers, directors and bureaucrats throughout government, which provided leverage with other elected officials. *Veto: The use and threat of legislative veto was used to influence the contents of many bills, or to gain favors, which would be called in for important matters. *Persuasion: Citizens and the press listened to the governor, who helped shape public opinion and citizens were encouraged to contact other elected officials and convey their opinions. Cone was a fiscal conservative and a \\"hands-off\\" governor. He generally believed that the governor should not interfere in operation of state agencies or deliberations of the legislature. However, Cone did not hesitate to reject legislation he disliked, using the veto more than any prior governor. The state badly needed new revenue streams, but business opposed a sales tax and a 1924 amendment to the state constitution prohibited a state income tax. Property taxes were the primary revenue of cities and counties, and the gas tax funded most of the state's activities. As a result, nothing was accomplished. =Accomplishments= During his term, the Florida Highway patrol was created, and although Cone opposed new taxes, he funded the agency by fees assessed on driver's licenses. To encourage tourism, the state sponsored a 110,000-square-foot exhibition at the 1939 New York World's Fair, the largest of any state. Florida's presentation recreated a tropical paradise and included 45 exhibits depicting natural resources, points of interest and the latest discoveries in science and industry. =Decision= In 1940, rather than run for a second term as governor, Cone made an unsuccessful bid for the U.S. Senate seat previously held by Park Trammell, who had died in office. Cone was defeated in the Democratic primary by Charles O. Andrews, who eventually won the general election. Death After leaving the governor's office on January 7, 1941, Cone returned to Lake City. He died there in 1948 and was buried at the Prospect Primitive Baptist Cemetery near White Springs, Florida in Hamilton County.

The game was written and directed by Goichi Suda, also known by the nickname Suda51, and produced by Hiroyuki Kobayashi. The game follows an elite group of assassins called the \\"killer7\\". The assassins, physical manifestations of a man named Harman Smith, perform hits on behalf of the United States government. Through these missions, the killer7 uncover a deeper conspiracy regarding the role of Japan in U.S. politics and secrets about the nature of their organization. Killer7 features first-person shooter elements and a unique on rails control scheme, but the core adventure-style gameplay has been compared to Myst and Snatcher. Killer7 was Suda51's first game released outside Japan. It received polarized reviews due to its unconventional control scheme, linear gameplay, and complex noir plot. While some reviewers appreciated the stripped-down controls and stylized arthouse approach, others panned it as confusing and restricting. However, the game's soundtrack, presentation, visual style and thought-provoking story received generally positive responses from critics and considered as the best aspects of the game and lead to several accolades and nominations. Killer7s cult appeal led to releases of Suda51's older works, a remastered version of Killer7 for Windows released in 2018, and the successful launch of No More Heroes. Gameplay The player battles enemies called Heaven Smiles in first- person view. The head-up display on the left indicates the player's stamina (the eye), weapon charge level, number of vials of thin blood, and amount of collected thick blood. The player controls the on-screen character, a member of the killer7 group, from a third-person view using the gamepad. The gameplay consists of elements of first-person shooter and action-adventure game with restricted movement (i.e. \\"on rails\\")‚Äîrather than allow free motion, the game limits the on-screen character to predetermined paths through the environment. The on-screen character moves forward by holding a button and reverses direction with another button press. At intersections, the player may choose which path to take. Progress is made by navigating the environment and solving puzzles. Some puzzles require the talents of a specific killer7 member. The player may switch between available members via a menu in the pause screen at any time; not all personalities may be awake at a start of a mission, and requires defeating a number of enemies before they can be awakened. Other puzzles require magical rings or other items collected throughout the game. Combat in Killer7 occurs when the player encounters enemies called \\"Heaven Smiles\\". Smiles announce their presence with a laughing sound effect and are initially invisible. The player must switch to a first-person viewpoint and scan the surroundings to reveal Smiles. While in first-person view, movement is disabled and the analog stick aims the character's gun. Targeting specific body parts will disable them; for example, shooting off a leg will cause a Smile to fall to the ground and crawl toward the player. The player may aim for a \\"critical point\\" that instantly destroys the Smile. Smiles that get too close will explode and injure the character. If a character dies, players can use Garcian Smith to retrieve the fallen character's head and bring them back to life; if Garcian dies, then the game ends. Defeated Smiles yield \\"thick blood\\" and \\"thin blood\\". Thick blood functions similarly to experience points, and players gain more by shooting Smiles' critical points. The player may redeem thick blood for \\"serum\\" while in \\"Harman's Room\\", checkpoints that appear throughout the game. Serum is used to improve the attributes of the characters such as \\"power\\" and \\"speed\\". This also unlocks special abilities for the characters. Players may save their game in designated Harman's Rooms. Thin blood is used to recover the characters' stamina and fuel special abilities. Completing the game unlocks a new difficulty called Killer8 where the character Young Harman can be played along with the original seven personalities. Killer8 is more difficult than the original mode with most enemies able to kill the player with one attack. Completing Killer8 unlocks a comical Hopper7 mode where the first level can be replayed with weaker enemies that wear grasshopper masks, mirroring the logo for the game's developer Grasshopper Manufacture. Story =Setting= Killer7 takes place in an alternate version of Earth in the early 21st century. After a treaty ends all international conflict, the world powers destroy all nuclear weapons by firing them into the upper atmosphere and intercepting them with other missiles. This event becomes known as \\"Fireworks\\" and symbolizes world peace to the general populace. In an effort to combat terrorism, pandemic disease, and cyberterrorism, the International Ethics Committee (IEC) shuts down all air travel and public use of the Internet. Air transportation is replaced by a system of intercontinent expressways. However, a new terrorist group called \\"Heaven Smile\\" appears, targeting the United Nations (UN) and IEC. The members of Heaven Smile are humans who have been infected with a virus that evokes a desire to kill. Factory-produced Smiles are given a \\"bomb-organ\\" that allows them to explode at will, their principal means of attack. In this Earth, Japanese politics are dominated by two parties: the UN Party and the Liberal Party. The UN Party is more powerful and moves to end the Asian Security Treaty and sever ties with the United States (US). The UN Party seized control of the Japanese government through the wisdom of the \\"Yakumo Cabinet Policy\\", a secret document which details how to run the \\"ideal nation\\". It was written by the Union 7, young members of the Liberal Party who went on to found the UN Party. The US government is also eager to sever relations with Japan, seeing the country as a hindrance and of little economic value. The interaction between Japan and the US is a central source of conflict in Killer7. =Characters= The player controls the members of a group of assassins called the \\"killer7\\". The group is led by an elderly man in a wheelchair named Harman Smith (Dwight Schultz), who exhibits \\"Multifoliate Personae Phenomenon\\". This condition allows him to physically transform into one of his seven assassin personae: African American Garcian Smith (Greg Eagles), aggressive Irish American Dan Smith (Michael Gough), Japanese American female Kaede Smith (Tara Strong), White British albino Kevin Smith, Mestizo Puerto Rican Coyote Smith (Benito Martinez), young Chinese American Con Smith (Jun Hee Lee), and Mexican American luchador Mask de Smith (Miguel Caballero). These people were gifted killers in life and Harman absorbed their souls through his condition after their deaths. The killer7 were temporarily incapacitated in an incident 50 years ago, in which the members of the group were systematically tracked and killed while performing a job at the Union Hotel in Pennsylvania. Garcian, whose power is to revive fallen personae, became the dominant personality as a result. In this capacity, he receives orders from the frail Harman when his consciousness is \\"awake\\" and accepts jobs from Christopher Mills (Bart Flynn), who hires the killer7 on behalf of the US government. Multifoliate Personae Phenomenon also causes Harman and his personae to see \\"remnant psyches\\" ‚Äî ghosts of their past victims. Iwazaru, a man in a bondage suit, and Travis Bell, the killer7's first target, are the main remnant psyches who aid them throughout the game. The primary antagonist is an old friend of Harman's named Kun Lan (Joe Lala). He has the \\"Hand of God\\", a supernatural power that produces the Heaven Smile virus. =Plot= The game opens with a conversation between Garcian Smith and Christopher Mills about a new job for the killer7. The assassins battle their way to the top of a building which has become infested with Heaven Smiles. Harman confronts the source of the Smiles, an angel-like figure, but she is merely Kun Lan's puppet. Harman and Kun Lan discuss the current state of the world before the mission ends. In the subsequent missions, the killer7 target a number of individuals on behalf of the US government or for personal reasons. They kill Andrei Ulmeyda (Cam Clarke), a Texan postal worker who established a successful company based on the Yakumo, when he becomes infected with the Heaven Smile virus. Dan Smith confronts Curtis Blackburn (Alastair Duncan), his former mentor and murderer, when Mills informs the group that Blackburn is running an organ smuggling business that targets young girls. Their penultimate mission pits them against the \\"Handsome Men\\", a group of sentai rangers who assassinate a US politician. The central plot arc concerns the true nature of US‚ÄìJapan relations. After a volley of two hundred intercontinental ballistic missiles are fired at Japan, the US government contracts the killer7 to eliminate Toru Fukushima (Jim Ward), the head of the UN Party. However, an assassin posing as Fukushima's secretary kills him first in an attempt to reclaim the Yakumo document for the Liberal Party, believing its wisdom would help the party to regain political power. Shortly thereafter, Kenjiro \\"Matsuken\\" Matsuoka (Steve Blum) kills two senior members of the UN Party to become its new leader, under the influence of Kun Lan. In the end, the killer7 defeat the two UN Party members who had been reanimated by Kun Lan as Japan is destroyed by the missiles. In their final mission, the killer7 seek Matsuken, who leads the 10 million UN Party members who live in the US. The government fears that if they converge on a single state, they could win a seat in the United States Senate. Garcian travels to Coburn Elementary School near Seattle, Washington and discovers tapes that reveal the school as a front for the UN Party to train children as assassins. The tapes focus on Emir Parkreiner, a gifted killer trained at the school. Garcian learns that Japan uses Coburn to control the vote of the US presidential election. The assassins battle a group of invincible Smiles and all but Garcian are incapacitated. Garcian travels to the Union Hotel where he witnesses visions of the other members being killed in their rooms. At the top, he discovers that his true identity is Emir Parkreiner, the one who killed the killer7 at the Union Hotel over 50 years ago. Following that incident, Harman absorbed Emir as a persona and Emir's memories were lost. Three years later, Garcian arrives at Battleship Island in Japan to destroy the last Heaven Smile. He meets with Matsuken, who presents Garcian with a choice: let him live, which allows Japan to mount an assault on the US; or kill him, which lets the US discover Japan's role in rigging American elections‚ÄîUS forces destroy Japan's last stronghold, Battleship Island, in retaliation and wipe Japan off the map. Regardless of the player's choice, Garcian finds that the last Heaven Smile is Iwazaru, whose real identity is Kun Lan, and kills him. However, Harman and Kun Lan are revealed to be immortal beings, representing a dialectic struggle between opposites, which persists a century in the future in Shanghai as they continue their eternal battle. Development Goichi Suda, also known as Suda51, wrote, designed, and directed Killer7, which he considers his proudest achievement. Development for Killer7 began in mid-2002 as part of the Capcom Five, a set of games overseen by Shinji Mikami and intended to be exclusive to the GameCube. Capcom produced the games to bring new intellectual property to the video game industry, which the company viewed as stagnant. Killer7s gameplay mechanics were finalized late in development because most resources went to story and visual work. Director Suda51 wrote the scenario based on a plot he conceived together with Mikami, and later decided on the unconventional control scheme as a deconstruction of how gamers play and to \\"create new expression\\". Complex controls and combos were omitted to present a system that fosters easy progression for the player. Producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi described the controls as \\"intuitive\\" and stated that the team wanted players to \\"think when they are playing\\" so they can enjoy the mystery in the story. The long development process culminated in several delays, the last of which was due to an artistic desire to release the game on July 7 (7/7). A lot of the content in Killer7 was cut due to feedback from both Mikami and internal testing. About 2/3 of the map size and plot were drastically reduced and according to Suda, the cinematics in total was 3 hours long as opposed to the now 1 hour duration. Of all the Smiths in the game, Coyote is Suda's favorite because of his backstory but again, it had to be cut halfway in development. Suda51 drew influence from film noir, particularly the theme of multiple personality disorder, and called Killer7 a \\"hardboiled action-adventure\\". Hiro Sugiyama, Peter Saville, and American comic book artists, such as Adrian Tomine, inspired the artistic design and aesthetic. Suda51 noted the inclusion of cel animation in Western and Japanese anime styles was meant to legitimize video games as an art form by competing with traditional art forms in their stage. The game's anime sequences were created by Xebec, while the CGI sequences were handled by Digital Frontier. Kobayashi commented that Killer7 is \\"styled more as an interactive story than a traditional game.\\" Suda also drew from yakuza film Battles Without Honor and Humanity: Hiroshima Deathmatch. His experience as an undertaker had a powerful effect on the portrayal of death in his games. The game reflects his interest in professional wrestling; Suda51 included a luchador character, Mask de Smith, and conducted interviews and attended promotional events while wearing a lucha libre mask. Reflecting on his work, Suda51 considers Killer7 his proudest achievement. Reception Killer7 received divisive reviews and sparked debates about depictions of sex and violence in video games and the status of video games as art. James Mielke of 1UP.com likened the game's high- contrast art style to noir and neo-noir film such as Se7en. He found that despite poor pacing and stilted gameplay, the \\"quirky scripting and edgy plot\\" were strong draws, and called Killer7 one of the \\"most artfully designed footnotes in gaming history\\". Edge magazine's reviewers echoed this sentiment and predicted that the game would \\"[pave the way] for future creative leeway\\", crediting the director with an unwavering artistic vision. Eurogamer's Kristan Reed was keenly aware of the game's limited appeal, calling it \\"a concept game, an arthouse game, a simple game, an often beautiful game, but most certainly never an everyman's game\\". Yahtzee Croshaw of The Escapist commends the game for \\"showing exactly what can be done when you flaunt all established convention and just start exploring what can really be done with gaming as an art form\\". Virtually all aspects of the game had their proponents and detractors. Greg Kasavin of GameSpot praised the unity of \\"great-looking camera work with simple controls\\" and compared its \\"thought-provoking\\" storyline to Metal Gear Solid, while a GamePro reviewer criticized those features, calling the controls limited, the cel-shading dull, and the story incoherent. Kasavin complimented the game's eclectic soundtrack, excellent voice acting, and distinctive sound effects, while the GamePro reviewer panned them as minimalist and irritating. IGN's Matt Casamassina likened the control scheme to \\"old-school adventure games like Myst and Snatcher\\" and commended Suda51 for making a \\"cult hit\\", \\"erupting with style, mood and undiluted craziness\\". Casamassina was also impressed by the quality of the anime-style cutscenes featured in the latter half of the game. The IGN, GameSpot, and GameSpy reviews noted the GameCube version features superior graphics, substantially faster loading times, and more responsive controls than the PlayStation 2 version, resulting in lower scores for the latter. Nevertheless, IGN called it the 94th best PlayStation 2 game. Nintendo Power claimed that Killer7 is a \\"highly rewarding\\" experience for dedicated gamers. Nintendo World Report writer Karl Castaneda also remarked that, despite repetitive gameplay, it was \\"still fun\\". Charles Herold of The New York Times was less forgiving and commented that the lack of new features beyond the first hour made the remaining experience boring and annoying. Despite its mixed reception, a number of video game publications recognized Killer7s unconventional gameplay and innovative style. At GameSpot's \\"Best and Worst of 2005\\" awards, the game was nominated for Best Story, Best GameCube Game, Most Outrageous Game, Most Gratuitous Use of F------ Swearing, and won Best New Character (Harman Smith) and Most Innovative Game. IGN similarly nominated it for Game of the Year, Most Innovative Design, and Best Artistic Design and awarded it Best Adventure Game, Best Story, and Best Game No One Played. IGN later named Killer7 the 20th best GameCube game of all time. The game had a large presence at the 2005 Nintendo Power Awards, winning Best New Character (Harman Smith). In August 2005, Jack Thompson, an activist who campaigns against video games, demanded that the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) change its rating for Killer7 from \\"M\\" (for Mature, ages 17 and up) to \\"AO\\" (for Adults Only, ages 18 and up). He cited Casamassina's review of the game at IGN, claiming that \\"full-blown sex sequences\\" present in the game would be harmful to minors. Casamassina rebutted that the scene in question involved two fully clothed adults and that a similar scene in a film would garner \\"only a PG-13 or, worst, R-rating\\". Legacy and related media Reviewers quickly identified Killer7 as a cult game with limited appeal. IGN lamented that its experimental style was not conducive to high sales, naming it GameCube's Best Game No One Played in their 2005 awards. IGN's Casamassina later placed it fourth in his Top 10 Tuesday: Underrated and Underappreciated Games feature. Despite modest sales, Killer7s cult success prompted the development of remakes of Suda51's older Japan-only games, The Silver Case and Flower, Sun, and Rain. In 2007, Grasshopper Manufacture released Suda51's No More Heroes to critical and commercial success. In addition to an original soundtrack and comic book adaptation, Capcom published Hand in killer7, a companion book that explains the plot in more depth. Kinetic Underground, the company that handled the comic book, also released a number of figurines depicting characters from the game. =Music= Killer7 Original Sound Track was released on June 20, 2005 by Sony Music Entertainment. It features 55 compositions by Masafumi Takada and 6 by Jun Fukuda across two discs. Takada put a large emphasis on ambient music due to the genre's ability to draw in the player. He called his soundtrack a \\"translation of the text\\" of the game and sought to retell the story through music. Carolyn Gudmundson of GamesRadar praised the soundtrack's varied style, a \\"moody, atmosphereric base punctuated with spikes of manic energy\\". She singled out \\"Rave On\\", a track heard before mini-boss battles, as an excellent example of the latter. GameSpy's Phil Theobald had similar compliments for \\"Rave On\\" and other more subdued pieces that slowly \\"work [their] way into your mind\\". Takada said in a 2008 interview that Killer7 is his favourite own soundtrack. Track list =Comic book= In 2006, Devil's Due Publishing released a comic book adaptation of Killer7, written and drawn by Kinetic Underground staff. The planned 12-issue limited series was cancelled after four issues. Players who preordered Killer7 through EB Games received a special \\"Issue #0\\" as a bonus, and \\"Issue #¬Ω\\" was available at the 2005 San Diego Comic-Con. Writer Arvid Nelson described the story as a \\"mutant cross-breeding of John Woo and Quentin Tarantino\\", and Devil's Due President Josh Blaylock commented that Killer7s style was perfect for the comic book medium. In adapting the game, Nelson admitted that the plot was streamlined to maintain a comprehensible story, but noted that the \\"video game doesn't spoon-feed you information ... That's how the comic's going to be, too\\". Sequel Since its inception, fans have been anticipating a Killer7 sequel. Suda made it clear that it will \\"probably never happen\\" as Capcom holds the rights to the IP. In a 2010 interview, he exclaimed that Killer7 is \\"part of his soul\\" and is certainly interested in making a sequel. In 2012, Suda revealed a new game titled Killer Is Dead; word quickly spread that it was a follow-up to Killer7 since the game shares similar concept with an assassin protagonist, complex plot and cel-shaded graphics. Suda later clarified that Killer Is Dead is an original game and has no relation to Killer7. During a panel at 2016's PAX East, Suda expressed his interest to remaster Killer7 and has begun talks with the game's publisher, Capcom. On March 17, 2018, during HOPPER'S Vol. 5 an event celebrating Grasshopper Manufacture's 20th anniversary, Suda verbally announced to attendees that there are plans to remaster both Killer7 and Flower, Sun, and Rain. However no platform or release date was mentioned. Suda later posted on his Twitter account stating that the Killer7 remaster will be out within 10 years. At the 2018 MomoCon, Suda announced a remastered version of Killer7 for Windows which was released on November 15, 2018.

It is a leading liberal business broadsheet. The TNS Media and NRS Russia certified July 2013 circulation of the daily was 120,000‚Äì130,000.  History  In 1989, with the onset of press freedom in Russia, Kommersant was founded under the ownership of businessman and publicist Vladimir Yakovlev. The newspaper's title is spelled in Russian with a terminal hard sign (—ä) ‚Äì a letter that is silent at the end of a word in modern Russian, and was thus largely abolished by the post-revolution Russian spelling reform, in reference to a pre-Soviet newspaper of the same name active between 1909 and 1917.

The TV show first aired in 1969, and again in 1973, 1976, 1979, 1985, and 1994. It is a surreal puppet show, and has met a lot of criticism from child psychologists, teachers and others, mainly because of its total lack of logic and pedagogic intent. The reason for the almost ten year intermission, from 1985 to 1994, was that NRK (The Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation) found the TV show to be unsuitable for children.http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/nordland/1.8344086 The series consists of five episodes, of which the moffedille appears briefly in episode 1, and has major appearances in episodes 2 and 3. It is introduced as the protagonists, the repairmen Pompel and Pilt, sit down on it in the belief that it is a tuft of grass, a misconception that is gradually cleared up as the moffedille starts moving. The moffedille then asks for a key (by uttering a talking-bubble containing a drawing of a key). Pilt, who has earlier found a key, shows it to the moffedille, which immediately grabs it and eats it. It then leaves. This concludes the appearance of the moffedille in episode 2. In episode 3, Pompel and Pilt meet up with the moffedille again. This time, it utters a big SOS inside a talking bubble. By uttering different semi- mysterious talking bubbles, along with rudimentary body language, the moffedille manages to communicate that it has a key inside of it, that it wants Pompel and Pilt to remove. Pompel, intending to do surgery on the moffedille, comes up with a saw. Pilt, however, does not approve of this, and suggests an alternative approach, where they feed the moffedille a length of rope, and make it dance. After the dance, they pull the rope out of the moffedille. It turns out that a large number of keys are now threaded onto the rope. One of them resembles the key that was swallowed by the moffedille in episode 2. Pilt takes this key, and the moffedille swallows all the others again. The moffedille then leads the way to a locked door. Pilt uses the key to unlock the door. The door opens, and a migrant (another type of fantasy creature) comes out. The moffedille eats the key again, and leaves.

The main ingredients are mangoes, aavapindi (powdered mustard seeds) and a combination of other spices used for pickling. South Indians are known to have a deep attachment to these spicy pickles. A wide variety of pickles are available in these regions, using mango as their prime ingredient. Besides being made at home, the pickles are available commercially and are exported to the United States, Europe, Japan and many other countries. Preparation Aavakaaya pickles are usually made in the summer, this being the time for peak availability of green mangoes. Green mangoes, hot oil, chillies and a variety of spices are the key ingredients. The process of preparation, storage and serving is considered almost a ritual. The mangoes are cut into medium-sized pieces approximately 2 cm x 2 cm using strong and especially sharp cutters/knives in swift strokes so as not to structurally damage the pieces. These pieces are wiped clean and dry with a highly-absorbent soft cloth ‚Äî usually an old sterilized cotton sari with no embroidery, stowed away for this purpose. They are then pickled with powdered mustard, red chili powder (dried and powdered or sometimes dried, roasted and powdered), salt, gingelly oil and fenugreek (both in whole and powder form). Garlic is optional. The mixture matures for four to eight weeks, care being taken to mix the contents periodically to ensure a uniform marinade. Popularity Aavakai (Telugu version) is prepared during the pre- Summer seasons when mangoes are just about to ripen. The Tamil version, is not as spicy as the Andhra version and often contains chickpeas as one of the primary ingredients. It is prepared in many households and eaten along with curd rice. Varieties Preparation of Moong Aavakaaya (For Temporary Purpose) Preparation of Moong Aavakaaya Mango Pieces Pickle Mango grated Pieces Pickle Aavakaaya and its container Aavakaaya is very popular in South India, especially in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. There is a wide variety of mango pickles, these include: # Aavakaaya (The default one made with powdered mustard seed) # Allam Aavakaaya (A spicy variety including ginger-garlic paste) # Bellam Aavakaaya (A sweet variant of Avakaya made with jaggery) # Dosa Aavakaya (Mango replaced with a type of dosakaya) (cucumber) # Maagaya (Made with green, peeled, unstoned mango) # Menthi aavakaaya or Menthikaaya (Includes fenugreek) # Nuvvulu aavakaaya (Includes sesame) # Paccha Aavakaya (Aavakaya with yellow chillies rather than red ones which are usually used.) # Pulihora Aavakaaya (Aavakaaya with taalimpu (Telugu), called Chaunk in Hindi) # Senagala Aavakaaya (Aavakaaya with the addition of chickpeas or Bengal gram or chana) # Thokku Maagaya (Maagaya with the mango peel included) # Thurum Maagaya (Maagaya made with grated mango) # Uduku Maagaya (Maagaya with boiled rather than raw mango) # Usiri Aavakaya (Mango replaced with gooseberry) # Vellulli Aavakaaya (Aavakaaya with addition of garlic) # Yendu aavakaaya (Aavakaaya with pickled, dried mango cubes mildly sweetened with jaggery) # Kobbari aavakaya (aavakaya made with coconut flavor) Consumption Hot rice is mixed with one or two pieces of aavakaaya and ghee (clarified butter) or groundnut oil, then made into bite-size balls. Aavakaaya is often eaten with rice and dahi (yogurt). Raw onion can be added which enhances the taste. Most people prefer to eat it along with muddapappu (pigeon pea dal) and neyyi (ghee/clarified Butter). Some people prefer to eat it within 1‚Äì2 months from preparation, when it is called Kottaavakaya.

She was emperor Augustus' first granddaughter, being the first daughter and second child of Julia the Elder and her husband Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa. Along with her siblings Julia was raised and educated by her maternal grandfather Augustus and her maternal step-grandmother Livia Drusilla. Just like her siblings she played an important role in the dynastic plans of Augustus, but much like her mother she was disgraced due to infidelity later on in her life. Life About 5 BC or 6 BC, Augustus arranged her to marry Lucius Aemilius Paullus.Suetonius, The Twelve Caesars, \\"II. Augustus\\", LXIV Paullus had a family relation to her as her first half-cousin, as both had Scribonia as grandmother: Julia's mother was a daughter of Scribonia by Augustus; Paullus' mother, Cornelia, was a daughter of Scribonia resulting from her earlier marriage to Publius Cornelius Scipio Salvito. Paullus and Julia had a daughter, Aemilia Lepida and possibly a son, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (although the latter may also have been the son to Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (consul 6). According to Suetonius, she built a large pretentious country house. Augustus disliked large overdone houses and had it demolished.Suetonius, The Twelve Caesars, \\"II. Augustus\\", LXXII Julia was imagined in Grotto in the Gulf of Salerno by Joseph Wright of Derby in 1774. In 8, according to ancient historians, Julia was exiled for having an affair with Decimus Junius Silanus, a Roman Senator. She was sent to Tremirus, a small Italian island, where she gave birth to a child. Augustus rejected the infant and ordered it to be exposed,Suetonius, The Twelve Caesars, \\"II. Augustus\\", LXV or left on a mountainside to die. Silanus went into voluntary exile, but returned under Tiberius' reign.Tacitus, Ann. III, 24 Sometime between 1 and 14, her husband Paullus was executed as a conspirator in a revolt.Suetonius, The Lives of Caesars, Life of Augustus 19 Modern historians theorize that Julia's exile was not actually for adultery but for involvement in Paullus' revolt.Norwood, Frances, \\"The Riddle of Ovid's Relegatio\\" Classical Philology (1963) p. 154 Livia plotted against her stepdaughter's family and ruined them, according to some. This led to open compassion for the fallen family. In 29 AD, Julia died on the same island where she had been sent in exile twenty years earlier.Tacitus, Ann. IV, 71 Due to the adultery that Julia committed, Augustus stated in his will that she would never be buried in Rome.Suetonius, The Twelve Caesars, \\"II. Augustus\\", CI She was survived by a daughter, possibly a son, and by several grandchildren. Unusual naming Julia the Younger was not a member of the Julian gens by birth: being the daughter of Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa made her a Vipsania Agrippina by birth, although there are no contemporary sources that show that that name was ever used for her. She came to belong to the household of the Julio-Claudian dynasty as she was raised and instructed by her maternal grandfather Augustus.Suetonius, The Twelve Caesars, \\"II. Augustus\\", LXIV‚Äînote that Augustus was member of the Julii Caesares gens through (posthumous) adoption by the (maternal) uncle of his mother Atia‚Äîthat maternal uncle was of course Julius Caesar; Augustus was an Octavius by birth (hence his name Octavianus after his posthumous adoption had taken place). Further, Augustus adopted Tiberius as his son (and heir), while Tiberius was remarried to Julia the Elder. Augustus became something of a paternal grandfather to Julia the Elder's children, too, including Julia the Younger. A formal adoption \\"in the family of the Caesars\\" among the offspring of Agrippa and Julia the Elder is however only recorded regarding Vipsania Julia's brothers Gaius Vipsanius Agrippa‚Äîhence Gaius Julius Caesar‚Äîand Lucius Vipsanius Agrippa‚Äîhence Lucius Julius Caesar.Tacitus, Ann. I, 3 Her younger sister Agrippina the Elder and youngest full brother, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa Postumus, were named after their natural father only until Agrippa Postumus was adopted by Augustus as Marcus Julius Caesar Agrippa Postumus. Likewise, her eldest half-sisters, Vipsania Agrippina, Vipsania Attica, Vipsania Marcella and Vipsania Marcellina, were named after their father. Her younger half-brother, unnamed in contemporary sources, was later sometimes dubbed \\"Tiberillus,\\" after his father Tiberius, and died young.

She was regent of France from 1190 to 1191 while her son Philip II participated in the Third Crusade. Early life Adela was the third child and first daughter of Theobald II, Count of Champagne and Matilda of Carinthia, and had nine brothers and sisters. She was named after her paternal grandmother Adela of Normandy. When Louis VII's second wife, Constance of Castile, died in childbirth in 1160, he was devastated and became convinced that he would die young as well, fearing that the country would fall into chaos as he had no male heir. As he was desperate for a son, King Louis married 20-year-old Adela of Champagne five weeks later, on 13 November 1160. Adela's coronation was held the same day. She went on to give birth to Louis VII's only son, Philip II, and to the future Byzantine empress Agnes. Queenship The marriage between Adela and Louis VII served as a peace treaty between one of King Louis‚Äô most rebellious vassals, Theobald II of Champagne who was an incredibly powerful feudal lord of France. The marriage was a way to ensure peace between the crown and Theobald. At the time of the marriage, the king was still mourning the death of his Spanish wife. This grief was very public on the part of the king, but Adela was praised greatly for conquering his heart \\"bit by bit\\". It took five years for Adela to give birth to Louis VII's only son, the future Philip Augustus, also called Philip \\"Dieu-Donne\\" or \\"God-given\\" because his birth was long-awaited by a kingdom that had enjoyed a long unbroken lineage of undisputed male heirs to the throne. Philip's birth meant the continuing rule of Capetian monarchs in France. Adela was active in the political life of the kingdom, along with her brothers Henry I, Theobald V, and William of the White Hands. Henry and Theobald were married to daughters of Louis VII and his first wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine. Adela and her brothers kept their political power base after the succession of her son to the throne in September 1180. She initially attempted to assume regency in a potential minor regency, as her son the king was only fifteen years old, but as he was deemed to be old enough to rule on his own, she did not succeed.Janse, Sharon L. : The Monstrous Regiment of Women Widowhood Adela and her brothers, Henry I of Champagne, Theobald V of Blois, Stephen I of Sancerre, and William White Hands, felt their position threatened when the heiress of Artois, Isabella of Hainault, married Adela's son Philip in April 1180. Adela formed an alliance with Hugh III of Burgundy and Philip I of Flanders, and even tried to interest Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. War broke out in 1181, and relations became so bad that Philip attempted to divorce Isabella in 1184. He called a council at Sens for the purpose of repudiating her. According to Gislebert of Mons, Isabella then appeared barefooted and dressed as a penitent in the town's churches to gain public support, which convinced Philip to change his mind. He gradually developed genuine respect and love for Isabella and was devastated by her early death in March 1190. Philip appointed Adela as regent of France several months later before he left the country on the Third Crusade. She acted as regent for her son together with the arch bishop of Reims from the departure of her son in 1190 until his return in 1191. She participated in the founding of many abbeys. Queen Adela died on 4 June 1206 in Paris and was buried in the church of Pontigny Abbey near Auxerre. Upon learning of her death, Philip reportedly refused to speak to anyone for two days afterwards.

Background He was the second son of the 6th king King Gusu and the younger brother of the 7th king Saban. However, since this would make him rule until at least the age of 110, modern historians commonly assume that Biryu was in fact the son or grandson of Saban's younger brother.Park, Hyun Sook, ¬´Î∞±Ï†úÏùòÏ§ëÏïôÍ≥ºÏßÄÎ∞©¬ª(Central area and regions of Baekje), p. 71, Juryuseong, 2005, After the preceding king Bunseo was assassinated in the 7th year of his reign in 304 by Chinese agents, Biryu ascended to the throne because Bunseo's sons were deemed too young to rule. This appears to have been part of a power struggle between the two branches of the Baekje royal family, the descendants of the 5th king Chogo (Biryu's ancestor) and that of the 8th king Goi. The Samguk Sagi records that \\"his character was generous and benevolent, and he was powerful and skilled with a bow. For a long time, he resided among the people, and he was praised far and wide. After the death of Bunseo, all his children were too young to succeed. Therefore, at the recommendation of the ministers and people, he took the throne\\".Samguk Sagi, Scroll 23 Reign In 312, he appointed Hae Gu to head the military. In 327, he stopped a rebellion by his half-brother Buyeo Ubok. In 337, he received a mission from the neighboring Silla. Samguk Sagi: * 308 AD, spring, first month, first day of the year. There was a solar eclipse. * 312 AD, spring, second month. The king sent ministers to make a tour and listen to the grievances of the people. The widowed and alone could not provide for themselves, and they were given three sok of grain. Summer, fourth month. The king visited Dongmyeong shrine. Bae Hae Gu was made Minister of the Military. * 313 AD, spring, first month. Sacrifices were made to heaven and earth in south of the city. The king himself slew the animals. * 316 AD, spring. There was a drought. A great star shot in the west. Summer, fourth month. The wells of the capital overflowed. A black dragon was seen inside of it. * 320 AD, autumn, eighth month. A tower for shooting was made in the west of the palace. Every month on the first day of the month, he practiced shooting. * 321 AD, spring, first month. The king's half-brother, Buyeo Ubok, was made Minister of the Interior. Autumn, seventh month. Venus was seen during the day. In the south of the country, locusts damaged the grain. * 325 AD, winter, tenth month. There was a sound in heaven like the wind and the waves were smashing against each other. 11th month. The king went hunting north of Guwon and shot a deer. * 327 AD, autumn, seventh month. There was a cloud like a red crow that came toward the sun. Ninth month. The Minister of the Interior, Buyeo Ubok, took control of the fortresses north of the Han River and rebelled. The king dispatched soldiers to attack him. * 331 AD, In the spring and summer, there was a great drought. The grass and trees withered, and the rivers ran dry until autumn, when it rained in the seventh month. That year there was a famine, and there were incidents of cannibalism. * 333 AD, summer, fifth month. A star fell. There was a fire in the king's palace. It spread to the houses of the people. Autumn, seventh month. They repaired the palace. Bae Jin Yi was made Minister of the Interior. Winter, 12th month. There was thunder. * 335 AD, winter, first day of the month.

Legacy He was father of the 13th king King Geunchogo who would become the most famous of all of the kingdom's monarchs bringing Baekje to its pinnacle of power.

An international co-production of the United Kingdom and Japan, the film portrays the experience of a single human soul, portrayed by Williams, through various incarnations. Williams is the only common actor throughout the stories that span man's history on Earth. An attempt on director-screenwriter Bill Forsyth's part to depict by visual means the ordinariness of life throughout the ages, Being Human is deliberately slow in its pace in order to emphasize how slow life often is. The structure is one of vignette-like character studies of one man (actually at least four distinct men, all with the same soul) who keeps making the same relationships and mistakes throughout his lifetimes.  Plot  In the first incarnation, which appears to be a caveman, a man's family is taken from him by raiders due to his cowardice and hesitation. Before his wife is taken away, she says, \\"Don't lose the children!\\" The next incarnation is in Ancient Rome in which he, Hector, is a slave to a \\"foolish master\\" who loses his fortune and is compelled to kill himself by his creditors and orders Hector to join him. Hector longs to be free to find the children and wife he had before he became a slave, but he has fallen in love with another slave and forgets his waiting family. Third incarnation: He is a Scottish crusader on his way home to his children. The master from his life in Rome as a slave is now a crusader trying to decide whether to become a priest. They travel together until Hector finds his soul mate from the life in Rome. She is a widow and wishes Hector to join her family, but his duties to the children in Scotland pull at him. Fourth incarnation: Hector is finally forced to confront his capacity for cowardly indecision. He is a Portuguese man in The Renaissance shipwrecked on the coast of Africa. He is the master in this life, his wife from the first incarnation shipwrecked with him as his spurned lover, and the raider who spirited her away is her steadfast friend. Fifth incarnation: He is a modern man in New York, paying the consequences of cowardly indecision and gaining the strength to address the children he lost lifetimes ago. He is joined in this life by his master/slave/friend/soul mate, and former wife Janet and her husband/raider from lifetimes past. They support him but are people who are trying to find their own way, just as in the past lives.

Later, after poor test screenings, Warner Bros. instructed Bill Forsyth to trim 40 minutes from the film, as well as add narration and a happy ending. Forsyth subsequently disowned the film. Reception Despite the changes, the film was still not well-received on release. The film currently holds a 50% rating on review aggregate Rotten Tomatoes. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an 'F' and said that the film \\"demonstrates what can happen when a director with a gossamer comic touch tries to become commercial--the movie is so flat and banal it's like a Mel Brooks parody in which someone forgot to put in the jokes.\\" Janet Maslin of The New York Times was more positive, declaring \\"Aiming high and falling short of his own mark, Mr. Forsyth remains a film maker of vivid, unpredictable imagination.\\"\\"Annals of Everybody, by Bill Forsyth\\" by Janet Maslin, The New York Times, 6 May 1994  Year-end worst-of lists  *3rd ‚Äì Glenn Lovell, San Jose Mercury News * Top 4 (not ranked) ‚Äì Stephen Hunter, The Baltimore Sun References External links * * Being Human at Rotten Tomatoes * Category:1994 films Category:Warner Bros. films Category:English-language films Category:Scottish Gaelic-language films Category:British films Category:1994 comedy-drama films Category:Films shot at Pinewood Studios Category:Films about reincarnation Category:British comedy- drama films Category:Japanese comedy-drama films Category:Japanese films Category:Films directed by Bill Forsyth Category:Films produced by David Puttnam ","title":"Being Human (1994 film)"},{"id":"1151728","text":"Sucia Island () is located north of Orcas Island in the San Juan Islands, San Juan County, Washington, United States. It is the largest of an archipelago of ten islands including Sucia Island, Little Sucia, Ewing, Justice, Herndon, the Cluster Islands islets, and several smaller, unnamed islands. The group of islands is about in length and just short of a half mile wide. Sucia island is roughly the shape of a hand. The total land area of all islands is 2.74 km¬≤ (1.058 sq mi, or 677 acres). The main island of Sucia Island by itself is 2.259 km¬≤ (0.8722 sq mi, or 558.1 ac). There was a permanent population of four persons as of the 2000 census, all on Sucia Island. Sucia Island State Park is a Washington State Marine Park. History Sucia Island's name originated with the Spanish Captain Francisco de Eliza, on his map of 1791. He named it \\"Isla Sucia\\". Sucia in Spanish means \\"dirty\\" or in a nautical sense \\"foul\\". This word was chosen because the shore was deemed dangerous due to reefs and hidden rocks. These reefs and broken shorelines are from a geologic folding of the Earth's crust, which brought many interesting marine fossils to the surface. Some good examples can be found on the southeast arm of Sucia Island. The isolated coves and bays of Sucia Island once served the Lummi Indians in their seal hunting days. They later provided excellent hideouts in the 19th century for smugglers of illegal Chinese laborers, as well as for hiding illegally imported wool and opium. Still later, the islands played a large role in rum-running during liquor Prohibition of the 1920s and 1930s, and in recent years they have figured in drug trafficking. The cluster of Sucia Islands was purchased in 1960 by the Puget Sound Interclub Association and later donated to the State of Washington for protection as a Marine State Park. In 2012, a femur bone from a theropod dinosaur was discovered on the island.

Anchorages =Shallow Bay= Sunset over the Shallow Bay anchorage Shallow Bay on the island's west side is protected from all but westerly winds and waves. There are seven mooring buoys and room for 40-50 small pleasure craft in this anchorage. There are beaches on three sides including a sandy beach to the north. Pebble Beach in the center is the access point to the camping and moorage pay box, as well as a large group camping site with a covered eating area and environmentally friendly composting out-houses. True to its name, Shallow Bay averages deep. The anchor holding is good in sand but may be more rocky towards the center and mouth of the bay. =Echo Bay= Boats at anchor in Echo Bay Echo Bay is directly opposite the island's narrow isthmus from Shallow Bay and the largest of the anchorages, and the most exposed, particularly to southeast winds. There are a number of mooring buoys close to a pebble beach. =Fossil Bay= Looking down at Dock 1 from the group campsite Fossil Bay is one of the most popular anchorages, particularly for small boats that prefer to tie up to one of two docks rather than anchor or pick up a mooring ring. Fossil Bay is an inlet that opens to the southeast. =Fox Cove= Fox Cove lies just west of and can be seen from Fossil Bay. Fox Cove is bordered by Ev Henry Finger point and Little Sucia island. =Ewing Cove= Ewing Cove is between the northeast end of Sucia island and Ewing Island.

Paramahansa Yogananda was born as Mukunda Lal Ghosh in Gorakhpur, India, into a Bengali Hindu family. Autobiography of a Yogi introduces the reader to the life of Paramahansa Yogananda and his encounters with spiritual figures of both the Eastern and the Western world. The book begins with his childhood family life, to finding his guru, to becoming a monk and establishing his teachings of Kriya Yoga meditation. The book continues in 1920 when Yogananda accepts an invitation to speak in a religious congress in Boston, Massachusetts, USA. He then travels across America lecturing and establishing his teachings in Los Angeles, California. In 1935, he returns to India for a yearlong visit. When he returns to America, he continues to establish his teachings, including writing this book. The book is an introduction to the methods of attaining God-realization and to the spiritual wisdom of the East, which had only been available to a few in 1946. The author claims that the writing of the book was prophesied long ago by the nineteenth-century master Lahiri Mahasaya (Paramguru of Yogananda) also known as the Yogiraj and Kashi baba. Before becoming a yogi, Lahiri Mahasaya's actual name was Shyama Charan Lahiri. It has been in print for seventy years and translated into over fifty languages by Self-Realization Fellowship. It has been highly acclaimed as a spiritual classic including being designated by Philip Zaleski, while he was under the auspices of HarperCollins Publishers, as one of the \\"100 Most Important Spiritual Books of the 20th Century.\\" It is included in the book 50 Spiritual Classics: Timeless Wisdom from 50 Great Books of Inner Discovery, Enlightenment and Purpose by Tom Butler-Bowdon. According to Project Gutenberg, the first edition is in public domain and at least five publishers are reprinting it and four post it free for online reading.  Overview  Looking north along Swami's beach in Encinitas, showing part of the Self Realization Fellowship's ashram on the point, including (on the left) the hermitage where Yogananda wrote Autobiography of a Yogi The Autobiography of a Yogi takes the reader on a journey into the spiritual adventures of Paramahansa Yogananda. The book begins by describing Yogananda's childhood family life to his search for his guru, Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri,Chapter 10 ‚Äì I Meet my Master, Sri Yukteswar to the establishment of his first school, Yogoda Satsanga Brahmacharya VidyalayaChapter 27 ‚Äì Founding of a Yoga School at Ranchi to his journey to America where he lectured to thousands, established Self-Realization FellowshipChapter 37 - I Go to America and visited with Luther Burbank,Chapter 38 ‚Äì Luther Burbank, A Saint Amidst the Roses a renowned botanist to whom this book is dedicated.

The preface was written by Walter Evans-Wentz, an Oxford scholar of anthropology, a writer who was a pioneer in the study of Tibetan Buddhism and an author of The Tibetan Book of the Dead and Tibet's Great Yogi Milarepa. In the preface he wrote, \\"His unusual life-document is certainly one of the most revealing of the depths of the Hindu mind and heart, and of the spiritual wealth of India, ever to be published in the West.\\"Evans-Wentz, W. Y. Preface Yukteswar Giri, Yogananda's guru, told him about a significant prediction made by Lahiri Mahasaya, Yukteswar's guru.Chapter 32 ‚Äì Rama is Raised from the Dead Yukteswar heard him say, \\"About fifty years after my passing,\\" he said, \\"my life will be written because of a deep interest in yoga which the West will manifest. The yogic message will encircle the globe, and aid in establishing that brotherhood of man which results from direct perception of the One Father.\\" In 1945 fifty years after Lahiri Mahasaya's passing in 1895, the Autobiography was complete and ready for publication. In 1999, Autobiography of a Yogi was designated as one of the \\"100 Most Important Spiritual Books of the 20th Century\\" by a panel of theologians and luminaries convened by HarperCollins publishers. According to Philip Goldberg, who wrote American Veda, \\"... the Self-Realization Fellowship which represents Yogananda's Legacy, is justified in using the slogan, \\"The Book that Changed the Lives of Millions.\\" It has sold more than four million copies and counting ...\\" Autobiography of a Yogi is the most popular of Yogananda's books and SRF has published the book into over fifty languages. Influence A 1920 photograph published in Autobiography of a Yogi, showing Yogananda attending a religious congress upon his arrival in the United States Autobiography of a Yogi has introduced meditation and yoga to many Westerners since its publication.Bowden, Henry Warner (1993). Dictionary of American Religious Biography. Greenwood Press. . p. 629. The book has many famous advocates, particularly in the business and entertainment communities. One of the most famous advocates of the book was Steve Jobs, the co-founder, and formerly Chairman and CEO of Apple Inc. Jobs \\"first read Autobiography of a Yogi as a teenager, then re-read [the book] . . . once a year ever since.\\" Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce.com, told his story of attending Steve Jobs' memorial service, where the attendees were handed a small brown box on their way out. \\"This is going to be good,\\" he thought. \\"I knew that this was a decision he made, and whatever it was, it was the last thing he wanted us all to think about.\\" The box contained a copy of the book. George Harrison, lead guitarist of the Beatles, received his first copy of Autobiography of a Yogi from Ravi Shankar in 1966 and, according to Shankar, \\"that was where his interest in Vedic culture and Indian-ness began.\\" Gary Wright, who wrote the song Dream Weaver, wrote: \\"In 1972, my friend George Harrison invited me to accompany him on a trip to India. A few days before we left, he gave me a copy of the book Autobiography of a Yogi by Paramahansa Yogananda. Needless to say the book inspired me deeply, and I became totally fascinated with Indian culture and philosophy. My trip was an experience I will never forget.\\" Elvis Presley was introduced to Autobiography of a Yogi in 1965 by his hair dresser-turned-guru, Larry Geller. Elvis continued to study the book throughout the 1970s. He left a copy of the book behind in a Nashville hotel room on January 21, 1977. Later on this book was auctioned off with a letter of authenticity The actress Mariel Hemingway says that she was introduced to the Autobiography of a Yogi by Peter Evans, a direct disciple of Yogananda. She was \\"mesmerized by the Autobiography of a Yogi and loved the whole great Hindu tradition of spiritual seeking ...\\" The actor Dennis Weaver gave a copy of the book to Linda Evans, saying that it had changed his life. Evans says that \\"Because of Dennis I took the first step in what would become a life long spiritual journey.\\" Andrew Weil, director of the program in Integrative Medicine at University of Arizona, wrote the book Eating Well for Optimum Health. He mentioned reading the Autobiography of a Yogi which he said, \\"awakened in me an interest in yoga and Indian religious philosophies.\\" He continued, \\"It is filled with wondrous tales from an exotic land, none more amazing than that of Giri Bala, 'a woman yogi who never eats.'\\" The work has also attracted less favourable comments. Srinivas Aravamudan has described its contents as \\"miracle-infested territory\\" whose \\"single most memorable feature ... is a repetitive insistence on collocating the miraculous and the quotidian. ... The autobiography is an eclectic directory of sorts that might be dubbed a hitchhiker's guide to the paranormal galaxy\\". Aravamudan notes the \\"aggressive marketing\\" of the Yogoda Satsang and Self-Realization Fellowship, that Yogananda himself \\"worked the mass media\\" and used a technique described as \\"Guru English\\". He notes that Yogananda was the collator of the testimonials that purport to validate the miracles described, which appear at a rate of around one per page. According to Chris Welch and the liner notes on the album, Tales From Topographic Oceans, a concept album recorded by Yes, the progressive rock group, was inspired by \\"a lengthy footnote on page 83\\" of Autobiography of a Yogi. The footnote describes four Shastric scriptures that cover religion, art, social life, medicine, music and architecture. On March 3, 1973, Jon Anderson was given a copy of 'Autobiography of a Yogi' by Jamie Muir at Bill Bruford's wedding. Anderson became particularly fascinated by the footnote on page 83, which inspired him to write much of the material for Tales from Topographic Oceans. Cholo-goth icon Rafael Reyes credits the book with saving his life and opening him to spiritual self-awareness.

Early life and education Born in Blountstown, Florida, he attended the University of Florida in Gainesville. While at the university he was one of the early members of Florida Blue Key, as well as the Tau chapter of Theta Chi fraternity. While still attending the university, he was elected in 1927 at the age of 21 to the Florida House of Representatives. Legal career and early politics Following graduation, he moved to Jacksonville, where he began practicing law. He served on the city council from 1931 until 1937; he was elected and returned to the Florida House in 1939. During World War II, he was a gunnery officer in the U.S. Navy. Term as governor Warren was nominated for governor by the Democratic Party in 1948; his platform included promises to fight racism in Florida. In addition to having to deal with racial segregation, most blacks were still disenfranchised and cut out of the official political system. Warren won the election and assumed the office of governor on January 4, 1949. After his election, he spoke out against the Ku Klux Klan, stating after a rally in January 1949 that In March 1949, reports were published that Warren had been a member of the Klan. He issued a statement saying that he had been a member before World War II, but during it he had \\"helped to fight a war to destroy the Nazis -- first cousins to Klansmen.\\" During his term, Warren set the foundations for the state's turnpike system, began the Florida reforestation program, instituted quality control programs on Florida's citrus crops, and signed a law that forbade cattle from wandering freely (as they damaged crops). In 1951 Warren signed an anti-Klan law which, although not mentioning the Klan specifically, forbade the wearing of masks in public or on the private property of another person without the written permission of the owner. The hearings of the United States Senate Special Committee to Investigate Crime in Interstate Commerce, chaired by Senator Estes Kefauver, brought to light the involvement of Florida public officials in gambling-related corruption involving numbers games and bolita. There were accusations that Warren's 1948 campaign had been funded by organized criminals. Warren refused to cooperate with the committee, claiming that to do so would contradict the principle of States' rights. In a letter to Senator Herbert O'Conor, in which Warren informed the committee that he would not appear before them, he stated: \\"I think state sovereignty as conceived by the founders of our Government is something more than a fading memory to rest in the nation's archives.\\" In 1951, legislator George S Okell, in the Florida House of Representatives introduced a resolution to impeach Warren for \\"wilfully ignoring\\" his duty to eliminate illegal gambling in Florida and for falsifying papers related to his 1948 campaign. The House voted on May 28, 1951, to reject the articles of impeachment. Later years  After Warren left office on January 6, 1953, he moved to Miami, where he practiced law. He ran for governor again in 1956, promising \\"to maintain segregation in Florida.\\" He lost the election to opponent LeRoy Collins. Warren died in Miami in 1973.

Wye Oak State Park preserves the site where the revered tree stood for more than 400 years in the town of Wye Mills, Talbot County, Maryland. The Wye Oak was believed to be over 460 years old at the time of its destruction during a severe thunderstorm on June 6, 2002. It measured in circumference of the trunk at breast height, high, with a crown spread of . It is believed that the acorn that became the oak germinated around the year 1540. The Wye Oak was still bearing a maturing crop of acorns when it was toppled. The Wye Oak drew public attention in 1909, when Maryland State Forester Fred W. Besley made the first official measurement of the tree. Ten years later, in 1919, it was featured in American Forestry magazine as the first tree in the American Forestry Association's \\"Tree Hall of Fame.\\" The Wye Oak inspired Besley to found the Big Tree Champion Program in 1925; as a result, in 1940 the American Forestry Association named the Wye Oak one of its first National Champion Trees. By the time of its destruction 62 years later, only one other tree named that year remained standing. The tree faced a loss of a large limb in 1956 that sparked concerns, and another limb fell in 1984 that weighed 70,280 lbs. The tree fell during a heavy thunderstorm with high winds on the night of June 6, 2002. The tree's exceptionally long life has been attributed to the efforts of park managers, who applied preventive measures such as fertilizer and insecticide as well as extensive pruning, cabling, and bracing of the branches. State park The Maryland General Assembly purchased the tree and established Wye Oak State Park in 1939. At its creation, the park was a little over an acre in size, according to Wye Oak: The History of a Great Tree by Dickson J. Preston: The park's current protect the nearby stream valley from development. The site of the Wye Oak remains largely untouched, and the descriptive plaque placed there in 1921 remains at the site. The park also includes a one-room brick schoolhouse dating from colonial times; it is the second oldest schoolhouse in Talbot County. Cloning Dr. Frank Gouin, Professor Emeritus of Horticulture at the University of Maryland, College Park, impressed both by the age and size of the tree, as well as its unusual resistance to oak wilt fungus and the gypsy moth, led a successful effort to clone the Wye Oak. The first two cloned saplings were planted at Mount Vernon on April 26, 2002. Another clone was planted in the remains of the trunk of the original tree during a June 6, 2006, ceremony; a marker commemorates the event. Artworks Upon its falling, immediate efforts were made to salvage and preserve the tree's remains. Pieces of the tree that had fallen in previous years had been used to sculpt works such as the statue of two children planting a tree located in the Tawes State Office Building in Annapolis. A very large section of the lost tree became a new desk for the Maryland governor's office. Wood distributed to artists and craftspersons was used to create carvings, sculptures, oil paintings, a 3-dimensional collage, furnishings, and serving pieces; a gallery of the creations was made available online by the Department of Natural Resources.

Fuller Warren Expansion Project (2017) left About 2013, The Florida State Department of Transportation (FDOT) began the Your10&95 project to add operational improvements and enhancements to the I-10, I-95 highway interchange in metro Jacksonville. A planning department held several public meetings to discuss the proposed project and the cost of its construction with residents, community partners and businesses. They also asked for input from the public attendees. The meetings were held on February 10, 2014, on August 28, 2014 and on February 26, 2015. During those meetings, it was suggested that as part of the widening project to add two additional traffic lanes to the Fuller Warren bridge, a pedestrian shared use path should be added as well. The proposed path over the St. Johns River would connect the Riverside and Avondale historic neighborhood with the San Marco historic neighborhood. As the current bridge provides for no pedestrian or bicycle access, the FDOT agreed to implement the shared use path suggestion, as well as a number of other requests, such as adding traffic noise barriers for residents. The project also includes improvements to the I-10 ramps at Stockton and Irene streets. Construction began May 5, 2017 and was expected to be completed in the summer of 2020.http://your10and95.com/Faq See Shared Use Path (SUP) renderings.

The Atra-Hasis tablets include both a creation myth and one of three surviving Babylonian flood myths. The name \\"Atra-Hasis\\" also appears, as king of Shuruppak in the times before a flood, on one of the Sumerian King Lists. The oldest known copy of the epic tradition concerning AtrahasisThe variant versions are not direct translations of a single original. can be dated by colophon (scribal identification) to the reign of Hammurabi‚Äôs great-grandson, Ammi-Saduqa (1646‚Äì1626 BC). However, various Old Babylonian fragments exist, and the epic continued to be copied into the first millennium BC. The story of Atrahasis also exists in a later Assyrian version, first rediscovered in the Library of Ashurbanipal, though its translations have been uncertain due to the artifact being in fragmentary condition and containing ambiguous words. Nonetheless, its fragments were first assembled and translated by George Smith as The Chaldean Account of Genesis, the hero of which had his name corrected to Atra-Hasis by Heinrich Zimmern in 1899. In 1965, Wilfred G. Lambert and Alan R. MillardLambert, Wilfred G., and Alan R. Millard. 1965. Cuneiform Texts from Babylonian Tablets in the British Museum. London. published many additional texts belonging to the epic, including an Old Babylonian copy (written c. 1650 BC) which is the most complete recension of the tale to have survived. These new texts greatly increased knowledge of the epic and were the basis for Lambert and Millard‚Äôs first English translation of the Atrahasis epic in something approaching entirety.Lambert, Wilfred G., and Alan R. Millard. 1999 [1969]. Atrahasis: The Babylonian Story of the Flood. London: Eisenbrauns. . A further fragment was recovered in Ugarit. In its most complete surviving version, the Atra-Hasis epic is written on three tablets in Akkadian, the language of ancient Babylon. Synopsis = Tablet I = Cuneiform tablet with the Atra-Hasis epic in the British Museum Taking place, according to its incipit, ‚Äúwhen gods were in the ways of men,\\" Tablet I of Atra-Hasis contains the creation myth of Anu, Enlil, and Enki‚Äîthe Sumerian gods of sky, wind, and water. Following the cleromancy ('casting of lots'), the sky is ruled by Anu, Earth by Enlil, and the freshwater sea by Enki.Walter Burkert traces the model drawn from Atrahasis to a corresponding passage, the division by lots of the air, underworld and sea among Zeus, Hades, and Poseidon in the Iliad, in which ‚Äúa resetting through which the foreign framework still shows‚Äù (pp. 88‚Äì91).

The Akkadian determinative dingir () primarily translates to 'god' or 'goddess'. However, it may also mean 'priest' or 'priestess', even while other Akkadian words (e.g. and ) also translate to such. The noun 'divine' is thus used to preserve this ambiguity in dingir. to do farm labor, as well as maintain the rivers and canals. After forty years, however, the lesser rebelled and refused to do strenuous labor. Enki, who is also the kind, wise counselor of the gods, suggested that rather than punishing these rebels, humans should be created to do such work instead. The mother goddess Mami is subsequently assigned the task of creating humans by shaping clay figurines mixed with the flesh and blood of the slain god Geshtu-E ('ear' or 'wisdom'; 'a god who had intelligence').On some tablets the under-god Weila or Aw-ilu, was slain for this purpose. All the gods, in turn, spit upon the clay. After 10 months, a specially-made womb breaks open and humans are born. Tablet I continues with legends about overpopulation and plagues, mentioning Atrahasis only at the end. = Tablet II = Tablet II begins with more human overpopulation. To reduce this population, Enlil sends famine and drought at formulaic intervals of 1200 years. Accordingly, in this epic, Enlil is depicted as a cruel, capricious god, while Enki is depicted as kind and helpful, perhaps because priests of Enki were writing and copying the story. Tablet II remains mostly damaged, however it ends with Enlil's decision to destroy humankind with a flood, with Enki bound by oath to keep this plan secret. = Tablet III = Tablet III of the Atra-Hasis epic contains the flood myth. It tells of how Enki, speaking through a reed wall,Suggestive of an oracle. warns hero Atrahasis ('extremely wise') of Enlil's plan to destroy humankind by flood, telling the hero to dismantle his house (perhaps to provide a construction site) and build a boat to escape. Moreover, this boat is to have a roof ‚Äúlike Abzu‚Äù (or Apsi; a subterranean, fresh water realm presided over by Enki); to have upper and lower decks; and to be sealed with bitumen. Atrahasis boards the boat with his family and animals, then seals the door. The storm and flood begin, and even the gods are afraid. After seven days, the flood ends and Atrahasis offers sacrifices to the gods. Enlil is furious with Enki for violating his oath, but Enki denies doing so: \\"I made sure life was preserved.‚Äù In conclusion, Enki and Enlil agree on other means for controlling the human population. The words \\"river\\" and \\"riverbank\\" are used in Tablet IIIAtra-Hasis III, iv.7‚Äì9. probably in reference to the Euphrates, the river upon which the ancient city Shuruppak, ruled by Atrahasis,\\"Sumerian King List.\\" WB 62. c. 2000 BC. was located. Alterations and adaptations =Lineage of Atrahasis= In later versions of the flood story, contained in the Epic of Gilgamesh and the Sumerian creation myth, the hero is not named Atrahasis. In Gilgamesh, the name of the flood hero is Utnapishtim, who is said to be the son of Ubara-Tutu, king of Shuruppak: \\"Gilgamesh spoke to Utnapishtim, the Faraway... O man of Shuruppak, son of Ubara-Tutu.\\"Kovacs, Maureen Gallery, trans. 1998. \\"The Story of the Flood.\\" Epic of Gilgamesh XI (electronic ed.), edited by W. Carnahan. Academy of Ancient Texts. Many available tablets comprising the Sumerian King Lists support the lineage of the flood hero given in Gilgamesh by omitting a king named Shuruppak as a historical ruler of Shuruppak, implying a belief that the flood story took place after or during the rule of Ubara-Tutu. In the Sumerian creation myth, first recorded in the 17th century BC (i.e. the Old Babylonian Empire), the hero is named Ziusudra, who also appears in the Instructions of Shuruppak as the son of the eponymous Shuruppak, who himself is called the son of Ubara-Tutu.Z√≥lyomi, G√°bor, trans. 2003 [1999]. \\"The instructions of ≈†uruppag.\\" The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature (2nd ed.), edited by G.

Tablet WB 62, however, provides a different chronology: Atrahasis is listed as a ruler of Shuruppak and a gudug priest, preceded by his father Shuruppak, who is, in turn, preceded by his father Ubara-Tutu, as in The Instructions of Shuruppak. This tablet is unique in that it mentions both Shuruppak and Atrahasis. = Gilgamesh and the flood myth = Subsequent versions of the flood myth in the Ancient Near East evidently alter (omit and/or editorially change) information about the flood and the flood hero found in the original Atra-Hasis story.George, Andrew R., trans. 2003 [1999]. The Epic of Gilgamesh (reprint and corrected ed.), edited by A. R. George. London: Penguin Books. . In particular, a lost, intermediate version of the Atra-Hasis flood myth seems to have been paraphrased or copied in a late addition of the Epic of Gilgamesh (Tablet XI).Tigay, Jeffrey H. 1982. The Evolution of the Gilgamesh Epic. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press. . pp. 238‚Äì39. This modern addition of Gilgamesh, known as the 'standard version', is traditionally associated with the Babylonian scribe S√Æn-lƒìqi-unninni (), though some minor changes may have been made since his time. Regarding the editorial changes to the Atra-Hasis text in Gilgamesh, Jeffrey H. Tigay comments: \\"The dropping of individual lines between others which are preserved, but are not synonymous with them, appears to be a more deliberate editorial act. These lines share a common theme, the hunger and thirst of the gods during the flood.\\"  Alterations  Examples of alterations to the Atra-Hasis story in Gilgamesh include: * Omitting information, for example: ** The hero being at a banquet when the storm and flood begins: \\"He invited his people...to a banquet.... He sent his family on board. They ate and they drank. But he [Atrahasis] was in and out. He could not sit, could not crouch, for his heart was broken and he was vomiting gall.\\"Atra-Hasis III, ii.40‚Äì47. ** \\"She was surfeited with grief and thirsted for beer.\\"Atra-Hasis III.iv. ** \\"From hunger they were suffering cramp.\\" * Editorial changes, for example: ** \\"Like dragonflies they have filled the river\\"Atra-Hasis III.iv 6‚Äì7. was changed to \\"Like the spawn of fishes, they fill the sea.\\"The Epic of Gilgamesh XI 123. * Weakening of anthropomorphic descriptions of the gods, for example: ** \\"The Anunnaki (the senior gods) [were sitt]ing in thirst and hunger\\"Atra-Hasis III 30‚Äì31. changed to \\"The gods feared the deluge.\\"The Epic of Gilgamesh XI 113.

In other words, every formula that can be derived using that rule is already derivable without that rule, so, in a sense, it is redundant. The concept of an admissible rule was introduced by Paul Lorenzen (1955). Definitions Admissibility has been systematically studied only in the case of structural rules in propositional non-classical logics, which we will describe next. Let a set of basic propositional connectives be fixed (for instance, \\\\\\\\{\\\\to,\\\\land,\\\\lor,\\\\bot\\\\\\\\} in the case of superintuitionistic logics, or \\\\\\\\{\\\\to,\\\\bot,\\\\Box\\\\\\\\} in the case of monomodal logics). Well-formed formulas are built freely using these connectives from a countably infinite set of propositional variables p0, p1, .... A substitution œÉ is a function from formulas to formulas which commutes with the connectives, i.e., :\\\\sigma f(A_1,\\\\dots,A_n)=f(\\\\sigma A_1,\\\\dots,\\\\sigma A_n) for every connective f, and formulas A1, ..., An. (We may also apply substitutions to sets Œì of formulas, making ) A Tarski-style consequence relationBlok & Pigozzi (1989), Kracht (2007) is a relation \\\\vdash between sets of formulas, and formulas, such that for all formulas A, B, and sets of formulas Œì, Œî. A consequence relation such that for all substitutions œÉ is called structural. (Note that the term \\"structural\\" as used here and below is unrelated to the notion of structural rules in sequent calculi.) A structural consequence relation is called a propositional logic. A formula A is a theorem of a logic \\\\vdash if \\\\varnothing\\\\vdash A. For example, we identify a superintuitionistic logic L with its standard consequence relation \\\\vdash_L axiomatizable by modus ponens and axioms, and we identify a normal modal logic with its global consequence relation \\\\vdash_L axiomatized by modus ponens, necessitation, and axioms. A structural inference ruleRybakov (1997), Def. 1.1.3 (or just rule for short) is given by a pair (Œì,B), usually written as :\\\\frac{A_1,\\\\dots,A_n}B\\\\qquad\\\\text{or}\\\\qquad A_1,\\\\dots,A_n/B, where Œì = {A1, ..., An} is a finite set of formulas, and B is a formula. An instance of the rule is :\\\\sigma A_1,\\\\dots,\\\\sigma A_n/\\\\sigma B for a substitution œÉ. The rule Œì/B is derivable in \\\\vdash, if \\\\Gamma\\\\vdash B. It is admissible if for every instance of the rule, œÉB is a theorem whenever all formulas from œÉŒì are theorems.Rybakov (1997), Def. 1.7.2 In other words, a rule is admissible if, when added to the logic, does not lead to new theorems.From de Jongh‚Äôs theorem to intuitionistic logic of proofs We also write \\\\Gamma\\\\,\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\sim B if Œì/B is admissible. (Note that \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\sim is a structural consequence relation on its own.) Every derivable rule is admissible, but not vice versa in general. A logic is structurally complete if every admissible rule is derivable, i.e., {\\\\vdash}={\\\\,\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\sim}.Rybakov (1997), Def. 1.7.7 In logics with a well-behaved conjunction connective (such as superintuitionistic or modal logics), a rule A_1,\\\\dots,A_n/B is equivalent to A_1\\\\land\\\\dots\\\\land A_n/B with respect to admissibility and derivability. It is therefore customary to only deal with unary rules A/B. Examples *Classical propositional calculus (CPC) is structurally complete.Chagrov & Zakharyaschev (1997), Thm. 1.25 Indeed, assume that A/B is non-derivable rule, and fix an assignment v such that v(A) = 1, and v(B) = 0. Define a substitution œÉ such that for every variable p, œÉp = \\\\top if v(p) = 1, and œÉp = \\\\bot if v(p) = 0. Then œÉA is a theorem, but œÉB is not (in fact, ¬¨œÉB is a theorem). Thus the rule A/B is not admissible either. (The same argument applies to any multi-valued logic L complete with respect to a logical matrix whose all elements have a name in the language of L.) *The Kreisel‚ÄìPutnam rule (a.k.a. Harrop's rule, or independence of premise rule) ::(\\\\mathit{KPR})\\\\qquad\\\\frac{ eg p\\\\to q\\\\lor r}{( eg p\\\\to q)\\\\lor( eg p\\\\to r)} :is admissible in the intuitionistic propositional calculus (IPC). In fact, it is admissible in every superintuitionistic logic.Prucnal (1979), cf. Iemhoff (2006) On the other hand, the formula ::( eg p\\\\to q\\\\lor r)\\\\to (( eg p\\\\to q)\\\\lor( eg p\\\\to r)) :is not an intuitionistic tautology, hence KPR is not derivable in IPC. In particular, IPC is not structurally complete. *The rule ::\\\\frac{\\\\Box p}p :is admissible in many modal logics, such as K, D, K4, S4, GL (see this table for names of modal logics). It is derivable in S4, but it is not derivable in K, D, K4, or GL. *The rule ::\\\\frac{\\\\Diamond p\\\\land\\\\Diamond eg p}\\\\bot :is admissible in every normal modal logic.Rybakov (1997), p. 439 It is derivable in GL and S4.1, but it is not derivable in K, D, K4, S4, S5. *L√∂b's rule ::(\\\\mathit{LR})\\\\qquad\\\\frac{\\\\Box p\\\\to p}p :is admissible (but not derivable) in the basic modal logic K, and it is derivable in GL. However, LR is not admissible in K4. In particular, it is not true in general that a rule admissible in a logic L must be admissible in its extensions. *The G√∂del‚ÄìDummett logic (LC), and the modal logic Grz.3 are structurally complete.Rybakov (1997), Thms. 5.4.4, 5.4.8 The product fuzzy logic is also structurally complete.Cintula & Metcalfe (2009) Decidability and reduced rules The basic question about admissible rules of a given logic is whether the set of all admissible rules is decidable. Note that the problem is nontrivial even if the logic itself (i.e., its set of theorems) is decidable: the definition of admissibility of a rule A/B involves an unbounded universal quantifier over all propositional substitutions, hence a priori we only know that admissibility of rule in a decidable logic is \\\\Pi^0_1 (i.e., its complement is recursively enumerable). For instance, it is known that admissibility in the bimodal logics Ku and K4u (the extensions of K or K4 with the universal modality) is undecidable.Wolter & Zakharyaschev (2008) Remarkably, decidability of admissibility in the basic modal logic K is a major open problem. Nevertheless, admissibility of rules is known to be decidable in many modal and superintuitionistic logics. The first decision procedures for admissible rules in basic transitive modal logics were constructed by Rybakov, using the reduced form of rules.Rybakov (1997), ¬ß3.9 A modal rule in variables p0, ..., pk is called reduced if it has the form :\\\\frac{\\\\bigvee_{i=0}^n\\\\bigl(\\\\bigwedge_{j=0}^k eg_{i,j}^0p_j\\\\land\\\\bigwedge_{j=0}^k eg_{i,j}^1\\\\Box p_j\\\\bigr)}{p_0}, where each eg_{i,j}^u is either blank, or negation eg. For each rule r, we can effectively construct a reduced rule s (called the reduced form of r) such that any logic admits (or derives) r if and only if it admits (or derives) s, by introducing extension variables for all subformulas in A, and expressing the result in the full disjunctive normal form. It is thus sufficient to construct a decision algorithm for admissibility of reduced rules. Let \\\\textstyle\\\\bigvee_{i=0}^n\\\\varphi_i/p_0 be a reduced rule as above. We identify every conjunction \\\\varphi_i with the set \\\\\\\\{ eg_{i,j}^0p_j, eg_{i,j}^1\\\\Box p_j\\\\mid j\\\\le k\\\\\\\\} of its conjuncts. For any subset W of the set \\\\\\\\{\\\\varphi_i\\\\mid i\\\\le n\\\\\\\\} of all conjunctions, let us define a Kripke model M=\\\\langle W,R,{\\\\Vdash}\\\\rangle by :\\\\varphi_i\\\\Vdash p_j\\\\iff p_j\\\\in\\\\varphi_i, :\\\\varphi_i\\\\,R\\\\,\\\\varphi_{i'}\\\\iff\\\\forall j\\\\le k\\\\,(\\\\Box p_j\\\\in\\\\varphi_i\\\\Rightarrow\\\\\\\\{p_j,\\\\Box p_j\\\\\\\\}\\\\subseteq\\\\varphi_{i'}). Then the following provides an algorithmic criterion for admissibility in K4:Rybakov (1997), Thm. 3.9.3 Theorem. The rule \\\\textstyle\\\\bigvee_{i=0}^n\\\\varphi_i/p_0 is not admissible in K4 if and only if there exists a set W\\\\subseteq\\\\\\\\{\\\\varphi_i\\\\mid i\\\\le n\\\\\\\\} such that #\\\\varphi_i Vdash p_0 for some i\\\\le n, #\\\\varphi_i\\\\Vdash\\\\varphi_i for every i\\\\le n, #for every subset D of W there exist elements \\\\alpha,\\\\beta\\\\in W such that the equivalences ::\\\\alpha\\\\Vdash\\\\Box p_j if and only if \\\\varphi\\\\Vdash p_j\\\\land\\\\Box p_j for every \\\\varphi\\\\in D ::\\\\alpha\\\\Vdash\\\\Box p_j if and only if \\\\alpha\\\\Vdash p_j and \\\\varphi\\\\Vdash p_j\\\\land\\\\Box p_j for every \\\\varphi\\\\in D :hold for all j. Similar criteria can be found for the logics S4, GL, and Grz.Rybakov (1997), Thms. 3.9.6, 3.9.9, 3.9.12; cf. Chagrov & Zakharyaschev (1997), ¬ß16.7 Furthermore, admissibility in intuitionistic logic can be reduced to admissibility in Grz using the G√∂del‚ÄìMcKinsey‚ÄìTarski translation:Rybakov (1997), Thm. 3.2.2 :A\\\\,\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\sim_{IPC}B if and only if T(A)\\\\,\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\sim_{Grz}T(B). Rybakov (1997) developed much more sophisticated techniques for showing decidability of admissibility, which apply to a robust (infinite) class of transitive (i.e., extending K4 or IPC) modal and superintuitionistic logics, including e.g. S4.1, S4.2, S4.3, KC, Tk (as well as the above-mentioned logics IPC, K4, S4, GL, Grz).Rybakov (1997), ¬ß3.5 Despite being decidable, the admissibility problem has relatively high computational complexity, even in simple logics: admissibility of rules in the basic transitive logics IPC, K4, S4, GL, Grz is coNEXP-complete.Je≈ô√°bek (2007) This should be contrasted with the derivability problem (for rules or formulas) in these logics, which is PSPACE-complete.Chagrov & Zakharyaschev (1997), ¬ß18.5 Projectivity and unification Admissibility in propositional logics is closely related to unification in the equational theory of modal or Heyting algebras. The connection was developed by Ghilardi (1999, 2000). In the logical setup, a unifier of a formula A in a logic L (an L-unifier for short) is a substitution œÉ such that œÉA is a theorem of L. (Using this notion, we can rephrase admissibility of a rule A/B in L as \\"every L-unifier of A is an L-unifier of B\\".) An L-unifier œÉ is less general than an L-unifier œÑ, written as œÉ ‚â§ œÑ, if there exists a substitution œÖ such that :\\\\vdash_L\\\\sigma p\\\\leftrightarrow \\\\upsilon\\\\tau p for every variable p. A complete set of unifiers of a formula A is a set S of L-unifiers of A such that every L-unifier of A is less general than some unifier from S. A most general unifier (mgu) of A is a unifier œÉ such that {œÉ} is a complete set of unifiers of A. It follows that if S is a complete set of unifiers of A, then a rule A/B is L-admissible if and only if every œÉ in S is an L-unifier of B. Thus we can characterize admissible rules if we can find well-behaved complete sets of unifiers. An important class of formulas which have a most general unifier are the projective formulas: these are formulas A such that there exists a unifier œÉ of A such that :A\\\\vdash_L B\\\\leftrightarrow\\\\sigma B for every formula B. Note that œÉ is a mgu of A. In transitive modal and superintuitionistic logics with the finite model property (fmp), one can characterize projective formulas semantically as those whose set of finite L-models has the extension property:Ghilardi (2000), Thm. 2.2 if M is a finite Kripke L-model with a root r whose cluster is a singleton, and the formula A holds in all points of M except for r, then we can change the valuation of variables in r so as to make A true in r as well. Moreover, the proof provides an explicit construction of a mgu for a given projective formula A. In the basic transitive logics IPC, K4, S4, GL, Grz (and more generally in any transitive logic with the fmp whose set of finite frame satisfies another kind of extension property), we can effectively construct for any formula A its projective approximation Œ†(A):Ghilardi (2000), p. 196 a finite set of projective formulas such that #P\\\\vdash_L A for every P\\\\in\\\\Pi(A), #every unifier of A is a unifier of a formula from Œ†(A). It follows that the set of mgus of elements of Œ†(A) is a complete set of unifiers of A. Furthermore, if P is a projective formula, then :P\\\\,\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\sim_L B if and only if P\\\\vdash_L B for any formula B. Thus we obtain the following effective characterization of admissible rules:Ghilardi (2000), Thm. 3.6 :A\\\\,\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\sim_L B if and only if \\\\forall P\\\\in\\\\Pi(A)\\\\,(P\\\\vdash_L B). Bases of admissible rules Let L be a logic. A set R of L-admissible rule is called a basisRybakov (1997), Def. 1.4.13 of admissible rules, if every admissible rule Œì/B can be derived from R and the derivable rules of L, using substitution, composition, and weakening. In other words, R is a basis if and only if \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\sim_L is the smallest structural consequence relation which includes \\\\vdash_L and R. Notice that decidability of admissible rules of a decidable logic is equivalent to the existence of recursive (or recursively enumerable) bases: on the one hand, the set of all admissible rule is a recursive basis if admissibility is decidable. On the other hand, the set of admissible rules is always co-r.e., and if we further have an r.e. basis, it is also r.e., hence it is decidable. (In other words, we can decide admissibility of A/B by the following algorithm: we start in parallel two exhaustive searches, one for a substitution œÉ which unifies A but not B, and one for a derivation of A/B from R and \\\\vdash_L. One of the searches has to eventually come up with an answer.) Apart from decidability, explicit bases of admissible rules are useful for some applications, e.g. in proof complexity.Mints & Kojevnikov (2004) For a given logic, we can ask whether it has a recursive or finite basis of admissible rules, and to provide an explicit basis. If a logic has no finite basis, it can nevertheless has an independent basis: a basis R such that no proper subset of R is a basis. In general, very little can be said about existence of bases with desirable properties. For example, while tabular logics are generally well-behaved, and always finitely axiomatizable, there exist tabular modal logics without a finite or independent basis of rules.Rybakov (1997), Thm. 4.5.5 Finite bases are relatively rare: even the basic transitive logics IPC, K4, S4, GL, Grz do not have a finite basis of admissible rules,Rybakov (1997), ¬ß4.2 though they have independent bases.Je≈ô√°bek (2008) =Examples of bases= *The empty set is a basis of L-admissible rules if and only if L is structurally complete. *Every extension of the modal logic S4.3 (including, notably, S5) has a finite basis consisting of the single ruleRybakov (1997), Cor. 4.3.20 ::\\\\frac{\\\\Diamond p\\\\land\\\\Diamond eg p}\\\\bot. *Visser's rules ::\\\\frac{\\\\displaystyle\\\\Bigl(\\\\bigwedge_{i=1}^n(p_i\\\\to q_i)\\\\to p_{n+1}\\\\lor p_{n+2}\\\\Bigr)\\\\lor r}{\\\\displaystyle\\\\bigvee_{j=1}^{n+2}\\\\Bigl(\\\\bigwedge_{i=1}^{n}(p_i\\\\to q_i)\\\\to p_j\\\\Bigr)\\\\lor r},\\\\qquad n\\\\ge 1 :are a basis of admissible rules in IPC or KC.Iemhoff (2001, 2005), Rozi√®re (1992) *The rules ::\\\\frac{\\\\displaystyle\\\\Box\\\\Bigl(\\\\Box q\\\\to\\\\bigvee_{i=1}^n\\\\Box p_i\\\\Bigr)\\\\lor\\\\Box r}{\\\\displaystyle\\\\bigvee_{i=1}^n\\\\Box(q\\\\land\\\\Box q\\\\to p_i)\\\\lor r},\\\\qquad n\\\\ge0 :are a basis of admissible rules of GL.Je≈ô√°bek (2005) (Note that the empty disjunction is defined as \\\\bot.) *The rules ::\\\\frac{\\\\displaystyle\\\\Box\\\\Bigl(\\\\Box(q\\\\to\\\\Box q)\\\\to\\\\bigvee_{i=1}^n\\\\Box p_i\\\\Bigr)\\\\lor\\\\Box r}{\\\\displaystyle\\\\bigvee_{i=1}^n\\\\Box(\\\\Box q\\\\to p_i)\\\\lor r},\\\\qquad n\\\\ge0 :are a basis of admissible rules of S4 or Grz.Je≈ô√°bek (2005,2008) Semantics for admissible rules A rule Œì/B is valid in a modal or intuitionistic Kripke frame F=\\\\langle W,R\\\\rangle, if the following is true for every valuation \\\\Vdash in F: :if \\\\forall x\\\\in W\\\\,(x\\\\Vdash A) for all A\\\\in\\\\Gamma, then \\\\forall x\\\\in W\\\\,(x\\\\Vdash B). (The definition readily generalizes to general frames, if needed.) Let X be a subset of W, and t a point in W. We say that t is *a reflexive tight predecessor of X, if for every y in W: t R y if and only if t = y or x = y or x R y for some x in X, *an irreflexive tight predecessor of X, if for every y in W: t R y if and only if x = y or x R y for some x in X. We say that a frame F has reflexive (irreflexive) tight predecessors, if for every finite subset X of W, there exists a reflexive (irreflexive) tight predecessor of X in W. We have:Iemhoff (2001), Je≈ô√°bek (2005) *a rule is admissible in IPC if and only if it is valid in all intuitionistic frames which have reflexive tight predecessors, *a rule is admissible in K4 if and only if it is valid in all transitive frames which have reflexive and irreflexive tight predecessors, *a rule is admissible in S4 if and only if it is valid in all transitive reflexive frames which have reflexive tight predecessors, *a rule is admissible in GL if and only if it is valid in all transitive converse well-founded frames which have irreflexive tight predecessors. Note that apart from a few trivial cases, frames with tight predecessors must be infinite, hence admissible rules in basic transitive logics do not enjoy the finite model property. Structural completeness While a general classification of structurally complete logics is not an easy task, we have a good understanding of some special cases. Intuitionistic logic itself is not structurally complete, but its fragments may behave differently. Namely, any disjunction-free rule or implication-free rule admissible in a superintuitionistic logic is derivable.Rybakov (1997), Thms. 5.5.6, 5.5.9 On the other hand, the Mints rule :\\\\frac{(p\\\\to q)\\\\to p\\\\lor r}{((p\\\\to q)\\\\to p)\\\\lor((p\\\\to q)\\\\to r)} is admissible in intuitionistic logic but not derivable, and contains only implications and disjunctions. We know the maximal structurally incomplete transitive logics. A logic is called hereditarily structurally complete, if any extension is structurally complete. For example, classical logic, as well as the logics LC and Grz.3 mentioned above, are hereditarily structurally complete. A complete description of hereditarily structurally complete superintuitionistic and transitive modal logics was given respectively by Citkin and Rybakov. Namely, a superintuitionistic logic is hereditarily structurally complete if and only if it is not valid in any of the five Kripke frames ::File:Tsitkin frames.svg Similarly, an extension of K4 is hereditarily structurally complete if and only if it is not valid in any of certain twenty Kripke frames (including the five intuitionistic frames above). There exist structurally complete logics that are not hereditarily structurally complete: for example, Medvedev's logic is structurally complete,Prucnal (1976) but it is included in the structurally incomplete logic KC. Variants A rule with parameters is a rule of the form :\\\\frac{A(p_1,\\\\dots,p_n,s_1,\\\\dots,s_k)}{B(p_1,\\\\dots,p_n,s_1,\\\\dots,s_k)}, whose variables are divided into the \\"regular\\" variables pi, and the parameters si. The rule is L-admissible if every L-unifier œÉ of A such that œÉsi = si for each i is also a unifier of B. The basic decidability results for admissible rules also carry to rules with parameters.Rybakov (1997), ¬ß6.1 A multiple-conclusion rule is a pair (Œì,Œî) of two finite sets of formulas, written as :\\\\frac{A_1,\\\\dots,A_n}{B_1,\\\\dots,B_m}\\\\qquad\\\\text{or}\\\\qquad A_1,\\\\dots,A_n/B_1,\\\\dots,B_m. Such a rule is admissible if every unifier of Œì is also a unifier of some formula from Œî.Je≈ô√°bek (2005); cf. Kracht (2007), ¬ß7 For example, a logic L is consistent iff it admits the rule :\\\\frac{\\\\;\\\\bot\\\\;}{}, and a superintuitionistic logic has the disjunction property iff it admits the rule :\\\\frac{p\\\\lor q}{p,q}. Again, basic results on admissible rules generalize smoothly to multiple-conclusion rules.Je≈ô√°bek (2005, 2007, 2008) In logics with a variant of the disjunction property, the multiple-conclusion rules have the same expressive power as single-conclusion rules: for example, in S4 the rule above is equivalent to :\\\\frac{A_1,\\\\dots,A_n}{\\\\Box B_1\\\\lor\\\\dots\\\\lor\\\\Box B_m}. Nevertheless, multiple- conclusion rules can often be employed to simplify arguments. In proof theory, admissibility is often considered in the context of sequent calculi, where the basic objects are sequents rather than formulas. For example, one can rephrase the cut-elimination theorem as saying that the cut-free sequent calculus admits the cut rule :\\\\frac{\\\\Gamma\\\\vdash A,\\\\Delta\\\\qquad\\\\Pi,A\\\\vdash\\\\Lambda}{\\\\Gamma,\\\\Pi\\\\vdash\\\\Delta,\\\\Lambda}. (By abuse of language, it is also sometimes said that the (full) sequent calculus admits cut, meaning its cut-free version does.) However, admissibility in sequent calculi is usually only a notational variant for admissibility in the corresponding logic: any complete calculus for (say) intuitionistic logic admits a sequent rule if and only if IPC admits the formula rule which we obtain by translating each sequent \\\\Gamma\\\\vdash\\\\Delta to its characteristic formula \\\\bigwedge\\\\Gamma\\\\to\\\\bigvee\\\\Delta.

Paper cuts, though named from paper, can also be caused by other thin, stiff, and abrasive materials. Description Although a loose paper sheet is usually too soft to cut, it can be very thin (sometimes as thin as a razor edge), being then able to exert high levels of pressure, enough to cut the skin. Paper cuts are most often caused by paper sheets that are strongly fastened together (such as brand new sheet of paper out of a ream), because one single paper sheet might be dislocated from the rest. Thus all the other sheets are holding this dislocated sheet in position, making it stiff enough to act as a razor. Pain Paper cuts can be surprisingly painful as they can stimulate a large number of skin surface nociceptors (pain receptors) in a very small area of the skin. Because the shallow cut does not bleed very much, the pain receptors are left open to the air, causing continued pain. This is exacerbated by irritation caused by the fibers in the paper itself, which may be coated in chemicals such as bleach. Additionally, most paper cuts occur in the fingers, which have a greater concentration of sensory receptors than the rest of the body.

McCarty was elected to the Florida House of Representatives, and served as its speaker, and was later elected the 31st Governor of Florida. Early life Dan McCarty was born in Fort Pierce, Florida, the son of a prominent local family, and grew up in a large house on Indian River Drive just south of the present courthouse in downtown Fort Pierce. He attended local public schools including the University of Florida. While at the University of Florida he was extremely active within Florida Blue Key, Student Government, the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity, and ROTC. After finishing his education in 1934, McCarty became a cattleman and citrus grower in Fort Pierce. He married Olie Brown with whom he had three children. During World War II, he served in the U.S. Army, was promoted to the rank of colonel, and was decorated with the Bronze Star Medal, the Purple Heart, the Legion of Merit, and the French Croix de Guerre. During World War II, he distinguished himself by being among those who landed on D-Day with the Seventh Army in the South of France.Allen Morris, The Florida Handbook at 331 (1997-1998 ed.) Political career He began his political career when in 1937, he was elected to the Florida House of Representatives where he served until 1941. During the 1941 session, he served as speaker of the house. In 1948 he was the runner up for the Democratic nomination for governor. Four years later in 1952, he ran for governor again, and this time was successful in winning the office. During his tenure, he reformed purchasing and hiring practices by the state government, boosted teachers' salaries and created scholarships for teacher training, opposed oil exploration in the Everglades, and instituted aid programs for the disabled. A chain smoker, McCarty's health was already weakened by the end of the 1952 Gubernatorial contest. On February 25, 1953, shortly after assuming the governorship, he suffered a debilitating heart attack. For months McCarty struggled to regain his strength, spending most of his days working in the Governor's mansion. Finally in early September he contracted a severe case of pneumonia and died on September 28, 1953, in Tallahassee. After a large funeral at his lifelong parish church, the old Carpenter Gothic St. Andrew's Episcopal Church across the street from his boyhood home in Fort Pierce, he was buried in the Palms Cemetery three miles south on Indian River Drive in Ankona. The beginning of the bumper-to-bumper funeral procession reached the small cemetery before the last cars had left the church area. Dan McCarty Middle School, in St. Lucie County, was named in his honor.

Also called Hushang Shah Gori, he was known as Alp Khan before he took on the title Hoshang Shah after being crowned the ruler of Malwa. Alp Khan's father Dilawar Khan Ghori had belonged to the court of Firozshah Tughlaq, the Sultan of Delhi. Dilawar Khan Gori was appointed governor of Malwa probably by Firuz of the house of Tughlaq, but made himself independent of the Delhi Sultanate for all practical purposes in 1401.An Advanced History of India:R C Majumdar, 2006, p. 304 Thus he had practically come to Mandu in 1401 as the first King of Malwa, although he did not declare himself a king. Biography Dilawar had also shifted the capital from Dhar to Mandu, renaming it Shadiabad, the city of joy. Hoshang Shah showed promise of being equally able and much bolder than his father. In fact, he was far more ambitious and did not care what steps he took to achieve his ambition. There is an interesting story of how he obtained the finest elephants from Odisha. The year was 1421. Hoshang Shah was furious to know that the King of Odisha refused to send him the best elephants in Odisha. One fine morning, he left Mandu, taking a thousand soldiers with him. His destination was Jajpur, in Odisha. They disguised themselves as merchants and carried with them several things not readily available in Odisha. Hoshang Shah also led a team of excellent horses, taking care to choose the kind particularly favoured by the King of Odisha. Everyone knew the latter‚Äôs love for bright bay, bright chestnut and grey horses. Hoshang Shah was sure he could not fail to be impressed by the ones he was taking along. Rani Rupmati Pavilion at Mandu Jahaz Mahal It took them a full month to reach Odisha from Mandu. Their disguise was so perfect that no one suspected that they were anything but ordinary merchants. When the king came to inspect the horses, Hoshang Shah‚Äôs men captured him. Hoshang Shah let him free only after the king promised to gift 100 of the very best elephants and to let him out of Odisha safely. Thus Hoshang Shah marched back to Mandu in triumph. Hoshang Shah ruled Malwa for 27 years. Some historians claim that despite being a warrior, he had a sympathetic heart and was dearly loved by his subjects. Some claims that he was a partial ruler and extended his patronage to only muslims. He is also remembered for his wonderful taste in architecture. It was he who made Mandu one of the most impregnable forts of India. At Dhar, the old capital of the kingdom of Malwa, two mosques were built wholly out of the remains of destroyed temples; the domes and pillars of these mosques were of Hindu form. But the buildings at Mandu, where the capital was soon transferred, were marked by the predominance of Muslim traditions. Among the many buildings of splendid architectural beauty built in the fortified city of Mandu, situated in an extensive plateau over-looking the Narmada River, the following deserve mention - the Jami Masjid, which was planned and begun by Hushang Shah and completed by Mahmud Khalji, the Hindola Mahal, the Jahaz Mahal, Hushang Shah's tomb, and Baz Bahadur's and Rani Roopmati's palaces.An Advanced History of India:R C Majumdar, 2006, pp. 412-413 The Hoshangabad city in Madhya Pradesh, India, was earlier called Narmadapur after the river Narmada, however later the name was changed to Hoshangabad.

The Interstate runs from I-64 and I-264 in Chesapeake north to I-64 in Hampton. I-664 forms the west side of the Hampton Roads Beltway, a circumferential highway serving the Hampton Roads metropolitan area. The Interstate crosses Hampton Roads via the Monitor-Merrimac Memorial Bridge- Tunnel between Suffolk and Newport News. I-664 is connected to the other major cities of the metropolitan area--Portsmouth, Norfolk, and Virginia Beach--by I-264. The Interstate also has a connection to Portsmouth through Virginia State Route 164 (SR 164) and to Suffolk via U.S. Route 13 (US 13), US 58, and US 460. Route description View north along I-664 between Terminal Avenue and US 60 in Newport News I-664 begins at a full Y interchange with I-64 and I-264 that serves as the terminus of all three Interstates in the Bowers Hill section of the city of Chesapeake. I-64 heads southeast as a continuation of the Hampton Roads Beltway through Chesapeake while I-264 heads east toward Portsmouth and Norfolk. I-664 heads west as an eight-lane freeway that has a southbound-only exit ramp to US 13 and US 460 (Military Highway) and crosses over Military Highway and a Norfolk Southern Railway rail line. The Interstate has a cloverleaf interchange with Military Highway, which here carries US 58 in addition to US 13 and US 460. The interchange also provides access to US 460 Alternate, which follows US 58 east into Portsmouth. I-664 curves north as a four-lane freeway that crosses Goose Creek and has a diamond interchange with SR 663 (Dock Landing Road) and a cloverleaf interchange with SR 337 (Portsmouth Boulevard). Just south of its partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 659 (Pughsville Road), I-664 crosses a rail line; a spur from that rail line heads north in the median of the freeway as the highway enters the city of Suffolk. The rail spur leaves the median and heads northeast toward Portsmouth just south of its interchange with SR 164 (Western Freeway) and US 17 (Bridge Road). SR 164 heads east toward downtown Portsmouth while US 17 heads northwest to the James River Bridge. There is no access from southbound I-664 to southbound US 17; that movement is made via the next interchange, a cloverleaf interchange with SR 135 (College Drive) that serves the satellite campus of Old Dominion University and the community of Churchland. North of SR 135, northbound I-664 has a vehicle inspection station and crossovers before the highway enters the Monitor-Merrimac Memorial Bridge-Tunnel. The bridge- tunnel passes to the west of Craney Island, an artificial island in the city of Portsmouth that lies to the west of the mouth of the Elizabeth River. West of the highway is the confluence of the James River and Nansemond River to form Hampton Roads, as well as the James River Bridge a short distance to the north on the namesake river. I-664 heads north-northeast along a causeway for to a point west of the Newport News Middle Ground Light, where the pair of bridges curve to the north-northwest onto an artificial island where the highway descends into a pair of tunnels under the estuary's main shipping channel. The Interstate resurfaces on another artificial island at Newport News Point east of the coal piers in the city of Newport News. Monitor- Merrimac Memorial Bridge-Tunnel I-664 has a southbound vehicle inspection station adjacent to its first interchange in Newport News, with Terminal Avenue. The Interstate parallels the southern end of CSX's Peninsula Subdivision as it passes through interchanges with several streets to the east of downtown Newport News. The southern interchange has ramps to and from 25th, 26th, and 27th streets; the first two streets carry eastbound and westbound US 60, which is unmarked from I-664. The northern interchange has ramps to and from 35th Street and Jefferson Avenue; Jefferson Avenue is SR 143, which is also unmarked from the Interstate. I-664 curves east as a six-lane freeway away from the railroad and has an oblique crossing of SR 351 (39th Street) prior to half-diamond interchanges with Roanoke Avenue and Chestnut Avenue. The Interstate enters the city of Hampton and has diamond interchanges with Aberdeen Road and Powhatan Parkway before reaching its northern terminus at I-64. I-664 meets its parent highway at a directional T interchange above Newmarket Creek just south of Hampton Coliseum. The Hampton Roads Beltway continues east along I-64 through Hampton before crossing Hampton Roads on the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel into the city of Norfolk. History I-664 was completed in sections, beginning in 1971 with the construction of the 'Tunnel Road' section, which led from Aberdeen Road to Interstate 64. The road was built to lead northbound traffic from I-64 and Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel to downtown Newport News. The interchange at I-64, was rebuilt as a partial stack interchange in 1980. I-664 was completed in sections by 1989, between Aberdeen Road and the 26th/27th street exit ramps in Downtown Newport News. I-664 was completed in Suffolk and Chesapeake in 1990, between US 17 and Pughsville Road. With the opening of the Monitor‚ÄìMerrimac Memorial Bridge‚ÄìTunnel on April 30, 1992, I-664 was almost complete. I-664 between Pughsville Road and the Bowers Hill interchange was completed in 1993, thus completing I-664 as a whole.

It is calculated by finding the net profit as a percentage of the revenue. : \\\\text{net profit margin} = {\\\\text{net profit}\\\\over\\\\text{revenue}} = {{\\\\text{revenue} - \\\\text{cost}}\\\\over\\\\text{revenue}}  Overview  Profit margin is calculated with selling price (or revenue) taken as base times 100. It is the percentage of selling price that is turned into profit, whereas \\"profit percentage\\" or \\"markup\\" is the percentage of cost price that one gets as profit on top of cost price. While selling something one should know what percentage of profit one will get on a particular investment, so companies calculate profit percentage to find the ratio of profit to cost. The profit margin is used mostly for internal comparison. It is difficult to accurately compare the net profit ratio for different entities. Individual businesses' operating and financing arrangements vary so much that different entities are bound to have different levels of expenditure, so that comparison of one with another can have little meaning. A low profit margin indicates a low margin of safety: higher risk that a decline in sales will erase profits and result in a net loss, or a negative margin. Profit margin is an indicator of a company's pricing strategies and how well it controls costs. Differences in competitive strategy and product mix cause the profit margin to vary among different companies. * If an investor makes $10 revenue and it cost them $1 to earn it, when they take their cost away they are left with 90% margin. They made 900% profit on their $1 investment. * If an investor makes $10 revenue and it cost them $5 to earn it, when they take their cost away they are left with 50% margin. They made 100% profit on their $5 investment. * If an investor makes $10 revenue and it cost them $9 to earn it, when they take their cost away they are left with 10% margin. They made 11.11% profit on their $9 investment.  Profit percentage  On the other hand, profit percentage is calculated with cost price taken as base : \\\\text{profit percentage} = {\\\\text{net profit}\\\\over\\\\text{cost price}}\\\\cdot 100\\\\% Suppose that something is bought for $50 and sold for $100. :Cost price = $50 :Selling price (revenue) = $100 :Profit = $100 ‚àí $50 = $50 :Profit percentage = $50/$50 = 100% :Profit margin = ($100 - $50)/$100 = 50% :Return on investment multiple = $50 / $50 (profit divided by cost). If the revenue is the same as the cost, profit percentage is 0%. The result above or below 100% can be calculated as the percentage of return on investment. In this example, the return on investment is a multiple of 1.0 of the investment, resulting in a 100% gain.

It ranges from India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and Sri Lanka east to Indonesia and north to China and Russia. It is a solitary and shy bird, found in forests and open woodland at up to . Description This is a medium-sized cuckoo with both sexes alike. It has grey upperparts while the underside has broad black barring. The tail is barred with a broad subterminal dark band and a white tip. Young birds have white markings on the crown and white chin and throat contrasting with a dark face. Juveniles are browner and have broad white tips to the head and wing feathers. The eye-ring is gray to yellow (a feature shared with the common hawk-cuckoo). The iris is light brown to reddish. The female differs from the male in being slightly paler grey on the throat and in having more brown on the breast and tail. The barring on the belly is narrower than in the male. Nestlings have an orange-red mouth and yellow flanges to the gape. The call is loud with four notes. They have been transcribed as \\"orange-pekoe\\", \\"bo-ko-ta-ko\\", \\"crossword puzzle\\" or \\"one more bottle\\". In northern India, they can be locally common during the breeding season with densities estimated at a calling bird for every . They feed on hairy caterpillars and other insects but sometimes take fruits. They usually feed on the upper canopy, gleaning insects, sometimes making aerial sallies for flying termites or rarely even by hovering lower near the ground. Taxonomy and systematics Two subspecies are generally recognized. The nominate form is found in much of continental Asia, while concretus S. M√ºller, 1845 which is smaller and darker is known from the Malay Peninsula, Java, Sumatra and Borneo. The birds in the Amur region are larger and Swinhoe described a form from northern China as Cuculus michieanus while Walter Norman Koelz described a form fatidicus from northeastern India. Distribution and habitat The species is found widely distributed across Asia, from the Indian subcontinent eastwards to Southeast Asia. The preferred habitat is deciduous and evergreen forests but also occur in garden lands and thick scrub. Some populations in India migrate south in winter, although there are breeding populations in the southern areas as well, with specimens netted at night or recorded at lighthouses. The population in the Amurland of the Russia is migratory. Behaviour and ecology leftThe Indian cuckoo is a brood parasite. In Russia, females were found to pair with specific males during the breeding season. The male diverts the attention of hosts from their nest giving time for the female to lay her egg. It lays its single egg mostly in the nests of drongos and crows. Brown shrikes have been recorded as hosts in Russia. The female removes and eats an egg from the host nest before laying her own. The breeding season varies from May to July in northern China, March to August in India, January to June in Burma and January to August in the Malay Peninsula. The host species include Lanius cristatus in the Amur region, black drongo and Pica cyanea in China. In India, they have been found to be fed by black drongos and ashy drongo. Other hosts that have been recorded include black-headed oriole, streaked spiderhunter, Eurylaimus ochromalus and Dicrurus paradiseus. The eggs of the cuckoo hatch in 12 days while those of the brown shrike in the Amur region take 15 days. During the third or fourth day, the young bird bends its back when touched and heaves out other eggs or nestlings. This instinct is lost soon after.  In culture  The loud calls have led to numerous cultural interpretations. In Bengali, it is interpreted as \\"‡¶¨‡¶â ‡¶ï‡¶•‡¶æ ‡¶ï‡¶ì (bou-kotha-kao)\\", \\"Bride, please speak\\". In Uttarakhand and Nepal, it is rendered as \\"kafal pako\\", or \\"the kafal fruit (Myrica esculenta) is ripe\\", as is the case in May‚ÄìJune when calling increases. Very little variation is noted between regions. In the Kangra Valley of India, the call is interpreted as the soul of the dead shepherd uttering \\"where is my sheep\\". In China, the call is variously interpreted as \\"why not go home\\" (‰∏çÂ¶ÇÊ≠∏Âéª), \\"single lonely\\" (ÂÖâÊ£çÂ•ΩËã¶), \\"single happy\\" (ÂÖâÊ£çÂ•ΩÈÅé), \\"mother-in-law beats me\\" (ÂÆ∂Â©ÜÊâìÊàë), \\"catfish congee\\" (ÊªëÂì•ÁÖ≤Á≤•), \\"myna of pea\\" (Ë±åË±ÜÂÖ´Âì•), \\"pea and maize corn\\" (Ë±åË±ÜÂåÖË∞∑), \\"go to cut wheat\\" (Âø´Âø´Ââ≤È∫•), \\"Grandpa, Grandma, cut wheat, transplant rice\\" (ÈòøÂÖ¨ÈòøÂ©ÜÔºåÂâ≤È∫¶ÊèíÁ¶æ).

It is particularly popular and traditionally celebrated in the Indian states of West Bengal, Assam, Odisha, Tripura and the country of Bangladesh, and the diaspora from this region, and also in Mithilanchal regions of Bihar and Nepal. The festival is observed in the Indian calendar month of Ashwin, which corresponds to the months of September‚ÄìOctober in the Gregorian calendar, and is a ten-day festival, of which the last five are of significance. The puja is performed in homes and in the public, the latter featuring temporary stage and structural decorations (known as pandals). The festival is also marked by scripture recitations, performance arts, revelry, gift giving, family visits, feasting, and public processions. Durga puja is an important festival in the Shaktism tradition of Hinduism. As per Hindu scriptures, the festival marks the victory of goddess Durga in her battle against the shape-shifting asura, Mahishasura. Thus, the festival epitomises the victory of good over evil, though it is also in part a harvest festival celebrating the goddess as the motherly power behind all of life and creation. Durga puja coincides with Navaratri and Dussehra celebrations observed by other traditions of Hinduism, in which the Ram lila dance-drama is enacted, celebrating the victory of Rama against Ravana, and effigies of Ravana are burnt. The primary goddesses revered during Durga puja are Parvati Durga (a form of Parvati) and Lakshmi Durga (a form of Lakshmi), but celebrations also include other major deities of Hinduism such as Saraswati (the goddess of knowledge and music), Ganesha (the god of good beginnings), and Kartikeya (the god of war). In Bengali and Odia traditions, these deities are considered to be Durga's children and Durga puja is believed to commemorate Durga's visit to her natal home with her children. The festival is preceded by Mahalaya, which is believed to mark the start of Durga's journey to her natal home. Primary celebrations begin on the sixth day (Shasthi), on which the goddess is welcomed with rituals. The festival ends on the tenth day (Vijaya dashami), when devotees embark on a procession carrying the worshipped clay sculpture- idols to a river, or other water body, and immerse them, symbolic of her return to the divine cosmos and her marital home with Shiva in Kailash. Regional and community variations in celebration of the festival and rituals observed exist. Durga puja is an old tradition of Hinduism, though its exact origins are unclear. Surviving manuscripts from the 14th‚Äîcentury provide guidelines for Durga puja, while historical records suggest that the royalty and wealthy families were sponsoring major Durga puja festivities since at least the 16th-century. The prominence of Durga puja increased during the British Raj in the provinces of Bengal, Odisha and Assam. In today's time, the importance of Durga puja is as much as a social and cultural festival as a religious one, wherever it is observed. Over the years, Durga puja has become an inseparable part of Indian culture with innumerable people celebrating this festival in their own unique way while pertaining to tradition. Names In West Bengal, Odisha, Assam, and Tripura, Durga puja is also called Akalbodhan (literally, \\"untimely awakening of Durga\\"), Sharadiya pujo (\\"autumnal worship\\"), Sharodotsab (\\"festival of autumn\\"), Maha pujo (\\"grand puja\\"), Maayer pujo (\\"worship of the Mother\\"), Durga pujo, or merely Puja or Pujo. In Bangladesh, Durga puja has historically been celebrated as Bhagabati puja. Durga puja is also referred to by the names of related Shakta Hindu festivals such as Navaratri, celebrated on the same days elsewhere in India; such as in Bihar, Jharkhand, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Kerala, and Maharashtra, Kullu dussehra, celebrated in Kullu Valley, Himachal Pradesh; Mysore dussehra celebrated in Mysore, Karnataka; Bommai golu, celebrated in Tamil Nadu; Bommala koluvu, celebrated in Andhra Pradesh; and Bathukamma, celebrated in Telangana. History and origins Durga is an ancient deity of Hinduism according to available archeological and textual evidence. However, the origins of Durga puja are unclear and undocumented. Surviving manuscripts from the 14th-century provide guidelines for Durga puja, while historical records suggest the royalty and wealthy families to be sponsoring major Durga Puja public festivities, since at least the 16th-century. The 11th or 12th-century Jain text Yasatilaka by Somadeva mentions an annual festival dedicated to a warrior goddess, celebrated by the king and his armed forces, and the description mirrors attributes of Durga puja. The Dadhimati Mata Temple of Rajasthan preserves a Durga-related inscription from chapter 10 of Devi Mahatmya. The temple inscription has been dated by modern methods to 608 CE. The name Durga, and related terms, appear in Vedic literature, such as in the Rigveda hymns 4.28, 5.34, 8.27, 8.47, 8.93 and 10.127, and in sections 10.1 and 12.4 of the AtharvavedaMonier Monier-Williams (1899), Sanskrit English Dictionary with Etymology, Oxford University Press, page 487Maurice Bloomfield (1906), A Vedic concordance, Series editor: Charles Lanman, Harvard University Press, page 486; A deity named Durgi appears in section 10.1.7 of the Taittiriya Aranyaka. While the Vedic literature uses the word Durga, the description therein lacks legendary details about her or about Durga puja that is found in later Hindu literature.A key text associated with Durga puja is Devi Mahatmya, which is recited during the festival. Durga was likely well established by the time this Hindu text was composed, which scholars variously estimate Durgato date between 400 and 600 CE. The Devi Mahatmya scripture describes the nature of evil forces symbolised by Mahishasura as shape- shifting, deceptive, and adapting in nature, in form and in strategy to create difficulties and thus achieve their evil ends. Durga calmly understands and counters the evil in order to achieve her solemn goals.Durga, in her various forms, appears as an independent deity in the Indian texts. Both Yudhisthira and Arjuna characters of the Mahabharata invoke hymns to Durga. She appears in Harivamsa in the form of Vishnu's eulogy, and in Pradyumna's prayer. The prominent mention of Durga in such epics may have led to her worship.A display of sculpture-idols depicting Rama praying to DurgaThe Indian texts with mentions of Durga puja are inconsistent. A legend found in some versions of the Puranas mention it to be a spring festival, while the Devi-Bhagavata Purana and two other Shakta Puranas mention it to be an autumn festival. The Ramayana manuscripts are also inconsistent. Versions of Ramayana found in north, west, and south of the Indian subcontinent describe Rama to be remembering Surya (the Hindu sun god) before his battle against Ravana, but the Bengali manuscripts of Ramayana, such as the 15th-century manuscript by Krttivasa, mention Rama to be worshipping Durga.According to some scholars, the worship of the fierce warrior goddess Durga, and her darker and more violent manifestation Kali, became popular in the Bengal region during and after the medieval era, marked by Muslim invasions and conquests. The significance of Durga and other goddesses in Hindu culture is stated to have increased after Islamicate armies conquered regions of the Indian subcontinent. According to yet other scholars, the marginalisation of Bengali Hindus during the medieval era led to a reassertion of Hindu identity and an emphasis on Durga puja as a social festival, publicly celebrating the warrior goddess.From the medieval era up to present-day, Durga puja has been celebrated as a socio-cultural event, while maintaining the roots of religious worship. Rituals and practices Durga puja is a ten-day event, of which the last five days involve certain rituals and practices. The festival begins with Mahalaya, a day on which Hindus perform tarpa·πáa by offering water and food to their dead ancestors. The day also marks the advent of Durga from her mythological marital home in Kailash. The next significant day of the festival is the sixth day (Sashthi), on which devotees welcomes the goddess and festive celebrations are inaugurated. On the seventh day (Saptami), eighth (Ashtami) and ninth (Navami) days, the goddess along with Lakshmi, Saraswati, Ganesha, and Kartikeya are revered and these days mark the main days of worship with recitation of scriptures, puja, legends of Durga in Devi Mahatmya, social visits to elaborately decorated and illuminated pandals (temporary structures meant for hosting the puja), among others. Durga puja is, in part, a post- monsoon harvest festival observed on the same days in the Shaktism tradition of Hinduism as those in its other traditions. The practice of including a bundle of nine different plants, called navapatrika, as a symbolism of Durga, is a testament practice to its agricultural importance. The typically selected plants include not only representative important crops, but also non-crops. This probably signifies the Hindu belief that the goddess is \\"not merely the power inherent in the growth of crops but the power inherent in all vegetation\\".The festival is a social and public event in eastern and northeastern states of India, where it dominates religious and socio-cultural life, with temporary pandals built at community squares, roadside shrines, and temples. The festival is also observed by some Shakta Hindus as a private home-based festival.The festival is started at twilight with prayers to Saraswati. She is believed to be another aspect of goddess Durga, and who is the external and internal activity of all existence, in everything and everywhere. This is typically also the day on which the eyes of the deities on the representative clay sculpture-idols are painted, bringing them to a lifelike appearance. The day also marks prayers to Ganesha and visit to pandals temples.Day two to five mark the remembrance of the goddess and her manifestations, such as Kumari (goddess of fertility), Mai (mother), Ajima (grandmother), Lakshmi (goddess of wealth) and in some regions as the Saptamatrikas (seven mothers) or Navadurga (nine aspects of Durga). On the sixth day major festivities and social celebrations start. The first nine days overlap with Navaratri festivities in other traditions of Hinduism.The puja rituals involve mantras (words manifesting spiritual transformation), shlokas (holy verses), chants and arati, and offerings. These also include Vedic chants and recitations of the Devi Mahatmya text in Sanskrit. The shlokas and mantras praise the divinity of the goddess; according to the shlokas Durga is omnipresent as the embodiment of power, nourishment, memory, forbearance, faith, forgiveness, intellect, wealth, emotions, desires, beauty, satisfaction, righteousness, fulfillment and peace. The specific practices vary by region. The rituals before the puja begins include the following: * Bodhana: Involves rites to awaken and welcome the goddess to be a guest, typically done on the sixth day of the festival. * Adhivasa: Anointing ritual wherein symbolic offerings are made to Durga, with each item representing a remembrance of subtle forms of her. Typically completed on the sixth day as well. * Navapatrika snan: Bathing of the navapatrika with holy water done on the seventh day of the festival. * Sandhi puja and Ashtami pushpanjali: The eighth day begins with elaborate pushpanjali rituals. The cusp of the ending of the eighth day and beginning of the ninth day is considered to be the moment when per scriptures Durga engaged in a fierce battle against Mahishasura and was attacked by the demons Chanda and Munda. Goddess Chamunda emerged from the third eye of Durga and killed Chanda and Munda at the cusp of Ashtami and Navami, the eighth and ninth days respectively. This moment is marked by the sandhi puja, involving the offering of 108 lotuses and lighting if 108 lamps. It is a forty-eight minutes long ritual commemorating the climax of battle. The rituals are performed in the last 24 minutes of Ashtami and the first 24 minutes of Navami. In some regions, devotees sacrifice an animal such as a buffalo or goat, but in many regions, there isn't an actual animal sacrifice and a symbolic sacrifice substitutes it. The surrogate effigy is smeared in red vermilion to symbolize the blood spilled. The goddess is then offered food (bhog). Some places also engage in devotional service. * and : The ninth day of festival is marked with the (fire oblation) rituals and . Some places also perform on this day. * and immersion: The tenth and last day, called is marked by , where women smear or vermillion on the sculpture-idols and also smear each other with it. This ritual signifies the wishing of a blissful marital life for married women. Historically the ritual has been restricted to married women. The tenth day is the day when Durga emerged victorious against Mahishasura and it ends with a procession where the clay sculpture-idols are ceremoniously taken to a river or coast for immersion rites. Following the immersion, Durga is believed to return to her mythological marital home of Kailasha to Shiva and the cosmos in general. People distribute sweets and gifts, visit their friends and family members on the tenth day.

Though the festival is observed post-monsoon harvest, the artisans begin making the sculpture-idols months before, during summer. The process begins with prayers to Ganesha and to the perceived divinity in materials such as bamboo frames in which the sculpture-idols are cast. Clay statue is being made Clay, or alluvial soil, collected from different region form the base. This choice is a tradition wherein Durga, perceived as the creative energy and material, is believed to be present everywhere and everything in the universe. In certain traditions in Kolkata, a custom is to include soil samples in the clay mixture for Durga from areas believed to be nishiddho pallis (forbidden territories; territories inhabited by the \\"social outcasts\\" such as brothels). The clay base is combined with straw, kneaded, and then molded into a cast made from hay and bamboo. This is layered to a fine final shape, cleaned, painted, and polished. A layer of a fiber called jute, mixed in with clay, is also attached to the top to prevent the statue from cracking in the months ahead. The heads of the statues are more complex, and are usually made separately. The limbs of the statues are mostly shaped from bundles of straws. Then, starting about August, the local artisans hand-paint the sculpture-idols which are later dressed in clothing, are decorated and bejewelled, and displayed at the puja altars. A man building statue in Rangpur,Bangladesh.jpg The procedure for and proportions of the sculpture-idols are described in arts-related Sanskrit texts of Hinduism, such as the Vishvakarma Sashtra. Environmental impact A Durga sculpture-idol in the river, post-immersion. The sculpture- idols for the puja are traditionally made of biodegradable materials such as straw, clay, soil, and wood. In today's times, brighter colored statues have increased in popularity and have diversified the use of non-biodegradable, cheaper or more colorful substitute synthetic raw materials. Environmental activists have raised concerns about the paint used to produce the statue, stating that the heavy metals in these paints pollute rivers when the statues are immersed at the end of the Durga festival. Brighter colors that are also biodegradable and eco-friendly, as well as the traditional natural colors, are typically more expensive compared to the non biodegradable paints. The Indian state of West Bengal has banned the use of hazardous paints, and various state government have started distributing lead-free paints to artisans at no cost to prevent pollution.Ipsita Pati (October 18, 2012), Paint with toxic chemicals banned during Puja, The Hindu =Animal sacrifice, symbolic sacrifice= Sacrifice of a buffalo during Durga puja, in Assam. Shakta Hindu communities mark the slaying of Mahishasura and the victory of Durga with a symbolic or actual sacrifice. Most communities prefer symbolic sacrifice, where a statue of the asura is made of flour or equivalent, is immolated and smeared with vermilion, symbolic of the blood that had spilled during the battle. Other substitutes include a vegetable or a sweet dish considered equivalent to the animal. In certain instances, devotees consider animal sacrifice distasteful, and practice alternate means of expressing devotion while respecting the views of others in their tradition. In communities performing actual sacrifice, an animal is sacrificed, mainly at temples. In Nepal, West Bengal, Odisha and Assam, animal sacrifices are performed at Shakta temples to commemorate the legend of Durga slaying Mahishasura. This involves slaying of a fowl, goat or a male water-buffalo. This practice is rare among Hindus outside the regions of Bengal, Odisha and Assam. In these regions, the festival season is primarily when significant animal sacrifices are observed. The Rajputs of Rajasthan worship their weapons and horses in the related festival of Navaratri, and some historically observed the sacrifice of a goat, a practice that continues in some places. The sacrifice ritual, supervised he the priest, requires slaying of the animal with a single stroke. In the past this ritual was considered a rite of passage into manhood and readiness as a warrior. The Kuldevi (clan deity) among these Rajput communities is a warrior goddess, with local legends tracing reverence for her during Rajput-Muslim wars. =Pandals and theme-based pujas= Months before the start of Durga Puja, youth members of the community collect funds and donations, engage priests and artisans, buy votive materials and help build pandals centred around a theme, which has rose to prominence in recent years. Such themes have included sex work, celebration of humanity, marginalisation of queer persons and transgender persons, folk culture, celebration of cinema, womanhood, pro-environment themes, while others have chosen metaphorical themes such as celebration of maati (literally, soil or ash) and \\"finding one's own light\\". Pandals have also been replicated on existing temples, structures, and monuments and yet others have been made of elements such as metal scraps, nails, and turmeric among others. Durga puja pandals have also been centred around themes to acknowledge political events such as the 2019 Balakot airstrike and to protest against the National Register of Citizens of India. Designs and sculpture-idols are made by commissioned artisans, which is also a team effort involving labourers, architects, and community representatives hosting it. The budget required for such theme-based pujas is significantly higher than traditional pujas. For such theme-based pujas, the preparations and the building of pandals are a significant arts-related economic activity, often attracting major sponsors. Such commercialised pujas attract crowds of visitors. The growth of competitiveness in theme-based pandals has escalated costs and scale of Durga puja in eastern states of India. Some segments of the society criticise the billboards, the economic competition, and seek return to basics. The competition takes many forms, such as the height of statue. In 2015, an 88-foot statue of Durga in Kolkata's Deshapriya Park attracted numerous devotees, with some estimates placing visitors at one million. Regional celebrations and observances Bagbajar, Kolkata, example of a sarvajanin barowari puja. There exists variation in worship practices and rituals associated with Durga puja, as is the case with other Hindu festivals, in the Indian subcontinent. Hinduism accepts flexibility and leaves the set of practices to the choice of the individuals concerned. Different localised rituals may be observed regionally, with these variations accepted across temples, pandals, and within families. The festival is most commonly associated with Bengali Hindus, and with the community having variability and differences in practices. There may exist differences of practice between the puja of theme-based Pandals, family pujas (with puja of erstwhile aristocrat families known as bonedi puja), and community pujas (known as barowari pujas ) of neighbourhoods or apartments. {{sfnRodrigues2003pp=17-18} The rituals of the puja also varies from being Vedic, Puranic, or Tantric, or a combination of these. The Bengali Durga puja rituals typically combine all three. The non-Bengali Durga puja rituals tend to be essentially Vedic (srauta) in nature but they too incorporate esoteric elements making the puja an example of a culmination of Vedic-Tantric practices. Historical evidence suggests that the Durga puja has evolved over time, becoming more elaborate, social, and creative. The festival had earlier been a domestic puja, a form of practice that still remains popular. But it had also come to be celebrated in the sarvajanin (public) form, where communities get together, pool their resources and efforts to set up pandals and illuminations, and celebrate the event as a \\"mega-show to share\\". The origins of this variation are unclear, with some sources suggesting a family in Kolkatta reviving such celebration in 1411 CE. While other set of sources suggest that a Bengali landlord, named Kamsanarayan, held a mega-show puja in late 16th-century Bengal. Yet, this festival of Bengal is likely much older with the discovery of 11th and 12th-century Durga puja manual manuscripts such as Durgotsavaviveka, Durgotsava Prayoga, Vasantaviveka and Kalaviveka. The rituals associated with the Durga puja migrated to other regions from Bengal, such as in Varanasi, a city that has historically attracted sponsorship from Hindus from various parts of the Indian subcontinent including Bengal. In contemporary India, Durga puja is celebrated in various styles and forms. Durga puja is a widely celebrated festival in the Indian states of West Bengal, Bihar, Assam, and Odisha. It is celebrated over a five-day period. Streets are decked up with festive lights, loudspeakers play festive songs as well as recitation of hymns and chants by priests, and pandals are erected by communities. The roads become overcrowded with revellers, devotees, and pandal-hoppers visiting the pandals on puja days. It often creates chaotic traffic conditions. Shops, eateries, and restaurants stay open all night; fairs are also set up and cultural programmes are held. People form organizing committees, which plan and oversee the pandal during the festivities. Today, Durga Puja has turned into a consumerist social carnival, a major public spectacle and a major arts event riding on the wave of commercialisation, corporate sponsorship, and craze for award-winning. For private domestic pujas, families dedicate an area of their homes, known as thakur dalan, for Durga puja where the sculpture-idols for worship is placed and decorated with home-dyed fabric, sola ornamentations, and gold and silver foil decorations. Elaborate rituals like arati are performed and prasad is distributed after being offered to the deities. As a tradition, married daughters visit their parents and celebrate the Durga puja with them, a symbolism alluding to Durga who is popularly believed to return to her natal home during the puja. Durga puja at the Shobhabazar Rajbari, in Kolkata, example of a bonedi puja. Durga Puja is also a gift-giving and shopping season for communities celebrating it, with people buying gifts for not only family members but also for close relatives and friends. New clothes are the traditional gift, and people wear them to go out together during Durga puja. During puja holidays, people may also go to places of tourist attractions while others return home to spend Durga puja with their family. It's a common trend amongst youngsters and even those who are older to go pandal-hopping and enjoy the celebrations. The organising committees of each puja pandal hires a purohita (priest) who performs the puja rituals on behalf of the community. For the priests, Durga puja is a time of activity wherein he pursues the timely completion of Vedic- Puranic-Tantric ritual sequences to make various offerings and perform fire oblations, in full public view, while the socio-cultural festivities occur in parallel. The complex puja rituals include periods of accurate and melodic scripture recitation. The puja involves crowds of people visiting the pandals, with smaller groups visiting family pujas, to witness the celebrations. On the last day, the sculpture-idols are carried out in immersion processions across Bengal, following which they are ritually immersed into rivers or other waterbodies. The immersion ceremony continues till a couple of days after the last day of puja. Immersion procession for Durga puja, with the sculpture- idols being carried by people on bamboo poles. According to some scholars, the ritual of immersing the Durga sculpture-idol into the river attracted the attention of colonial era travelers to the Bengal region from Europe, such as Garcin de Tassy and Emma Roberts. In 1831, Tassy reported that similar rituals were annually observed by the Muslim community in Bengal. Shia Muslims observed Muharram over ten days, taking out processions in memory of the martyrdom of Imam Husayn ibn Ali, and then cast a memorial Imam's cenotaph into a river on the tenth day. Tassy further stated that the Muslim rituals included the same offerings at the annual observation of Muharram that the Hindu rituals included during Durga puja. According to yet other scholars, the ritual of immersion in water by Hindus for Durga puja in Bengal and Ganesh Chaturthi in the western states of India, may have grown because members of the Hindu community attempted to create a competing procession and immersion ritual to that of Muharram, allowed by the colonial British Indian government in the 19th and early 20th-centuries. Durga puja in New Delhi, 2014. In Maharashtra, the city of Nashik and other places such as CIDCO, Rajeevnagar, Panchavati, and Mahatmanagar host Durga puja celebrations. While in Delhi, the first community Durga puja was organised near Kashmiri Gate by a group of expatriate Bengalis, in 1910, a year before Delhi was declared the capital of British India. This group came to be the Delhi Durga Puja Samiti, popularly known as the Kashmere Gate Durga puja. The Durga puja at Timarpur, Delhi was started in the year 1914. In 2011, over 800 Durga pujas were held in Delhi, with a few hundred more in Gurgaon and NOIDA.  Durga Puja in Odisha  Sculpture-idols in Cuttack, Odisha for Durga puja, bedecked with jewellery. In Odisha, Durga puja is the most important festival of the people of the state. Durga puja is a very important festival for Odias, during the 4 days of the festival, the streets of the city turns into a wonderland throughout the state, people welcome the arrival of their maa by rejoicing themselves, eating tasty food, wearing new clothes,seeing different pandals across the city, family gathering and gift givings. In 2019, ninety-seven pandals in Cuttack alone, Odisha were reported to bedeck respective sculpture-idols with silver jewellery for Durga puja celebrations; such club of pandals termed regionally as Chandir Pandel. The state capital is famous for the modern themes and creativity In the pandals, while the Western part of the state has a more retro decoration theme to the pandal. In the northern parts of the state particularly Balasore, durga puja is celebrated with much fervor and the odia diaspora abroad especially in Australia, which originates 95% from the district of Balasore celebrates the puja in the same manner which is done back home in Balasore. In September 2019, 160 pandals were reported to be hosting Durga puja in Cuttack. While in Tripura there were over 2,500 community Durga puja celebrations in 2013. Durga puja has been started at the Durgabari temple, in Agartala by King Radha Kishore Manikya Bahadur. Significance Beyond being an art festival and a socio-religious event, Durga puja has also been a political event with regional and national political parties having sponsored Durga puja celebrations. In 2019, West Bengal Chief Minister, Mamata Banerjee announced a grant of 25,000 to all community organised Durga pujas in the state. In 2019, Kolkata's Durga puja was nominated by the Indian government for the 2020 UNESCO Representative list of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Durga puja also stands to be politically and economically significant. The committees organising Durga puja in Kolkata have close links to politicians. Politicians patronise the festival by making donations or helping raise money for funding of community pujas, or by marking their presence at puja events and inaugurations. The grant of 25,000 to puja organising committees in West Bengal by a debt-ridden state government was reported to cost a budget a 70 crores. The state government also announced an additional grant of 5,000 to puja organising committees fully managed by women alone, while also announcing a twenty-five per-cent concession on total electricity bills for puja pandal. The government had made a grant of 10,000 each to more than 20,000 puja organising committees in the state, in 2018. A 2013 report by ASSOCHAM states West Bengal's Durga puja to be a 25,000 crores worth economy, expected to grow at the compound annual growth rate of about 35 per-cent. Economic slowdowns in India, such as in 2019, have hence affected corporate sponsorships and puja budgets for public celebrations. In August 2019, the Income Tax Department of India had allegedly sent notices to various Durga puja organising committees in West Bengal, against which the ruling party of the state, All India Trinamool Congress (AITMC) protested. The Central Board of Direct Taxes denied sending any such notices, to which AITMC politician Madan Mitra is reported to have said that the intention may have been to enquire if tax deducted at source had been deducted on payments to vendors for organising community pujas. =Media attention= Durga puja has been a theme in various artistic works such as movies, paintings, and literature. Shown here is Pratima Visarjan by alt=A painting by Gaganendranath Tagore depicting Durga puja immersion. The day of Mahalaya is marked by the Bengali community with Mahishasuramardini ‚Äî a two-hours long All India Radio programme ‚Äî that has been popular in the Bengali community since the 1950s. While in earlier days it used to be recorded live, a pre-recorded version has come to be broadcast in recent decades. Bengalis traditionally wake up at four in the morning on Mahalaya to listen to the radio show, primarily involving recitations of chants and hymns from Devi Mahatmyam (or Chandi Path) by Birendra Krishna Bhadra and Pankaj Kumar Mullick. The show also features various devotional melodies. Dramas enacting the legend of Durga slaying Mahishasura are telecasted on the television. Radio and television channels also air other festive shows, while Bengali and Odia magazines publish special editions for the puja known as Pujabarshiki (Annual Puja Edition) or Sharadiya Sankhya (Autumnal Volume). These contain works of writers, both established and upcoming, and are more voluminous than the regular issues. Some notable examples of such magazines in Bengali are Anandamela, Shuktara, Desh, Sananda, Nabakallol, and Bartaman. Celebrations outside India Durga puja is celebrated commonly by Bangladesh's Hindu community. Some Bengali Muslims also take part in the festivities. In Dhaka, the Dhakeshwari Temple puja attracts visitors and devotees. In Nepal, the festivities are celebrated as Dashain. Beyond south Asia, Durga puja is organised by Bengali communities in the United States of America. Durga puja celebrations have also been started in Hong Kong by the Bengali diaspora. Celebrations are also organised in Europe. The sculpture-idols are shipped from India and stored in warehouses to be re- used over the years. According to BBC News, for community celebrations in London in 2006, these \\"idols, belonging to a tableau measuring 18ft by 20ft, were made from clay, straw and vegetable dyes\\". At the end of the puja, the sculpture-idols were immersed in River Thames for the first time in 2006, after \\"the community was allowed to give a traditional send-off to the deities by London's port authorities\\". In Germany, the puja is celebrated in Cologne, and other cities. In Switzerland, puja in Baden, Aargan has been celebrated since 2003. In Sweden, the puja is celebrated in cities such as Stockholm and Helsingborg. In the Netherlands, the puja is celebrated in places such as Amstelveen, Eindhoven, and Voorschoten. In Japan Durga Puja is celebrated in Tokyo with much fanfare. Footnotes References =Bibliography=                Sen Ramprasad (1720‚Äì1781).

It was composed somewhere between the 10th and 13th centuries. While the origin of the song is not entirely clear, several scholars agree that Saint Adalbert of Prague is the likely author. Polish knights sang it as an anthem before the Battle of Grunwald. Bogurodzica also accompanied the coronation ceremonies of the first Jagiellonian kings.  History  Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth forces (probably sixteenth - seventeenth century) singing the Bogurodzica hymn before the battle. Painting by J√≥zef Brandt. It was recorded in writing at the beginning of the 15th century. Two records preserved till today date back to that time: # the Kcynia record including two initial stanzas together with musical notation; # the Krak√≥w record covering thirteen stanzas without notes. Other records date back to the second half of the fifteenth century, the turn of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and to the beginning of the 16th century. In 1509 the song was printed in Krak√≥w in Jan ≈Åaski's Statut. The origin of the song is not clear, although St Adalbert is a likely author. It used to be related either to Latin liturgy, the tradition of church hymns, Greek or Old Church Slavonic influences, Western or Eastern culture. The two initial stanzas were created first - probably in the middle or at the end of the thirteenth century, or possibly at the very beginning of the fourteenth century. Bogurodzica is a prayer hymn whose first stanza contains an invocation to Christ through the intercession of Mary. It begins with an apostrophe to her - to the Mother of Christ, the Virgin, praised by God, the chosen one. After the apostrophe, there is an appeal to Mary to win favour for people from her Son. The second stanza begins with a direct addresses to Christ (called God's Son) - with an invocation to John the Baptist who can support human imploring. The prayer closing this stanza contains a request that Christ give people a blissful stay on earth and, after death, everlasting existence in heaven. The subsequent stanzas develop various motifs: Easter, the Passion, a litany - with invocations to the saints. Bogurodzica was initially connected with the mass and procession but already in the fifteenth century it became a knight's battle hymn. Thanks to Jan D≈Çugosz (historian, author of Annales seu Cronicae incliti Regni Poloniae), we know that it was sung at Grunwald in 1410 as well as before other battles in subsequent years. It also accompanied the coronation ceremonies of W≈Çadys≈Çaw III of Poland. That is why D≈Çugosz called Bogurodzica \\"carmen patrium\\" (the hymn of the fatherland). In the next centuries the hymn lost its significance. It regained its position of \\"carmen patrium\\" in the nineteenth century and has held it to the present day.  Lyrics  Polish English Virgin, Mother of God, God-famed Mary! Ask Thy Son, our Lord, God-named Mary, To have mercy upon us and hand it over to us! Kyrie eleison!

The Codex Alimentarius is recognized by the World Trade Organization as an international reference point for the resolution of disputes concerning food safety and consumer protection.Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures World Trade Organization. Accessed 3 September 2008.Understanding the Codex Alimentarius Preface. Third Edition. Published in 2006 by the World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Accessed 3 September 2008. As of 2020, there were 189 members of the Codex Alimentarius Commission: 188 member countries and one member organization, the European Union (EU).. There were 237 Codex observers: 58 intergovernmental organizations, 163 non-governmental organizations, and 16 United Nations organizations. Scope The Codex Alimentarius covers all foods, whether processed, semi-processed or raw. In addition to standards for specific foods, the Codex Alimentarius contains general standards covering matters such as food labeling, food hygiene, food additives and pesticide residues, and procedures for assessing the safety of foods derived from modern biotechnology. It also contains guidelines for the management of official i.e. governmental import and export inspection and certification systems for foods. The Codex Alimentarius is published in the six official languages of the United Nations: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Spanish and Russian. Not all texts are available in all languages. =General texts= * Food labelling (general standard, guidelines on nutrition labelling, guidelines on labelling claims) * Food additives (general standard including authorized uses, specifications for food grade chemicals) * Contaminants in foods (general standard, tolerances for specific contaminants including radionuclides, aflatoxins and other mycotoxins) * Pesticide and veterinary chemical residues in foods (maximum residue limits) * Risk assessment procedures for determining the safety of foods derived from biotechnology (DNA-modified plants, DNA- modified micro-organisms, allergens) * Food hygiene (general principles, codes of hygienic practice in specific industries or food handling establishments, guidelines for the use of the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point or ‚ÄúHACCP‚Äù system) * Methods of analysis and sampling =Specific standards= * Meat products (fresh, frozen, processed meats and poultry) * Fish and fishery products (marine, fresh water and aquaculture) * Milk and milk products * Foods for special dietary uses (including infant formula and baby foods) * Fresh and processed vegetables, fruits, and fruit juices * Cereals and derived products, dried legumes * Fats, oils and derived products such as margarine * Miscellaneous food products (chocolate, sugar, honey, mineral water) Controversy The controversy over the Codex Alimentarius relates to a perception that it is a mandatory standard for the safety of food, including vitamin and mineral supplements. Supporters of the Codex Alimentarius say that it is a voluntary reference standard for food and that there is no obligation on countries to adopt Codex standards as a member of either Codex or any other international trade organization. From the point of view of its opponents, however, one of the main causes of concern is that the Codex Alimentarius is recognized by the World Trade Organization as an international reference standard for the resolution of disputes concerning food safety and consumer protection. Proponents argue that the use of Codex Alimentarius during international disputes does not exclude the use of other references or scientific studies as evidence of food safety and consumer protection. It is reported that in 1996 the German delegation put forward a proposal that no herb, vitamin or mineral should be sold for preventive or therapeutic reasons, and that supplements should be reclassified as drugs.'Health supplements: R.I.P.'. The Guardian newspaper, UK. Published 14 September 2002. Accessed 2 August 2008 The proposal was agreed, but protests halted its implementation. The 28th Session of the Codex Alimentarius Commission was subsequently held July 4‚Äì9, 2005.Codex Alimentarius Commission 28th Session, FAO Headquarters, Rome, Italy, 4-9 July, 2005. Official report. Among the many issues discussed were the Guidelines for Vitamin and Mineral Food Supplements,Codex Guidelines for Vitamin and Mineral Food Supplements which were adopted during the meeting as new global safety guidelines: The guidelines state that \\"people should...be encouraged to select a balanced diet from food before considering any vitamin and mineral supplement. In cases where the intake from the diet is insufficient or where consumers consider their diet requires supplementation, vitamin and mineral food supplements serve to supplement the daily diet.\\" This text has been the subject of considerable controversy among proponents of dietary supplements. Many countries regulate such substances as therapeutic goods or pharmaceuticals or by some other category, without requiring them to be shown to be medically useful. The text does not seek to ban supplements, but subjects them to labeling and packaging requirements, sets criteria for the setting of maximum and minimum dosage levels, and requires that safety and efficacy are considered when determining ingredient sources. The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Health Organization (WHO) will implement these criteria with \\"labelling to stop consumers overdosing on vitamin and mineral food supplements.\\" The Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) has said that the Guidelines call \\"for labelling that contains information on maximum consumption levels of vitamin and mineral food supplements.\\" The WHO has also said that the Guidelines \\"ensure that consumers receive beneficial health effects from vitamins and minerals.\\" In 2004, similarities were noted between the EU's Food Supplements Directive and the Codex Alimentarius draft guidelines for vitamin and mineral supplements'. Additional controversy has been expressed by proponents of ecologically and socially sustainable agriculture and food systems, such as the Slow Food movement, although the Slow Food movement has become more closely aligned with the EU.About us, Slow Food \\"Slow Food gratefully acknowledges funding support from the European Commission.\\" In addition, the Manifesto on the Future of Food stated that \\"bureaucracies like the World Trade Organization, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the Codex Alimentarius have codified policies designed to serve the interests of global agribusiness above all others, while actively undermining the rights of farmers and consumers\\".

Its prefecture (capital) was Nancy. It ceased to exist following the annexation of Alsace- Lorraine by Germany in 1871. General characteristics The department of Meurthe was created on 4 March 1790, during the French Revolution, out of a part of the former province of Lorraine. It took its name from the river Meurthe flowing through it. As of 1866, Meurthe had 714 communes. Its area was 6,070 km2 (2,344 sq. miles). It was divided into 5 arrondissements: Nancy, Ch√¢teau-Salins, Lun√©ville, Sarrebourg and Toul. History The departments of Alsace and Lorraine After the French defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871, the northeastern part of the Meurthe department was annexed to the German Empire by the Treaty of Frankfurt. On 18 May 1871 about one-third of the Meurthe, corresponding approximately to the arrondissements of Ch√¢teau- Salins and Sarrebourg in the northeast of the department, were detached from Meurthe and annexed to the German Department of Lorraine, becoming part of the Reichsland of Alsace-Lorraine. The remaining two thirds of Meurthe were merged with one fifth of the Moselle department (arrondissement of Briey, in the extreme west of Moselle, to the northwest of Meurthe) which had escaped German annexation, and on 7 September 1871 the merger gave birth to the new Meurthe- et-Moselle department (area: 5,246 km2, compared to 6,070 km2 for the former Meurthe), with its prefecture at Nancy. In 1919, with the Allied victory in the First World War, Alsace-Lorraine was returned to France by Germany at the Treaty of Versailles. However, the old departments of Meurthe and Moselle was not recreated by reverting to the old department borders of before 1871. Instead, Meurthe-et-Moselle was left untouched, and the one-third of Meurthe and the four-fifths of Moselle that had been formed the German region of Lorraine in 1871 were reinstituted as the new department of Moselle, which shares the name of the old department of Moselle but which has quite different borders. Population At the 1866 French census, the Meurthe department had a population of 428,387 inhabitants. In 1872, after the annexation and merger, the new Meurthe-et-Moselle department had a population of 365,137 inhabitants. At the 1999 French census, if Meurthe still existed it would have had a population of 647,307 inhabitants. On the other hand, in 1999 Meurthe-et- Moselle had a population of 713,779 inhabitants (the industrial area of Briey and Longwy merged in 1871 is more populated than the rural areas of Ch√¢teau- Salins and Sarrebourg lost in 1871).

Haggard is the founder and former pastor of New Life Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado and is a founder of the Association of Life-Giving Churches. He served as President of the National Association of Evangelicals (NAE) from 2003 until November 2006. Haggard made national headlines in November 2006 when male prostitute and masseur Mike Jones alleged that Haggard, who had advocated against the legalization of same-sex marriage, had paid him for sex for three years and had also purchased and used crystal methamphetamine. After initially denying the allegations, Haggard claimed to have purchased methamphetamine and thrown it away without using it. Haggard resigned his post at New Life Church and his other leadership roles shortly after the allegations became public. Later, Haggard admitted to having used drugs, participated in some sexual activity with Jones, and engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a young man who attended New Life Church. In 2010, Haggard and his wife, Gayle, founded St. James Church in Colorado Springs; as of September 2018, Haggard continues to serve as founding pastor at St. James Church. Early life and education The main entrance of New Life Church in Colorado Springs Haggard was born in Indiana.Sharlett, p. 42. His father, J. M. Haggard, a practicing veterinarian in Yorktown, Indiana, founded an international charismatic ministry, which was featured in a PBS Middletown documentary series. Haggard has stated that he was molested when he was seven years old. In 1972, at age 16, Haggard became a born-again Christian after hearing a sermon from evangelist Bill Bright in Dallas, Texas, and becoming acquainted with the Christian apologetics of C. S. Lewis. As a co- editor of his high-school newspaper in 1974, Haggard published frank articles that described services that were available to prevent and deal with increasingly prevalent pregnancies and STDs. These articles scandalized his small town and embroiled him in a free-press lawsuit. Haggard describes feeling the call of God on his life after his first year in college while he was in the kitchen at home. He had been a telecommunications major with a minor in journalism, but after this experience he believed he had been called to be a pastor.Haggard, Ted: \\"The Life-Giving Church\\", p. 27. Regal Books, 2001. Haggard subsequently attended Oral Roberts University, a Christian university in Tulsa, Oklahoma, graduating in 1978. New Life Church According to Haggard, in November 1984, when he was an associate pastor of Bethany World Prayer Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, his confidant and mentor Danny Ost, a missionary to Mexico City, had a vision of Haggard founding his church in Colorado Springs. Accordingly, Haggard moved to Colorado shortly afterwards, and founded New Life Church. Initially, the 22 people who met in the basement of Haggard's house formed his church, which then grew to rented spaces in strip malls.Sharlett, pp. 43‚Äì44. After 22 years, New Life Church operated from a campus in northern Colorado Springs and had a congregation of 14,000. In 1993, during what Haggard describes as his \\"first prayer journey,\\" he traveled with a group to Israel. They stood on the Mount of Olives, where Haggard claims that he felt the Holy Spirit speak to him. \\"From that time until now,\\" Haggard writes in The Life-Giving Church, \\"apostolic power has blessed me. My only problems are with me ‚Äî not with the enemy, not with circumstances, not with people.\\"Haggard, T: The Life Giving Church, p. 36. Regal Books, 2001. Under Haggard's leadership, New Life Church formed the Association of Life-Giving Churches. It has been listed as a denomination by the U.S. National Association of Evangelicals. As of 2006, Harper's Magazine reported that it comprised some 300 congregations.http://harpers.org/SoldiersOfChrist-20061103288348488.html =Sex and drug scandal= In November 2006, male prostitute and masseur Mike Jones alleged that Haggard had paid him for sex over a three-year period and had also purchased and used crystal methamphetamine. Jones said he had only recently learned of Haggard's true identity, and explained his reasons for coming forward by saying, \\"It made me angry that here's someone preaching against gay marriage and going behind the scenes having gay sex.\\" Jones made the allegations public in response to Haggard's political support for a Colorado Amendment 43 on the November 7, 2006, Colorado ballot that would ban same-sex marriage in that state. Jones told ABC News, \\"I had to expose the hypocrisy. He is in the position of influence of millions of followers, and he's preaching against gay marriage. But behind everybody's back [he's] doing what he's preached against.\\" Jones hoped that his statements would sway voters. Haggard's immediate response was denial. He told a Denver television station, \\"I did not have a homosexual relationship with a man in Denver... I am steady with my wife. I'm faithful to my wife.\\" Haggard also said, \\"I have never done drugs-ever. Not even in high school. I didn't smoke pot. I didn't do anything like that. I'm not a drug man. We're not a drinking family. I don't smoke cigarettes. I don't socially drink. We don't socially drink. We don't have wine in our house. We don't do that kind of thing.\\" Many evangelical leaders initially showed support for Haggard and were critical of media reports, including James Dobson who issued a statement of support for Haggard, which stated: \\"It is unconscionable that the legitimate news media would report a rumor like this based on nothing but one man's accusation.... Ted Haggard is a friend of mine, and it appears someone is trying to damage his reputation as a way of influencing the outcome of Tuesday's election - especially the vote on Colorado's marriage-protection amendment, which Ted strongly supports.\\"A look at the contradictions in the different statements Pastor Ted Haggard has made to 9NEWS. 9NEWS at 5 p.m. November 1, 2006. Cornered by his voicemail to Mike Jones requesting methamphetamine, Haggard told the press, \\"I bought it [methamphetamine] for myself but never used it. I was tempted but I never used it.\\" Haggard claimed he bought the methamphetamine but threw it away, and added that he had never met his accuser. Jones volunteered to take a polygraph test on a KHOW radio show hosted by Peter Boyles, where Jones first made the allegations. However, Jones's responses during the section of the polygraph test about whether he had engaged in sex with Haggard indicated deception. The test administrator, John Kresnik, discounted the test results because of Jones's stress and lack of eating or sleeping. Regardless, Haggard responded by saying, \\"We're so grateful that he failed a polygraph test this morning, my accuser did.\\" Jones was not asked questions about drug use. Jones expressed doubt that he would retake the test, saying \\"I've made my point. He's the one who has discredited himself. He should admit it and move on.\\" Due to the scandal, Haggard went on administrative leave from New Life, saying, \\"I am voluntarily stepping aside from leadership so that the overseer process can be allowed to proceed with integrity. I hope to be able to discuss this matter in more detail at a later date. In the interim, I will seek both spiritual advice and guidance.\\" On November 2, 2006, senior church officials told Colorado Springs television station KKTV that Haggard had admitted to some of the claims made by Jones. In an e-mail to New Life Church parishioners sent on the evening of November 2, Acting Senior Pastor Ross Parsley wrote, \\"It is important for you to know that he [Haggard] confessed to the overseers that some of the accusations against him are true.\\" Haggard admitted that he had purchased methamphetamine and received a massage from Jones, but denied using the drugs or having sex with Jones. As it became apparent that at least some of the claims were true, some evangelical leaders such as Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell sought to distance themselves and downplay Haggard's influence on religious conservatives, his connections to the Bush administration, and the importance of the NAE.Church forces out Haggard for 'sexually immoral conduct' 2006-11-03. On November 4, 2006, the Overseer Board of New Life Church released a statement that Haggard had been fired as senior pastor: \\"Our investigation and Pastor Haggard's public statements have proven without a doubt that he has committed sexually immoral conduct.\\" Ross Parsley, the Associate Senior Pastor, was then named Haggard's successor. Haggard then entered counseling by a team including Jack Hayford and Tommy Barnett who stated their intention to \\"perform a thorough analysis of Haggard's mental, spiritual, emotional and physical life,\\" including the use of polygraph tests. The team was to include James Dobson, who later stepped aside, citing time constraints. H. B. London, Focus on the Family's vice president of church and clergy, took Dobson's place on the team. After the scandal was publicized, Haggard entered three weeks of intensive counseling, overseen by four ministers. In February 2007, one of those ministers, Tim Ralph, said that Haggard \\"is completely heterosexual.\\" On November 3, 2006, Haggard's resignation from his leadership role at the National Association of Evangelicals was accepted. Eventually, Haggard admitted to having used drugs and having been masturbated by Jones. =Other allegations= On January 23, 2009, less than one week before The Trials of Ted Haggard was released on HBO, officials from Haggard's former church announced that a young male church member had come forward in 2006 and that there was an \\"overwhelming pool of evidence [of an] inappropriate, consensual sexual relationship [that] went on for a long period of time [with Haggard]... it wasn't a one-time act.\\" Haggard's successor, Brady Boyd, said the church reached a six-figure settlement with the man, who was in his early 20s at the time. According to the man, the contact was \\"not consensual\\". Later reports indicated that the relationship did not involve physical contact, but that on one occasion Haggard masturbated in front of the young man. The man, Grant Haas, added that New Life Church paid him $179,000 for counseling and college tuition.\\"Former Church Member: Haggard Performed Sex Act\\", Fox News/Associated Press, January 27, 2009. Haggard openly admitted to an inappropriate relationship with Haas on CNN and in other media; when asked if he had had additional gay relationships that have been unreported, Haggard did not provide a direct answer.\\"Disgraced pastor Haggard admits second relationship with man\\", CNN-TV Larry King, January 29, 2009. Period between church leadership positions In April 2007, the Haggard family moved to Phoenix, Arizona, to start a restoration process. They attended Phoenix First Assembly of God Church, whose pastor, Tommy Barnett, was on Haggard's counseling team. Haggard reached an agreement with New Life Church on a severance package that would pay him through 2007; one of the conditions was that he had to leave the Colorado Springs area.. His last reported income was $138,000, not including benefits. On February 6, 2008, the new pastor at New Life Church issued a press release announcing that Haggard had requested to leave the team created to \\"restore\\" him and that as Haggard's restoration was \\"incomplete,\\" he was not welcome to return to vocational ministry at New Life.. In August 2007, Haggard released a statement asking for monetary donations to help support his family while he and his wife attended classes at the University of Phoenix. Questions surfaced about the tax-exempt group \\"Families With a Mission\\" to which Haggard had urged people to contribute. According to Haggard, the group would use 10% of donations for administrative costs and forward 90% to Haggard; however, the group was dissolved in February 2007, according to the Colorado Secretary of State. A few days after Haggard's initial email statement, his restoration team stepped in to say his statement was \\"inappropriate\\" and that \\"Haggard was a little ahead of himself.\\" They indicated that Haggard would not be working at the Dream Center or in ministry of any kind and that they advised Haggard to seek secular employment to support himself and his family.., posted by KRDO (via worldnow.com).\\"Disgraced Pastor Ted Haggard Asks Supporters for Cash\\", Associated Press, August 25, 2007.Tillie Fong, \\"Overseers tell Haggard: Stop asking for money and get a job\\" , Rocky Mountain News, August 29, 2007.Nicole Vap, \\"Haggard told to change his plans\\", 9News.com, August 29, 2007. In June 2008, with the severance deal of the New Life Church at an end, Haggard was \\"free to live where he wanted\\" and returned to his Colorado Springs home. Also in June, an email surfaced in which Haggard admitted masturbating with Jones and taking drugs, as alleged in 2006. Kurt Serpe, who provided the email, said Haggard \\"craved sex, he was a sexaholic.\\" In November 2008, Haggard said in guest sermons at an Illinois church that his actions had roots in sexual abuse by an adult when he was seven years old. He also agreed to appear in Alexandra Pelosi's HBO documentary about his sex scandal titled The Trials of Ted Haggard, that premiered on HBO in January 2009. According to the documentary, Haggard had begun a new career selling insurance.Dan Harris and Lee Ferran, Exclusive: Ted Haggard Breaks His Silence, ABC News, November 12, 2008.The Associated Press, \\"Defrocked pastor promoting documentary about own gay sex scandal\\" , \\"365 Gay: News\\", December 18, 2008. In January 2009, after the release of The Trials of Ted Haggard, Haggard and wife Gayle appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show, Larry King Live, Good Morning America, and other national media programs to offer a public apology and confession for the issues that spurred his resignation. The couple also appeared on the syndicated television show Divorce Court in April 2009. On the program, Ted says he wanted his wife to divorce him after the scandal, saying that he thought he had become so \\"toxic\\" that divorce was best for Gayle and their children. On March 11, 2009, Haggard attended a performance in New York of This Beautiful City, a play about him and the Colorado Springs evangelical community. In August 2009, Haggard told Charisma magazine: \\"I do not believe my childhood experience is an excuse. I fell into sin and failed to extract myself. I am responsible, and I have repented.\\" He also extols the benefits of qualified counselors: \\"I highly recommend qualified Christian counseling... for anyone losing their fight with any kind of compulsive thoughts or behaviors. ... I believe our generation of believers is going to have to accept that it's not always lack of faith if we need counseling for assistance with integrity. If I had gone to counseling, I probably could have completely avoided my crisis.\\".... Newsweek's June 7, 2010, issue's BACK STORY listed Haggard among prominent conservative activists who have a record of supporting anti-gay legislation and are later caught in a gay sex scandal.Newsweek, June 7, 2010, p. 56. In a July 2010 interview he gave to CNN, Haggard claimed that his feelings of sexual attraction to other men had miraculously disappeared. Haggard portrayed his encounter with the male prostitute as a massage that went awry.Simon, Stephanie. \\"Humbled Haggard Climbs Back in Pulpit\\". The Wall Street Journal (New York), p. B1, July 24, 2010. Return to the pulpit: St. James Church In October 2009, the Colorado Springs Independent published the first extensive interview with Haggard to appear in the secular press since the 2006 scandal. Over the course of a 2¬Ω-hour interview, the former pastor talked about the scandal, his agreement never to return to New Life or the state of Colorado, suicidal ideas, and the prospect of starting a new church in Colorado Springs. \\"Back in the old days,\\" said Haggard, \\"when somebody would get in trouble, they'd just need to move 40 or 50 miles, or a hundred miles, and they could start again. Not anymore. Which is one of the reasons why we needed to come home. Because I needed to finish this story from here.\\" On November 4, 2009, Haggard posted a message on his Twitter account announcing his intent to begin public prayer meetings in his Colorado Springs home. On December 7, he started holding the prayer meetings in his barn.\\"Ted Haggard returns to the pulpit in Colorado\\" from The Los Angeles Times. On June 6, 2010, the first meeting of the St. James Church, with Haggard as pastor, was held at the Haggard home.\\"Ted Haggard to start new church in Colo. Springs\\" from Associated Press. In 2010, Haggard and his wife, Gayle, founded St. James Church in Colorado Springs. As of September 2018, Haggard continues to serve as founding pastor at St. James Church. Beliefs =\\"Life-Giving Church\\"= Haggard developed a concept he called \\"The Life-Giving Church\\", which amounted to his ministry practice. He believed that churches and their members either lived \\"in the Tree of Life\\" or \\"in the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil\\", referring to the two trees in the Garden of Eden (see Gen. 2:9). He wrote a book, The Life-Giving Church, to expound on this difference, and said that motivations are the key difference between two types of Christians. \\"One way we can tell which tree we are living in,\\" wrote Haggard, \\"is our response to sin... one of the greatest marks of bearing His [Christ's] character is our response to someone else's sin. If we handle others' mistakes with a life- giving attitude, then we (and they) have the opportunity to enjoy great power and freedom. But if we handle others' mistakes negatively, then we're eating from the wrong tree and will begin to die.\\" Christians who live in the \\"tree of life,\\" writes Haggard, \\"grow in their understanding of right and wrong, and they find great insight, wisdom, victory, and joy in the stream of Jesus' righteousness.\\" Those who dwell in the opposite tree find and display \\"frustration, judgmental attitudes, and death.\\"Haggard, Ted, The Life-Giving Church, pp. 51‚Äì61 Regal Books, 2001. In The Life-Giving Church, Haggard sets forth bylaws he initiated that were meant to help other churches with forming their own bylaws. A significant part of the bylaws was a universal pay scale Haggard instituted for all pastoral staff. Including himself, all pastors at New Life Church were paid on the same scale so that the longer one was employed, the better the pay became.Haggard, Ted, The Life-Giving Church, pp. 220‚Äì65, Regal Books, 2001.Forman, Bill, \\"The Resurrection of Pastor Ted\\", Colorado Springs Independent, October 1, 2009. A significant part of Haggard's ministry at New Life Church was based around an entrepreneurial leadership model, which is also covered in The Life-Giving Church. Haggard felt that young and upcoming leaders of the church would bog down in \\"cumbersome systems\\" in their churches and decide to take their talents elsewhere, resulting in the church losing its \\"brightest and best future leaders\\".Haggard, Ted, The Life-Giving Church, p. 48, Regal Books, 2001. Rather than a top-down command and control hierarchy where Haggard made all the decisions and people fell in line, he instituted a free market concept that encouraged young leaders to debate the best ideas (even to the point of disagreeing with him) and pursue God-inspired dreams and visions in their own departments and beyond. In Haggard's book, Primary Purpose, he explains that the normal leadership style that governments and many corporations use is top down, while the servant leadership model he teaches is the opposite. In a visual representation, Haggard uses an upside down triangle to illustrate this concept. The leader is at the bottom and the people to be served are on top. This \\"Philippians 2 Attitude\\" comes from the scripture that states, \\"Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves. Each of you should look not only to your interests, but also to the interests of others.\\"Haggard, Ted, Primary Purpose, pp. 128‚Äì31. Creation House, 1995. =Politics= In 2005, Haggard was listed by Time magazine as one of the top 25 most influential evangelicals in America.TIME Names the 25 Most Influential EVANGELICALS in America TIME. Haggard was a firm supporter of former US President George W. Bush, and is sometimes credited with rallying evangelicals behind Bush during the 2004 election. Author Jeff Sharlet reported in 2005 that Haggard \\"talks to... Bush or his advisers every Monday\\" and stated at that time that \\"no pastor in America holds more sway over the political direction of evangelicalism.\\"Sharlet, pp. 42, 43. Haggard has stated that fighting global warming is an important issue, a divisive issue among Evangelical leaders. Though he personally supported the Evangelical Climate Initiative, the NAE did not adopt a position. =Teachings on homosexuality= In 2006, Haggard and his church supported Colorado Amendment 43 to the Colorado Constitution. It provided, \\"Only a union of one man and one woman shall be valid or recognized as a marriage in this state.\\" Although Colorado law already defined marriage as being between a man and a woman, Haggard and other gay marriage opponents sought to enshrine the prohibition in the state constitution, so that the Colorado Supreme Court would not have the power to declare the statute unconstitutional. In the movie Jesus Camp, Haggard says, \\"we don't have to debate about what we should think about homosexual activity. It's written in the Bible.\\" Haggard initially opposed same-sex marriage, but supported civil unions for homosexual couples. He later came to support same-sex marriage as a civil institution, saying that while he still believes it is forbidden under Biblical law, he feels that \\"we need to be careful not to inculcate [biblical law] into civil law.\\" Under Haggard's leadership, the NAE released \\"For the Health of the Nation: An Evangelical Call to Civic Responsibility\\" in late 2004, \\"a document urging engagement in traditional culture war issues such as abortion and gay marriage but also poverty, education, taxes, welfare, and immigration\\". The NAE has stated that \\"homosexual activity, like adulterous relationships, is clearly condemned in the Scriptures.\\" Television and movie appearances Haggard has appeared on several broadcast network programs, including Dateline NBC and ABC's 20/20. He also appears in the documentary Jesus Camp, the History Channel documentary The Antichrist, the documentary Constantine's Sword, as well as the HBO documentary Friends of God: A Road Trip with Alexandra Pelosi. In 2009, Pelosi made The Trials of Ted Haggard, a film that documented Haggard's life in exile after the scandal, which was aired on HBO. To date, this documentary has been shown over 40 times on HBO. Trials has received critical acclaim. In early 2006, evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins interviewed Haggard as part of a British television documentary entitled The Root of All Evil?.The Root of All Evil? documentary by Richard Dawkins. in 2012 Haggard appeared in the reality television show Celebrity Wife Swap, where he swapped wives for one week with Gary Busey. Personal life Haggard has been married to Gayle Alcorn since 1978. The couple have five children: Christy (1981), Marcus (1983, founder and former pastor of Boulder Street Church, Colorado Springs), Jonathan (1987), Alex (1990), and Elliott (1993). In an interview published in the February 2011 issue of GQ, Haggard said, \\"I think that probably, if I were 21 in this society, I would identify myself as a bisexual,\\" adding that \\"Just like you're a heterosexual but you don't have sex with every woman that you're attracted to, so I can be who I am and exclusively have sex with my wife and be perfectly satisfied.\\" Books * Primary Purpose (1995) * Loving Your City into the Kingdom (1997) ‚Äî(with Jack W.

He was also an accomplished guitar player and author of one of the first rock songs in Italian (\\"Ciao ti dir√≤\\", 1958). With Sandro Luporini, he pioneered the musical genre known as teatro canzone (\\"song theatre\\"). Biography = Debut = He was born in Milan into a lower-middle-class family. His father, Guido Gaberscik, was born in Trieste, when the city was still part of Austria- Hungary. The surname Gaberscik is of Slovene origin (Gaber≈°ƒçik).L'origine dei cognomi. cognomiitaliani.org His mother was from the Veneto region. The two met and married in Veneto and later moved to Milan, where Giorgio was born. Gaber began to play as rehabilitation for an injury to his hand which required constant but not strenuous activity to recover his motor skill. Since his health as a child was not the best and his older brother Marcello played guitar, he was encouraged to play as well. The outcome was good both in terms of his health and artistically, and at only fourteen years of age he was engaged to play at a New Eve's party and earned his first paycheck of 1,000 lire. Subsequently, he began to frequent the Santa Tecla, a venue in Milan where he had the chance to meet musicians of the time, including Luigi Tenco, Gianfranco Reverberi, Adriano Celentano, Ricky Gianco, and Mogol, who obtained a contract for Gaber with Dischi Ricordi. He then played with the Rocky Mountains Old Time Stompers (replacing Tony Dallara who had left to pursue a solo career) and with Rolling Crew. Because neither Tenco nor Gaber were yet members of the Italian Society of Authors and Publishers they could not trademark the song \\"Ciao ti dir√≤\\" (\\"I'll Say Hi to You\\", inspired by Elvis Presley's \\"Jailhouse Rock\\"), which was signed off by Giorgio Calabrese and Giampiero Reverberi despite being composed by Tenco and Gaber. The two went on to continue writing music together, developing at the same time a close friendship. In 1958 they toured Germany together with Adriano Celentano, Enzo Jannacci, Paolo Tomelleri e Gianfranco Reverberi. Gaber paired up with Enzo Jannacci as I Due Corsari (\\"The Two Privateers\\"), who made their debut at the end of 1958 with two vinyl singles ‚Äì \\"Come Facette Mammeta\\", a classic song of Neapolitan humour, and \\"Non occupatemi il telefono\\" (\\"Don't Hog the Telephone\\"). They continued to release singles with Dischi Ricordi throughout the following year, and in 1960 released their first album, Giorgio Gaber ‚Äì Enzo Jannacci. Giorgio Gaber and Ombretta Colli in 1970 After a sentimental- artistic companionship with singer and actress Maria Monti, he married Ombretta Colli in 1965, then a student of languages (Chinese and Russian) at the University of Milan. In 1966 she gave birth to daughter Dalia. He took part to Festival di Sanremo four times, with the songs \\"Benzina e cerini\\" (\\"Petrol and Matches\\") in 1961, \\"Cos√¨ felice\\" (\\"So Happy\\") in 1964, \\"Mai, Mai, Mai Valentina\\" (\\"Never, Never, Never Valentina\\") in 1966 and \\"...E allora dai\\" (\\"...Well Come On Then!\\") in 1967. = Il signor G = In 1969 he released one of his best known successes, \\"Com'√® bella la citt√†\\" (\\"How Beautiful the City Is\\"), an example of the introduction of social matters in a song. The following year, he showed at Piccolo teatro his first ediction of Il Signor G (\\"Mister G\\"), a recital he repeated in many Italian squares. In 1973, he recorded the one song by which he is most recognized by international audiences: Far Finta di Essere Sani which was covered in English as Tomorrow's Got to be Sunny by Tony Orlando and Dawn on their 1975 album He Don't Love You (Like I Love You). A year later, he was given the very first Premio Tenco award, and many years later, also received the Targa Tenco in 2001 for his song \\"La razza in estinzione\\" (\\"The Dying Race\\") and in 2003 for the album Io non mi sento italiano (\\"I Don't Feel Italian\\"). After the Tenco award Gaber abandoned television and began to tour only in theatres, as one of the founders of the teatro canzone genre. He would appear again in TV, although sporadically, only in the 1990s and early 2000s. Death Gaber's grave at the Monumental Cemetery of Milan, Italy. A lifelong smoker, Giorgio Gaber died on New Year's Day 2003 after a long battle with cancer, in his country house in Montemagno near Camaiore, in Tuscany, and is buried at the Monumental Cemetery of Milan. In 2004, the refurbished underground auditorium of the Pirelli Tower in Milan was dedicated to him.

Outside the US, flatware is a term for \\"open-shaped\\" dishware items such as plates, dishes and bowls (as opposed to \\"closed\\" shapes like jugs and vases). \\"Dinnerware\\" is another term used to refer to tableware and \\"crockery\\" refers to ceramic tableware, today often porcelain or bone china. Sets of dishes are referred to as a table service, dinner service or service set. Table settings or place settings are the dishes, cutlery and glassware used for formal and informal dining. In Ireland, such items are normally referred to as delph, the word being an English language phonetic spelling of the word Delft, the town from which so much delftware came. Silver service or butler service are methods for a butler or waiter to serve a meal. Setting the table refers to arranging the tableware, including individual place settings for each diner at the table as well as decorating the table itself in a manner suitable for the occasion. Tableware and table decoration is typically more elaborate for special occasions. Unusual dining locations demand tableware be adapted. Materials Historic Pewter, faience and glass tableware In recent centuries, flatware is usually made of pottery, ceramic materials such as earthenware, stoneware, bone china or porcelain. The triumph of ceramics is probably due to the spread of ceramic glazes, which were slow to develop in Europe; without the glassy surface they give pottery tableware may be less hygienic. Table ware can be made of other materials such as wood, pewter, latten, silver, gold, glass, acrylic and plastic. Before it was possible to purchase mass-produced tableware, it was fashioned from available materials, such as wood. Industrialisation and developments in ceramic manufacture made inexpensive washable tableware available. It is sold either by the piece or as a matched set for a number of diners, normally four, six, eight, or twelve place settings. Large quantities are purchased for use in restaurants. Individual pieces, such as those needed as replacement pieces for broken dishes, can be procured from \\"open stock\\" inventory at shops, or from antique dealers if the pattern is no longer in production. Cutlery is normally made of metal of some kind, though large pieces such as ladles for serving may be of wood. History =Plates and other vessels= The Royal Gold Cup, high, across; weight 1.935 kg, British Museum. Saint Agnes appears to her friends in a vision. Before 1391, when it was owned by the King of France. One of a handful of medieval survivals, solid gold with enamels. The earliest pottery in cultures around the world does not seem to have included flatware, concentrating on pots and jars for storage and cooking. Wood does not survive well in most places, and though archaeology has found few wooden plates and dishes from prehistory, they may have been common, once the tools to fashion them were available. Ancient elites in most cultures preferred flatware in precious metals (\\"plate\\") at the table; China and Japan were two major exceptions, using lacquerware and later fine pottery, especially porcelain. In China bowls have always been preferred to plates. In Europe pewter was often used by the less well off, and eventually the poor, and silver or gold by the rich. Religious considerations influenced the choice of materials. Muhammad spoke against using gold at table, as the contemporary elites of Persia and the Byzantine Empire did, and this greatly encouraged the growth of Islamic pottery. On the other hand, Hindus avoided eating off pottery. In Europe the elites dined off metal, usually silver for the rich and pewter for the middling classes, from the ancient Greeks and Romans until the 18th century. The trencher was a large flat piece of either bread or wood. In the Middle Ages this was a common way of serving food, the bread also being eaten; even in elite dining it was not fully replaced in France until the 1650s,Strong, 226 although in Italy maiolica was used from the 15th century. Orders survive for large services. At an Este family wedding feast in Ferrara in 1565, 12,000 plates painted with the Este arms were used, though the \\"top table\\" probably eat off precious metal.Strong, 166-167; the wedding was between Alfonso II d'Este, Duke of Ferrara and Barbara of Austria A c. 1785-90 Chinese export porcelain dinner service for the American market Possession of tableware has to a large extent been determined by individual wealth; the greater the means, the higher was the quality of tableware that was owned and the more numerous its pieces. The materials used were often controlled by sumptuary laws. In the late Middle Ages and for much of the Early Modern period much of a great person's disposable assets were often in \\"plate\\", vessels and tableware in precious metal, and what was not in use for a given meal was often displayed on a dressoir de parement or buffet (indeed, similar to a large Welsh dresser) against the wall in the dining hall. At the wedding of Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, and Isabella of Portugal in 1429, there was a dresser 20 feet long on either side of the room, each with five rows of plate;Strong, 96-98. Strong says 1429, the year the proxy wedding took place. The bride arrived by sea in late 1429, but the formal marriage ceremony was not until January 1430. a similar display on three dressoirs could be seen at the State Banquet in Buckingham Palace for President Donald J. Trump in 2019. Inventories of King Charles V of France (r. 1364‚Äì1380) record that he had 2,500 pieces of plate.Strong, 97 Plate was often melted down to finance wars or building, or until the 19th century just for remaking in a more fashionable style, and hardly any of the enormous quantities recorded in the later Middle Ages survives.Osborne, 733 The French Royal Gold Cup now in the British Museum, in solid gold and decorated with enamel and pearls, is one of few secular exceptions. Weighing more than two kilos, it was perhaps passed around for ceremonial toasts. Another is the much plainer English silver Lacock Cup, which has survived as it was bequeathed to a church early on, for use as a chalice. The same is true for French silver from the 150 years before the French Revolution, when French styles, either originals or local copies, were used by all the courts of Europe. London silversmiths came a long way behind, but were the other main exporters. French silver now survives almost entirely in the form of exported pieces, like the Germain Service for the King of Portugal.Strong, 237 In London in the 13th century, the more affluent citizens owned fine furniture and silver, \\"while those of straiter means possessed only the simplest pottery and kitchen utensils.\\" By the later 16th century, \\"even the poorer citizens dined off pewter rather than wood\\" and had plate, jars and pots made from \\"green glazed earthenware\\".p.55, 96 The nobility often used their arms on heraldic china. The final replacement of silver tableware with porcelain as the norm in French aristocratic dining had taken place by the 1770s.Strong, 232-233 After this the enormous development of European porcelain and cheaper fine earthenwares like faience and creamware, as well as the resumption of large imports of Chinese export porcelain, often armorial porcelain decorated to order, led to matching \\"china\\" services becoming affordable by an ever-wider public. By 1800 cheap versions of these were often brightly decorated with transfer printing in blue, and were beginning to be affordable by the better-off working-class household. Until the mid-19th century the American market was largely served by imports from Britain, with some from China and the European continent. The introduction of hot drinks, mostly but not only tea and coffee, as a regular feature of eating and entertaining, led to a new class of tableware. In its most common material, various types of pottery, this is often called teaware. It developed in the late 17th century, and for some time the serving pots, milk jugs and sugar bowls were often in silver, while the cups and saucers were ceramic, often in Chinese export porcelain or its Japanese equivalent.Osborne, 736; Strong, 225-226 By the mid 18th century matching sets of European \\"china\\" were usual for all the vessels, although these often did not include plates for cake etc. until the next century. This move to local china was rather delayed by the tendency of some early types of European soft-paste porcelain to break if too hot liquid was poured into it. =Cutlery= The knife is much the oldest type of cutlery; early ones were normally carried by the individual at all times. Forks and spoons came later, initially only for the wealthy, who typically carried their own personal set. After the Romans, who made great use of spoons, joined by forks later,Strong, 33 there were only knives and perhaps wooden spoons for most of the Middle Ages. It was only in the 17th century that hosts among the elite again began to lay out cutlery at the table, although at an Italian banquet in 1536 for Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, it is recorded that each guest was provided with knife, spoon and fork, evidently a rarity.Strong, 170 The table fork was revived in Italy in the 16th century, and was described for his English readers by Thomas Coryat in the 1590s as \\"not used in any other country that I saw in my travels\\".Strong, 167 In England and France, it only became common after the 1660s, even in the court of Louis XIV,Strong, 168 (France); Osborne, 736 (England) and for a while seems to have mostly been used by ladies, and for especially messy food, like fruits in syrup.Strong, 168-170 =Table decoration= Sugar sculpture (1880) Tableware is generally the functional part of the settings on dining tables but great attention has been paid to the purely decorative aspects, especially when dining is regarded as part of entertainment such as in banquets given by important people or special events, such as State occasions. Table decoration may be ephemeral and consist of items made from confectionery or wax - substances commonly employed in Roman banqueting tables of the 17th century. During the reign of George III of the United Kingdom, ephemeral table decoration was done by men known as \\"table-deckers\\" who used sand and similar substances to create marmotinto works (sand painting) for single-use decoration. In modern times, ephemeral table decorations continue to be made from sugar or carved from ice. The porcelain figurine began in early 18th- century Germany as a permanent replacement for sugar sculptures on the dining table. In wealthy countries such as 17th century France, table decorations for the aristocracy were sometimes made of silver. One of the most famous table decorations is the Cellini Salt Cellar. Ephemeral and silver table decorations were replaced with porcelain items after its reinvention in Europe in the 16th century. Western style Setting the table for a family meal, Leipzig (1952) =Table settings= A table setting in Western countries is mainly in one of two styles: service √† la russe (French for \\"in the Russian style\\"), where each course of the meal is brought out in specific order; and service √† la fran√ßaise (French for \\"in the French style\\"), where all the courses for the meal are arranged on the table and presented at the same time that guests are seated. Service √† la russe has become the custom in most restaurants, whereas service √† la fran√ßaise is the norm in family settings. Place settings for service √† la russe dining are arranged according to the number of courses in the meal. The tableware is arranged in a particular order. With the first course, each guest at the table begins by using the tableware placed on the outside of place setting. As each course is finished the guest leaves the used cutlery on the used plate or bowl, which are removed from the table by the server. In some case, the original set is kept for the next course. To begin the next course, the diner uses the next item on the outside of the place setting, and so on. Forks are placed on the left of a dinner plate, knives to the right of the plate, and spoons to the outer right side of the place setting. =Plates and bowls= Service √† la russe formal place setting showing glassware for a range of beverages Table laid out for a banquet in Toulouse at the Palais Niel (2010) Plates Dinner plate with rolled table napkin; small bread plate above forks. Glasses Small glass for water, larger one behind for red wine, and smaller wine glass for white wine. Cutlery (from the outside toward the plate) Fish cutlery (knife and fork, as fish will be served without any sauce, otherwise it would be a fish spoon (cuill√®re √† gourmet)); meat cutlery and cheese or fruit cutlery, the end of the knife rests on a knife rest. Above the plate, dessert cutlery (spoon and fork). Items of tableware include a variety of plates, bowls; or cups for individual diners and a range of serving dishes to transport the food from the kitchen or to separate smaller dishes. Plates include charger plates as well as specific dinner plates, lunch plates, dessert plates, salad plates or side plates. Bowls include those used for soup, cereal, pasta, fruit or dessert. A range of saucers accompany plates and bowls, those designed to go with teacups, coffee cups, demitasses and cream soup bowls. There are also individual covered casserole dishes. Dishes come in standard sizes, which are set according to the manufacturer. They are similar throughout the industry. Plates are standardised in descending order of diameter size according to function. One standard series is charger (12 inches); dinner plate (10.5 inches); dessert plate (8.5 inches) salad plate (7.5 inches); side plate, tea plate (6.75 inches). =Drinkware= Glasses and mugs of various types are an important part of tableware, as beverages are important parts of a meal. Vessels to hold alcoholic beverages such as wine, whether red, white, sparkling tend to be quite specialised in form, with for example Port wine glasses, beer glasses, brandy balloons, aperitif and liqueur glasses all having different shapes. Water glasses, juice glasses and hot chocolate mugs are also differentiated. Their appearance as part of the tableware depends on the meal and the style of table arrangement. Tea and coffee tend to involve strong social rituals and so teacups and, coffee cups (including demitasse cups) have a shape that depends on the culture and the social situation in which the drink is taken. =Cutlery= Cutlery is an important part of tableware. A basic formal place setting will usually have a dinner plate at the centre, resting on a charger. The rest of the place setting depends upon the first course, which may be soup, salad or fish. * If soup is the first course, to the left of the dinner plate, moving clockwise, are placed a small salad fork to the left of the dinner plate; a large dinner fork to the left of the salad fork; a side plate above the forks; a wine or water glass above and to the right of the dinner plate; a large dinner knife to the right of the dinner plate; a smaller butter knife to the right of the dinner knife; a dinner spoon to the right of the knives; a soup spoon to the right of the dinner spoon. * If salad is the first course, the soup spoon is skipped. The dinner fork is placed immediately left of the dinner plate; the salad fork is placed on the outer left side of the place setting. In either arrangement, the napkin may either rest folded underneath the forks, or it may be folded and placed on the dinner plate. When more courses are being served, place settings may become more elaborate and cutlery more specialised. Examples include fruit spoon or fruit knife, cheese knife, and pastry fork. Other types of cutlery, such as boning forks, were used when formal meals included dishes that have since become less common. Carving knives and forks are used to carve roasts at the table. =Serving dishes= Tableware for serving mint tea A wide range of serving dishes are used to transport food from kitchen to table or to serve it at table, in order to make food service easier and cleaner or more efficient and pleasant. Serving dishes include: butter dishes; casseroles; fruit bowls; ramekins or lidded serving bowls; compotes; pitchers or jugs; platters, salvers, and trays; salt and pepper shakers or salt cellars; sauce or gravy boats; tureens and tajines; vegetable or salad bowls. A range of items specific to the serving of tea or coffee also have long cultural traditions. They include teapots and coffee pots as well as samovars, sugar bowls; milk or cream jugs. = Place markers = Place markers are used to designate assigned seats to guests. They are typically used at large formal functions such as weddings, banquets for dignitaries, politicians or diplomats as well as on special occasions such as large children's parties. Some are collectible Chinese style A place setting for a Chinese meal Chinese table settings are traditional in style. Table setting practices in Japan and other parts of East Asia have been influenced by Chinese table setting customs. The emphasis in Chinese table settings is on displaying each individual food in a pleasing way, usually in separate bowls or dishes. Formal table settings are based upon the arrangements used in a family setting, although they can become extremely elaborate with many dishes. Serving bowls and dishes are brought to the table, where guests can choose their own portions. Formal Chinese restaurants often use a large turning wheel in the centre of the table to rotate food for easier service. In a family setting, a meal typically includes a fan dish, which constitutes the meal's base (much like bread forms the base of various sandwiches), and several accompanying mains, called cai dish (choi or seoung in Cantonese). More specifically, fan usually refers to cooked rice, but can also be other staple grain-based foods. If the meal is a light meal, it will typically include the base and one main dish. The base is often served directly to the guest in a bowl, whereas main dishes are chosen by the guest from shared serving dishes on the table. ; Place setting An \\"elaborate\\" formal meal would include the following place setting: * Centre plate, about 6 inches in diameter * Rice bowl, placed to the right of the centre plate * Small cup of tea, placed above the plate or rice bowl * Chopsticks to the right of the centre plate, on a chopstick rest * A long-handled spoon on a spoon rest, placed to the left of the chopsticks * Small condiment dishes, placed above the centre plate * Soup bowl, placed to the left above the centre plate * A soup spoon, inside the soup bowl Japanese style New Year sake set with images of cranes, lacquer on wood (Japan, late 19th century) A Japanese table setting. Japanese ceramic tableware is an industry that is many centuries old. Unlike in Western cultures, where tableware is often produced and bought in matching sets, Japanese tableware is set on the table so that each dish complements the type of food served in it. Since Japanese meals normally include several small amounts of each food per person, this means that each person has a place setting with several different small dishes and bowls for holding individual food and condiments. The emphasis in a Japanese table setting is on enhancing the appearance of the food, which is partially achieved by showing contrasts between the items. Each bowl and dish may have a different shape, colour or pattern. ; Place setting A basic complete place setting for one person in Japan would include the following: * Hot noodle bowl * Rice bowl * Soup bowl * Two to three shallow 3- to 5-inch diameter dishes * Two to three 3- to 5-inch diameter, 1- to 3-inch-deep bowls * Two square or rectangular pieces, traditionally served for serving fish * Three 2- to 3-inch diameter condiment plates * Cold noodle tray with bamboo strainer * Dipping sauce cup * Chopsticks and chopstick rest Not all of these plates and bowls would be necessary for one meal. A rice bowl, a soup bowl, two or three small dishes with accompanying foods, and two or three condiment dishes for person would be typical. Various serving bowls and platters would also be set on a table for a typical meal, along with a soy sauce cruet, a small pitcher for tempura or other sauce, and a tea setting of tea pot, tea cups and tea cup saucers. Adaptations Tableware for special circumstances has to be adapted. Dining in the outdoors, for example, whether for recreational purposes, as on a picnic or as part of a journey, project or mission requires specialised tableware. It must be portable, more robust and if possible, lighter in weight than tableware used indoors. It is usually carefully packed for transportation to the place where it will be used.

Madame Sat√£ was the artistic name of Jo√£o Francisco dos Santos (1900-1976), a drag performer and capoeirista from Brazil. Biography He was born into a family of ex-slaves in the state of Pernambuco, Brazil. Having been accused with conspiracy of murder, spending 27 years in prison, being a former gangster and father of 7, he found refuge in the dark Bohemian culture of Rio de Janeiro amid a lively world of pimps, prostitutes, deviants and samba composers. Jo√£o is most commemorated as a figure who fought to redefine himself while battling the stigmas of being a son of former black slaves, illiterate and homosexual. Jo√£o is quoted for once saying \\"I was born an outlaw, that's how I'll live.\\" In between his drag performances, his days as a hustler and his convictions of murder, his image as the legendary cabaret performance artist Madame Sat√£ meaning Madam Satan having been influenced by the 1930s film by Cecil B.

Jo√£o's infamous character represented an expression of resistance in this post abolitionist era in Brazil where black people, prostitutes, drug users and addicts and other 'deviant' outcasts were deemed useless to society. He was a skilled street fighter trained in the style of capoeira, and his battles against the police forces were legendary. He routinely fought barehanded against quartets of policemen armed with wooden clubs.Nestor Capoeira, Capoeira: Roots of the Dance-fight-game Also, it's said he once faced a 24-man platoon and battled them to a stalemate, forcing them to fly away after leaving seven of them badly wounded, two with broken arms and two with split livers.Gerard Taylor, Capoeira: The Jogo de Angola from Luanda to Cyberspace, Volumen 2 Thus, Jo√£o Francisco dos Santos became a living myth that supported and represented the values and lives of such outcasts of society becoming himself a revolutionary icon for the marginalized socially.

The topic can essentially be divided into three main areas: * Theoretical foundations and analysis * Use of computer technology to aid logicians * Use of concepts from logic for computer applications  Theoretical foundations and analysis  Logic plays a fundamental role in computer science. Some of the key areas of logic that are particularly significant are computability theory (formerly called recursion theory), modal logic and category theory. The theory of computation is based on concepts defined by logicians and mathematicians such as Alonzo Church and Alan Turing. Church first showed the existence of algorithmically unsolvable problems using his notion of lambda- definability. Turing gave the first compelling analysis of what can be called a mechanical procedure and Kurt G√∂del asserted that he found Turing's analysis \\"perfect.\\" In addition some other major areas of theoretical overlap between logic and computer science are: *G√∂del's incompleteness theorem proves that any logical system powerful enough to characterize arithmetic will contain statements that can neither be proved nor disproved within that system. This has direct application to theoretical issues relating to the feasibility of proving the completeness and correctness of software. *The frame problem is a basic problem that must be overcome when using first-order logic to represent the goals and state of an artificial intelligence agent. *The Curry‚ÄìHoward correspondence is a relation between logical systems and software. This theory established a precise correspondence between proofs and programs. In particular it showed that terms in the simply-typed lambda-calculus correspond to proofs of intuitionistic propositional logic. *Category theory represents a view of mathematics that emphasizes the relations between structures. It is intimately tied to many aspects of computer science: type systems for programming languages, the theory of transition systems, models of programming languages and the theory of programming language semantics.  Computers to assist logicians  One of the first applications to use the term artificial intelligence was the Logic Theorist system developed by Allen Newell, J. C. Shaw, and Herbert Simon in 1956. One of the things that a logician does is to take a set of statements in logic and deduce the conclusions (additional statements) that must be true by the laws of logic. For example, If given a logical system that states \\"All humans are mortal\\" and \\"Socrates is human\\" a valid conclusion is \\"Socrates is mortal\\". Of course this is a trivial example. In actual logical systems the statements can be numerous and complex. It was realized early on that this kind of analysis could be significantly aided by the use of computers. The Logic Theorist validated the theoretical work of Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead in their influential work on mathematical logic called Principia Mathematica. In addition, subsequent systems have been utilized by logicians to validate and discover new logical theorems and proofs.  Logic applications for computers  There has always been a strong influence from mathematical logic on the field of artificial intelligence (AI). From the beginning of the field it was realized that technology to automate logical inferences could have great potential to solve problems and draw conclusions from facts. Ron Brachman has described first- order logic (FOL) as the metric by which all AI knowledge representation formalisms should be evaluated. There is no more general or powerful known method for describing and analyzing information than FOL. The reason FOL itself is simply not used as a computer language is that it is actually too expressive, in the sense that FOL can easily express statements that no computer, no matter how powerful, could ever solve. For this reason every form of knowledge representation is in some sense a trade off between expressivity and computability. The more expressive the language is, the closer it is to FOL, the more likely it is to be slower and prone to an infinite loop. For example, IF THEN rules used in expert systems approximate to a very limited subset of FOL. Rather than arbitrary formulas with the full range of logical operators the starting point is simply what logicians refer to as modus ponens. As a result, rule-based systems can support high-performance computation, especially if they take advantage of optimization algorithms and compilation. Another major area of research for logical theory was software engineering. Research projects such as the Knowledge Based Software Assistant and Programmer's Apprentice programs applied logical theory to validate the correctness of software specifications. They also used them to transform the specifications into efficient code on diverse platforms and to prove the equivalence between the implementation and the specification. This formal transformation driven approach is often far more effortful than traditional software development. However, in specific domains with appropriate formalisms and reusable templates the approach has proven viable for commercial products. The appropriate domains are usually those such as weapons systems, security systems, and real time financial systems where failure of the system has excessively high human or financial cost. An example of such a domain is Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) design‚Äîthe process for designing the chips used for the CPUs and other critical components of digital devices. An error in a chip is catastrophic. Unlike software, chips can't be patched or updated. As a result, there is commercial justification for using formal methods to prove that the implementation corresponds to the specification. Another important application of logic to computer technology has been in the area of frame languages and automatic classifiers. Frame languages such ais KL-ONE have a rigid semantics. Definitions in KL-ONE can be directly mapped to set theory and the predicate calculus. This allows specialized theorem provers called classifiers to analyze the various declarations between sets, subsets, and relations in a given model. In this way the model can be validated and any inconsistent definitions flagged. The classifier can also infer new information, for example define new sets based on existing information and change the definition of existing sets based on new data. The level of flexibility is ideal for handling the ever changing world of the Internet. Classifier technology is built on top of languages such as the Web Ontology Language to allow a logical semantic level on to the existing Internet. This layer of is called the Semantic web. Temporal logic is used for reasoning in concurrent systems.

His economic contributions would influence both the Keynesian and Austrian schools of economic thought. He was married to the noted feminist Anna Bugge.  Early life  Wicksell was born in Stockholm on December 20, 1851. His father was a relatively successful businessman and real estate broker. He lost both his parents at a relatively early age. His mother died when he was only six, and his father died when he was fifteen. His father's considerable estate allowed him to enroll at the University of Uppsala in 1869 to study mathematics and physics. Education He received his first degree in two years, and he engaged in graduate studies until 1885, when he received his doctorate in mathematics. In 1887, Wicksell received a scholarship to study on the Continent, where he heard lectures by the economist Carl Menger in Vienna. In the following years, his interests began to shift toward the social sciences, particularly economics.  Lecturer  As a lecturer at Uppsala, Wicksell attracted attention because of his opinions about labour. At one lecture, he condemned drunkenness and prostitution as alienating, degrading, and impoverishing. Although he was sometimes identified as a socialist, his solution to the problem was decidedly Malthusian in advocating birth control, which he would defend to the end of his life. His fiery ideas had attracted some attention, but his first work in economics, Value, Capital and Rent (1892), went largely unnoticed. In 1896, he published Studies in the theory of Public Finance and applied the ideas of marginalism to progressive taxation, public goods and other aspects of public policy, attracting considerably more interest. Wicksell married Anna Bugge in 1887. Economics in Sweden at the time was taught as part of the law school, and Wicksell was unable to gain a chair until he was awarded a law degree. Accordingly, he returned to the University of Uppsala where he completed the usual four-year law degree course in two years, and he became an associate professor at that university in 1899. The next year, he became a full professor at Lund University, where he would undertake his most influential work. After giving a lecture in 1908 satirising the Virgin birth of Jesus, Wicksell was deemed guilty of blasphemy and imprisoned for two months in 1910.  Later life  In 1916, he retired from his post at Lund and took a position at Stockholm advising the government on financial and banking issues. In Stockholm, Wicksell associated himself with other future great economists of the so-called \\"Stockholm School,\\" such as Bertil Ohlin, Gunnar Myrdal and Erik Lindahl. He also taught a young Dag Hammarskj√∂ld, the future Secretary-General of the United Nations. Wicksell died in 1926 while he was writing a final work on the theory of interest.  Work  = Influences = Wicksell was enamored with the theory of L√©on Walras (the Lausanne school), Eugen von B√∂hm-Bawerk (the Austrian school), and David Ricardo, and sought a synthesis of the three theoretical visions of the economy. Wicksell's work on creating a synthetic economic theory earned him a reputation as an \\"economist's economist.\\" For instance, although the marginal productivity theory ‚Äì the idea that payments to factors of production equilibrate to their marginal productivity ‚Äì had been laid out by others such as John Bates Clark, Wicksell presented a far simpler and more robust demonstration of the principle, and much of the present conception of that theory stems from Wicksell's model. Wicksell's (1898, 1906) theory of the \\"cumulative process\\" of inflation remains the first decisive swing at the idea of money as a \\"veil\\" as well as Say's law. Extending from Ricardo's investigation of income distribution, Wicksell concluded that even a totally unfettered economy was not destined to equalize wealth as a number of Wicksell's predecessors had predicted. Instead, Wicksell posited, wealth created by growth would be distributed to those who had wealth in the first place. From this, and from theories of marginalism, Wicksell defended a place for government intervention to improve national welfare. Wicksell influenced the field of constitutional political economy. His 1896 work on fiscal theory Finanztheoretische Untersuchungen called attention to the significance of the rules within which choices are made by political agents, and he recognized that efforts at reform must be directed toward changes in the rules for making decisions rather than trying to influence the behaviour of the actors. =Interest and Prices, 1898 = Geldzins und G√ºterpreise, 1936 Wicksell's most influential contribution was his theory of interest, originally published in German language as Geldzins und G√ºterpreise, in 1898. The English translation Interest and Prices became available in 1936; a literal translation of the original title would read Money Interest and Commodity Prices. Wicksell invented the key term natural rate of interest and defined it at that interest rate which is compatible with a stable price level.Wicksell, K. Interest and Prices., Mises Institute website. If the interest rate falls short of the natural rate, inflation is likely to arise; if the interest rate exceeds the natural rate, this will tend to produce deflation. An interest rate that coincides with the natural rate ensures equilibrium in the commodity market and produces price level stability. This theory was adopted and expanded upon by the Austrian School, which theorized that an economic boom happened when (due to monetary expansions) the spot interest rate fell below the natural, unhampered money market rate. = Cumulative process = This contribution, called the \\"cumulative process,\\" implied that if the natural rate of interest was not equal to the interest rate on loans, investment demand and savings would differ. If the interest rate is beneath the natural rate, an economic expansion occurs, and prices, ceteris paribus, will rise. This gave an early theory of endogenous money ‚Äì money created by the internal workings of the economy, rather than external factors, and various theories of endogenous money have since developed.A handbook of alternative monetary economics, by Philip Arestis, Malcolm C. Sawyer, p. 53 Wicksell's theory of the \\"cumulative process\\" of inflation remains the first decisive swing at the idea of money as a \\"veil\\". Wicksell's process has its roots in that of Henry Thornton. Recall that the start of the Quantity theory's mechanism is a helicopter drop of cash: an exogenous increase in the supply of money. Wicksell's theory claims, indeed, that increases in the supply of money leads to rises in price levels, but the original increase is endogenous, created by the relative conditions of the financial and real sectors. With the existence of credit money, Wicksell argued, two interest rates prevail: the \\"natural\\" rate and the \\"money\\" rate. The natural rate is the return on capital ‚Äì or the real profit rate. It can be roughly considered to be equivalent to the marginal product of new capital. The money rate, in turn, is the loan rate, an entirely financial construction. Credit, then, is perceived quite appropriately as \\"money\\". Banks provide credit, after all, by creating deposits upon which borrowers can draw. Since deposits constitute part of real money balances, therefore the bank can, in essence, \\"create\\" money. = Quantity theory of money = Wicksell's main thesis, that disequilibrium engendered by real changes leads endogenously to an increase in the demand for money ‚Äì and, simultaneously, its supply as banks try to accommodate it perfectly. Given full employment (a constant Y) and payments structure (constant V), then in terms of the equation of exchange, MV = PY, a rise in M leads only to a rise in P. Thus, the story of the Quantity theory of money, the long-run relationship between money and inflation, is kept in Wicksell. Primarily, Say's law is violated and abandoned by the wayside. Namely, when real aggregate supply does constrain, inflation results because capital goods industries cannot meet new real demands for capital goods by entrepreneurs by increasing capacity. They may try but this would involve making higher bids in the factor market which itself is supply-constrained ‚Äì thus raising factor prices and hence the price of goods in general. In short, inflation is a real phenomenon brought about by a rise in real aggregate demand over and above real aggregate supply. Finally, for Wicksell the endogenous creation of money, and how it leads to changes in the commodity market is fundamentally a breakdown of the Neoclassical tradition of a dichotomy between monetary and real sectors. Money is not a \\"veil\\" ‚Äì agents do react to it and this is not due to some irrational \\"money illusion\\". However, we should remind ourselves that, for Wicksell, in the long run, the Quantity Theory still holds: money is still neutral in the long run, although to do so, Wicksell have broken the cherished Neoclassical principles of dichotomy, money supply exogeneity and Say's law. = Reception = Parts of Wicksell's ideas would be expanded upon by the Austrian school, which used it to form a theory of the business cycle based on central bank policy ‚Äì changes in the level of money in the economy would shift the market rate of exchange in some way relative to the natural rate, and thus trigger a change in the relative proportion of the production of consumer goods to investment, which would ultimately result in an economic correction, or recession, in which the proportion of production of consumption goods to investment in the economy is pushed back towards the level that the natural rate of interest would result in. The cumulative process was the leading theory of the business cycle until John Maynard Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money. Wicksell's theory would be a strong influence in Keynes's ideas of growth and recession, in Gunnar Myrdal's key concept Circular Cumulative Causation and also in Joseph Schumpeter's \\"creative destruction\\" theory of the business cycle. Wicksell's main intellectual rival was the American economist Irving Fisher, who espoused a more succinct explanation of the quantity theory of money, resting it almost exclusively on long run prices. Wicksell's theory was considerably more complicated, beginning with interest rates in a system of changes in the real economy. Although both economists concluded from their theories that at the heart of the business cycle (and economic crisis) was government monetary policy, their disagreement would not be solved in their lifetimes, and indeed, it was inherited by the policy debates between the Keynesians and monetarists beginning a half-century later. Wicksell also expressed his views on many social issues and was often a critic of the status quo. He questioned the institutions of rank, marriage, the church, the monarchy, and the military.Carlson, Benny and Lars Jonung. \\"Knut Wicksell, Gustav Cassel, Eli Heckscher, Bertil Ohlin and Gunnar Myrdal on the Role of the Economist in Public Debate\\". Econ Journal Watch. Volume 3, Issue 3, September 2006. While Wicksell fought for a more equal distribution of wealth and income, he saw himself primarily as an educator of the public. He desired to influence more than just the field of monetary economics.  Legacy  Elements of his public policy were taken strongly to heart by the Swedish government, including his price-level targeting rule during the 1930s (Jonung 1979) and his vision of a welfare state. Wicksell's contributions to economics have been described by some economists, including historian-of-economics Mark Blaug, as fundamental to modern macroeconomics. Michael Woodford has especially praised Wicksell's advocacy of using the interest rate to maintain price stability, noting that it was a remarkable insight when most monetary policy was based on the gold standard (Woodford, 2003, p. 32). Woodford calls his own framework 'neo- Wicksellian', and he titled his textbook on monetary policy in homage to Wicksell's work. = Economists influenced by Wicksell = * John Maynard Keynes * Friedrich Hayek * James M.

Hyperactivated sperm motility is characterised by a high amplitude, asymmetrical beating pattern of the sperm tail (flagellum). This type of motility may aid in sperm penetration of the zona pellucida, which encloses the ovum. Hyperactivation could then be followed by the acrosome reaction where the cap-like structure on the head of the cell releases the enzymes it contains. This facilitates the penetration of the ovum and fertilisation. Some definitions consider sperm activation to consist of these two processes of hyperactivation and the acrosome reaction Hyperactivation is a term also used to express an X chromosome gene dosage compensation mechanism and is seen in Drosophila. Here, a complex of proteins bind to the X-linked genes to effectively double their genetic activity. This allows males (XY) to have equal genetic activity as females (XX), whose X's are not hyperactivated. Mechanisms Mammalian sperm cells become more active when they approach an egg cell in a process called sperm activation. Sperm activation has been shown to be caused by calcium ionophores in vitro, progesterone released by nearby cumulus cells and binding to ZP3 of the zona pellucida. The initial change is called \\"hyperactivation\\", which causes a change in spermatozoa motility. They swim faster and their tail movements become more forceful and erratic. A recent discovery links hyperactivation to a sudden influx of calcium ion into the tails. The whip-like tail (flagellum) of the sperm is studded with ion channels formed by proteins called CatSper. These channels are selective, allowing only calcium ion to pass. The opening of CatSper channels is responsible for the influx of calcium. The sudden rise in calcium levels causes the flagellum to form deeper bends, propelling the sperm more forcefully through the viscous environment. Sperm hyperactivity is necessary for breaking through two physical barriers that protect the egg from fertilization. Hyperactivation has also shown to serve as a feature of the human sperm Chemotaxis. When the sperm is exposed to chemo-attractant, especially progesterone; the sperm will exhibit sudden flagellar arrest, followed by sharp turn and hyperactivation. This response suggests that hyperactivation serves as method to quickly guide sperm through chemo- attractant gradient. Importance to Fertilization Before reaching the egg, the sperm are often trapped in epithelial cells in a Fallopian tube, meaning they are rendered inert unless they undergo hyperactivation. The change in motion and force of the tail movements enable the sperm to escape from the epithelium. Thus, only those sperm which have undergone hyperactivation have the ability to fertilize the egg.

Day for night is a set of cinematic techniques used to simulate a night scene while filming in daylight. It is often employed when it is too difficult or expensive to actually shoot during nighttime. Because both film stocks and digital image sensors lack the sensitivity of the human eye in low light conditions, night scenes recorded in natural light, with or without moonlight, may be underexposed to the point where little or nothing is visible. This problem can be avoided by using daylight to substitute for darkness. When shooting day for night, the scene is typically underexposed in- camera or darkened during post-production, with a blue tint added. Additional effects are often used to heighten the impression of night. As film stocks and video cameras have improved in light sensitivity, shooting day for night has become less common in recent years. Techniques During the silent era of film, release prints were often tinted blue during night scenes to enhance the illusion. Although moonlight is not actually blue, it appears bluish to the human eye due to the Purkinje effect. To give a bluer appearance to scenes filmed in color, some techniques use 3200K tungsten-balanced rather than 5000K daylight-balanced film stock. The tungsten balance renders artificial lighting (street lights, headlights, lit windows, etc.) as white and unlit areas as \\"moonlight blue.\\" With professional video cameras, color temperature adjustments are made to achieve the same effect. With digital post production now nearly universal, the color temperature adjustment is usually made in camera, to preserve the \\"white\\" artificial lights, but scene darkening is left to post production for finer control of the effect. Underexposing the shot can add to the illusion of darkness or moonlight. It is typical to underexpose by about two f-stops. A neutral-density filter is often used to achieve this darkening, so that the camera aperture remains unchanged. Daytime sky can be darkened to simulate night. With black and white film, a red lens filter will turn a blue sky black. Infrared film is occasionally used for long shots, but it renders green foliage as white. Yellow or orange filters (Wratten 8 or 15) can be substituted for closer shots, to preserve the performers' flesh tones. With color film or video, a graduated neutral-density filter can achieve a similar effect, as can a polarizing filter. Using either of these filters can limit camera movement during a shot, as the axis of a graduated filter must match the horizon, and the effect of the polarizing filter changes as the axis of the camera lens moves relative to the sun. If the scene is backlit by the sun for a \\"moonlight\\" rim light effect, faces and other foreground details may be too dark to see properly. Partially filling shadows with reflectors or a 5000K (daylight-balanced) key light can compensate for this. Even so, shadow areas are still slightly under-lit, to match the higher contrast of the overall scene. With digital post-production techniques it is also common to add or intensify glare and light scattering from light sources that would otherwise be less pronounced in daylight, such as windows revealing indoor lighting, outdoor artificial lights, car headlights, and so on. Day for night techniques can be made more convincing through such digital effects. It is possible to digitally replace the entire sky to add the moon and stars, as was done for the film Cast Away. For the 2015 film Mad Max: Fury Road, an unusual variation of the technique was used, in which scenes were deliberately overexposed, rather than underexposed as is typically recommended. Taking advantage of the dynamic range of the digital cameras used on the production, the shots were then darkened and color-graded a bluish tint in post- production, with the result that detail was maintained in the shadows rather than being clipped, as might happen when underexposing. Instead of shooting during midday, it is also common to shoot at dawn or dusk. During these periods, car headlights, streetlights, and interior lights are on, as they would be at night. This is sometimes referred to as \\"dusk for night.\\" Shooting this way can be difficult because the desired lighting conditions last only a short time, during which both light levels and color temperatures are constantly changing. In other media A similar technique can sometimes be observed in older hand-tinted postcard views, where a \\"night\\" view of a scene is created by simply re-tinting the original (black and white) photo with darker coloration, suggestive of night. File:On the boardwalk at Ocean City, Md (72788).jpgOriginal scene File:On the boardwalk at night, Ocean City, Maryland (78230).jpg\\"Night\\" version Though the results resemble day for night film and video shots, the techniques are quite different. Instead of reducing the exposure of the print made for the night version, the colorist painted an identical print with darker individual tints. No attempt at an overall bluish effect was made, and many colors are actually warmer in the \\"night\\" scene. (Compare the two beach umbrellas.) Convincing bright hot spots were added to the streetlights, which are unlit in the original, and the sky was supplied with fewer, wispier clouds.

The university comprises five colleges and is a doctorate degree- granting institution. History The school was founded in December 1960 by the Presbyterian Church of Korea. The original idea was conceived in the 1920s but permission was not granted by the Japanese governor at the time. In the late 1950s the Presbyterian Church of Korea secured US$150,000 by raising funds at an American conference. In the first few years Seoul Women's University only had two main buildings, with Dr. Hwang Kyung Koh as the first president of the university. Campus today The university now boasts 5 colleges, with 31 majors for undergraduate students, 25 departments for students studying for their master's degree and 13 departments in 2 divisions for students going for their doctoral degrees. International opportunities Through various partnerships and exchange programs with universities in the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Great Britain, New Zealand, Vietnam, China and Japan, Seoul Women's University offers many chances for people from many countries to interact. Korean students are offered short term cross cultural exchange programs, and international students are offered internships after finishing their studies. Korean students also have the chance to spend a year abroad in Canada, America, New Zealand, France, Great Britain, Germany, Vietnam, China or Japan. Other opportunities include the SWELL English program, and the Bahrom International Program. SWELL English The SWELL program stands for Seoul Women‚Äôs University English Language License. It is one of the unique programs at Seoul Women‚Äôs University. This program has two types: regular classes during semesters or an intensive program in the summer and winter vacations. The main goal of these two programs is exactly the same: improving English skills of all three areas: writing, speaking, and listening. However, the characteristics are different. A regular class during the semester is only for Seoul Women's‚Äô University students whereas intensive program is for anyone who is willing to study English intensively. In a regular SWELL class, students commute from their home. The class starts at 7:15 am. However, students can take regular SWELL courses between classes, so not just the early birds can participate in the program. All classes are small and taught by an English speaker, mostly American and Canadian teachers. On the other hand, in the intensive SWELL program, students live in dormitory for six weeks. The most remarkable feature of this program is that participants should speak only English. Therefore, a lot of students of Seoul Women's‚Äô University, as well as other well-known university students in Korea, join this program to advance their English skills. The Intensive SWELL program is not only a demanding course, but has various enjoyable activities such as banquet day, sports days, a singing contest, a field trip, and so on. In other words, swellers (a term for participants in the intensive SWELL program) attain more active English from different activities rather than passively learn from only English textbooks. The two SWELL programs have different resident styles, a different period of time, and include different events; however, both programs are valuable in terms of enhancing English skills. Bahrom international program The Bahrom buildings. The Bahrom International program strives to invite foreign students from the university's sister colleges in Canada and The United States to learn about and experience Korean culture. Exchange students of Seoul Women's‚Äô University who are going to sister colleges in the following semester participate in this program. According to a division of International Relations in Seoul Women's University , participants will learn about Korean lifestyle, historical and religious background, the economic issues, politics, North/South tension, Korean pop culture and Korean language through lectures and hands-on experiences such as field trips and group activities. For four weeks of the program, participants live in the Bahrom Education building. In each room, two Korean students and one foreign student stay together. Fostering closer relationships between Korean students and foreign students enables foreign students to learn more about Korea as well as to have unforgettable memories in Korea. Also, Korean students receive a lot of ongoing help from foreign students who are from sister colleges that they are going to as exchange students.

Double liability may be mitigated in a number of ways, for example, a jurisdiction may: * exempt foreign-source income from tax, * exempt foreign-source income from tax if tax had been paid on it in another jurisdiction, or above some benchmark to exclude tax haven jurisdictions, or * fully tax the foreign-source income but give a credit for taxes paid on the income in the foreign jurisdiction. Jurisdictions may enter into tax treaties with other countries, which set out rules to avoid double taxation. These treaties often include arrangements for exchange of information to prevent tax evasion such as when a person claims tax exemption in one country on the basis of non-residence in that country, but then does not declare it as foreign income in the other country; or who claims local tax relief on a foreign tax deduction at source that had not actually happened. The term \\"double taxation\\" can also refer to the taxation of some income or activity twice. For example, corporate profits may be taxed first when earned by the corporation (corporation tax) and again when the profits are distributed to shareholders as a dividend or other distribution (dividend tax). There are two types of double taxation: jurisdictional double taxation, and economic double taxation. In the first one, when source rule overlaps, tax is imposed by two or more countries as per their domestic laws in respect of the same transaction, income arises or deemed to arise in their respective jurisdictions. In the latter one, when same transaction, item of income or capital is taxed in two or more states but in hands of different person, double taxation arises.income tax india International double taxation agreements It is not unusual for a business or individual who is resident in one country to make a taxable gain (earnings, profits) in another country. It could happen that a person will need to pay tax on that income locally and also in the country in which it was made. The stated goals for entering into a treaty often include reduction of double taxation, eliminating tax evasion, and encouraging cross-border trade efficiency. It is generally accepted that tax treaties improve certainty for taxpayers and tax authorities in their international dealings. A DTA (double tax agreement) may require tax to be levied by the country of residence, and be exempt in the country in which it arises. In other cases, the resident may pay a withholding tax to the country where the income arose, and the taxpayer receives a compensating foreign tax credit in the country of residence to reflect the fact that tax has already been paid. In the former case, the taxpayer would declare himself (in the foreign country) a non-resident. In either case, the DTA may provide that the two taxation authorities exchange information about such declarations. Because of this communication between the countries, they also have a better view on individuals and companies who are trying to avoid or evade tax.Darren Rykers (2009): A Critical Analysis of how Double Tax Agreements can facilitate Fiscal Avoidance and Evasion; The Taxpayer and the Lotus, 17 Nov. 2009. Individuals (\\"natural persons\\") can only be resident for tax purposes in one country at a time. Corporate persons, owning foreign subsidiaries, can be based in one country and simultaneously based in another country: a subsidiary may make substantial income in one country but remit that income (as license fees, for example) to a holding company in another country that has a lower rate of corporation tax. Because of this, the control of unreasonable tax avoidance of corporations becomes more difficult and it requires more investigation when goods, rights and services are transferred.Gio Wiederhold (2013): Valuing Intellectual Capital, Multinationals and Taxhavens; Springer Verlag, 2013, Chap.4. =Double taxation relief= Countries may reduce or avoid double taxation either by providing an exemption from taxation (EM) of foreign-source income or providing a foreign tax credit (FTC) for tax paid on foreign-source income. The EM method requires the home country to collect the tax on income from foreign sources and remit it to the country where it arose. Tax jurisdiction extends only to the national border. When countries rely on territorial principle as described above, they usually depend on the EM method to relieve double taxation. But the EM method is only common for certain income classes or sources, such as international shipping income for example. The FTC method is used by countries that tax (individual or corporate) residents on income, irrespective of where it arises. The FTC method requires the home country to allow credit against domestic tax liability where the person or company pay foreign income tax. Another solution used is 'relief provision'. They create more favorable terms for multinational companies to (remain) based in countries that use less effective measures than the EM or FTC method.Ernest R. Larkins(2001): Double Tax Relief for Foreign Income: A Comparative Study of Advanced Economies; HeinOnline, 2001. Vol:21:233 European Union In the European Union, member states have concluded a multilateral agreement on information exchange. This means that they will each report (to their counterparts in each other jurisdiction) a list of those people who have claimed exemption from local taxation on grounds of not being a resident of the state where the income arises. These people should have declared that foreign income in their own country of residence, so any difference suggests tax evasion. (For a transition period, some states have a separate arrangement.See (17) and (18) of 2003/48/EC above, for a \\"temporary\\" period, Austria, Belgium and Luxembourg may apply a withholding tax to non-resident accounts rather than exchange information. They may offer each non-resident account holder the choice of taxation arrangements: either (a) disclosure of information as above, or (b) deduction of local tax on savings interest at source as is the case for residents). A 2013 study by Business Europe says that double taxation remains a problem for European MNEs and an obstacle for cross border trade and investments. In particular, the problematic areas are limitation in interest deductibility, foreign tax credits, permanent establishment issues and diverging qualifications or interpretations. Germany and Italy have been identified as the Member States in which most double taxation cases have occurred. =Cyprus= Cyprus has entered into over 45 double taxation treaties and is negotiating with many other countries. Under these agreements, a credit is usually allowed against the tax levied by the country in which the taxpayer resides for taxes levied in the other treaty country, resulting in the taxpayer paying no more than the higher of the two rates. Some treaties provide for an additional tax credit for tax which would have been otherwise payable had it not been for incentive measures in the other country which result in exemption or reduction of tax. = Czech Republic ‚Äì Korea DTA= In January 2018, a DTA was signed between Czech Republic and Korea. The treaty eliminates double taxation between these two countries. In this case, a Korean resident (person or company) that receives dividends from a Czech company needs to balance the Czech dividend withholding tax but also the Czech tax on profits, profits of the company that pays the dividends. The treaty covers taxation of dividends and interest. Under this treaty, dividends that are paid to the other party will be taxed at the maximum of 5% of the total amount of dividend for legal entities as well as for individuals. This treaty reduces from 10% to 5% the limit for taxing paid interest. Copyrights to literature, works of art etc. still remain free from taxation. For patents or trademarks a maximum 10% tax rate is implied. = German taxation avoidance = If a foreign citizen is in Germany for less than a relevant 183-day period (approximately six months) and is tax resident (i.e., and paying taxes on his or her salary and benefits) elsewhere, then it may be possible to claim tax relief under a particular Double Tax Treaty. The relevant 183 day period is either 183 days in a calendar year or in any period of 12 months, depending upon the particular treaty involved. So, for example, the Double Tax Treaty with the UK looks at a period of 183 days in the German tax year (which is the same as the calendar year); thus, a citizen of the UK could work in Germany from 1 September through the following 31 May (9 months) and then claim to be exempt from German tax. As the double taxation avoidance agreements will give the protection of income from some countries, =The Netherlands = Different factors such as political and social stability, an educated population, a sophisticated public health and legal system, but most of all the corporate taxation makes the Netherlands a very attractive country of doing business in. The Netherlands levies corporate income tax at a 25 per cent rate. Residents taxpayers are taxed on their worldwide income. Non- residents taxpayers are taxed on their income derived from Dutch sources. There are two sorts of double taxation relief in The Netherlands. Economic double taxation relief is available with regard to proceeds from substantial equity investments under the participation. Juridical double taxation relief is available for resident taxpayers having foreign source income items. In both situations there is a combined system in place which makes difference in active and passive income.Maarten F. de Wilde & Geert T. W. Janssen(2011): The Netherlands: Key practical issues to eliminate double taxation of business income. Erasmus School of Law, 2011. = Hungary = Hungary is unique as it is the only non-developing country (the other, developing country being Eritrea, at a flat 2%) that considers all of its citizens tax residents, and provides no personal allowance (such as the US foreign earned income exclusion) ‚Äì income is taxed from the first penny earned. While double taxation agreements do provide for relief from double taxation, Hungary only has some 73 of them in place. This means that Hungarian citizens receiving income from the 120-odd countries and territories that Hungary has no treaty with will be taxed by Hungary, regardless of any tax already paid elsewhere. India  India has comprehensive double taxation avoidance agreement with 88 countries, out of which 85 have entered into force. This means that there are agreed rates of tax and jurisdiction on specified types of income arising in a country to a tax resident of another country. Under the Income Tax Act 1961 of India, there are two provisions, Section 90 and Section 91, which provide specific relief to taxpayers to save them from double taxation. Section 90 (bilateral relief) is for taxpayers who have paid the tax to a country with which India has signed double taxation avoidance agreements, while Section 91 (unilateral relief) provides benefit to tax payers who have paid tax to a country with which India has not signed an agreement. Thus, India gives relief to both kinds of taxpayers. The rates differ from country to country. Example of double taxation avoidance agreement benefit: Suppose interest on NRI bank deposits attracts 30 per cent tax deduction at source in India. Since India has signed double taxation avoidance agreements with several countries, tax may be deducted at only 10 to 15 per cent instead of 30%. In case of any conflict between the provisions of the Income Tax Act or double taxation avoidance agreement, the provisions of the latter prevail. A large number of foreign institutional investors who trade on the Indian stock markets operate from Singapore and the second being Mauritius. According to the tax treaty between India and Mauritius, capital gains arising from the sale of shares are taxable in the country of residence of the shareholder and not in the country of residence of the company whose shares have been sold. Therefore, a company resident in Mauritius selling shares of an Indian company will not pay tax in India. Since there is no capital gains tax in Mauritius, the gain will escape tax altogether. The Protocol for amendment of the India-Mauritius Convention signed on 10 May 2016, provides for source-based taxation of capital gains arising from alienation of shares acquired from 1 April 2017 in a company resident in India. Simultaneously, investments made before 1 April 2017 have been grandfathered and will not be subject to capital gains taxation in India. Where such capital gains arise during the transition period from 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2019, the tax rate will be limited to 50% of the domestic tax rate of India. However, the benefit of 50% reduction in tax rate during the transition period shall be subject to the Limitation of Benefits Article. Taxation in India at full domestic tax rate will take place from financial year 2019-20 onwards. The revised double taxation avoidance agreement between India and Cyprus signed on 18 November 2016, provides for source based taxation of capital gains arising from alienation of shares, instead of residence based taxation provided under the double taxation avoidance agreement signed in 1994. However, a grandfathering clause has been provided for investments made prior to 1 April 2017, in respect of which capital gains would continue to be taxed in the country of which taxpayer is a resident. It also provides for assistance between the two countries for collection of taxes and updates the provisions related to Exchange of Information to accepted international standards. The India-Singapore double taxation avoidance agreement at present provides for residence based taxation of capital gains of shares in a company. The Third Protocol amends the agreement with effect from 1 April 2017 to provide for source based taxation of capital gains arising on transfer of shares in a company. This will curb revenue loss, prevent double non-taxation and streamline the flow of investments. In order to provide certainty to investors, investments in shares made before 1 April 2017 have been grandfathered subject to fulfillment of conditions in Limitation of Benefits clause as per 2005 Protocol. Further, a two-year transition period from 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2019 has been provided during which capital gains on shares will be taxed in source country at half of normal tax rate, subject to fulfillment of conditions in Limitation of Benefits clause. The Third Protocol also inserts provisions to facilitate relieving of economic double taxation in transfer pricing cases. This is a taxpayer friendly measure and is in line with India's commitments under Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action Plan to meet the minimum standard of providing Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) access in transfer pricing cases. The Third Protocol also enables application of domestic law and measures concerning prevention of tax avoidance or tax evasion. Singapore's investment of $5.98 billion has over taken Mauritius's investment of $4.85 billion as the single largest investor for the year 2013‚Äì14. Australia  In principle, an Australian resident is taxed on their worldwide income, while a non-resident is taxed only on Australian-sourced income. Both legs of the principle may give raise to taxation in more than one jurisdiction. To avoid double taxation of income by different jurisdictions, Australia has entered into double taxation avoidance agreements (DTAs) with a number of other countries, under which both countries agree on which taxes will be paid to which country. For example, the DTA with the United States provides that, in the case of royalties, the US will tax Australian residents at the rate of 5%, and Australia will tax it at normal Australian rates (i.e., 30% for companies) but give a credit for the 5% already paid. For Australian residents, this results in the same liability as if the royalties had been earned in Australia, while the US retains the 5% credit. United States =U.S. citizens and resident aliens abroad= In principle, United States citizens are liable to tax on their worldwide earnings, wherever they reside. However, some measures mitigate the resulting double tax liability. First, an individual who is a bona fide resident of a foreign country or is physically outside the United States for an extended time is entitled to an exclusion (exemption) of part or all of their earned income (that is, personal service income, as distinguished from income from capital or investments). That exemption was $103,900 for 2018, pro-rated. (See IRS form 2555.) Second, the United States allows a foreign tax credit by which income tax paid to foreign countries can be offset against U.S. income tax liability attributable to any foreign income not covered by this exclusion. The foreign tax credit is not allowed for tax paid on earned income that is excluded under the rules described in the preceding paragraph (i.e. no double dipping). = Double taxation within the United States = Double taxation can also happen within a single country. This typically happens when sub-national jurisdictions have taxation powers, and jurisdictions have competing claims. In the United States a person may legally have only a single domicile. However, when a person dies different states may each claim that the person was domiciled in that state. Intangible personal property may then be taxed by each state making a claim. In the absence of specific laws prohibiting multiple taxation, and as long as the total of taxes does not exceed 100% of the value of the tangible personal property, the courts will allow such multiple taxation. Also, since each state makes its own rules on who is a resident for tax purposes, someone may be subject to the claims by two states on his or her income. For example, if someone's legal/permanent domicile is in state A, which considers only permanent domicile to which one returns for residency but he or she spends seven months of the year (say April‚ÄìOctober) in state B where anyone who is there longer than six months is considered a part- year resident, that person will then owe taxes to both states on money earned in state B. College or university students may also be subject to claims of more than one state, generally if they leave their original state to attend school, and the second state considers students to be residents for tax purposes. In some cases one state will give a credit for taxes paid to another state, but not always. =Taxation of corporate dividends= In the US, the term \\"double taxation\\" is sometimes used to refer to dividend taxation. This situation arises when corporate profits are considered to have been taxed twice: first when earned by the corporation (corporation tax) and again when the profits are distributed to shareholders or stockholders as a dividend or other distribution (dividend tax).Robert Carroll (2010) Lanfeng Kao & Anlin Chen (2011): Dividend policy and elimination of double taxation of dividends; Asia-Pacific Journal of Financial Studies. 2011 China In recent years, the development of overseas investment of Chinese enterprises is growing rapidly and has become rather influential. Thus, dealing with cross-border taxation matters turns into one of the significant financial and trade projects of China, and the problems of cross-border taxation is still increasing. In order to solve the problems, the multilateral tax treaties between countries, which can provide legal support to help enterprises from both sides with double taxation avoidance and tax issues solutions, are established. To fulfill the \\"going global\\" strategy of China and support the domestic enterprises to adapt to the globalization situation, China has been making efforts on promoting and signing multilateral tax treaties with other countries to achieve mutual interests. By the end of November 2016, China has officially signed 102 double taxation avoidance agreements. Out of which 98 agreements have already entered into force. In addition, China signed double taxation avoidance arrangement with Hong Kong and Macau Special Administrative Region. China also signed double taxation avoidance agreement with Taiwan in August 2015, which has not entered into force yet. According to the Chinese State Administration of Taxation, the first double taxation avoidance agreement was signed with Japan in September 1983. The latest agreement was signed with Cambodia in October 2016. As for the situation of state disruption, China would continue the signed agreement after the disruption. For example, China first signed double taxation avoidance agreement with Czechoslovakia Socialist Republic in June 1987. In 1990, Czechoslovakia divided into two countries, Czech Republic and Slovakia Republic, and the initial agreement signed with Czechoslovakia Socialist Republic was continually used in two new countries. In August 2009, China signed the new agreement with Czech Republic. And when it comes to the special case of Germany, China continued using the agreement with The Federal Republic of Germany after two Germanys reunited. China have signed double taxation avoidance agreement with many countries. Among them, there are not only countries which have made large investment in China, but also countries which as well-relationship recipient of Chinese investment. As for the agreement quantity, China is now next only to United Kingdom. For those countries which have not signed the double taxation avoidance agreements with China, some of them signed information exchange agreements with China. There are mainly four effects of signing Double Taxation Avoidance agreement. 1\\\\. Eliminate the double taxation, decrease the tax cost of \\"going global\\" enterprises. 2\\\\. Increase the certainty of taxation, decrease the risk of cross-border taxation 3\\\\. Decrease the tax burden of \\"going global\\" enterprises in the host country, improve the competitiveness of those enterprises. 4\\\\. When taxation disputes occur, the agreements can provide bidirectional consultation mechanism, solve the existed disputed problems. Under general conditions, the tax rate under tax treaty is often lower than the domestic tax rate under the law of host country. Take Russia as an example, in Russia, the standard withholding tax rate of interest and royalty under domestic law is both 20%. According to the newest tax treaty China signed with Russia, the withholding tax rate of interest is 0 and the withholding tax rate of royalty is 6%. This can obviously reduce the tax cost of enterprises, increase the willing of \\"going global\\" and the competitiveness of domestic enterprises, and bring the goodness.

It is home to the municipal council of Kv√¶nangen. The village has a population (2017) of 405 which gives the village a population density of .  General information  Burfjord lies on the northern border of Troms County, along the busy European route E6 highway that winds its way through this part of Northern Norway. The village is located at the end of the Burfjorden, an arm of the Kv√¶nangen fjord. It is about straight west of the town of Alta and the Alta Airport. The services of Burfjord include a bank, a post office, a gas station, a medical office, a nursing home, a dentist, a primary school, grocery shops, and Burfjord Church. Burfjord's residents are composed of a mix of indigenous Sami people, Kven people, and ethnic Norwegians. Sami tourist stops selling handicrafts are located all around the village.  History  Burfjord's growth as a town is relatively recent. Prior to 1500, the Kv√¶nangen region was almost entirely inhabited by indigenous Sami peoples, who at some point left the traditional nomadic life of reindeer herding atop the mountain plateau and settled to fish and farm as sj√∏same (sea-Sami). The first scouts northward from Trondheim found no southern Norwegians living in or around the area. During the early 18th century, Burfjord and the larger Kv√¶nangen region became inhabited by Norwegians from the south who plied their trade fishing and farming, as well by the Kv√¶ns, Finns who emigrated from the east. Despite the Kv√¶ns remaining a minority, population-wise, they nevertheless gave Kv√¶nangen its namesake. Kv√¶nangen was originally part of the Skj√¶rv√∏y parish in northern Troms county. Kv√¶nangen became a separate sub-parish in 1861. It was in the 19th century that Burfjord grew in size and is listed as a town. Due to its geographically central location, it was chosen as the capital of Kv√¶anangen.

It is a four-lane bridge‚Äìtunnel composed of bridges, trestles, man-made islands, and tunnels under a portion of the Hampton Roads harbor where the mouths of the James, Nansemond, and Elizabeth Rivers come together. It connects the independent cities of Newport News on the Virginia Peninsula and Suffolk in South Hampton Roads and is part of the Hampton Roads Beltway, a circumferential interstate highway which links the seven largest cities of Hampton Roads. The MMMBT, completed in 1992 provided a third major vehicle crossing of the Hampton Roads harbor area, supplementing the Hampton Roads Bridge‚ÄìTunnel which carries Interstate 64 between the independent cities of Hampton and Norfolk, and the James River Bridge connecting the independent city of Newport News and Isle of Wight County in the South Hampton Roads region. All three facilities are toll-free. The MMMBT cost $400 million to build, and it includes a four-lane tunnel that is 4,800 feet (1,463 m) long, two man-made portal islands, and 3.2 miles (5.1 km) of twin trestle. Battle of Hampton Roads Map of Interstate 664 The MMMBT is named for the two ironclad warships which engaged in the famous Battle of Hampton Roads on March 8‚Äì9, 1862, during the US Civil War. The battle took place between the USS Monitor and the CSS Virginia. The latter ship had been rebuilt from the wreck of the USS Merrimack. The site of the battle was within 1 mile (1.6 km) of the bridge‚Äìtunnel structure named by the Commonwealth of Virginia as a memorial.

It is a four-lane facility comprising bridges, trestles, man-made islands, and tunnels under the main shipping channels for Hampton Roads harbor in the southeastern portion of Virginia in the United States. It connects the historic Phoebus area of the independent city of Hampton near Fort Monroe on the Virginia Peninsula with Willoughby Spit in the city of Norfolk in South Hampton Roads, and is part of the Hampton Roads Beltway. History and design Prior to the opening of the HRBT (and well before even the HRBT's counterpart the Monitor‚ÄìMerrimac Memorial Bridge‚ÄìTunnel), VDOT operated ferries to carry vehicle traffic across the harbor from the Southside to the Peninsula. There were two routes: one from Hampton Boulevard near Naval Station Norfolk to downtown Newport News, and a second, less popular route from Willoughby Spit to Fort Monroe in Hampton. Traffic at the time was typically about 2500 vehicles per day. The original two-lane structure opened November 1, 1957 at a cost of $44 million as a toll facility. As population and traffic grew, construction on a parallel bridge- tunnel facility began in 1972. The construction of the $95 million second portion of the HRBT was funded as part of the Interstate Highway System as authorized under the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, as a portion of I-64, which means that it was funded with 90% FHWA funds from the Highway Trust Fund and 10% state DOT funds. The second span opened on November 1, 1976 as a toll- free roadway. = Design = The HRBT has two -wide lanes each way, on separately built bridge‚Äìtunnel structures. The bridge‚Äìtunnel was originally signed as State Route 168 and U.S. Route 60. It later received the Interstate 64 designation when the second span opened in 1976, and, much later, SR 168 was truncated south of the crossing. The centerline of the HRBT tunnels cross a naturally deep channel ranging from 50 to 60 feet deep, 1-1/2 mile wide, with water only 6-10 feet deep between the edge of the deep channel and each shore. Part of the design features of the HRBT involved the use of man-made islands for the tunnel portals at the place where Hampton Roads flows into the Chesapeake Bay. The Hampton Roads Bridge‚ÄìTunnel south portal island connects to about of land that is the site of Fort Wool, a fort during the American Civil War, World War I and World War II, and a public park since 1970. Fort Wool is on a man-made island known as Rip Raps, created in 1818. There is a small earthen causeway that connects Fort Wool to the HRBT south portal island including the island across the navigational channel of the mouth of Hampton Roads from Old Point Comfort was created for Fort Calhoun (a portion of the Fort Monroe complex later renamed Fort Wool).  Modern day  The eastbound span Given its proximity to the U.S. Navy's Atlantic Fleet home base at Naval Station Norfolk, many nearby shipyards and critical port facilities, the HRBT design incorporates a tunnel instead of a more cost effective drawbridge. A bridge‚Äìtunnel, if destroyed in wartime or due to natural disaster, would not block the vital shipping channels. Eastbound in the tunnel Another four-lane facility, the Monitor‚ÄìMerrimac Memorial Bridge‚ÄìTunnel (MMMBT) was completed in 1992. The MMMBT provided a second bridge‚Äìtunnel crossing of the Hampton Roads harbor, supplementing the Hampton Roads Bridge‚ÄìTunnel and providing some traffic relief. The MMMBT also forms part of the Hampton Roads Beltway, and is also toll-free. = Over-height vehicles = The tunnel entrance The current westbound tunnel from Norfolk to Hampton is the original tunnel constructed in 1957 and has a lower clearance than the newer eastbound tube built in the 1970s‚Äî as opposed to . Because of this, special over-height detectors have been installed near the Willoughby Spit end of the bridge alerting the truck driver to stop at the inspection station for a more precise measurement of the trucks height. If a truck driver ignores this alert or for whatever reason doesn't stop at the inspection station, VDOT personnel at the tunnel will be alerted and the truck will be alerted and flagged to stop prior to the entrance to the tunnel, where with a fine of up to $2,500 may be assessed if the over height occurs during rush hour. This is because any vehicle turnaround at the tunnel requires a full-stoppage of traffic in both directions in order to redirect the affected vehicle from one side of the bridge-tunnel to the other. VDOT currently has identified new systems to improve the overheight detection system, by detecting vehicles well in advance of the tunnel to cut down on the over heights approaching the tunnel, This project is estimated to cost the state $900,000. =July 2009 flood= In July 2009, the westbound tube partially flooded after a thunderstorm hit the Hampton Roads region. The flooding was caused by a failed water main, which burst and led a chamber below the tunnel roadway to fill with millions of gallons of water. Pumps designed to remove water from the chamber were overwhelmed, and water began to puddle on the roadway, forcing VDOT to close the tunnel for nearly seven hours during midday on July 2, 2009. This closure forced hundreds of thousands of commuters, tourists, as well as Hampton Roads residents heading westbound for the Fourth of July holiday, to divert and go through the MMMBT or the James River Bridge, the only alternate routes to get to the Peninsula. The MMMBT had troubles of its own during the afternoon, as a pileup shut down the northbound lanes, closing the tunnel and causing a traffic jam along I-664. The James River Bridge was also closed on July 2 because of downed wires from the storm. The series of events involving all three water crossings led to a \\"perfect storm\\" of traffic which led to gridlock throughout all major arteries of Hampton Roads. The flooding of the Hampton Roads Bridge‚ÄìTunnel caused widespread concern about evacuation capabilities of the region during the approach of a hurricane, as the HRBT, MMMBT and the James River Bridge serve as the primary hurricane evacuation routes for residents of Virginia Beach, Portsmouth, Norfolk, and Chesapeake. = July 2016 vehicle crash and fire = At 7:30 pm on July 16, 2016, a two- car collision between a Volkswagen Passat and an Acura occurred three-quarters of the way inside the eastbound tunnel, which travels from Hampton to Norfolk. The Acura was rear-ended by the Passat; both vehicles burst into flames and filled the tunnel with smoke, leaving 35 vehicles stuck inside the tunnel behind the scene. Because neither of the tunnels have escape walkways, 80 drivers and passengers were required to walk out of the tunnel through the smoke, leaving their vehicles behind. Fifteen people were treated on the scene for smoke inhalation, while four others were taken to the hospital. The fires caused moderate to major damage to the walls of the tunnel, which VDOT repaired through nightly road work at the tunnel. The crash shut down traffic in both directions for four hours, finally reopening westbound at 11 pm, and reopening eastbound at 11:45 pm. The driver of the Passat was cited with following too closely by Virginia State Police. Expansion plans According to VDOT, in 1958, an average of 6,000 vehicles a day used the facility whereas an average of 88,000 vehicles a day were using the crossing in 2008, with volumes exceeding 100,000 during the tourist season, well exceeding the original design capacity of 77,000 vehicles per day, which sparked decades of debate on how to improve traffic flow at the region's most important water crossing. Studies into the growing traffic at the HRBT have roots back to the early 1990s. In 1992, the Virginia General Assembly had requested that VDOT study growing traffic at the HRBT. The conclusion of that study determined that a long-term large-scale solution to the problem would be required to alleviate backups. For the next fourteen years, VDOT would undertake numerous studies in 1999, 2008, 2012 and 2016, to help choose a candidate build that was financially and physically feasible to build. After nearly two decades of studies and planning, the Commonwealth Transportation Board, and the two regional boards responsible for the project (HRTPO/HRTAC) voted unanimously in 2016 to a $3.3 billion expansion of the current bridge-tunnel and its approaches from four lanes to six lanes in both directions from the I-664 interchange to the I-564 interchange, with a new, three lane bridge tunnel built to carry traffic eastbound (Hampton to Norfolk). A Final Environmental Impact Study was published in May 2017, and the Record of Decision from the FHWA was granted in June. There is no current timeline for construction, however, HRTPO's Executive Director has stated that the project should be completed by 2024, while internal planning documents suggest no later than 2028.

The group, which included Daniel Bedingfield, Dido, Justin Hawkins of The Darkness, Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead, Chris Martin of Coldplay, Bono of U2, and Paul McCartney, re-recorded the 1984 song \\"Do They Know It's Christmas?\\", written by Band Aid organisers Bob Geldof and Midge Ure. Recording The song was recorded on 14 November 2004, to benefit Sudan's troubled Darfur region, and was released that same month. The single became the UK's biggest seller of 2004 as well as the Christmas number one. Bono and Paul McCartney were the only artists from the original Band Aid to lend their voices to Band Aid 20. There was a reported dispute over the line 'Well tonight thank God it's them, instead of you', which Bono sang on the original version. Justin Hawkins, of The Darkness, laid down a version of the line, as did Robbie Williams, but Bono insisted on re-recording his version, which was eventually used on the record. Travis lead singer Fran Healy, who played guitar on the recording, said, \\"It's dead exciting. When [the 1984 version] was first recorded, I was 11 and I went everywhere looking for it and I couldn't find it, and now we're going to do the follow-up to it. It's going to be great, McCartney's doing it, Bono's going to sing his own line, [and] we're going to help out with some music, with Nigel Godrich, who produced the single. I really wanted to get Franz Ferdinand involved in it -- I think they're going to do it, although I haven't spoken to Midge Ure for about a week now.\\" \\"Midge did a thumbnail sketch of the original with new music on it,\\" Healy continued. \\"He's got the Darkness doing the guitars at the end, and he's changed the arrangement of it. He shipped that over to L.A. where Nigel was working with McCartney. If it turns out absolutely shit, it does not matter. What I will say is you've got to buy the record because it's the only record that's going to save lives this side of Christmas, and you can't ask for more than that.\\" A special documentary titled Band Aid 20: Justice, Not Charity, which went behind-the-scenes of the new recording, was broadcast by BBC One on 6 December 2004. Release The Band Aid 20 single was first played simultaneously on The Chris Moyles Show (on BBC Radio 1) and the breakfast shows on Virgin Radio and Capital Radio, at 8 am on 16 November 2004. The music video was first broadcast in the UK simultaneously over multiple channels, including the five UK analogue terrestrial channels, at 5:55 pm on 18 November 2004, with an introduction by Madonna. One of the new ways to buy the song, by downloading it from the internet, hit a problem when Apple Computer's iTunes Music Store initially refused to supply it, due to their fixed-pricing policy. A partial solution was reached after a few days, enabling UK users to download the song at the standard iTunes price, with Apple donating an extra amount (equivalent to the price difference) to the Band Aid Trust. The single sold 72,000 copies in the first 24 hours when it was released on 29 November 2004, and went straight in at No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart on 5 December 2004. The CD version sold over 200,000 copies in the first week and was the fastest-selling single of the year. It stayed at No. 1 for Christmas and the week after, a total of four weeks, one week shorter than the 1984 original. It was the last single ever to sell a million physical copies in the UK as the format largely died out other than as a niche product. The single was supported by companies such as the mobile entertainment provider, WebTV, which allowed customers to play and purchase the song and music video on their mobile phones. It could also be purchased with a bundle of tracks including both the original 1984 version and the 2004 version of \\"Do They Know It's Christmas?\\". HMV stores opened early to give customers more time to buy the single and staff wore Band Aid 20 shirts that said, \\"Have you bought your copy yet?\\". Prime Minister Tony Blair was seen picking up a copy of the charity single at an HMV store in Edinburgh. Critical reception Band Aid 20's efforts met with mixed criticism. The BBC said the new generation of singers, who differed greatly from those that appeared on the 1984 original, endeavoured to fit their talents into a 20-year-old template resulting in an \\"anonymous\\" record. The Guardian said the appearance of female singers was successful.

The main access routes to Fourways are off the N1 at R511 William Nicol Drive, or alternatively along R564 Witkoppen Road. It is located mostly in Region E of the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality. It is roughly as far as one can go in the Johannesburg Metropolitan area before it dissolves into rolling hills, game farms and the capital Pretoria, 55 kilometres to the northeast. Hartebeespoort verch Dam and the Magaliesberg Mountains lie half an hour to the north-west. It is bordered by Bryanston to the east and south and Randburg to the west. The Fourways district is also home to the Fourways Mall which became the largest shopping centre in Africa post an extensive upgrade.  History  Long before the district came to be called Fourways, it was a residence and game farm owned by the Eriksen family. The residence they built here in the early 1940s was named Norscot Manor (after their nationalities 'Nor'wegian and 'Scot'tish). The house is in the classic Cape Dutch style, although it is far too large and misshapen to be considered a true Cape Dutch. After being sold off piece by piece, the stately manor house was given to the City Council of Johannesburg in the 1970s, who named the suburb that was planned around it 'Norscot'. The mansion now serves Fourways as Norscot Manor Recreation Centre, the majority of it being a library, but also encompassing an art gallery, lessons for children in Irish & Highland dancing, Ballet, Biodanza, Indian and Modern dancing as well as Judo and Karate, a playground and a tea garden. There has been much alteration to the manor. It contains Art Deco finishes which abound and remain, such as seashell-inspired window fastenings, and air grates above windows delicately molded of plaster and depicting classic Art Deco ideas: the stag and a sylph- like female form in a forest. In 2015, the Norscot manor house was awarded 'blue plaque' heritage status from the City of Johannesburg, which was unveiled by local Ward Councillor Chris Santana on 18 February 2015.http://fourwaysreview.co.za/191057/norscot-manors-proud-unveiling/ Fourways was so named because of the four-way stop where William Nicol Drive and Witkoppen Road met. Today William Nicol Drive cuts under Witkoppen Road and is 3 lanes wide. The Fourways name is symbolised with two four-way roundabouts on Kingfisher Drive, the main thoroughfare of the Greater Fourways suburb, intersecting Robin Drive and Alexander Avenue. This suburb also has the original (circa 1905) house the Eriksen lived in before Norscot Manor was built, and it can be found on Flamingo Avenue.  Geography  The district of Fourways encompasses several suburbs and estates. The suburbs include Fourways (on the Western side of William Nicol Drive, with a small portion on the Eastern side colloquially known as Little Fourways), Magalies View, Bryanston Ext. 34, several Magaliessig extensions, Norscot, Norscot Slopes, Lonehill and Beverley, Craigavon, Broadacres. The estates are Cedar Creek, Cedar Lakes, Fourways Gardens, Dainfern, Dainfern Valley, Dainfern Ridge and Fernbrook Estate. The estates have come to be because of the city's high crime rate. Dainfern is centred on a golf course, while Cedar Lakes, Fourways Gardens and Fernbrook Estate are centred on family ideals and parks, Fourways Gardens has a small nature enclosure which used to be home to a set of zebra and several blue cranes. The weather is warmer here than that to the South. Fourways will, on average, enjoy Pretoria's temperatures, owing to their proximity. Of the koppies located in Greater Johannesburg, Fourways has one located in the Fourways Nature Reserve, named the Norscot Koppies. Lonehill and Beverley has another, located in the Lonehill Nature Reserve, named the Lonehill Koppie. Apart from the metropolitan's older and most prestigious suburbs, such as Westcliff in Johannesburg and Sandhurst in Sandton, this district has some of the metro's priciest and most sought-after homes. Central Fourways comprises the entertainment district. These centres are Design Quarter, just north of Magaliessig, Fourways Mall north of Fourways, Montecasino to the east of Fourways, Fourways Crossing just east of Fourways Mall and the newest development, Cedar Square to the north-west of Fourways Mall. It must be mentioned that Broadacres and Lonehill are served by their own smaller shopping centres. These centres are chic, and are frequented by stay-at-home moms, Broadacres being the particular favourite because of the large park-like grounds it encloses, making it a safe and enjoyable haven for children.  Schools  Fourways has several reputable schools. They include the government school Fourways High School in Greater Fourways (grades 8-12), the private Crawford schools: Pre-Primary, and Preparatory in Craigavon (grades 000-7) as well as Crawford Pre-Primary, Preparatory and College in Lonehill (grades 000-12). Dainfern is served by Dainfern College (grades 0-12). Residents of Fourways have a precedent stake in entering their children in Bryanston's elite government primary schools Bryandale Primary School and Bryanston Primary School, because of Fourways' close proximity to Bryanston. The poor soil quality of the area is owed to the fact that the top-soil was sold off between the 1920s and 1960s. Some of the main attractions in Fourways are: *Fourways Mall, the first of the large malls in the area. *Cedar Square, home to various restaurants, a Virgin Active and the country's first 65m ski slope. *Montecasino, a faux-Tuscan complex designed by architect bureaus Creative Kingdom and Bentel Abramson & Partners. *Fourways Crossing, a \\"factory mall\\" style complex. These facilities are on the intersection between the R511 and Witkoppen Road, the intersection after which the area was named. Trivia There are two urban legends, one that the Lonehill Nature Reserve came to be when alarmed residents heard that an American had bought the topmost rock of the Lonehill Koppie. In a panic they had the surrounding area declared a nature reserve, and the American could no longer remove it. The second was that Afrikaners believed that the English would be driven out of South Africa if the top rock could be dislodged. The reserve is open from September through April on Saturdays and Sundays and is an idyllic place to laze away or exert oneself - both koppies may be climbed, and original rock art can be observed.

The institute conducts social research both in Norway and internationally. Fafo has offices in Oslo and Beijing. Fafo was founded by the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions (LO) in 1982 and was reorganised as an independent research foundation in 1993 with contributions from the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions, Norwegian Union of Municipal and General Employees and six major Norwegian companies (Orkla Group, Umoe, Elkem, Coop Norge, Sparebank1 Gruppen and Telenor). The first director of Fafo was Terje R√∏d Larsen (1982‚Äì1993). Under his leadership, Fafo became increasingly involved in international peace research and politics, particularly in the Middle East, from the late 1980s; the institute played a central role in the negotiations that culminated in the Oslo Accords. The origin of the Oslo Accords can be traced back to a research project initiated by Fafo in the Palestinian territories, and the negotiations that led to the accords were hosted by Fafo in Oslo.

It is also called the -MST or edge- weighted -cardinality tree. Finding this tree is NP-hard, but it can be approximated to within a constant approximation ratio in polynomial time. Problem statement The input to the problem consists of an undirected graph with weights on its edges, and a The output is a tree with vertices and edges, with all of the edges of the output tree belonging to the input graph. The cost of the output is the sum of the weights of its edges, and the goal is to find the tree that has minimum cost. The problem was formulated by . As cited by . and by . Ravi et al. also considered a geometric version of the problem, which can be seen as a special case of the graph problem. In the geometric -minimum spanning tree problem, the input is a set of points in the plane. Again, the output should be a tree with of the points as its vertices, minimizing the total Euclidean length of its edges. That is, it is a graph -minimum spanning tree on a complete graph with Euclidean distances as weights.. A preliminary version of this work was presented earlier, at the 5th Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, 1994, pp. 546‚Äì555. Computational complexity When is a fixed constant, the -minimum spanning tree problem can be solved in polynomial time by a brute-force search algorithm that tries all -tuples of vertices. However, for variable , the -minimum spanning tree problem has been shown to be NP-hard by a reduction from the Steiner tree problem. The reduction takes as input an instance of the Steiner tree problem: a weighted graph, with a subset of its vertices selected as terminals. The goal of the Steiner tree problem is to connect these terminals by a tree whose weight is as small as possible. To transform this problem into an instance of the -minimum spanning tree problem, attach to each terminal a tree of zero-weight edges with a large number of vertices per tree. (For a graph with vertices and terminals, they use added vertices per tree.) Then, they ask for the -minimum spanning tree in this augmented graph with . The only way to include this many vertices in a -spanning tree is to use at least one vertex from each added tree, for there are not enough vertices remaining if even one of the added trees is missed. However, for this choice of , it is possible for -spanning tree to include only as few edges of the original graph as are needed to connect all the terminals. Therefore, the -minimum spanning tree must be formed by combining the optimal Steiner tree with enough of the zero-weight edges of the added trees to make the total tree size large enough. Even for a graph whose edge weights belong to the set }, testing whether the optimal solution value is less than a given threshold is NP-complete. It remains NP-complete for planar graphs. The geometric version of the problem is also NP-hard, but not known to belong to NP, because of the difficulty of comparing sums of square roots; instead it lies in the class of problems reducible to the existential theory of the reals. The -minimum spanning tree may be found in polynomial time for graphs of bounded treewidth, and for graphs with only two distinct edge weights. Approximation algorithms Because of the high computational complexity of finding an optimal solution to the -minimum spanning tree, much of the research on the problem has instead concentrated on approximation algorithms for the problem. The goal of such algorithms is to find an approximate solution in polynomial time with a small approximation ratio. The approximation ratio is defined as the ratio of the computed solution length to the optimal length for a worst- case instance, one that maximizes this ratio. Because the NP-hardness reduction for the -minimum spanning tree problem preserves the weight of all solutions, it also preserves the hardness of approximation of the problem. In particular, because the Steiner tree problem is NP-hard to approximate to an approximation ratio better than 96/95,. the same is true for the -minimum spanning tree problem. The best approximation known for the general problem achieves an approximation ratio of 2, and is by ... This approximation relies heavily on the primal-dual schema of .. When the input consists of points in the Euclidean plane (any two of which can be connected in the tree with cost equal to their distance) there exists a polynomial time approximation scheme devised by ..

Guavina (SS-362) was launched by the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Co., Manitowoc, Wisc., 29 August 1943; sponsored by Miss Marie Roen; and commissioned 23 December 1943, Lieutenant Commander Carl Tiedeman in command. Guavina was initially ordered with the Balao class. However, Manitowoc did not receive the drawings for this class from Electric Boat in time to build SS-361 through SS-364 to the new design, so they were built as Gato class. Thus, in some references, these boats are listed with the Balao class.Friedman 1995, p. 209 After shakedown, Guavina was towed down the Mississippi in a floating drydock by tug Minnesota, reaching New Orleans 24 January 1944. She underwent training exercises at New Orleans and at Balboa, C.Z., before reaching Pearl Harbor 5 April to prepare for her first war patrol.  First war patrol, April ‚Äì May 1944  Guavina sailed 6 April 1944, on her first offensive cruise. On 22 April she sank by gunfire two trawlers loaded with lumber and cargo and 3 days later torpedoed a large \\"maru\\". Her first big kill came 26 April when she sent torpedoes into two of the merchant ships in a seven-ship convoy. One of them, Noshiro Maru, sank almost immediately after three tremendous explosions. The second maru also exploded, although persistent depth charging prevented Guavina from staying around to observe the sinking. After standing lifeguard duty off Wake Island during air strikes 21 May ‚Äì 26 May, the submarine returned to Majuro Atoll 28 May. Her aggressive first patrol forecast even greater service for the nation.  Second war patrol, June ‚Äì July 1944  On her second war patrol (20 June ‚Äì 31 July) Guavina sailed from Majuro to Brisbane, Australia, sinking 1 ship and rescuing 12 downed aviators. At 13:24 on 3 July she picked up an obviously important ship with four escorts, and trailed her to get in attack position. Finally at 03:48 the next morning Guavina launched four torpedoes, three of which hit and set off a tremendous explosion. The sub spent the next 3 hours running silent and deep to avoid a total of 18 depth charges and 8 aerial bombs, surfacing at 06:43 to observe the wreckage of Tama Maru (3,052 tons). A total of 321 troops, two gunners and eleven crewmen were killed. While on lifeguard duty off Yap 2 July to 21 July, Guavina picked up a total of 12 downed B 24 airmen, and then headed for Brisbane via Seeadler Harbor, Admiralty Islands.  Third and fourth war patrols, August ‚Äì December 1944  Guavina's third war patrol (16 August ‚Äì 29 September) took her along the Philippine coast off Mindanao. On 31 August she opened fire on two small coastwise steamers, chasing them almost onto the beach before finally destroying them. Then, after a period of lifeguard duty, on 15 September Guavina sighted a large ship, later revealed to be a transport at anchor. Closing for the kill she loosed a salvo of three torpedoes. Only one hit, so she fired three more, scoring twice. Although the target was enveloped in fire and smoke, it still did not sink; so Guavina administered the final fatal blow with a spread of two torpedoes which totally disintegrated the target. Departing Brisbane 27 October, Guavina headed to the South China Sea for her fourth war patrol. A night surface attack 15 November netted her a large maru; one torpedo hit caused a violent explosion, as the maru apparently was carrying aviation gasoline; a second fish sent through the fiery waters finished her. Tanker Down Maru fell victim to Guavina 22 November, and a second tanker anchored nearby met the same fate the following day. During the final month she searched for additional victims. Then finding unfavorable attack conditions, she sailed for port, making Perth, Australia 27 December.  Fifth and sixth war patrols, January ‚Äì May 1945  Working first with and then with and , Guavina spent her fifth war patrol (23 January ‚Äì 5 March 1945) again in the South China Sea. The value of the coordinated attack group was quickly proved as on 6 February Guavina was directed in for the kill by Pampanito and sank the 6,892-ton tanker Taigyo Maru. To avoid the subsequent depth charging, Guavina pulled the unusual maneuver of lying on the bottom near the stern of her recent victim. She returned Pampanito's favor the following day by providing a diversion in the form of four flares from her \\"Buck Rogers\\" gun as her sister sub maneuvered for a successful shot. Guavina sank another tanker, the 8,673-ton Eiyo Maru, 20 February, and suffered one of the severest depth chargings of the war. With no room to run, she lay on the bottom at while Japanese escorts and planes dropped a total of 98 depth charges and bombs during the next 7 hours. Battered but undaunted, she sailed to Subic Bay in the Philippines, arriving 5 March for a badly needed refit. On her sixth war patrol (21 March ‚Äì 8 May) Guavina worked in coordination with , , and Blenny in the South China Sea. A lack of targets resulted in her returning empty-handed, but she did rescue five B-25 crew members 28 March before returning to Pearl Harbor 8 May. With six successful war patrols behind her she proceeded to the West Coast for overhaul. She departed San Francisco for Pearl Harbor 6 August, but with the end of the war returned to the States. Guavina then put in at Mare Island and was placed in commission, in reserve, and Decommissioned 8 June 1946.  Post-war service as submarine tanker  From March 1949, Guavina underwent extensive overhaul and modification for conversion to a submarine oiler at Mare Island, and was even equipped with a snorkel. Guavina recommissioned in the active fleet as SSO-362 1 February 1950 at Mare Island. After operations along the West Coast, she sailed to Norfolk via Balboa and San Juan 24 July to 25 August. Further operations out of Norfolk were followed by overhaul at Philadelphia and on 29 January 1951, Guavina reported to Key West, her new homeport. Operating out of Key West, Guavina cruised to the Caribbean Sea and up the East Coast to Nova Scotia to test the concepts of fueling seaplanes and other submarines, although most of her work was in the Gulf of Mexico and the Straits of Florida. After overhaul at Philadelphia 18 April to 26 July 1952, Guavina was redesignated AGSS-362. Two more years of operations along the East Coast and in the Gulf were followed by a second extensive overhaul at Philadelphia. To aid refueling, Guavina gained a large, raised platform over the after torpedo room, which was soon dubbed the \\"flight deck\\". Guavina (AGSS-362), refueling a P5M Marlin flying boat off Norfolk, VA. in 1955. It was planned to use submarines to refuel the new jet-powered P6M SeaMaster flying boats. As part of this program Guavina was converted to carry 160,000 gallons of aviation fuel. And a flight deck it soon became as in January 1956 Guavina began testing the concept of mobile support of seaplanes from a submarine oiler. After an initial 2-week trial period, Guavina and a variety of seaplanes carried out refueling development for most of 1956. Sailing from Charleston 18 September, the submarine headed for the Mediterranean Sea. After her 2-month deployment there with the 6th Fleet and Patrol Squadron 56, Guavina returned to Key West 1 December, then put into Charleston for overhaul. Emerging from overhaul 12 July 1957 with the new designation AOSS-362, Guavina resumed her established pattern of testing various applications of submarine oiler and seaplane refueling concepts, operating principally in the Caribbean. Ranging along the coast from New London to Bermuda, she also engaged in antisubmarine exercises and other peacetime training missions.  Grounding  On February 16, 1958 Guavina was operating in the Bahamas and dropped anchor off the island of San Salvador. Overnight, high winds and heavy seas pushed her aground. Guavina spent several days stuck hard aground in the shallow sandy surf of San Salvador. She was eventually freed by the combined efforts of rescue and salvage vessels and and the ocean tugs and . Guavina sailed into the Charleston Navy Yard 4 January 1959, and decommissioned there 27 March, going into reserve. She served as a training ship for reservists in the 5th Naval District at Baltimore, MD until struck from the Navy List 30 June 1967 and sunk as a target by , off Cape Henry, VA with a MK 16-1 warshot.

It crosses the harbor of Hampton Roads at two locations on large four- laned bridge-tunnel facilities: the eastern half carries Interstate 64 (and U.S. Route 60) and uses the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel and the western half carries Interstate 664 and uses the Monitor-Merrimac Memorial Bridge-Tunnel. The beltway has the clockwise direction (as looking down at a map of the area) signed as the Inner Loop, and the counter-clockwise direction signed as the Outer Loop. The entire beltway, including the bridge-tunnels, is owned and operated by the Virginia Department of Transportation. History right Even before Interstate 64 was built beginning in 1958, from some of the earliest planning stages, there were hopes of a circumferential highway to Interstate highway standards for the Hampton Roads region. Some proposals envisioned state and local and/or toll funding if necessary to achieve that goal. Indeed, the first two-laned portion of the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel was built with toll revenue bond funding in 1957 prior to the creation of I-64. It carried U.S. Route 60 and State Route 168 designations, and tied in with the new Tidewater Drive in Norfolk. (Tolls were removed when the other two lanes and tunnel were built adjacently to the immediate south of the older structure with federal Interstate Highway funding in the mid 1970s.) Building of Interstate 64 was the first priority in the region, and a portion of Interstate 264 through Portsmouth connecting with the Downtown Tunnel was completed even as I-64 finally reached its eastern terminus at Bower's Hill in Norfolk County (which became the City of Chesapeake in 1963). I-64, the portion of the Hampton Roads Beltway which was completed first, makes a huge long arc around the area, from Hampton through portions of Norfolk, Virginia Beach, and Chesapeake and around Portsmouth to reach Bower's Hill at the edge of the Great Dismal Swamp. It was a number of years before the newer I-664 portion was built. The roadway connects with I-64 at Bower's Hill in Chesapeake and crosses through portions of Portsmouth and Suffolk to cross Hampton Roads via the Monitor-Merrimac Memorial Bridge-Tunnel and then pass through eastern Newport News to reconnect with I-64 in Hampton. This completed the loop in 1992. In January, 1997, a -long I-64/I-664 loop was designated by the Virginia Department of Transportation (and signed) as the Hampton Roads Beltway. Route description I-664 begins at a full Y interchange with I-64 and I-264 that serves as the terminus of all three Interstates in the Bowers Hill section of the city of Chesapeake. I-64 heads southeast as a continuation of the Hampton Roads Beltway through Chesapeake while I-264 heads east toward Portsmouth and Norfolk. I-664 heads west as an eight-lane freeway that has a southbound-only exit ramp to US 13 and US 460 (Military Highway) and crosses over Military Highway and a Norfolk Southern Railway rail line. The Interstate has a cloverleaf interchange with Military Highway, which here carries US 58 in addition to US 13 and US 460. The interchange also provides access to US 460 Alternate, which follows US 58 east into Portsmouth. I-664 curves north as a four-lane freeway that crosses Goose Creek and has a diamond interchange with SR 663 (Dock Landing Road) and a cloverleaf interchange with SR 337 (Portsmouth Boulevard). Just south of its partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 659 (Pughsville Road), I-664 crosses a rail line; a spur from that rail line heads north in the median of the freeway as the highway enters the city of Suffolk. The rail spur leaves the median and heads northeast toward Portsmouth just south of its interchange with SR 164 (Western Freeway) and US 17 (Bridge Road). SR 164 heads east toward downtown Portsmouth while US 17 heads northwest to the James River Bridge. There is no access from southbound I-664 to southbound US 17; that movement is made via the next interchange, a cloverleaf interchange with SR 135 (College Drive) that serves satellite campuses of Tidewater Community College and Old Dominion University and the Portsmouth neighborhood of Churchland. North of SR 135, northbound I-664 has a vehicle inspection station and crossovers before the highway enters the Monitor-Merrimac Memorial Bridge-Tunnel. The bridge-tunnel passes to the west of Craney Island, an artificial island in the city of Portsmouth that lies to the west of the mouth of the Elizabeth River. West of the highway is the confluence of the James River and Nansemond River to form Hampton Roads, as well as the James River Bridge a short distance to the north on the namesake river. I-664 heads north-northeast along a causeway for to a point west of the Newport News Middle Ground Light, where the pair of bridges curve to the north-northwest onto an artificial island where the highway descends into a pair of tunnels under the estuary's main shipping channel. The Interstate resurfaces on another artificial island at Newport News Point east of the coal piers in the city of Newport News. I-664 has a southbound vehicle inspection station adjacent to its first interchange in Newport News, with Terminal Avenue. The Interstate parallels the southern end of CSX's Peninsula Subdivision as it passes through interchanges with several streets to the east of downtown Newport News. The southern interchange has ramps to and from 25th, 26th, and 27th streets; the first two streets carry eastbound and westbound US 60, which is unmarked from I-664. The northern interchange has ramps to and from 35th Street and Jefferson Avenue; Jefferson Avenue is SR 143, which is also unmarked from the Interstate. I-664 curves east as a six-lane freeway away from the railroad and has an oblique crossing of SR 351 (39th Street) prior to half-diamond interchanges with Roanoke Avenue and Chestnut Street. The Interstate enters the city of Hampton and has diamond interchanges with Aberdeen Road and Powhatan Parkway before reaching its northern terminus at I-64. I-664 meets its parent highway at a directional T interchange above Newmarket Creek just south of Hampton Coliseum. The Hampton Roads Beltway continues east along I-64, continuing the Inner Loop. I-64 curves north- northeast to pass north of Downtown Hampton and cross the Hampton River, turning back southward to reach the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel, which it utilizes to cross the main shipping channel at the entrance to the harbor of Hampton Roads from the Chesapeake Bay. Once on the Southside, I-64 turns south through Norfolk, passing the eastern boundary of Naval Station Norfolk and Chambers Field, and the spur route supplying it, Interstate 564. It then becomes a six lane divided highway with a two lane reversible roadway in the middle, which is used for HOV-traffic during morning and afternoon rush hours. It continues through Norfolk, curving multiple times and eventually ending up heading due south as it passes the interchange with another of its spur routes, Interstate 264 on the northwest side of Virginia Beach. After I-264, there are no more directional markers I-64 until its \\"eastern\\" terminus, because I-64 \\"east\\" will actually head west after its current southward course, and vice versa. From I-264 to its \\"eastern\\" terminus, it is simply only signed as the Inner and Outer loop of the Hampton Roads Beltway. Shortly after the I-264 interchange, I-64 leaves Virginia Beach for the city of Chesapeake. It soon comes to a complex interchange between another of its spur routes, Interstate 464, along with SR 168 and U.S. 17. I-64, now running westward, crosses the Southern Branch of the Elizabeth River using the High Rise Bridge. The road then curves northwesterly and comes back to Bowers Hill, where it meets the western terminus of Interstate 264 and the southern terminus of Interstate 664, completing the Beltway.  Projects  = High Rise Bridge & I-64 widening = The Southside portion of the Beltway (from the I-464/SR 168/U.S. 17 interchange in Chesapeake to the Bowers Hill Interchange in Suffolk) was approved in March 2015 for the addition of two lanes of capacity in each direction, with the possibility of them being either 2 HOT lanes, 1 HOV & 1 general purpose lane or all four lanes being tolled. Widening would be accomplished by adding the lanes in the median east of U.S. 17 and to the outside shoulder west of U.S. 17. The approved plan also calls for the construction of a new, four-lane 135 ft. fixed span bridge to the south of the current High Rise Bridge. Construction will be conducted in multiple phases, similar to the widening project on the Peninsula: * The first phase of the project would widen I-64 to 6 lanes in each direction by adding the new lane to the median in both directions as a managed lane, begin the construction of the new High Rise Bridge, and replace and rehabilitate other existing bridges in the area. This segment is estimated to cost around $600 million. * The second phase would see all six lanes of I-64 shifted to the newly constructed bridge while the old bridge is demolished and replaced with a new four lane bridge that would eventually carry Inner Loop (I-64 West) traffic. * The final phase would see the addition of the fourth lanes of traffic added to both directions and the shift of Inner Loop/I-64 West to the newly reconstructed bridge. Once completed, the entire corridor would be an eight-lane stretch of highway, with two 135-ft fixed span bridges. Estimated costs for the entire project are currently estimated at $2.30 billion. Currently, the project is expected to be awarded in August 2017, with construction likely to begin in 2018. Plans have construction to be complete by 2020. = Outer Loop/I-264 interchange widening = In 2016, VDOT undertook a project to build and improve on the exit ramp from the Outer Loop (I-64 westbound, from Chesapeake towards Norfolk/Hampton) to eastbound I-264. The single lane exit ramp is typically highly congested during peak traffic hours due to the fact that it requires vehicles exiting onto I-264 to weave merge into a collector- distributor lane which carries traffic exiting to nearby Virginia State Route 403 (Newtown Road). Plans call for adding a second Outer Loop exit lane and widening of the exit ramp from one to two lanes. The project will also build a new, two lane collector distributor road for traffic exiting to Newtown Road, while allowing traffic from the Outer Loop to connect to the old collector- distributor lanes without weaving through traffic. The projects expected cost is $158 million, and should be completed by October 2019. = High Occupancy - Toll (HOT) lane conversion = As part of the I-64 Express Lanes project, the Hampton Roads Beltway will see the conversion of all of its HOV lanes to HOT lanes. Segment 1 will convert the 2 lane reversible roadway in Norfolk between the I-64/I-564 interchange and the I-64/I-264 interchange to HOT-2 lanes, Segment 2 would convert the single HOV-2 diamond lane in each direction to HOT-2 lanes, and will extend those lanes across the new High Rise Bridge to the Bowers Hill interchange, and Segment 3 would continue the project from the I-564/I-64 interchange in Norfolk across the Hampton Roads to the I-64/I-664 interchange in Newport News. Segment 1 is currently the only segment in active construction, with an operational date of late 2017. Segments 2 will be built as part of the I-64 Southside Widening in 2021 and the Segment 3 as part of the HRBT Expansion in 2024.

The site accommodates several British Army regimental museums, including those of the Parachute Regiment (named Airborne Assault) and the Royal Anglian Regiment. Based on the historic Duxford Aerodrome, the site was originally operated by the Royal Air Force (RAF) during the First World War. During the Second World War Duxford played a prominent role during the Battle of Britain and was later used by United States Army Air Forces fighter units in support of the daylight bombing of Germany. Duxford remained an active RAF airfield until 1961. After the Ministry of Defence declared the site surplus to requirements in 1969 the Imperial War Museum received permission to use part of the site for storage. The entirety of the site was transferred to the museum in February 1976.

Museum history The Imperial War Museum originated during the First World War in 1917 as the National War Museum committee, formed by the British government to record the war effort and sacrifice of Britain and her Empire. The museum opened in 1920, by which point it had been renamed the Imperial War Museum. With the outbreak of the Second World War, the museum's terms of reference were enlarged to include that conflict as well.'Imperial War Museum: Collection of war relics', The Times 14 May 1940 Issue 48615 Page 4 Column F The museum's terms of reference was broadened again in 1953 to include all modern conflicts in which British or Commonwealth forces were engaged.Imperial War Museum London (guidebook), (London: Imperial War Museum, 2009) pp. 2 The effect of these expansions of remit was to cause the museum's collections to expand enormously, to the point that many parts of the collection, especially those of aircraft, vehicles and artillery, could not be effectively stored or exhibited. Although the museum's south London home (a nineteenth-century building in Southwark which was previously the Bethlem Royal Hospital) had been extended in 1966, by the end of the decade the museum was seeking additional space. RAF Duxford, a Royal Air Force fighter station had been declared surplus to requirements by the Ministry of Defence in 1969, and the museum duly requested permission to use part of one of the airfield's hangars as temporary storage. Duxford featured three double bay hangars of First World War vintage, which together provided over 9000 m2 of space. Within two years, ten of the museum's aircraft had been brought to Duxford, and were being restored by volunteers of the East Anglia Aviation Society. While the museum's own aircraft were not restored to flying condition, by cooperating with private groups the museum was able to mount its first airshow in 1973. Further air shows followed, with a display in June 1976 attracting an audience of 45,000 people. The runway was bought by Cambridgeshire County Council in 1977. The success of these shows provided a valuable source of revenue, and complemented the efforts of volunteers, so that the museum applied for the permanent transfer of the entire site to its use. Permission was received in February 1976 and Duxford became the first outstation of the Imperial War Museum. Initially open from March‚ÄìOctober, Duxford received 167,000 visitors in the 1977 season, and 340,000 in 1978.

Site layout An aerial view of the Duxford site. Visible on the right is the large AirSpace exhibition hall, Hangars 2, 3, 4 and 5, the American Air Museum and the eastern end of the runway. When originally planned in 1917, Duxford aerodrome was to occupy a site divided by what is now the A505 road which runs north-east from Royston to Newmarket. The area north of the road would be occupied by accommodation and administrative buildings with the airfield, hangars and technical buildings on the south side. Still divided by the A505, the museum's site is now bounded to the east by the M11 motorway, which meets the A505 adjacent to the museum site at Junction 10. The construction of the M11 in 1977 forced the shortening of the runway by 300 m. In its role as a museum, the north side of the site is occupied by the Imperial War Museum's stored collections and is not generally open to the public, while the south side is occupied by various hangars and other historic buildings, purpose- built structures, and by two runways. The south side visitor entrance, which now houses a shop and visitor facilities, was previously the airfield's armoury.Duxford Update: A Duxford Buildings Tour www.Duxford-Update.info .

Early life Giorgio Perlasca was born in Como and grew up in Maser√†, province of Padua, Italy. During the 1920s, he became a supporter of Fascism, fighting in East Africa during the Second Italo-Abyssinian War, and in the Spanish Civil War for the Nationalist Corpo Truppe Volontarie. As a gratitude safe conduct for his service in Spain, he was awarded a diplomatic mission from Francisco Franco. Perlasca grew disillusioned with Fascism, in particular due to Benito Mussolini's alliance with Nazism and adoption of the Italian Racial Laws, that came into force in 1938. In World War II During the initial phase of World War II, he worked at procuring supplies for the Italian Army in the Balkans. He was later appointed as an official delegate of the Italian government with diplomatic status and sent to Eastern Europe with the mission of buying meat for the Italian army fighting on the Russian front. On 8 September 1943, Italy surrendered to the Allied forces. Italians had to choose whether to join Benito Mussolini's newly formed Italian Social Republic, which was fascist, or stay loyal to the King and join the Allies' side. Perlasca chose the latter. In Budapest, he was arrested and confined to a castle reserved for diplomats. After a few months, he used a medical pass that allowed him to travel within Hungary and he requested political asylum at the Spanish Embassy. He took advantage of his status as a veteran of the Spanish war. He adopted the first name of \\"Jorge\\" and, since Spain was neutral in the war, he became a free man. Perlasca worked with the Spanish Charg√© d'Affaires, √Ångel Sanz Briz, and other diplomats of neutral states to smuggle Jews out of Hungary. The system he devised consisted of furnishing 'protection cards' which placed Jews under the guardianship of various neutral states. He helped Jews find refuge in protected houses under the control of various embassies, which had extraterritorial conventions that gave them an equivalent to sovereignty. They could provide asylum for Jews.Yad Vashem, Giorgio Perlasca When Sanz Briz was removed from Hungary to Switzerland in November 1944, he invited Perlasca to accompany him to safety. However, Perlasca chose to remain in Hungary. The Hungarian government ordered the Spanish Embassy building and the extraterritorial houses where the Jews took refuge to be cleared out. Perlasca immediately made the false announcement that Sanz Briz was due to return from a short leave, and that he had been appointed his deputy for the meantime. Throughout the winter, Perlasca was active in hiding, shielding and feeding thousands of Jews in Budapest. He continued issuing safe conduct passes (initiated by Sanz Briz), on the basis of a Spanish law passed in 1924 that granted citizenship to Jews of Sephardic origin (descendants of Iberian Jews expelled from Spain in the late 15th century). In December 1944, Perlasca rescued two boys from being herded onto a freight train in defiance of a German lieutenant colonel on the scene. The Swedish diplomat-rescuer Raoul Wallenberg, also present there, later told Perlasca that the officer who had challenged him was Adolf Eichmann. During 45 days period from 1 December 1944 to 16 January 1945, Perlasca helped save more than 5,000 Jews, about four times more than saved by Oskar Schindler.Haaretz, 1992: A Fake Diplomat Who Saved 5,200 Jews Dies, 15 August 2013 According to Perlasca, he also prevented the execution of a plan to demolish the Budapest Ghetto with around 60,000 people in it, as the Nazis had done in Warsaw.VareseNews, Gli uomini giusti muoiono di sabato, 22 May 2010Interview by Enrico Deaglio to Giorgio Perlasca, from: Fondazione Giorgio Perslasca, Giorgio Perlasca - il mixer israeliano in ebraico, 1990Interview by Enrico Deaglio to Giorgio Perlasca, from: Mixer, Giorgio Perlasca, Giovanni Minoli, Rai, 1990United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Oral history interview with Giorgio Perlasca, 5 September 1990 While Perlasca was posing as the Spanish consul-general, he learned of the intentions of the SS and Arrow Cross to destroy the ghetto. Shocked and incredulous, he asked for a direct hearing with the Hungarian interior minister, G√°bor Vajna, and threatened him with legal and economic measures against the \\"3,000 Hungarian citizens\\" (in fact, a much smaller number) declared by Perlasca as residents of Spain, unless he withdrew the plan. Perlasca also offered to help Vajna and his family escape from Hungary before the advancing Soviet Army reached Budapest. The plan to raze the Budapest Ghetto was subsequently cancelled.  After the war After the war, Perlasca returned to Italy. He did not talk about his actions in Hungary to anyone, including his family, and lived a quiet, humble life. In 1987, a group of Hungarian Jews whom he had saved finally found him after searching for him for 42 years in Spain. There was publicity at the time, and Perlasca became noted for his heroic deeds. Enrico Deaglio wrote an account of his remarkable heroism, Banality of Goodness, (2002), which became a bestseller.

In 1906, as a novice member of a local combat group of the Tambov Socialists-Revolutionaries (SRs),Immediately after the Party of Socialists-Revolutionaries was founded in 1901, its Central Committee established a separate central terrorist unit, usually called the 'Combat Organisation' (Boyevaya Organizatsiya), specializing in the assassination of state leaders and officials of the highest rank. Besides it, \\"the SR leadership relied on smaller terrorist or combat units (boevye druzhiny), on the flying combat detachments (letuchie boevye otriady), or on isolated individuals to carry out assassinations\\". In the provinces party committees operated local combat units or resorted to individuals, in order to execute the death sentences they passed on provincial tsarist officials (Geifman, p. 58). she assassinated a security official. Her subsequent abuse by police earned her enormous popularity with the opponents of Tsarism throughout the empire and even abroad.Boniece, The _Shesterka_ , and McDermid, passim. After spending over 11 years in Siberian prisons she was freed after the February Revolution of 1917, and returned to European Russia as a heroine of the destitute, and especially of the peasants. She was the only woman other than Alexandra Kollontai to play a truly important role during the Russian Revolution,Cole, IV, part II, p. 842. leading the Left Socialist- Revolutionaries to initially side with Lenin and the Bolsheviks, and then to break with them. From 1918 on, she was repeatedly arrested, imprisoned, briefly detained in a mental sanitarium, sent into internal exile, and finally shot in 1941. A successful campaign was run to discredit her name and portray her as a hysterical extremist, and she was \\"forced into oblivion\\".Rabinowitch, 'Last Testament', p. 424. The Soviet attitude over time towards Spiridonova is exemplified by the Great Soviet Encyclopedia: no mention of her was made in either of the first two editions, published respectively during 1926‚Äì1947 and 1950‚Äì1958, and not until 1976 did a brief sketch appear in the third edition, vol. 24 (Maxwell, Narodniki women, p. 176). In 1958, when publishing the fourth volume of A History of Socialist Thought, G.D.H. Cole wrote that nothing was known of what had happened to her after 1920.Cole, IV, part I, p. 194. Twenty years later, Richard Stites was still uncertain whether her death occurred in 1937 or 1941.The women's liberation movement in Russia: Feminism, Nihilism and Bolshevism 1860-1930, Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1978; new edition, 1990, p. 313, note 12. Only after the end of Stalinism and the fall of the Soviet Union did it gradually become possible to reconstruct the last decades of her life. Biography = Early life = Spiridonova was born in the city of Tambov, located approximately south-southeast of Moscow. Her father, a bank official, was a member of the non-hereditary minor nobility of the Russian Empire.Rabinowitch, \\"Spiridonova,\\" pg. 182. She attended the local gymnasium until 1902, when the death of her father, and a case of tuberculosis, caused her to drop out. She studied dentistry in Moscow for a short while, before returning to Tambov to work as a clerk for the local Assembly of the Nobility. She soon became involved in political activism and was arrested during the student demonstrations of March 1905. In September 1905 she applied for training as a feldsher (a health care professional similar to a physician assistant) but was rejected due to her political record. Instead, she joined the Party of Socialists‚ÄìRevolutionaries (SRs), and became a full-time activist. During this time, she formed a relationship with Vladimir Vol'skii, a local SR leader. Like most SRs, she shared the Narodniks' philosophy of assassination and terrorism as a weapon of revolution, and was one of hundreds of SRs who, in the years around the 1905 Revolution, attacked the Russian state and its leaders. =Luzhenovsky assassination= Grigory Andreyevich Gershuni, founder of the SR Combat Organization (Akatuy 1906) Spiridonova's target was , a landowner and Tambov provincial councillor who had been appointed district security chief in Borisoglebsk, a town southeast of Tambov. Luzhenovsky, also a local leader of the Union of the Russian People (the most important branch of the Black Hundred), was known for his harsh suppression of peasant unrest in the district, and the SR committee in Tambov had \\"passed a death sentence on him\\". Spiridonova volunteered to kill him. She stalked Luzhenovsky for several days, and finally got her chance at the Borisoglebsk railway station on 16 January 1906. Disguised as a secondary school student, she fired several shots from a revolver and hit Luzhenovsky five times. He died on 10 February 1906.Boniece, \\"The Spiridonova Case\\", pp. 127-151. Unable to escape, Spiridonova tried to turn her weapon against herself but was restrained, brutally beaten and arrested by Luzhenovsky's Cossack guard. She was then transferred to the local police station where she was stripped naked, searched and mocked by her captors. She was interrogated and tortured for more than half a day by two government officials, P.F. Avramov, head of the Cossack guard, and T.S. Zhdanov, a local police officer. That night she was transported to Tambov by train. During the journey, Avramov subjected her to further ill-treatment and sexual harassment, possibly rape. The Luzhenovsky assassination was one of close to two hundred acts of SR \\"individual terror\\" during the Revolution of 1905-7.According to Anna Geifman, 3611 government officials were attacked by terrorists between October 1905 and September 1906. By the end of 1907, taking into account private individuals too, the number of terrorist casualties exceeded 9000 (Thou shalt kill, p. 21). It received mainly local attention until the following month,Boniece, \\"The Spiridonova Case\\", pp. 128-129 when Spiridonova succeeded in leaking a very well-thought-out letter to the press. It described the treatment she had received, including threats of gang rape directed at her, and hinted that Avramov might have raped her on the train to Tambov. The letter was published on 12 February 1906 by Rus, a liberal newspaper in Saint Petersburg, and soon taken up by others, becoming an immediate sensation with their readers. Progressive public opinion in Russia traditionally tended to consider terrorism with a certain degree of understanding, as it was regarded as a natural reaction against autocracy. For example in 1878 a jury caused a sensation by acquitting populist terrorist Vera Zasulich despite her pleading guilty to causing serious injury to Colonel Fyodor Trepov during a failed attempt to assassinate him. In the case of Spiridonova, many were outraged by the appalling cruelty to a prisoner, especially as she was an attractive young woman. Liberal circles throughout Russia condemned the Tambov authorities. Spiridonova was described as \\"a pure, virginal being, a flower of spiritual beauty ... [being put] into the shaggy paws of brutally repulsive, brutally malicious, brutally salacious orangutans\\".\\"Nasha Zhizn'\\" (Our Life), 8 March 1906; quoted in Boniece (2010), p. 143 The Shesterka (\\"Six\\") photographed at the Omsk station during their triumphal transfer to Siberia (Spiridonova is the first on the left in the foreground) Rus sent reporter Vsevolod A. Vladimirov to Tambov. He produced seven sensational articles that appeared in March 1906. These articles exaggerated Spiridonova's mistreatment and injuries, and more explicitly touched on her alleged rape. Vladimirov also glossed over Spiridonova's political convictions, portraying her as a genteel, high-principled victim of the tyrannical Russian system. This annoyed the Tambov SRs almost as much as it did the conservatives and the authorities. Spiridonova herself repudiated Vladimirov's account. On 11 March, Spiridonova was tried and convicted of Luzhenovsky's murder and sentenced to death. However, the tribunal also asked that the sentence be commuted to penal servitude in Siberia, in view of her ill health. This was approved on 20 March. The liberal press continued its campaign in her support. On 2 April Avramov was himself assassinated, creating a further sensation.Boniece, \\"The Spiridonova Case\\", p. 146. According to Anna Geifman, the second torturer Zhdanov, too, suffered the same fate the following month (p. 341, note no 78). The government released its report on the case on 8 April. The report acknowledged that Spiridonova had been beaten by the Cossacks at the time of her arrest, and that Avramov had verbally abused her on the train, but denied all the more lurid accusations. This was denounced by some as a whitewash. Secret letters from Spiridonova in prison to her sister Yulia, a fellow SR, had been seized by police on 19 February and were summarized by the Tambov deputy prosecutor in a report to the national authorities. His extracts indicate that Spiridonova consciously participated in the image-making that was going on outside, suggesting what should be emphasized and what should be played down. A request in one letter not to reveal her \\"romantic history\\", presumably her relationship with Volsky, was quoted. Many liberals called this an attempt to slander her morals. The governor of Tambov had known about the affair (Spiridonova appealed for a meeting with Volsky, whom she described as her fianc√© although he was already married), but did not pass on the information, which would have demolished Spiridonova's \\"virginal\\" image. Spiridonova was sent to Siberia in the company of five other prominent female SR terrorists. The group was sometimes called the Shesterka (\\"Six\\"). As a result of the press campaign, Spiridonova was the most famous. She was also young, attractive, and an ethnic Russian (at least four of the others were Jewish, Belarusian, and Ukrainian). The Shesterka were transported by train from Moscow to the Nerchinsk katorga, a system of penal labor colonies in Transbaikal (east of Lake Baikal and near the border of China). Their slow journey lasted around a month and turned into a kind of triumphal progress:Steinberg, Spiridonova,chapter V: Triumphal progress; p. 45 ff. the train was met at every stop by growing crowds of sympathizers. Each time, although she was suffering from a serious recurrence of tuberculosis, Spiridonova would get up from her couch, greet the audience with smiles and patiently answer their numerous questions, expounding the SR political program. , one of the Shesterka, later commented: The Shesterka (\\"Six\\") in exile at Akatuy (Spiridonova is the first on the left) Spiridonova and her comrades were first detained in the Akatuy penal colony. The prison regime of the colony was exceedingly mild, more similar to a sort of internal exile or political confinement than to a real prison. In 1907, however, they were removed to the new female colony that had been established at Maltsev, another centre of the Nerchinsk katorga. Here the rules of detention were somewhat stricter, albeit surely not so extreme as in 'the regimes of punishment and mistreatment that \\"politicals\\" endured elsewhere' (including beatings, floggings and isolation in dark, freezing cells).William Bruce Lincoln, The conquest of a continent: Siberia and the Russians, Ithaca/London: Cornell University Press, 2007, p. 279. 'For the Maltsev women there was no forced labor, only enforced isolation from the outside world in which each day was like the next and the one that had gone before'.Ibidem, p. 278. In 1908 a young Ukrainian maximalist, arrived at Maltsev. She had been convicted of involvement in a terrorist group. Kakhovskaya was a descendant of Decembrist revolutionary Pyotr Grigoryevich Kakhovsky, who had been hanged in 1826 for assassinating Saint-Petersburg Governor Mikhail Andreyevich Miloradovich, and another Grenadier officer. She formed a special friendship with Spiridonova and Izmailovich, a bond of political and personal sisterhood that would last throughout their lives.Maxwell, Narodniki women, chapter 12: Political Heroines in the Gulag, pp. 306 ff. After being finally released in the 1950s Kakhovskaya demanded in vain the full rehabilitation of her slain comrades. In 1959, at the age of 72, she insisted upon having a memorial she called Notes and Explanations (\\"Zapiski i Zaiavleniia\\") sent on to the Central Committee of the Communist party, to the Council of Ministers, and to the Office of the Public Prosecutor, with the sole aim of keeping alive the memory of her comrades' late years. It was mainly steadfast Kakhovskaya's credit that this memory was not completely lost. In April 1911, 28 female inmates, including Spiridonova, were transferred back to Akatuy where the conditions of their detention were further worsened, and they were forced to work in a bookbindery. The constant physical work, however, was eventually welcomed by the detainees, and made their prison life more tolerable.Steinberg, Spiridonova, p. 141 ff. =Left SR leader= Accommodation with the revolution After the February Revolution of 1917, Spiridinova was released from incarceration at the women's Akatuy prison by a general amnesty covering imprisoned political criminals. According to Alexander Rabinowitch, Spiridonova was widely esteemed by the common people of Russia, being venerated by many peasants as very nearly a saint. Spiridonova traveled from Siberia to Moscow to attend the 3rd National Congress of the Party of Socialists-Revolutionaries (the SRs) late in May 1917, but she was not elected to the governing Central Committee of the party. Despite this failure, Spiridonova became deeply involved in party affairs as a leader of the SR left wing and of the party's organization in the capital city of Petrograd.Rabinowitch, \\"Spiridonova,\\" pp. 182-183. She was also involved in work helping to establish soviets amongst the peasantry.Rabinowitch, \\"Spiridonova,\\" pg. 183. Following the October Revolution, Spiridonova cast in her lot with the Left SRs, who had split from their old party and sided with their erstwhile rivals of the Bolshevik Party. She was extremely supportive of efforts to forge a unity government between the Bolsheviks, the Left SRs, and the other socialist parties represented in the Soviets, but when it proved impossible to reach a general agreement she supported the Left SRs entering into a coalition government with only the Bolsheviks. Her name was included by the railroad union (Vikzhel) in a list of possible candidate ministers for the unity government, but she did not take a ministerial role in the new Bolshevik-Left SR government. Instead she was appointed head of the Peasant Section of the Central Executive Committee of the All-Russian Soviet of Workers', Peasants', and Soldiers' Deputies (VTsIK), making her nominally a chief official over peasant affairs. She was later one of a handful of Left SR leaders offering early support for Lenin's decision to agree to the draconian peace terms offered by the government of Imperial Germany in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. As the head of the Peasant Section of the VTsIK, Spiridonova appeared almost exclusively focused on winning the approval of the soviets and enforcement of an SR-inspired law of land socialization, constituting agrarian reform. The law was eventually passed on 19 February 1918.Translation of the Fundamental Law of Land Socialization. Consequently, for some months she strived primarily to safeguard the alliance with the Bolsheviks, even at the cost of being temporarily sidelined within her own party. On 18 January 1918, at the inaugural meeting of the Constituent Assembly both the Left SRs and the Bolsheviks proposed Spiridonova as their candidate for the chair, but centrist SR V√≠ktor Mikhailovich Chernov was elected instead. The Assembly was dissolved for good after the end of that same first session.Rabinowitch, The Bolsheviks, p. 114 ff. Revolt against Bolshevism Spiridonova at work as a Left SR leader The honeymoon between Spiridonova (and the Left SRs generally) and the Bolsheviks was short-lived. Late in the spring of 1918 Bolshevik military detachments were formed to conduct forced requisitions of grain in a desperate effort to stave off famine in the cities amidst economic collapse. \\"The brutal Bolshevik grain-procurement policy and the devastating impact on the peasantry of the Soviet government's vast territorial and increasingly onerous economic concessions to Imperial Germany\\" caused widespread discontent in the countryside and the Peasant Section of the VTsIK was overwhelmed with complaints and protests. As head of the Section, Spiridonova was especially aware of the deepening misery of peasants throughout the country.Rabinowitch, 'Last Testament', p. 426. Unity between Left SRs and Bolsheviks turned to rivalry over the future of the revolution and a competition ensued for control of the 5th Congress of Soviets, scheduled to begin in Moscow on 4 July 1918. Historian Alexander Rabinowitch summarized the prelude to what he would later term \\"the suicide of the Left SRs\\" in his work on the first year of Soviet rule in Petrograd:Rabinowitch, The Bolsheviks, chapter 11, The Suicide of the Left SRs, pp. 283-309. On 7 July 1918 two members of the Left SR Party, Iakov Bliumkin and , assassinated German ambassador Wilhelm Mirbach. Spiridonova immediately assumed the \\"political\\" responsibility for the attack on behalf of the party's Central Committee. In her 1937 letter to the NKVD (see below), she claimed also to have directed the attack (even showing a sort of 'professional' pride).On 30 July 1918 in Kiev a Left SR combat group led by Kakhovskaya assassinated Generalfeldmarschall Hermann von Eichhorn, the German military governor of Ukraine (Maxwell, Narodniki Women, pp. 271 ff). The situation did not evolve as the Left SR leadership had expected. Instead of fueling a new conflagration with Germany, Lenin used Mirbach's assassination as a pretext for the suppression of the Left SR organization: the terrorist attack was immediately portrayed as a straightforward uprising against Soviet power, and troops rapidly isolated the army units supporting their former allies.Rabinowitch, \\"Spiridonova,\\" pg. 184. Spiridonova rushed to the Bolshoi Theatre to take the floor before the ongoing 5th Congress of Soviets: she intended to explain and justify the Left SRs' political goals and plead for support, but found that the Congress had been suspended in the aftermath of the assassination and more than 400 Left SR delegates had been detained. Spiridonova and many other Left SR leaders were imprisoned in Moscow, her Peasant Section of the VTsIK was dissolved, and an undisclosed number of other party members (over 200 according to Spiridonova herself) were summarily shot.Rabinowitch, 'Last Testament', p. 428. After she was kept in jail for several months, it was announced that Spiridonova was to be tried on 1 December 1918. To undercut the possibility of a potentially volatile situation developing a secret trial was conducted on 27 November instead. Spiridonova was sentenced to one year in prison for her part in the Left SR revolt but was amnestied the next day. Further imprisonment Spiridonova became the voice of a radical faction of the Left SRs opposed to any accommodation with the \\"Communist\\" regime (as the Bolsheviks now styled themselves) and she publicly denounced the government for having betrayed the revolution with its policies and actions.Rabinowitch, \\"Spiridonova,\\" pg. 185. Despite her bitter refusal to compromise, Spiridonova remained separate from the party's ultra- left terrorist wing, focusing on the idea of revitalizing the system of Soviets in opposition to the rule of the Communist party by bureaucratic edict. In January 1919, after another public speech in opposition to the Communist government, Spiridonova was arrested by the Moscow Cheka. She was tried once more on 24 February 1919, with ex Left Communist leader Nikolai Bukharin as the sole witness for the prosecution. Bukharin charged that Spiridonova was mentally ill and a menace to society in the deadly political atmosphere of the Russian Civil War. Spiridonova was found guilty and sentenced to one year's incarceration in a mental sanitarium, effectively removing her from politics. Instead of a sanitarium, Spiridonova was actually confined in a small holding cell inside a military barracks in the Kremlin, where her already frail health rapidly deteriorated. Left SR militants organized her escape on 2 April 1919. Spiridonova subsequently lived underground in Moscow as a peasant woman under the pseudonym Onufrieva. She was rearrested 19 months later, ill with typhus and suffering from an unstated nervous disorder: it was 'the night of October 26, 1920, exactly three years after the victory of the October Revolution'.Steinberg, p. 265. This time, the Communist authorities proved somewhat more merciful than usual: given her extremely poor health, Spiridonova was initially put under house arrest. Alexandra Izmailovich was transferred from Butyrka prison and charged with nursing her, along with the party co-leader, Boris Kamkov, then possibly Spiridonova's romantic partner as well.According to American Anarchist Emma Goldman's subjective impression ‚Äî she spent a couple of days in hiding with Spiridonova and Kamkov in 1920 ‚Äî small gestures by the former clearly betrayed them to be in love with each other even though neither did ever explicitly touch on the matter in front of her, or even hint at it (L'√©pop√©e d'une anarchiste: New York 1886-Moscou 1920, Bruxelles: √âditions Complexe, 1984 and 2002, pp. 253-254, ). Kamkov was with her at the moment of arrest and was permitted to stay beside her for the next four months.Steinberg, Spiridonova, p. 265 ff. She was later transferred to a Cheka medical facility, then confined in a psychiatric prison. She was finally released to the custody of two Left SR comradesThey were the secretary of the central bureau of the Left SRs (legalists), , and the erstwhile People's Commissar for Justice and Spiridonova's future biographer, Isaac Nachman Steinberg (Rabinowitch, 'Last Testament', p. 429). on 18 November 1921 under the condition that she cease and desist all political activity. Historian Alexander Rabinowitch comments that there is no evidence that she ever violated this condition.Rabinowitch, \\"Spiridonova,\\" pg. 186. Spiridonova's active political life was at an end. = Persecution, death and legacy = Despite her withdrawal from active politics, she was arrested again on 16 May 1923. At the time large numbers of moderate socialist and liberal leaders were permitted or obliged to emigrate to the West (including the two Left Socialist-Revolutionaries to whom Spiridonova had been entrusted). Nevertheless Spiridonova was charged with \\"having made preparations to flee abroad\\" and sentenced to three years of administrative exile, a sentence that was repeatedly extended. She spent the rest of the 1920s in Kaluga (1923-25), Samarkand (1925-28) and Tashkent (1928-30). In 1930, after Stalin's consolidation of power, Spiridonova was arrested once again. Charged with maintaining contacts abroad, she was sentenced to three more years of administrative exile (twice extended), this time in Ufa, capital of the Bashkir Republic. She lived with her former prison partner Izmailovich during the whole period of exile. Kakhovskaya also spent time with them as often and as long as she was permitted to. In the mid 1920s Spiridonova had also married her fellow exile ,Rabinowitch, \\"Last Testament\\", p. 430. a Left SR leader of peasant origin and erstwhile Deputy People's Commissar for Agriculture.Steinberg, Spiridonova, \\"Illustrations\\", p. 192. In 1937 Spiridonova was arrested yet again, with several former party comrades including her husband, her teenaged stepson, her invalid father-in-law, Alexandra Izmailovich, Irina Kakhovskaya and the latter's aged aunt. The group was accused of plotting to create a united counter-revolutionary center and to assassinate Bashkir Communist leaders. Spiridonova underwent cruel interrogation in prison in Ufa and in Moscow for several months, without admitting any guilt, although a confession was extorted from her husband.According to the inquisitors of Spiridonova, Mayorov was threatened that his minor son and his sick aged father would be both interned for five years in a labour camp, and was eventually forced into signing his confession while 'wailing like a baby'. 'Mayorov crying?' wondered Spiridonova, 'In my nineteen years with him I had never seen him shed a tear, much less cry out loud. \\"What have you done to him?\\"' (Rabinowitch, 'Last Testament', p. 438). Both Izmailovich and Kakhovskaya refused either to confess anything or to accuse anybody. In November 1937 she wrote a long letter to the 4th Section of the Main Directorate of State Security (GUGB) within the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD) from her cell, protesting against the prison treatment inflicted on her, contesting the correctness of the judicial procedure and rejecting every single charge.The original text in Russian is available online at the Sakharov Center website: ¬´–ü—Ä–æ—è–≤–∏—Ç–µ –≥—É–º–∞–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –∏ —É–±–µ–π—Ç–µ —Å—Ä–∞–∑—É‚Ä¶¬ª : –ü–∏—Å—å–º–æ –ú. –ê. –°–ø–∏—Ä–∏–¥–æ–Ω–æ–≤–æ–π (\\"Be humane and kill me now ...\\": a letter from M.A. Spiridonova). Large excerpts translated into English are quoted in Rabinovich's cited essay, 'Maria Spiridonova's \\"Last Testament\\"'. The letter proclaimed that she fully supported the construction of socialism and acknowledged the Communist leadership. However, she concluded what was later called her 'last testament' with a vibrant heart-felt plea against capital punishment, twice abolished in the aftermaths of the February and October Revolutions and twice re-established by subsequent governments despite vehement protests from the Left Social-Revolutionaries: On 7 January 1938, she was eventually sentenced to 25 years in prison by the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court. After a hunger strike, she was held in isolation at Oryol Prison. On 11 September 1941 (three months after the German invasion of the USSR), Spiridonova, Izmailovich, Mayorov and over 150 other political prisoners (among them Christian Rakovsky and Olga Kameneva), were executed by order of Stalin in the Medvedevsky Forest massacre.Rabinowitch, 'Last Testament', p. 445. Despite Kakhovskaya's efforts after the 1956 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, \\"not until 1990 were the 1941 charges against Spiridonova rescinded [...] Finally, in 1992, [she] was exonerated of the charges for which she had been imprisoned and exiled beginning in 1918, and was fully rehabilitated.\\" The exact burial place of the Medvedevsky Forest victims has never been found.Rabinowitch, 'Last Testament', p. 446.

The film is about the visions, memories, and mysticism that help a middle-aged woman find the strength to leave her philandering husband. The film uses \\"caricatural types and dream situations to represent a psychic landscape.\\"Constantini, 188 It was Fellini's first feature-length color film, but followed his use of color in The Temptation of Doctor Antonio episode in the portmanteau film Boccaccio '70 (1962). Juliet of the Spirits won the 1966 Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Woody Allen loosely adapted it with his 1990 film Alice. Plot Giulietta explores her subconscious and the odd lifestyle of her glamorous neighbour, Suzy, as she attempts to deal with her mundane life and her philandering oppressive husband, Giorgio. As she increasingly taps into her desires (and her demons) she slowly gains greater self-awareness, leading to independence, although, according to Masina (Fellini's wife), the ending's meaning is debatable.

Fellini's longtime musical collaborator Nino Rota composed the soundtrack. Until his death in 1979, Rota wrote the music for every Fellini film except his directorial debut, Variety Lights. The music in Juliet of the Spirits contains circus themes, as in Fellini's 8¬Ω, and also uses organ, cocktail piano, guitar, saxophones, and voices without words to convey Juliet's shifts in feeling. The soundtrack was mentioned in a profile of the actor Steve Buscemi, which notes that \\"a Victrola sits in [Buscemi's] dining room, with the theme music for 'Juliet of the Spirits' permanently on its turntable.\\" Awards and nominations * 1965 New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Foreign Language Film Won * 1966 David di Donatello Award for Best Actress (Giulietta Masina) Won * 1966 Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign-Language Foreign Film Won * 1966 Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists Silver Ribbon for Best Cinematography, Color (Gianni Di Venanzo) * 1966 Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists Silver Ribbon for Best Production Design (Piero Gherardi) Won * 1966 Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists Silver Ribbon for Best Supporting Actress (Sandra Milo) Won * 1966 National Board of Review Award for Best Foreign Language Film Won * 1966 National Board of Review Award for Top Foreign Film Won * 1967 Kansas City Film Critics Circle Award for Best Director (Federico Fellini) Won * 1967 Sant Jordi Award for Best Foreign Film (Federico Fellini) Won Reception On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 79% based on 28 reviews, with an average rating of 7.2/10.

It helps the embryo exchange gases and handle liquid waste. The allantois, along with the amnion and chorion (other extraembryonic membranes), identify humans and other mammals as well as reptiles (including birds) as amniotes. Of the vertebrates, only the anamniotes (amphibians and non-tetrapod fish) lack this structure. Function This sac-like structure, whose name is the New Latin equivalent of \\"sausage\\" (in reference to its shape when first formed) is primarily involved in nutrition and excretion, and is webbed with blood vessels. The function of the allantois is to collect liquid waste from the embryo, as well as to exchange gases used by the embryo. =In reptiles, birds, and monotremes= The structure first evolved in reptiles and birds as a reservoir for nitrogenous waste, and also as a means for oxygenation of the embryo. Oxygen is absorbed by the allantois through the egg shell. =In marsupials= In most marsupials, the allantois is avascular, having no blood vessels, but still serves the purpose of storing nitrogenous (NH3) waste. Also, most marsupial allantoises do not fuse with the chorion. An exception is the allantois of the bandicoot, which has a vasculature, and fuses with the chorion. =In placental mammals= In placental mammals, the allantois is part of and forms an axis for the development of the umbilical cord. * The mouse allantois consists of mesodermal tissue, which undergoes vasculogenesis to form the mature umbilical artery and vein. * The human allantois is a caudal out-pouching of the yolk sac, which becomes surrounded by the mesodermal connecting stalk known as the body-stalk. The vasculature of the body-stalk develops into umbilical arteries that carry deoxygenated blood to the placenta. It is externally continuous with the proctodeum and internally continuous with the cloaca. The embryonic allantois becomes the fetal urachus, which connects the fetal bladder (developed from cloaca) to the yolk sac. The urachus removes nitrogenous waste from the fetal bladder.First AID for the USMLE Step 1 2008 Clinical significance During the third week of development, the allantois protrudes into the area of the urogenital sinus. Between the 5th and 7th week of development, the allantois will become the urachus, a duct between the bladder and the yolk sac. A patent allantois can result in urachal cyst.

He progressed onto small roles in TV dramas such as The Bill, London's Burning (appearing in the last ever episode) and Judge John Deed. Parker worked as a stunt double in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. He then came to wider attention in the role of Spencer Moon in the BBC soap opera EastEnders, where he played the younger brother of Alfie Moon, portrayed by British actor Shane Richie.

He has presented gardens at the Chelsea Flower Show on nine occasions from 1995 to 2016, winning a number od medals, including gold in 2011. He has also authored or co-authored at least ten gardening-related books. Early life Gavin was born in London on 10 May 1964, to Irish parents, and brought to Ireland when he was a month old. He grew up in the Fairways development in Rathfarnham, a suburb of Dublin. When Gavin was six, his younger brother Conor was killed by a car while they were walking to school. He received his primary school education in St. Joseph's Boys National School in Terenure Dublin 6. He received his secondary education at Templeogue College; he recalls the subjects as being \\"horrifying,\\" with the exception of art classes with a favourite teacher, Mr Weafer. He applied to the College of Amenity Horticulture at the Botanic Gardens in Glasnevin, Dublin, failing the first time, but securing entry three years later. Gardening career Gavin started work with small jobs, the first, a suburban house garden featuring gravel and railway sleepers, in 1988, while he was studying at Glasnevin, still intact as of 2016. A notable early commission was for social columnist Terry Keane, a contract during which he also met his future wife. =Design and consulting= Gavin runs his own garden and landscape design business, with an office in London, and contact details in Ireland also. The enterprise launched its website in 2005, but after a refresh, the site has displayed a holding page since 2013. Gavin has designed many gardens in the UK and Ireland, and beyond, for commercial, public sector and private clients. In interviews he has mentioned projects primarily in the UK and China, that his work primarily involves travel, and that he has never yet been to Ireland's national flower show, Bloom. In particular the projects in China have tended to be large-scale and of long duration, involving a lot of time away from home, and limiting his work in Ireland and the UK. =Chelsea Flower Show= By the end of 2019, Gavin has participated in the Royal Horticultural Society's Chelsea Flower Show nine times, seven on the main avenue, the last having been 2016. His first Chelsea garden, in 1995, was inspired by the coastal gardens of Noelle Campbell-Sharp at Canuig House in Ballinskelligs, County Kerry. He discussed some of his garden concepts, and material sourcing, in his autobiographical volume. He entered again in 1996. Gavin won a bronze medal in 1995, and a silver-gilt medal in 2004. In 2007, Gavin's Westland Garden, featuring recycled materials, also won a silver-gilt medal. The Sky Garden, 2011 Gold medal In May 2011 Gavin returned to Chelsea after a three-year gap, with his \\"Irish Sky Garden\\", which attracted funding of more than ‚Ç¨1.7 million from F√°ilte Ireland, the Irish tourism body, and was also supported by Cork City Council. Gavin described the garden as inspired by the Oscar-winning animator Richie Baneham (who drove visual effects for Avatar), as well as by the \\"suspended table\\" novelty restaurant concept, and by the Midsummer Festival of the Senses at Cork, the landscapes of Capability Brown, Charles Jencks and the some Italian Renaissance figures. The garden was built in an ovoid container suspended more than 25 metres above the ground. Twenty- five reflecting and flowing pools on the ground showcased the garden, which could be visited by show-goers in groups of up to eight. This garden won the gold medal at the show. The Sky Garden attracted controversy when Cork City Council in Ireland agreed to put the garden on permanent display at Fitzgerald's Park in the Mardyke area of the city ‚Äì at a cost of at least ‚Ç¨300,000 to the cash-strapped council. The decision attracted widespread criticism including that of a number of Cork city councillors with Councillor Ted Tynan pointed out that there were over 500 boarded up local council houses in the city and demanded clarification from the council as to what the exact cost of the garden would be. In the end, the garden was not set up in its full form, but aspects of its design were used in a reworking of Fitzgerald's Park. 2012- Gavin participated again in Chelsea, on the main avenue, in 2012, 2013 and 2016. His 2016 garden, the British Eccentric's Garden, inspired by Heath Robinson and others, sponsored by Harrods, and planted with help from Helen Dillon and Carmel Duignan, won a silver gilt medal.

Biography =Early life and family= Sammlung Duncker Augusta Victoria was born at Dolzig Castle, the eldest daughter of Frederick VIII, future Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg and Princess Adelheid of Hohenlohe- Langenburg, a great-niece of Queen Victoria. She grew up at Dolzig until the death of her grandfather, Christian August II, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein- Sonderburg-Augustenburg, in 1869. The family then moved to Castle Primkenau and the estate her father had inherited. She was known within her family as \\"Dona\\" =Crown Princess= German State Prussia, Wedding Medal 1881 Prince Wilhelm and Auguste Victoria, obverse The reverse shows the couple in Medieval costumes in front of 3 squires carrying the shields of Prussia, Germany, and Schleswig-Holstein On 27 February 1881, Augusta married her second cousin Prince Wilhelm of Prussia. Augusta's maternal grandmother Princess Feodora of Leiningen was the half-sister of Queen Victoria, who was Wilhelm's maternal grandmother. Wilhelm had earlier proposed to his first cousin, Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine (known in the family as \\"Ella\\"), a daughter of his mother's own sister, but she declined. He did not react well, and was adamant that he would soon marry another princess. Wilhelm's family was originally against the marriage with Augusta Victoria, whose father was not even a sovereign. However, Chancellor Otto von Bismarck was a strong proponent of the marriage, believing that it would end the dispute between the Prussian government and Augusta's father.Radziwill, p. 30. In the end, Wilhelm's intransigence, the support of Bismarck, and a determination to move beyond the rejection of his proposal to Ella, led the reluctant imperial family to give official consent. =Empress= Portrait of the Queen of Prussia, by Philip de Laszlo, 1908. Augusta was known as \\"Dona\\" within the family. She had a somewhat lukewarm relationship with her mother-in-law, Victoria, who had hoped that Dona would help to heal the rift between herself and Wilhelm; this was not to be the case. The Empress was also annoyed that the title of head of the Red Cross went to Dona, who had no nursing or charity experience or inclination (though in her memoirs, Princess Viktoria Luise paints a different picture, stating that her mother loved charity work). Augusta often took pleasure in snubbing her mother-in-law, usually small incidents, such as telling her that she would be wearing a different dress than the one Victoria recommended, that she would not be riding to get her figure back after childbirth as Wilhelm had no intention of stopping at one son, and informing her that Augusta's daughter, Viktoria, was not named after her (though, again, in her memoirs, Viktoria Luise states that she was named after both her grandmother and her great-grandmother, Queen Victoria). Augusta and her mother-in-law grew closer for a few years when Wilhelm became emperor, as Augusta was often lonely while he was away on military exercises and turned to her mother-in-law for the companionship of rank, although she never left her children alone with her lest they be influenced by her well-known liberalism. Nevertheless, the two were often seen riding in a carriage together. Augusta was at Victoria's bedside when she died of breast cancer in 1901. Augusta also had less than cordial relationships with some of Wilhelm's sisters, particularly the recently married Crown Princess Sophie of Greece. In 1890, when Sophie announced her intention to convert to Greek Orthodoxy, Dona summoned her and told her that if she did so, not only would Wilhelm find it unacceptable as the head of the Evangelical State Church of Prussia's older Provinces, but she would be barred from Germany and her soul would end up in Hell. Sophie replied that it was her business whether or not she did. Augusta became hysterical and gave birth prematurely to her son, Prince Joachim, as a result of which she was overprotective of him for the rest of his life, believing that he was delicate. Evidently, so did Wilhelm; he wrote to his mother that if the baby died, Sophie would have murdered it. =Later life= In 1920, the shock of exile and abdication, combined with the breakdown of Joachim's marriage and his subsequent suicide, proved too much for Augusta's health. She died in 1921, in House Doorn at Doorn in the Netherlands. Wilhelm, still reeling over the same losses, was devastated by her death. The Weimar Republic allowed her remains to be transported back to Germany, where they still lie in the Temple of Antiquities, not far from the New Palace, Potsdam. Because he was not permitted to enter Germany, Wilhelm could accompany his wife on her last journey only as far as the German border. With daughter Princess Viktoria Luise of Prussia, Berlin (1911) =Issue= Augusta gave birth to seven children by Wilhelm II: *Wilhelm, German Crown Prince (1882‚Äì1951); married Duchess Cecilie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. *Prince Eitel Friedrich (1883‚Äì1942); married Duchess Sophia Charlotte of Oldenburg. *Prince Adalbert (1884‚Äì1948); married Princess Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen. *Prince August Wilhelm (1887‚Äì1949); married Princess Alexandra Victoria of Schleswig- Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl√ºcksburg. *Prince Oskar (1888‚Äì1958); married Countess Ina Marie von Bassewitz. *Prince Joachim (1890‚Äì1920); married Princess Marie- Auguste of Anhalt. *Princess Victoria Louise of Prussia (1892‚Äì1980); married Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick. In literature The funeral of Augusta Victoria is reflected upon in the novel by Katherine Anne Porter, Ship of Fools. In it, a German passenger silently reminisces on the funeral and its cinematic showing to a small colony of Germans living abroad in Mexico and describes the outpouring of public grief that was seen within that community. Augusta Victoria's passing is viewed among Germans who lived through the First World War as the ending of a great epoch, the conclusion of which forever divorces them from their maternal country and enshrines Augusta Victoria as a venerable saint and symbol of a Germany long past.

They typically are autonomous and/or operated by a built-in control system, with manual override options. The term \\"service robot\\" does not have a strict technical definition. The International Organization for Standardization defines a ‚Äúservice robot‚Äù as a robot ‚Äúthat performs useful tasks for humans or equipment excluding industrial automation applications‚Äù.Provisional definition of Service Robots English, 24 September 2018 According to ISO 8373 robots require ‚Äúa degree of autonomy‚Äù, which is the ‚Äúability to perform intended tasks based on current state and sensing, without human intervention‚Äù. For service robots this ranges from partial autonomy - including human-robot interaction - to full autonomy - without active human robot intervention. The International Federation of Robotics (IFR) statistics for service robots therefore include systems based on some degree of human robot interaction or even full tele-operation as well as fully autonomous systems. Service robots are categorized according to personal or professional use. They have many forms and structures as well as application areas. Types The possible applications of robots to assist in human chores is widespread. At present there are a few main categories that these robots fall into. =Industrial= Industrial service robots can be used to carry out simple tasks, such as examining welding, as well as more complex, harsh-environment tasks, such as aiding in the dismantling of nuclear power stations. Industrial robots have been defined by the International Federation of Robotics as \\"an automatically controlled, reprogrammable, multipurpose manipulator programmable in three or more axes, which may be either fixed in place or mobile for use in industrial automation applications\\". =Frontline Service Robots= Service robots are system-based autonomous and adaptable interfaces that interact, communicate and deliver service to an organization‚Äôs customers.Jochen Wirtz, Paul Patterson, Werner Kunz, Thorsten Gruber, Vinh Nhat Lu, Stefanie Paluch, and Antje Martins (2018), ‚ÄúBrave New World: Service Robots in the Frontline‚Äù, Journal of Service Management, Vol. 29, No. 5, 907-931, https://doi.org/10.1108/JOSM-04-2018-0119 =Domestic= The Roomba vacuum cleaner is one of the most popular domestic service robots. Domestic robots perform tasks that humans regularly perform in non-industrial environments, like people's homes such as for cleaning floors, mowing the lawn and pool maintenance. People with disabilities, as well as people who are older, may soon be able to use service robots to help them live independently. It is also possible to use certain robots as assistants or butlers. =Scientific= Robotic systems perform many functions such as repetitive tasks performed in research. These range from the multiple repetitive tasks made by gene samplers and sequencers, to systems which can almost replace the scientist in designing and running experiments, analysing data and even forming hypotheses. Autonomous scientific robots perform tasks which humans would find difficult or impossible, from the deep sea to outer space. The Woods Hole Sentry can descend to 4,500 metres and allows a higher payload as it does not need a support ship or the oxygen and other facilities demanded by human piloted vessels. Robots in space include the Mars rovers which could carry out sampling and photography in the harsh environment of the atmosphere on Mars.

The northern half which is approximately the same size is called Streymnes. Together the two villages have a population of more than 400 inhabitants.

Biography Born in Buenos Aires, Cacho Casta√±a developed an interest in music during his early years, and by age fourteen, he was a piano teacher. Raised in modest circumstances in the Flores neighborhood, he worked with his father, a shoe cobbler, until age 16. He began his career in music in his teens as a pianist in Oscar Esp√≥sito's orquesta t√≠pica, one of numerous such groups that performed tango music at the time, and also performed in the Chamam√© folk genre. Casta√±a became famous as a bolero singer during the 1970s, performing on Argentine television programs such as Tiempo Final and Un Cortado, among others. He authored numerous hits, including Me gusta, me gusta (\\"I like it, I like it\\"), Lo llaman el matador (\\"He's Nicknamed the Killer\\") and Hay que encontrar al ladr√≥n (\\"The Thief Must be Found\\"), and his signature bolero: Para vivir un gran amor (\\"To Live a Great Love\\"). His lyrics became known for their extemporaneous and often autobiographical style, which he described as \\"writing as I would speak.\\" He is much better known, however, for his contributions to tango music: some of his compositions are considered classics by his fans, including Qu√© tango hay que cantar (\\"What Tango Must One Sing\\", with Rub√©n Ju√°rez), Garganta con Arena (\\"Throat full of sand\\", an homage to Roberto Goyeneche, his mentor), \\"Tita de Buenos Aires\\", (Tita de Buenos Aires, dedicated to Tita Merello), A d√≥nde vas? Quedate en Buenos Aires (\\"Where are you going? Stay in Buenos Aires\\"), and his ode to the Flores neighborhood: Caf√© la Humedad. Casta√±a composed around 2,500 songs, of which 500 have been recorded. He produced 44 records, of which fifteen became gold records (over 20,000 sold, per CAPIF ratings), and ten, platinum (over 40,000 sold). Cacho Casta√±a smiles over Corrientes Avenue from a billboard announcing his Opera Theatre show in 2007 Casta√±a also starred in thirteen Argentine films, including two for which he wrote the score, El mundo que inventamos (\\"The World We Created\\", 1973) and Los hijos de L√≥pez (\\"L√≥pez's Sons\\", 1980); numerous picaresque comedies; and in Felicidades (2000). A confirmed bachelor for much of his life, his numerous relationships included one with Susana Gim√©nez during the 1970s (Gim√©nez would later become a top-rated talk show hostess in Argentina). He ultimately married Andrea Sblano, the 27-year-old daughter of a close friend, in 2006; among his other close friends was former President Carlos Menem. His television appearances in later years included a cameo on the popular Argentine telenovela, Los Rold√°n. He earned a Konex Award in 2005 for his work as songwriter, and his tango album released that year, Espalda con espalda (\\"Back to back\\") earned a Gardel Prize. He was invited to perform \\"with all the other monsters\\" in Leopoldo Federico's series, Selecci√≥n Nacional de Tango Argentino (an event he considered \\"the happiest day of my life\\"), and was inducted into the National Academy of Tango in 2007. Casta√±a's career declined during the 1990s, but rebounded after 2003, and he became active in Argentina's stage and festival circuit.

It is also an industrial region for shipbuilding, international trade, and heavy industries, such as car making and chemical producing. Industries The Southeastern Maritime Industrial Region, as mentioned above, is one of South Korea's chief industrial centers. Only the Capital Metropolitan Area, located around Seoul, is more advanced. This region began to grow as an international center for commerce and industrial power in the late 1970s, during which the South Korean government began to introduce national development plans to spur the South Korean industry. The results were shocking: within a decade, small fishing wharfs like Busan and Ulsan grew into densely populated cities with over two million people each. Meanwhile, industries like car manufacturing and shipbuilding, never heard of before in South Korea, progressed ahead with ferocious speed. Today, the Southeastern Maritime Industrial Region is made up of several industrial cities, all with a special local industry. Ulsan, Geoje, and Busan, all major international ports, especially the latter, which is the world's third largest trading harbor in terms of total cargo volume, specialize in car manufacturing and shipbuilding. For instance, in 1999, Korean shipbuilding companies based here, such as Hyundai Heavy Industries, Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering, and Samsung Heavy Industries overtook Japanese shipbuilding firms as the world's best (). Especially in Ulsan, where heavy industries make up most of the city's revenue, Hyundai Auto and other automobile companies are slowly taking leading positions in the global society. In other cities, such as Pohang and Changwon, steel and oil refining is particularly advanced. Pohang itself is the seat of POSCO, the Korean steel giant, while Changwon is the capital of South Gyeongsang Province. Finally, in Gimhae and Gyeongju, tourism is very popular, as Gyeongju was the ancient capital of the Silla Kingdom, while Gimhae was the capital of the Gaya Kingdom.

The defence is one of the oldest chess openings, with games dating back to the 16th century. It is a weak opening that gives a large advantage for White after 3.Nxe5. Even if White does not go for this continuation, simple leads to an advantage since 2...f6 weakened Black's as well as took away the best square for the g8-knight. The ECO code for the Damiano Defence is C40 (King's Knight Opening). 3.d4 and 3.Bc4 Black's 2...f6 is a weak move that exposes Black's king, weakens Black's kingside and takes away his knight's best square. The moves 3.d4 and 3.Bc4 are strong replies; I.A. Horowitz wrote (substituting algebraic notation for his descriptive notation), \\"Simple and potent is 3.Bc4 d6 4.d4 Nc6 5.c3, after which Black chokes to death.\\"I.A. Horowitz, Chess Openings: Theory and Practice, Simon and Schuster, 1964, p. 227 n. 31. 3.Nxe5! Most forceful, however, is the knight sacrifice 3.Nxe5Understanding the Chess Openings, Sam Collins, 2005, p. 28. Taking the knight with 3...fxe5? exposes Black to a deadly attack after 4.Qh5+ Ke7 (4...g6 loses to 5.Qxe5+, forking king and rook, leaving Black down the exchange, though other options are worse) 5.Qxe5+ Kf7 6.Bc4+ d5! (6...Kg6 7.Qf5+ is devastating and leads to mate shortly after) 7.Bxd5+ Kg6 8.h4 (8.d4? Bd6!) 8...h5 (see diagram; 8...h6 is similar, except Black cannot play 9...Bxb7 because of 10.Qf5) 9.Bxb7! Bd6 (9...Bxb7 10.Qf5+ Kh6 11.d4+ g5 12.Qf7! mates quickly) 10.Qa5!, when Black's best is 10...Nc6 11.Bxc6 Rb8, and now White will be ahead by several pawns. Bruce Pandolfini notes that Black's opening is thus sometimes described as \\"the five pawns \\".Bruce Pandolfini, Chess Openings: Traps and Zaps, Simon & Schuster, 1989, p. 92. . Alternatively, White can continue developing his pieces, remaining four pawns up. In either case, White has a clearly winning position. Since taking the knight is fatal, after 3.Nxe5 Black should instead play 3...Qe7!Pandolfini 1989, p. 91. (Other Black third moves, such as 3...d5, lead to 4. Qh5+! g6 5. Nxg6!) After 4.Nf3 (4.Qh5+? g6 5.Nxg6 Qxe4+ 6.Be2 Qxg6 leaves Black ahead a piece for a pawn) 4...Qxe4+ 5.Be2, Black has regained the pawn but has lost and weakened his kingside, and will lose more time when White chases the queen with Nc3, or 0-0, Re1, and a move by the bishop on e2. Nick de Firmian in Modern Chess Openings analyses instead 4...d5 5.d3 dxe4 6.dxe4, when White had a small advantage in Emmanuel Schiffers‚ÄìMikhail Chigorin, St. Petersburg 1897.Modern Chess Openings, 15th Edition, Random House Puzzles & Games, 2008, p. 156. . The fact that Black can only regain the pawn with 3...Qe7! shows that 2...f6? did not really defend the e-pawn at all. Indeed, even a relatively useless move like 2...a6 is less risky than 2...f6? After 2...a6?! 3.Nxe5, Black could still regain the pawn with 3...Qe7 4.d4 d6, when he would have done so without weakening his kingside or depriving his of its best square. History The opening is named after the Portuguese chess author Pedro Damiano (1480‚Äì1544), despite the fact that he condemned it as weak. In 1847, Howard Staunton wrote of 2...f6, \\"This move occurs in the old work of Damiano, who gives some ingenious variations on it. Lopez, and later authors, have hence entitled it 'Damiano's Gambit'.\\"Howard Staunton, The Chess-Player's Handbook, Henry C. Bohn, 1847, p. 60. Instead, Staunton's contemporary George Walker more logically reserved the term \\"Damiano Gambit\\" for the knight sacrifice played by White on the third move: 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 f6 3.Nxe5.Walker wrote of the knight sacrifice, \\"This constitutes the Damiano Gambit.\\" George Walker, The Art of Chess-Play: A New Treatise on the Game of Chess (4th ed. 1846), Sherwood, Gilbert, & Piper, p. 236. Staunton referred to [1.e4 e5 2.Nf3] 2...Nc6, a highly respected move then and now, as \\"Damiano's defence to the 's opening\\".Staunton, p. 64. The Damiano Defence is never seen today in top-level play. The greatest player to play the Damiano in serious master competition was Chigorin. As noted above, he played the 3...Qe7 line in a game against Schiffers at St. Petersburg 1897. Chigorin lost his queen on move 10 (see diagram), but Schiffers played so weakly that Chigorin later missed a brilliant and only escaped when Schiffers agreed to a draw in a winning position. Robert McGregor played the Damiano in a 1964 simultaneous exhibition against Bobby Fischer, essaying 3...Qe7 4.Nf3 d5 5.d3 dxe4 6.dxe4 Qxe4+ 7.Be2 Bf5, and drew, although Fischer did not play the best moves.

The purpose of the procedure is to create an upper eyelid with a crease (i.e. \\"double eyelid\\") from an eyelid that is naturally without a crease (also known as a \\"single eyelid\\" or \\"monolid\\"). Anatomically, there are a number of subtle differences in the upper eyelids of East Asians, compared with the eyelids of Europeans and Sub-Saharan Africans. While some East Asians have a double eyelid and some do not, there is also a large variation in the crease position (double eyelid size) of the East Asian upper eyelid. The upper lid fold can range from above the eyelash line to about . Several methods can be used to create the double eyelid ‚Äî including the full-incisional, partial incision and no incision methods (e.g. the DST method). Each has its advantages depending on the patient's anatomy and desires. East Asian blepharoplasty have been reported to be the most common aesthetic procedure in Taiwan, South Korea and other parts of East Asia and is also frequently performed in Northeast Indian states such as Assam. The procedure has been reported to have some risk of complications, but is generally quite safe if done by an expert plastic surgeon. Practitioners of East Asian blepharoplasty include plastic surgeons (facial plastic and reconstructive surgeons), otolaryngologists, oral and maxillofacial surgeons, and ophthalmologists (oculoplastic surgeons). A procedure to remove the epicanthal fold (i.e. an epicanthoplasty) is often performed in conjunction with an East Asian blepharoplasty. The procedure to alter the natural East Asian \\"single eyelid\\" appearance has been a subject of controversy. For example, opponents of the procedure described it as being \\"indoctrinated by white standards of beauty\\", although New York-based cosmetic surgeon Dr. Edward Kwan states that many patients who get the procedure done are \\"not trying to look white\\", but look like the many East Asians who naturally have an eyelid fold.

The southern coast contains two capes, each with a lighthouse (√òknastangi on the south-east, Bor√∞an on the south). The lighthouses were built in the late 18th century to aid smugglers working against the unpopular trading monopoly imposed by Denmark. In 2005, the National Bank of Denmark issued a 20 DKK commemorative coin for the lighthouse. There is only one settlement on the island, also called N√≥lsoy, on the north-west coast on the Stongin peninsula which is attached to the rest of the island by a metres-wide isthmus. The island is accessible by a 20-minute ferry journey from T√≥rshavn. As many as 40 people that live in N√≥lsoy go to work in T√≥rshavn each morning. In recent years many young families have moved from T√≥rshavn to N√≥lsoy where the houses are cheaper than in T√≥rshavn. This way it is possible to live \\"in the country\\" and still be only 20 minutes from the capital. People from N√≥lsoy N√≥lsoy has an annual civic festival called Ovastevna, held at the beginning of August. Ovastevna is similar to √ìlavs√∏ka in T√≥rshavn only smaller. Ovastevna is held to commemorate Ove Joensen from N√≥lsoy. He rowed from the Faroe Islands to Denmark in a traditional Faeroese boat in 1986. In 1987 Ove drowned in Sk√°lafj√∏r√∞ur-inlet where he fell overboard. The profit from the festival is used to build a swimming pool for the children in N√≥lsoy. Ove originally started this project after his row to Denmark. N√≥lsoyar P√°ll came from N√≥lsoy. He is recognized as a kind of freedom fighter and national hero. He fought to end the Royal Trade Monopoly in the beginning of 19th century. The Royal Trade Monopoly was exhausting and impoverishing the people of the Faroe Islands from 1271 to 1856.

Alongside is Thomond Bridge. As with other cities in Ireland, Limerick has a history of great architecture. A 1574 document prepared for the Spanish ambassador attests to its wealth and fine architecture: :Limerick is stronger and more beautiful than all the other cities of Ireland, well walled with stout walls of hewn marble... There is no entrance except by stone bridges, one of the two of which has 14 arches, and the other 8 ... for the most part the houses are of square stone of black marble and built in the form of towers and fortresses. Many examples remain in the city to the present day ‚Äì though much has been lost also, through wars, decay and modern development. Present-day Limerick has perhaps not as extensive historical architecture as other Irish cities, though some very notable examples remain, such as the 800-year-old St. Mary's Cathedral and King John's Castle. Ecclesiastical architecture ;St. Mary's Cathedral St Mary's Cathedral is the older of Limerick's two cathedrals and dates from the 12th century. The cathedral has elements of both Romanesque and Gothic styles of architecture with Romanesque arches and doorways and Gothic windows. The plan and elevation of the cathedral show signs of the design being an altered over the years. The original plan of the church was in the form of a Latin cross. Additions were made to the Cathedral during the episcopate of Stephen Wall, Bishop of Limerick. The Romanesque doorway on the west side is an impressive carving of chevrons and patterns. Like many medieval churches in Ireland, the building has been heavily restored by the Victorians. The Cathedral plays a dominant role in this medieval area within Limerick City showing the amalgamation of the architectural styles of Romanesque and Gothic.http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county;=LI&regno;=21508014 The tower of St. Mary's Cathedral was added in the 14th century, and it rises to 120 feet ;St. John's Cathedral St John's Cathedral The main body of St. John's Cathedral was designed by English architect Philip Charles Hardwick, and constructed between 1856 and 1861. It has the tallest spire in Ireland at 94m (a later addition, designed by M.A. Hennessy and completed in 1883). The exterior of St. John's was completely refurbished in 2004, with new roofing and repointing of all stonework. The cathedral today cuts an imposing presence on an otherwise undeveloped side of the city centre. An important historical Protestant church sits near the cathedral also, and although in need of some repair, is now in use today by Dance Limerick. ;St. Munchin's Church, Englishtown The church was constructed by architect James Pain in 1837 replacing an earlier structure. The church is Gothic in design. ;St. John's Church, Irishtown Constructed in 1851 by architect Joseph Welland the church replaced an earlier dating from the 11th century. This important historic site is adjacent to the former John's Gate and the town walls where the existing Citadel is located and incorporated within St. John's Hospital.

The island contains some of Limerick's main attractions including King John's Castle which was completed in around 1200. The walls, towers and fortifications remain today. The remains of a Viking settlement was also uncovered during the construction of the visitor centre at the site. St. Mary's Cathedral was founded in 1168 and is recorded as the oldest building in Limerick. It was built on an earlier castle belonging to the King of Munster. Nicholas street and Mary Street the medieval center of Limerick contained many examples of medieval buildings including tall gabled houses in the Flemish or Dutch fashion. Unfortunately, very little, if any of this streetscape remains today. Following the development of Newtown Pery this area of the city went into decline.A Topographical Dictionary of Ireland pg505 Today both the Englishtown and Irishtown areas remain neglected and dilapidated in appearance. Castle Lane beside King Johns Castle includes a reconstruction of some medieval buildings including a granary, labourers cottage, and gabled houses. The development is mainly for tourism purposes. Georgian architecture Georgian Period Townhouses on Mallow Street in the city centre Much Georgian architecture was evident in the city from about the 1800s onwards. Although some has since been demolished, much of the city centre area is built in the Georgian fashion. John's Square, in front of St. John's Cathedral, towards the city centre, is an example of this. Stone-faced Georgian offices and townhouses were built in a planned fashion around this square. The development of Georgian Limerick was driven by Edmund Sexton Pery, speaker of the Irish House of Commons, and his name has been retained in the Georgian city centre; Newtown Pery. This development extended the city south of the Abbey river and the ancient medieval city. During this time most of the walls of the medieval city were torn down to facilitate the expansion of the city. The new city, Newtown Pery was built completely in Georgian style with long wide and elegant streets in grid plan design with O'Connell Street (previously Georges street) as its centre. The new Georgian town became the new economic and cultural centre of Limerick as the medieval city along with its main street, Nicholas street, fell largely into decline. Much of the Georgian architecture is still largely intact with the Crescent area of O' Connell street and Pery Square being among some of the finest examples of Georgian architecture in Ireland however much of the area is now in a neglected or decaying state while much of the more ornate styles around the retail areas of O' Connell street, William street and Sarsfield street has sadly been lost and replaced with more disappointing modern styles of architecture. The Hunt Museum One of Ireland's most celebrated museums, the Hunt Museum is based in the historic 18th-century former Custom House. The museum was established to house an internationally important collection of approximately 2,000 works of art and antiquities formed by John and Gertrude Hunt during their lifetimes. On display are the 9th-century Antrim Cross, a sketch by Picasso and a bronze sculpture of a horse, said to be from a design by Leonardo da Vinci. Victorian and Edwardian architecture From the 19th century much Victorian and Edwardian architecture was evident in Limerick. Unified terraces, detached or semi detached dwellings were built by the middle classes on roads protruding from the city centre as can be seen today in O' Connell Avenue, South and North Circular Roads, Ennis Road, Shelbourne Road and Mulgrave Street.http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/highlights.jsp?county=LI&list;=true Typical features of this style of architecture in Limerick include arched or bay windows with brick detailing around doorways and elaborate railings enclosing long front gardens. Features of buildings dating from the Edwardian period also include balconies, porched and timbered gables, and horizontal mullioned windows. 20th century Council housing in Limerick developed from the 1940s onwards. Today Council housing comprises about 40% of housing within the city boundary (excl suburbs. From the period of Irish Independence right up to the 1960s there was very little development in Limerick. Housing had become a major problem as many of the city's poorer residents lived in overcrowded slums, streets and laneways in the oldest parts of the city. Life in these parts of the city in the early 20th century are perhaps best described in the worldwide best seller Angelas Ashes written by Frank McCourt. During the 1960s Limerick Corporation began to clear the slums and laneways by relocating families to new large council estates on the edge of the city. The estates were built primarily in Moyross, Southill, the Island Field (St. Marys Park) and Ballinacurra Weston. Initially seen to be a success these estates began to experience high levels of disadvantage, unemployment, poverty and crime as was replicated in other parts of Ireland such as Ballymun. Today the estates can be described as Sink estates and are awaiting a massive regeneration project. The city also expanded during this time with much development outside the city boundary creating new city suburbs. The most notable development is the University of Limerick in the suburb of Castletroy towards the eastern end of the city. UL is the location of the University Concert Hall, a 1000-seat venue on the university campus which is suitable for holding a wide variety of events. The UL arena, which opened in 2002 is Ireland's largest indoor complex. It consists of the National 50m Swimming Pool which is the only water facility in Ireland which has the approval of FINA, the international swimming body, and is the first in the country to be built to Olympic standards. The Arena's Indoor Sports Hall comprises 3,600 square metres laid out with four wood-sprung courts, catering for a variety of sports, a sprint track, an international 400m athletics track, and a 200m three-lane suspended jogging track. The facility also has a state-of-the-art cardiovascular and strength training centre, a weight-training room, team rooms, an aerobics studio and classroom areas. The Arena is often used by the Munster rugby team. On the southside of the city the Crescent Shopping Centre the largest shopping centre in Ireland outside Dublin was built in the suburb of Dooradoyle. It has a retail space of 100,000m squared with over 90 shops. By the end of the 20th century and early 21st century Limerick's trend towards suburbanisation continued which has led to many concerns of the development of the city during this time particularly in relation to the amount of out-of- town retail developments which has reduced footfall on city centre streets. Bridges As a city situated on a river (the Shannon), and at a crossing point, Limerick's bridges are of vital importance to the region. They connect the northern bank of the river, and County Clare, to the southern bank and County Limerick. Apart from forming part of the Limerick to Galway route, the crossings are important today in connecting Shannon Airport to the city and beyond. =Thomond Bridge= Thomond Bridge The earliest bridge, Thomond Bridge, was built near a fording point. It was the scene of a failed defending of the city during the Siege of Limerick. At one ends sits the Treaty Stone, which stands as a symbol of the signed treaty. The treaty itself was probably signed in a campaign tent. The current bridge was built in 1836, replacing the earlier bridge which was also alongside King John's Castle. The bridge now forms part of the R445 (formerly N7), carrying traffic on the Northern Relief Road. =Sarsfield Bridge= The second of Limerick's River Shannon crossings is now called Sarsfield Bridge, to commemorate Patrick Sarsfield, the Earl of Lucan, who is renowned in Limerick for his role in the Williamite War and the 1691 siege and Treaty of Limerick in particular. The bridge was opened as Wellesley Bridge on 5 August 1835, following 11 years of construction. It was designed by the Scottish engineer Alexander Nimmo and based on the Pont de Neuilly in Paris. It was a particularly important development for the city as it allowed expansion to the northern shore of the river. The bridge itself consists of five large and elegant elliptical arches with an open balustrade, running from a man-made island, originally called Wellesley Pier but now known as Shannon Island, to the northern shore, and a simple flat, swivel deck with iron lattice railings crossing a canal and road from the island to what was known as Brunswick Street, now Sarsfield Street. The swivel end is no longer functional, although some of its heavy machinery is still intact underneath the roadway. A lock system has replaced the swivel section to allow for the passage of smaller boats. Apart from this, the bridge has remained largely unchanged since it opened and still has its original lamp standards.Spellissy, S., The History of Limerick City, The Celtic Bookshop, Limerick, 1998. p.295. 1916 Monument on Sarsfield Bridge Rowing clubhouses sit on Shannon Island at either side of the bridge. The Shannon Rowing Club was founded by Sir Peter Tait in 1866 and has a very elegant clubhouse on the northern side. Limerick Boat Club was founded in 1870 and has a simpler structure on the southern side.Spellissy, p.242 A monument located on the bridge just above the Limerick Boat Club building, commemorates the 1916 Rising. An earlier monument on this site was a statue of Viscount Fitzgibbon of Mountshannon House,http://limerickslife.com/crimean-war/ who was killed in The Charge of the Light Brigade at Balaclava in 1854, flanked by two Russian cannon captured in the Crimean War. This statue was blown up by the Irish Republican Army in 1930.Spellissy, p.297. The War of Independence memorial is located at the northern end of the bridge, commemorating two former mayors of Limerick (George Clancy and Michael O'Callaghan), among others, who were killed by the British in 1921. The quays on the northern shore are called Clancy Strand and O'Callaghan Strand in their honour. =Shannon Bridge= The Shannon Bridge is by far the newest River Shannon crossing in Limerick city centre. It was built in the late 1980s, and connects to a relief road that passes through a bird sanctuary and runs around the north of the city. The bridge is still at times referred to as \\"The New Bridge\\", although the Abbey Bridge across the Abbey River is newer. For some time after its construction, the bridge was also termed \\"The Whistling Bridge\\" ‚Äî the fencing on the bridge resonated with the winds coming up the Shannon Estuary, producing a shrill whistling sound. In extreme winds, the sound was quite deafening. Simple grills were added, and the effect was ceased.http://limerickslife.com/limerick-bridges/#shanb =Baal's Bridge= This is one of the oldest bridges in the city. The current structure was built in between 1830 and 1831 and is a single-arched hump-back limestone bridge. It replaced an earlier four-arched bridge that formed the only link before the mid-18th century crossing the Abbey river between Englishtown and Irishtown.http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county;=LI&regno;=21513031 Early drawings show a row of houses on the bridge before it was replaced. During the construction of the new bridge in 1830 a significant archaeological object was found in the foundations of the old bridge. A brass Square of Freemasonry symbolism was found in the foundations with an inscription dating from 1507. Also inscribed on the square is the text I will strive to live with love and care upon the level, by the square. It is reputed to be one of the earliest Masonic items to be found in the world. =Other bridges and the tunnel= Another bridge at the northern end of King's Island, connects to Corbally on the north of the city. This is a simpler bridge, further up the Shannon. The only other road bridge across the Shannon near the city is the \\"University Bridge\\", at the University of Limerick. Opened in 2004 by then Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, this fashionable modern bridge connects the recently commenced north bank campus (includes student villages/accommodation and Health Science building) to the main southern campus, but it does not serve as a public crossing point as there is no north bank entrance from the Clare side. The university is also home to one of the longest footbridges in Europe ‚Äì The Living Bridge. Another bridge is named after Dr. Sylvester O'Halloran. The Limerick Tunnel opened in July 2010 as part of the Limerick Southern Road. The tunnel forms a fourth river crossing of the Shannon. It is a 675m long,http://www.limericktunnel.com/index.html twin-bore road tunnel underneath the River Shannon on the outskirts of the city. Architecture lost and found O'Connell Street in the 1950s with uniform Georgian terraces showing old AIB and Royal George Hotel all since rebuilt in more modern design Much of Limerick's architectural heritage has been compromised. The main streets in the city centre were originally fronted by mostly uniform Georgian townhouses. Nowadays significant gaps and oddities may be found, in addition to the dilapidated state of some buildings. The most recent example of a controversial demolition was the Cruises Hotel. This was the oldest hotel in Limerick; Daniel O'Connell himself stayed in it. It was demolished in or around 1990 to allow Cruises Street pedestrian area. Sadly, the site of what was this illustrious building is now home to a McDonald's and Costa Coffee shop on either corner of the street entrance. Other examples of lost architecture include the impressive facade of the old Cannock's Department Store (now Penney's) and its landmark clock tower which was demolished in the 1960s and replaced with a more modern styled building and the facade of Todd's Department Store (now Brown Thomas) which was destroyed by a fire in the late 1950s has also been replaced with a more modern design. Other areas of the city have similar tragic tales. Since the late 1990s, Ireland has had somewhat tougher development requirements. This has resulted in an increasing number of Georgian and other historical buildings being refurbished rather than demolished. Shining examples include the conversion of a historic bank to a pub, also the conversion of old stone-built warehouses and Georgian townhouses to up-market apartments. These recent refurbishments of Georgian townhouses include cleaned brickwork, replica railings outside sash windows with brass catches, and new replica street railings. Until recently, the tougher development requirements have ironically resulted in tracts of wasteland on King's Island remaining undeveloped due to complicated development work around historical remains of demolished structures. As of 2006 new apartment blocks continue to be built on the Island near the Abbey Bridge. Modern architecture RiverpointAlthough a lot of developments in Limerick have been concentrated in suburban areas there has been notable modern architectural developments and improvements in the appearance of city centre in recent years. Most developments have been along the banks of the river Shannon and are facing onto the river. The most prominent are the 60m high Riverpoint building and the 200 ft four star Clarion Hotel on Steamboat quay. Other developments include apartments and office blocks along the quays. Other developments in the city centre include the successful redevelopment of Bedford Row, Henry street, Thomas street and Catherine street. In 2007 Thomond Park underwent redevelopment which included the construction of two large stands to accommodate a capacity attendance of 26,500 with 15,100 seated. The stadium has become an icon for Limerick City and in 2009 the design of the stadium won the peoples choice award from the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland awards 2009. Although progress has been made with regards to the architectural quality of buildings in Limerick, dereliction and neglect is continuing to plague parts of the city's most historic stock of buildings. The demise of the Opera Centre has left a large block of the city centre devoid of any business or retail activity and has suffered a major loss of footfall. The areas affected include the once thriving streets of Patrick Street, Rutland Street, Ellen Street, Michael Street & Bank Place which enclose the site. The buildings on these streets constitute Limerick's earliest Georgian Developments. Although plans are being made to revitalise the site with the possibility of LIT opening a fashion hub in the site, it remains to be seen if any plans will be realised given the poor economic outlook.

Founded in November 1980 as a work of the Society of Jesus, JRS was officially registered on 19 March 2000 in Vatican City as a foundation. The impetus to found JRS came from the then superior general of the Jesuits, Pedro Arrupe, who was inspired to action by the plight of Vietnamese boat people. JRS has programmes in over 50 countries. The areas of work are in the field of education, emergency assistance, health care, livelihoods, reconciliation, and psychosocial support. JRS is also involved in advocacy and human rights work. This involves ensuring that refugees are afforded their full rights as guaranteed by the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and working to strengthen the protection afforded to Internally displaced persons (IDPs). JRS's international headquarters is located in Rome at the Society's General Curia. The International Director is Rev. Thomas H. Smolich SJ. History JRS was founded in November 1980 by Fr. Pedro Arrupe SJ, the then superior general of the Society of Jesus, to respond to the plight of Vietnamese boat people fleeing their war-ravaged homeland. Following the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, hundreds of thousands of South Vietnamese fled their homes, setting out in overcrowded boats across the South China Sea. Many did not survive the journey; they were killed by pirates, or drowned because of storms and rough seas. Fr Arrupe felt compelled to act. He called on the Jesuits \\"to bring at least some relief to such a tragic situation.\\" Fr Arrupe wrote to over 50 Jesuit provinces regarding the situation, recognising that the Jesuits, then numbering 27,000 men across the world, were well-placed to coordinate a global humanitarian response. As conflicts broke out in Central and Latin America, southeastern Europe, and across Africa, JRS rapidly grew from helping Vietnamese boat people in a few camps in Southeast Asia to working with refugees around the world. Nearly 20 years after its founding, JRS was officially registered as a foundation of the Vatican City State on 19 March 2000. =Mission= JRS's mission is to accompany, serve, and advocate on behalf of refugees and other forcibly displaced persons, that they may heal, learn, and determine their own future. As an international humanitarian NGO, JRS strives to implement the magis ideal of Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Jesuits. One of the key messages of the 35th Jesuit General Congregation (2008) was to reach new physical, cultural, religious and social frontiers, to those who are estranged,General Congregation 35, Decree 1. Accessed 20 May 2016. a task confirmed by two Popes. The search for new frontiers has taken JRS to places where refugees face deprivation and abuse of their basic rights: traditional refugee camps, detention centres and prisons, conflict zones, border areas, and in the heart of big cities, including Iraq and Syria. On 24 May 2019, Jesuit Superior General Arturo Sosa called all Jesuits to \\"renewed commitment\\" to JRS in accord with the Jesuits' newly promulgated apostolic preferences, endorsed by Pope Francis. For its part JRS is restructuring to produce \\"strong country offices that will strengthen local capacity and encourage subsidiarity.\\" JRS defined its priorities for 2019-2023 as, \\"the promotion of reconciliation and social cohesion; the delivery of quality formal and informal education; innovative livelihood programmes that lead to self-reliance and sustainability; and effective advocacy for the rights of refugees.\\" Refugees In deciding with whom to work, JRS finds the scope of existing international conventions is too restrictive. It therefore applies the expression 'de facto refugee' to all \\"persons persecuted because of race, religion, membership of social or political groups\\"; to \\"the victims of armed conflicts, erroneous economic policy or natural disasters\\"; and, for \\"humanitarian reasons\\", to internally displaced persons, that is, civilians who \\"are forcibly uprooted from their homes by the same type of violence as refugees but who do not cross national frontiers.\\" Since the above definition refers only to individuals in fear of persecution, regional organisations in both Africa (African Union 1969) and Latin America (Organisation for American States 1984) have developed wider definitions which include mass displacements which occur as a result of social and economic collapse in the context of conflict. JRS strives by \\"accompaniment\\" to respect the human dignity of all refugees throughout their ordeal. UNHCR On the website of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, detailed recent reports are given of JRS work under the following categories: Country Reports, Fact Finding Reports, Handbooks/Manuals, Legal Articles/Analyses/Commentaries, Policy/Position Papers, Regional Reports, and Thematic Reports.

In other words, this industry is one that engages, on a large scale, with goods and services that are cultural in nature‚Äîand usually protected by intellectual property rights‚Äîalong economic considerations rather than for the purpose of cultural development. The term was first introduced by Theodor W. Adorno and Max Horkheimer in the Dialectic of Enlightenment (1972), who chose this term in place of mass culture, which implies that such phenomenon \\"arises spontaneously from the masses themselves,\\" like a culture; cultural industry excludes this notion and instead emphasizes that the phenomenon is manufactured.Adorno, Theodor W. 1975. \\"Culture Industry Reconsidered.\\" New German Critique 6(Autumn):112-19. . Concept The notion of cultural industries generally includes textual, music, television, and film production and publishing, as well as crafts and design. For some countries, such fields as architecture, the visual and performing arts, sport, advertising, and cultural tourism may be included as adding value to the content and generating values for individuals and societies. They are knowledge-based and labour- intensive, creating employment and wealth. By nurturing creativity and fostering innovation, societies will maintain cultural diversity and enhance economic performance. Cultural industries worldwide have adapted to the new digital technologies and the introduction of national, regional and international (de)regulatory policies. These factors have radically altered the context in which cultural goods, services, and investments flow between countries and, consequently, these industries have undergone a process of internationalization and progressive concentration, resulting in the formation of a few big conglomerates: a new global oligopoly.

It takes values in :H^{4k}(M,\\\\mathbf{R}). If we assume also that M is compact, Poincar√© duality identifies this with :H^{0}(M,\\\\mathbf{R}) which can be identified with \\\\mathbf{R}. Therefore cup product, under these hypotheses, does give rise to a symmetric bilinear form on H2k(M,R); and therefore to a quadratic form Q. The form Q is non-degenerate due to Poincar√© duality, as it pairs non-degenerately with itself. More generally, the signature can be defined in this way for any general compact polyhedron with 4n-dimensional Poincar√© duality. The signature of M is by definition the signature of Q, an ordered triple according to its definition. If M is not connected, its signature is defined to be the sum of the signatures of its connected components.  Other dimensions  If M has dimension not divisible by 4, its signature is usually defined to be 0. There are alternative generalization in L-theory: the signature can be interpreted as the 4k-dimensional (simply-connected) symmetric L-group L^{4k}, or as the 4k-dimensional quadratic L-group L_{4k}, and these invariants do not always vanish for other dimensions. The Kervaire invariant is a mod 2 (i.e., an element of \\\\mathbf{Z}/2) for framed manifolds of dimension 4k+2 (the quadratic L-group L_{4k+2}), while the de Rham invariant is a mod 2 invariant of manifolds of dimension 4k+1 (the symmetric L-group L^{4k+1}); the other dimensional L-groups vanish. = Kervaire invariant = When d=4k+2=2(2k+1) is twice an odd integer (singly even), the same construction gives rise to an antisymmetric bilinear form. Such forms do not have a signature invariant; if they are non-degenerate, any two such forms are equivalent. However, if one takes a quadratic refinement of the form, which occurs if one has a framed manifold, then the resulting Œµ-quadratic forms need not be equivalent, being distinguished by the Arf invariant. The resulting invariant of a manifold is called the Kervaire invariant.  Properties  Ren√© Thom (1954) showed that the signature of a manifold is a cobordism invariant, and in particular is given by some linear combination of its Pontryagin numbers. For example, in four dimensions, it is given by \\\\frac{p_1}{3}. Friedrich Hirzebruch (1954) found an explicit expression for this linear combination as the L genus of the manifold. William Browder (1962) proved that a simply-connected compact polyhedron with 4n-dimensional Poincar√© duality is homotopy equivalent to a manifold if and only if its signature satisfies the expression of the Hirzebruch signature theorem.

It was a polytheistic religion, worshipping a number of different deities. The principal god was the god of thunder and the sky, Ukko; other important gods included Jumi (Jumala), Ahti, and Tapio. Jumala was a sky god; today, the word \\"Jumala\\" refers to the Christian God. Ahti was a god of the sea, waters and fish. Tapio was the god of forests and hunting. Finnish paganism shows many similarities with the religious practices of related cultures, such as Estonian, Mordvin, Mari, Sami and other Eurasian paganism. It shares some features with its neighbouring Baltic, Norse and Germanic paganisms. The organic tradition was sidelined due to Christianization starting from ca. 12th century and finally broken by modernization by the early 20th century, when folk magic and oral traditions went extinct. Finnish paganism provided the inspiration for a contemporary pagan movement Suomenusko (Finnish: Finnish faith), which is an attempt to reconstruct the old religion of the Finns. It is nevertheless based on secondary sources. Deities An ancient Finnish cup-stone used for votive offerings in Hartola. The Finnish pagans were polytheistic, believing in a number of different deities. Most of the deities ruled over a specific aspect of nature; for instance, Ukko was the god of the sky and thunder (even today finnish word for thunder is ukonilma). These deities were often pan-Finnic, being worshipped by many different tribes in different regions. The Finnish pagans were also animists, worshipping local nature deities at site-specific shrines to that particular deity. These shrines are thought to be mainly \\"tree-gods\\": wooden statues or carvings done in trees or treestumps, depicting human figures, and have been scarcely preserved. One confirmed Stone Age wooden statue has been found in Pohjankuru, and folklore about worshipping tree-gods has been documented. Another kind of shrine are \\"cup-stones\\" (Finnish: :fi:kuppikivi), large natural stones into which cup-sized recesses have been drilled. Votive offerings of food or drink were left into these cups. Despite Christianization, offerings on these cup- stones continued up to the early 20th century. =Major deities= * Several key deities were venerated across nearly all of Finland and Karelia. These pan-Finnic deities controlled many aspects of nature. * The chief god was Ukko (also known as Perkele), who was the ruler over the sky and thunder. A corresponding figure is known in countless other cultures of the world. * Another deity that appeared very significant to the Finnish pagans, but about whom modern scholars know very little, was Jumi, whose name is related to \\"Jumala\\", the modern Finnish language word for a monotheist God. * There were many other important deities who ruled over a specific aspect of the natural world, and who have been referred to as \\"kings\\". The king of water was often called Ahti, and the king of the forest was Tapio. * Other major deities included √Ñkr√§s, the god of fertility; Mielikki, the goddess of the forests and the hunt; Kuu, the goddess of the moon; and Lempo, the god of wilderness and archery. * Great heroes, who had, in mythology, once been human, such as V√§in√§m√∂inen and Ilmarinen, were also objects of worship, in a way similar to the Greek pagans' worship of mythical human heroes like Herakles. = Haltija = Local animistic deities, known as haltijas or haltias (same pronunciation), were also worshipped. These haltijas could be male or female, and could take a human or another animal's form. Haltijas could be found everywhere in nature, both in the biotic and abiotic parts. Every human has a haltija, usually called haltijasielu (haltija soul) or luontohaltija (nature haltija), which is one of the three parts of a person's soul. The tradition blends with the Swedish tomte: the Finnish tonttu was a being analogous to haltija, but which lives in a building, like a home (kotitonttu) or a sauna (saunatonttu).  Maan haltija  Certain \\"haltiat\\", known as \\"maan haltija\\" (literally \\"tutelary of land\\"), guarded the property of an individual, including their house and livestock. Votive offerings would be given to these haltijas at a shrine, as thanks for the help given and also to prevent the haltija from causing harm. Sometimes haltijas of certain families and farms acted against other families and their farms by stealing their wealth or making the animals infertile, for instance. Many local haltijas were believed to have originally been the sacred spirits of ancestors. In some cases a haltija was the first inhabitant of house. Sometimes while making a new house a local spirit of nature could be \\"employed\\" to work as a maan haltija. V√§ki and haltija Different elements and environments had their own haltijas. Haltijas were grouped into types or races called v√§ki. \\"V√§ki\\" has multiple connected meanings of \\"strength\\", \\"force\\", \\"throng\\", \\"military troop\\"; in the magical context, it referred ambiguously to magical strength and numbers. There were, for instance, different v√§ki of water, forests, and graveyards. V√§kis could become angry if people acted in a disrespectful manner in their area. For example, cursing close to water made the v√§ki of water angry. When angry, v√§kis could cause diseases and other misfortune to befall the human victim. Some v√§kis were always angry, like the v√§ki of fire, explaining why every time you touch fire it burns, no matter how respectful you are around it. Each tribe of v√§kis belonged to specific environments and if they were misplaced, problems occurred. For example, most v√§kis were misplaced if they attached to a human being, and they made the human being ill because they were in the wrong place. Illnesses were removed by sending v√§kis back to their right places. Shamans who cured diseases were returning the cosmic balance. For example, it was believed that on contact with the ground, as in falling on one's face, diseases could spread to the human, caused by the \\"v√§ki\\" of the earth. Similarly, l√∂yly (sauna steam) was believed to contain a v√§ki spirit (l√∂ylyn henki), which could cause open wounds to get infected. According to the concept of v√§ki being divided in two (into power and folk of haltijas) the ancient Finns believed that the world was totally animistic in that no force of nature or intelligent life existed without v√§kis or haltijas. In other words, nothing happened in the universe without it being caused by a group of spirits. Even a person's soul consisted of many spirits. Soul, death, and the afterlife =Soul= The pagan Finnish belief about the soul of a human was different from that of most other cultures across the world, in that they believed the human soul to be composed of three different parts: henki, luonto and itse. Each of the three were autonomous beings on their own. Similar beliefs about multiple autonomous souls are found amongst other peoples speaking Uralic languages, such as the Khanty and Mansi, who believe in two souls: the shadow and the lili (l√∂yly). Henki (translated as \\"life\\", \\"breath\\" or \\"spirit\\", sometimes also referred to as l√∂yly) was a person's life force, which presented itself as breathing, the beating of one's heart and the warmth of their body. Henki was received prior to birth and it left at the moment of death. The word henget√∂n (lit. \\"one without henki\\") can be used as a synonym for dead in the Finnish language even now. Luonto (translated as \\"nature\\") was a guardian spirit or protector. Luonto has also been referred to as the haltija of a person. A strong willed, artistic or otherwise talented person was believed to have a strong haltija who granted them good luck and skills to complete their tasks well. A weak luonto could be strengthened by various spells and rituals. Luonto could leave a person's body without the person dying, but its lengthened absence would cause problems, such as alcoholism and other addictions. Unlike henki, luonto was not received prior to birth but instead either at the time of getting the first teeth or being given a name. A newborn child was thus considered to be particularly vulnerable. These concepts share similar basics with the idea of hamr (life force) and Hamingja (luck) in Norse belief. Itse was a spirit received at the time of birth or a few days after. It was believed to define one's personality and receiving itse made one a person. In modern-day Finnish the word itse means \\"self\\", but in old days itse was different from one's self, minuus. Like luonto, itse could leave one's body without the person dying but long absence would cause illnesses and misery. Depressions, for instance, was seen as a result of having lost one's itse. If a person was diagnosed to be itset√∂n or luonnoton (without one's itse or without one's luonto), a shaman or a sage could try locating the missing part of the soul and bring it back. Although itse and luonto were usually lost after a traumatising event, it was possible to purposefully separate one's itse from their body. This was required if a missing part of the soul needed to be found. Itse could also leave the body to appear as an eti√§inen (a sort of false arrival apparition). At the time of a person's death their itse joined the other deceased of the family or, in some cases, stayed among the living as a ghost; much like the Norse concept of Fylgja (follower). =Burial= In some traditions, it was a habit to pause at a half-way point while transporting the dead body, from the dwelling to the graveyard. Here, a karsikko-marking was made on a big pine tree. The marking was for people to remember the person; and in the event that the spirit were to awaken and try to make its way back home from the graveyard, it would see its own karsikko- marking, then realize that it is dead and instead try to find the path to the spirit realm. A forest with karsikko-marked trees was a kind of supernatural barrier between dwellings of the living and the burial grounds. After a person died there was a transitional period of thirty to forty days while their soul searched Tuonela, the land of dead, and tried to find their place there. During this period, the soul could visit its living relatives either as a ghost or in the form of an animal. The soul visited relatives especially if it was unhappy. To please an unhappy soul, one would show respect by not speaking ill of the deceased or by having a sacrifice in the spirit's name. After this transitional period, the soul moved permanently into Tuonela. However, the soul could still come back if it were unhappy, or if it were asked to return by its relatives who needed help. Some souls were not able to settle down or were not welcomed in Tuonela, and they continued haunting, i.e. bastard children who were killed and buried outside a cemetery usually ended up as permanent haunters of some place, typically screaming in terror, until someone digs up their bodies, blesses them, and buries them in a graveyard. =Ancestor veneration= People were afraid of ghosts, but spirits of ancestors could also help their living relatives, and they were asked to help. A shaman could be sent to Tuonela to ask for knowledge of spirits or even to take a spirit to the world of living as luonto. A Spirit of the dead had to be honoured by giving him/her sacrifices. Places where sacrifices were given to ancestors were called Hiisi ( = sacred forest, also a kind of open air temple, often included the Offering-stone, uhrikivi, collective monument for the dead of the family). Christianity held hiisi to be evil creatures and places. The old sacred places were often desecrated by being used as the building sites for the churches of the new religion, and the old sacred trees were hacked down. Lemmink√§isen √§iti by Akseli Gallen-Kallela. A depiction of the underworld, Tuonela, from a myth found in the Kalevala. =Afterlife= The Finns believed in a place of afterlife called Tuonela, or sometimes Manala. In most traditions it was situated underground or at the bottom of a lake, though sometimes it was said to exist on the other side of a dark river. Tuonela was ruled over by the god Tuoni, and his wife, the goddess Tuonetar. Tuonela was a dark and lifeless place, where the dead were in a state of eternal sleep. Shamans were sometimes able to reach the spirits of their dead ancestors by traveling to Tuonela in a state of trance created by rituals. He had to make his way over the Tuonela river by tricking the ferryman. While in Tuonela, the shaman had to be careful not to get caught: the living were not welcome there. Shamans who were caught could end up decaying in the stomach of a giant pikefish with no hope of returning to normal life. If the shaman died during the trance ritual, it was believed that he had been caught by the guards at Tuonela. An illustration of the hero V√§in√§m√∂inen from Finnish mythology.  Mythology  The pagan Finns had many myths about their gods and their great heroes. Because they lived in a non-literate society, the stories were taught orally as folklore, and they were not written down. Finnish mythology survived Christianisation by being told as myths. Many of these myths were later written down in the 19th century as the Kalevala, which was created to be a national epic of Finland by Elias L√∂nnrot. Sacred animals The bear was a sacred animal to the Finnish pagans. Because of the very nature of life in prehistoric, ancient, and medieval Finland, the Finns relied heavily on hunting for survival. As such the animals that they hunted became vital to their survival, and they were treated with respect. The bear was considered sacred in the pre-Christian beliefs of the Finns. As noted by DuBois, \\"the Finno-Ugric ceremonial bear hunt sought to remove a fierce competitor from the local environment, while winning its power for the hunter.\\" After the flesh was eaten, the bones were buried, and the skull placed on a venerated pine tree known as kallohonka. Peijaiset are also an important part of other Uralic cultures, such as the Khanty-Mansi. In Karelia and Eastern Finland, before going hunting, hunters would pray to the emuu, the ancestral mother of the animal species being hunted, for help. The word emuu is in Karelian dialect and is related to the word emo \\"animal mother\\". Each species had its own emuu. From ancient drawings, petroglyphs, it is clear that the elk was a very important animal. Elk is also very important to other peoples of the region, such as the Komis, who depict their sky god Jenmar as half-human and half-elk. It appears much more than bears do, and it is theorised that the bear was such a holy animal that it was forbidden to depict it. Also, the bear's name was almost forbidden to say, so many euphemisms were developed. The most usual Finnish word for bear in modern language, karhu, is just one of the many euphemisms, and it means \\"rough fur.\\" Among the many names of bear otso is probably the original \\"real\\" name, as suggested by the wide spread of the word otso and related words among many of the Uralic languages. Many euphemisms for bear are local. Many water birds were holy for Finns and other Baltic Finns. They were often depicted on petroglyphs. It was believed that if you killed a water bird, you'd died soon after. The holiest water bird was the swan. With its long neck, it could look to all the levels of the world, including Tuonela, the land of the dead. Birds are found often in Uralic mythology. For example, there are many stories about a bird creating the world. A very common Uralic myth is where a hunter (Finnish Lemmink√§inen, Mari Salij) travels to the underworld in order to marry a woman and comes across the primordial waterbird on the river of the underworld, the hunter shoots the waterbird with his bow, but the waterbird escapes and terrible things happen to the hunter. In many traditions it was believed that the world was created by the egg of a bird. In other traditions it was believed that the world was created on mud that bird took in its beak while diving. In Karelia it was believed that a bird brings the soul to a newborn baby, and that the same bird takes the soul with it when that person dies. This soul-carrying bird was called sielulintu, \\"soul-bird\\". In some traditions people carried artifacts depicting their sielulintu. Sielulintu was believed to guard their souls while they slept. After the person died, the artifact-bird was inserted to sit on the cross at the person's grave. Such crosses with soul birds still exist in graveyards in Karelia. This is one example how Christian and Pagan beliefs still existed side by side hundreds of years after the Christianisation of the Finnish and Karelian people.  Shamanism  Swan and egg, based on petroglyphs of Karelia It is believed by some scholars that shamanism played a big part in Finnish paganism, as it did (and still does) in the Siberian paganism to the east of Finland. A tiet√§j√§ (shaman, literally \\"one who knows\\") is a wise and respected person in the community, believed to have a special relationship with the spirit world. Shamans go into a trance to commune with spirits and ancestors or to take a journey into the spirit realm. In trances shamans may ask their ancestors or various nature spirits for guidance. They believe that nature has the answers to all questions. Tiet√§j√§s or healers were typically men of high standing in the local society, often landed peasants; it was thought that wealth was evidence of magic powers. Among the Finns' western neighbours, the Norse of Scandinavia, it was a common belief that the Finns were wizards. In the Norse sagas, inclusion of a Finnish element almost always signifies a supernatural aspect to the story. Finns were also called Kvens. However, \\"Finn\\" in some Norse sagas could also mean the Sami and not the Finns. In prehistoric times, the nomadic Sami people inhabited much of the same lands as Finns, and the Sami warlocks (Lapin noita) were a parallel and coexisting tradition. Sami warlocks inherited their position and traditions through a paternal line. According to tales, foreign seafarers bought ropes tied in knots from Finns. By opening the knot a bit, a seaman could raise a wind to make his ship go faster. However, opening it too fast would raise a storm. Finnish wizards were known and feared by neighbouring peoples around the Baltic Sea. Christianisation Christian missionaries entered Finland in the 11th century. The native pagan religion still persisted, until Christianity was strengthened under Swedish influence in the 12th century. In the 13th century a crusade was launched against the last pagans in the country by Birger Jarl. However, old traditions were only slowly rooted out and elements of it long persisted along new faith. Particularly, the cult of Ukko remained popular: there are records from the 17th century of peasants holding festives to honour Ukko, and in some places these traditions may have persisted until the 19th century. Songs and incantations In the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries, Finnish folk magic often incorporated chanted or sung incantations. These incantations might bring healing or presage a tiet√§j√§'s ecstatic trance. In the twentieth century, an American researcher in Minnesota reported sung charms for summoning cattle, avoiding hiccups, and avoiding cold based on interviews with a Finnish immigrant. Finnish Neopaganism In the 20th century, with the rise of the Neopagan movement across the world, Finnish Neopaganism arose as a reconstructed form of the old religion. It is mainly practiced in Finland where it has had an official minority religion status since 2013. Finnish neopaganism accounting for a relatively small percentage of the population, the majority being members of the state Lutheran Church or professing no religion. In 2020, the registered religious community of Finnish neopaganism, Karhun kansa (The Folk of the Bear), had approximately 80 members.

Murakami, and starring Richard Thomas, Robert Vaughn, George Peppard, John Saxon, Sybil Danning and Darlanne Fluegel. Intended as a \\"Magnificent Seven in outer space\\", and based on The Magnificent Seven (in which Vaughn also appeared), the 1960 Western remake of Akira Kurosawa's 1954 film Seven Samurai, the screenplay was written by John Sayles with the score by James Horner and special effects designed by James Cameron. The film was theatrically released by New World Pictures, and was a moderate box office success while receiving mixed reviews from critics. Plot The farming world Akir is threatened by the tyrannical warlord Sador (John Saxon), who rules the sinister Malmori Empire and, his body parts deteriorating, is capturing and appropriating them from others. Sador's huge dreadnought, the Hammerhead, (nicknamed \\"Hammerhead\\") mounts a \\"Stellar Converter\\", a weapon that turns planets into small stars. He demands that the peaceful Akira submit to him when he returns in \\"seven risings of your red giant\\", or he will turn his Stellar Converter on their planet. Zed (Jeff Corey), last of the famous Akira Corsairs, is old and nearly blind. He suggests they hire mercenaries to protect their world. Since Akir lacks valuable resources, its people can offer just food and shelter in payment. Unable to go in person, Zed offers his ship for the job if they can find a pilot. The ship is fast and well-armed, but, despite its AI navigation/tactical computer Nell, cannot defeat Sador alone. Shad (Richard Thomas), a young man who has piloted the ship and is well known to Nell, volunteers for the recruiting mission. Seeking weapons, Shad goes to the space station of Doctor Hephaestus (Sam Jaffe), an old friend of Zed. The station is populated mostly by androids, except for two humans: Hephaestus, whose numerous life support-systems have turned him into a cyborg, and his beautiful daughter Nanelia (Darlanne Fluegel), who looks after him and the androids. The doctor wants Shad to mate with his daughter, by force if necessary. Shad cannot bring himself to abandon his people; he persuades Nanelia to help him escape. She follows in her own ship; although she has no weapons, her highly advanced computer systems might be useful. The two split up to look for more mercenaries. Shad encounters Cowboy (George Peppard), a freighter-pilot from Earth who is ambushed by Space Jackers while delivering a shipment of laser-handguns to the planet Umateal. Shad fights off the Jackers, thus saving Cowboy's life twice over; they arrive at Umateal just in time to watch Sador destroy the planet with his Stellar Converter. Lacking the fuel to carry his weapons back home, Cowboy offers them to Akir instead. Shad talks Cowboy into sharing his gunslinging experience with the Akira. Later, Shad meets a set of five alien clones who share a group consciousness named Nestor. They admit their life is incredibly dull, since their whole race shares one mind. In order to be entertained, they have sent five members to join Shad's cause. Nestor does not require payment, saying they are completely self- sufficient. Next, Shad recruits Gelt (Robert Vaughn), a wealthy assassin who cannot show himself on any civilized planet for fear of retribution. Gelt offers his services in return for being allowed to live peacefully among the Akira. Gelt's ship is highly maneuverable and well-armed. On his way back to Akir, Shad is approached by Saint-Exmin (Sybil Danning) of the Valkyrie warriors. She is a headstrong woman looking to prove herself in battle. She pilots a small, but extremely fast ship with enhanced firepower. Shad finds her annoying and wishes she would go away, but she tags along. While waiting for Shad's return, Nanelia is captured by a reptilian slaver named Cayman of the Lazuli (Morgan Woodward). Cayman possesses a powerful ship with an eclectic crew of aliens. She explains to Cayman that they are seeking mercenaries for a war against Sador. Cayman takes up their cause in return for the head of Sador, who destroyed Cayman's homeworld years ago. Back on Akir, Shad's sister Mol is captured by two Malmori warriors with the intent to rape her. As Shad and Company return, their approach frightens the Malmori into attempting to escape. Mol, in retaliation, interferes with their controls, allowing Gelt the opportunity to destroy their ship, killing all three. Upon reaching the planet's surface, the heroes are greeted with caution by the natives, who are wary of violent species. When Sador returns, his Malmori forces are intercepted by Shad's hired warriors. Gelt dogfights his way to Hammerhead, which shoots him down. Cowboy and the laser-toting Akira ward off an invasion backed by a Malmori Sonic Tank. Many of Sador's troops are killed, and their Sonic Tank is destroyed; however, many Akira die as well, including Zed. After surviving an assassination attempt by Nestor, Sador launches the remainder of his fleet in a retaliatory strike against Akir. Saint-Exmin blows herself up to knock out Sador's Stellar Converter. Although Sador's aerospace forces are wiped out, Hammerhead picks off all the remaining mercenaries with laser battery-fire and nuclear missiles. Only Nell, piloted by Shad and Nanelia, survives the Malmori onslaught. Crippled and unable to fight, Nell is captured by Hammerhead's tractor beam. Nanelia and Shad activate Nell's self- destruct program, then flee their ship in an escape pod. Sador commands Nell to surrender. Instead she detonates, causing his Stellar Converter to backfire and disintegrate Hammerhead. As Shad and Nanelia return to Akir, Nanelia despairs over their friends' deaths. Shad shares with her the teachings of Akir's \\"Varda\\": nobody is truly dead when they have been loved and are celebrated by the living. The Akira will always remember the sacrifices made by the mercenaries, who will forever be honored in the legends of Akir. Cast * Richard Thomas as Shad, a young Akira farmer who looks for mercenaries to save his people. Over the course of the story, he evolves into the next Akira Corsair, brother of the ill-fated Mol. * Robert Vaughn as Gelt, a notorious assassin with an intergalactic bounty on his head.

Production =Development= Battle Beyond the Stars was budgeted at an estimated $2,000,000. At the time of its release, it was the most expensive film produced by Roger Corman. Much of the budget allegedly went toward paying the salaries of George Peppard and Robert Vaughn, since both of screenwriter Sayles' previous films were low-budget productions. To save on costs, the film was produced in Corman's own studio, his \\"renowned lumberyard facility\\" in Venice, California. Initially, the film came out of producer Roger Corman's desire to make a space opera-style film in the wake of the massive worldwide success of Star Wars. Up-and-coming screenwriter John Sayles had already written the Corman-produced The Lady in Red and Piranha, the latter of which was both a financial and critical success. At one point, Australian director Richard Franklin (Patrick, Psycho II) was attached to direct.\\"Oz in LA\\", Cinema Papers, May‚ÄìJune 1979 p332 However, he was replaced by Jimmy T. Murakami, a veteran animator who had previously been an uncredited co-director on Corman's Humanoids from the Deep. The planet Akir and its inhabitants, the Akira, a peaceful alien race at the center of the conflict, were named in honor of director Akira Kurosawa, whose film Seven Samurai provided the framework for the plot. Corman initially hired James Cameron as a model maker for his studio after being impressed with his short film Xenogenesis. When the original art director for the film was fired, Cameron became responsible for the majority of the film's special effects, or, as Cameron later put it, \\"production design and art direction\\". This was Cameron's first \\"big break\\" in the entertainment industry, and it helped to propel his career. He was recommended by long-time working partner and future wife Gale Anne Hurd, who was at the time working for Corman. While Cameron initially worked on camera rigging, he soon started working on special effects and production design of interior sets. The low-budget led to Cameron designing the spaceship's corridors out of spray-painted McDonald's containers. Cameron paid great attention to detail, and hardly slept for weeks while working on the film. His hard work paid off, as the special effects were one aspect of the film highly received by both fans and critics, opening the door for his later successes. According to Hurd, actor Bill Paxton was employed on the set as a carpenter, which is where she first met him, before working with him and Cameron on Aliens: \\"So my first memory of Bill was him pounding nails and cracking everybody up. I mean, we‚Äôd be working at three or four in the morning and he would be the one who kept all our spirits up. He was that person on and off set\\". =Score= This was composer James Horner's third film score. He had previously worked on Roger Corman's Humanoids from the Deep and The Lady in Red, and the producer brought him back for Battle Beyond the Stars. The score features several elements that would become regular staples of Horner's many science fiction and adventure film scores. Several fans have noted similarities between these scores and those for later films, such as Krull and Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. Horner would go on to become a regular collaborator with James Cameron, eventually winning an Academy Award for Best Original Score for Titanic. The supervising sound editor, also responsible for special sound effects, such as Robert Vaughn's \\"laser shot\\" ‚Äì based on Clint Eastwood's .44 Magnum from Dirty Harry ‚Äì was David Yewdall, a regular contract-worker for Corman films. Yewdall later remarked on the \\"film's frugal sound editorial budget\\" in his Practical Art of Motion Picture Sound, and explained some of the movie's sounds: each of the seven spaceships had its own sound. The Nestor ship's sound was made from human voices generated by the community choir from his hometown college in Coalinga, California; Robert Vaughn's ship was based on the recording of a dragster. =Casting= Prior to production, a Hollywood trade paper announced that John Wayne would star in the film, under the direction of Ingmar Bergman. In all likelihood, this was a joke, either by the trade paper or the film's publicist. =Reused material= The starship footage was reused in another Roger Corman science fiction film, Space Raiders, blasted by critics, as well as in the ultra-low budget Corman features Starquest II, Vampirella, The Fantastic Four, Dead Space, and Forbidden World. This same footage was also reused in later films and video games: a clip from the film (in 3-D) is shown during the movie theater fight scene at the end of Bachelor Party, and footage was also used for the LaserDisc game Astron Belt. The soundtrack was later recycled by Corman for Raptor and other films. Sections of Horner's score were reused in Space Raiders and other Corman films. Several of the effects shots and clips were re-used for other films throughout the 1980s, including Bachelor Party, while the spaceship model was re-used in the film Space Raiders. The film was later picked up by Shout! Factory, who released it on DVD and Blu-ray in 2011 as part of the Roger Corman's Cult Classics series. Release Battle Beyond the Stars was released in theatres on September 8, 1980. The film was released on DVD on February 6, 2001, by New Concorde. Corman recouped his costs upon selling the foreign distribution to Orion Pictures for $2.5 million. He also resold cable rights to HBO for $750,000. Reception Battle Beyond the Stars grossed $1.7 million in its opening weekend, and reportedly earned $11 million fairly quickly. =Critical response= Battle Beyond the Stars received mixed reviews from critics due to its similar space opera styling, capitalizing upon the success of Star Wars. Cameron's special effects were praised as being impressive, considering the film's low budget, and helped to open the door for his future success. The film has since garnered a cult following, in part due to its effects-heavy action set-pieces and creative production design. The film review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 45%, based on reviews from 11 critics. Christopher John reviewed Battle Beyond the Stars in Ares Magazine #5 and commented that \\"There is a lot to be pointed up in this picture. There is the fact that every different technology shows different lines of development. Every ship and the way it is operated is distinctly unique.\\" Awards and nominations =Awards= Saturn Awards * Outstanding Achievement: Sybil Danning ‚Äì 19811981 Saturn Awards =Nominations= Saturn Awards1981 IMDb Saturn Awards * Best Science Fiction Film: 1981 * Best Special Effects: Chuck Comisky ‚Äì 1981 * Best Costumes: Durinda Wood ‚Äì 1981 * Best Make-Up: Sue Dolph, Steve Neill, Rick Stratton ‚Äì 1981 Battle Amongst the Stars A prequel comic book, set 30 years before the BBTS film, was launched by Bluewater Productions in March 2010.\\"Bluewater Productions March Releases \\" bluewaterprod.com.

Terminology In nautical usage the term \\"sheet\\" is applied to a rope or chain attached to the lower corners of a sail for the purpose of extension or change of direction. The connexion in derivation with the root \\"shoot\\" is more clearly seen in \\"sheet- anchor\\", one that is kept in reserve, to be \\"shot\\" in case of emergency.  Fore-and-aft rigs Fore-and-aft rigs comprise the vast majority of sailing vessels in use today, including effectively all dinghies and yachts. The sheet on a fore-and-aft sail controls the angle of the sail to the wind, and should be adjusted to keep the sail just filled. Most smaller boats use the Bermuda rig, which has two or three sets of sheets: * The mainsheet is attached to the boom, and is used to control the mainsail. In a rig with no boom on the mainsail, the mainsheet would attach directly to the mainsail clew. A mainsheet is a line connected to the boom which allows a sailor to control the speed of a boat. * The jib sheet attaches to the clew of the jib, and controls it. The jib has a sheet on each side, only one of which (the leeward one) will be in use at one time. * The spinnaker sheet attaches to the clew(s) of the spinnaker, if carried. A symmetrical spinnaker has two sheets, an \\"active\\" one and a \\"lazy\\" one, in the same way as a jib, but they are attached to the sail's two separate clews. On boats larger than around thirty feet, the spinnaker will also be fitted with guys, which are similar to sheets but control the pole instead of the sail. On smaller boats the lazy sheet is used as a guy. On the smallest boats, a sheet is often a simple line, pulled by hand; on larger boats, intermediate blocks are sometimes used to provide mechanical advantage. However, many blocks and their multiply reeved lines, particularly on headsails, have been replaced by single-line sheets trimmed by powerful winches.  Square rig  Square-rigged vessels are much less common, and are usually large ships. Nevertheless, they too have sheets on the movable corners of their square sails. Unlike fore-and-aft sheets, though, square-rig sheets do not control the angle of the sails (which is performed using braces); instead, they are used to haul the corners of the sails from their stowed positions down towards the tip of the yard below. They are then not adjusted significantly while sailing until the sail is to be handed (put away) again. The lowest sails, the courses, are trimmed using the sheets as these sails are loose footed and are secured to yards only at the head. File:Ecoutes lov√©es.jpgCoiled sheets Image:Stowing sails aloft.jpgThe length of chain running diagonally up and right from the bottom-left of this picture to the upper of the two yards is the fore-lower-topsail sheet. Some of the lines on Prince William's larger sails are made of chain to handle the heavy loads while remaining flexible enough to pass through the various blocks on their route to the deck.

She is best known as a B movie actress and is often referred to as a \\"scream queen\\" due to her frequent appearances in low-budget horror films during the 1980s and 1990s. Born in Davenport, Iowa, Quigley first pursued her career in the late 1970s shortly after moving to Los Angeles. While working at Jack LaLanne's health spa, she was encouraged by her friends to try modeling and also began taking acting and guitar-playing classes. After appearing as an extra in various films, Quigley got her first acting role in the Charles Band-produced film Fairy Tales (1978). She continued receiving small parts mostly in B movies. Her first bigger part was in the 1981 slasher film, Graduation Day. Quigley followed with more films such as Savage Streets (1984) and Silent Night, Deadly Night (1984). In 1985, Quigley appeared in the zombie horror film The Return of the Living Dead playing a teenage punk, which is considered one of her most notable roles and earned her \\"scream queen\\" status. During the second half of the 1980s, Quigley starred in a number of low-budget films following the popularization of the home video. She repeatedly worked with the directors David DeCoteau (Creepozoids, Nightmare Sisters, and Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-O- Rama) and Kevin Tenney (Night of the Demons and Witchtrap), and appeared alongside fellow scream queens Brinke Stevens and Michelle Bauer. By the end of the 1980s, Quigley decided to take a different direction and starred in the first two films of Rick Sloane's comedy series Vice Academy. However, she continued being type cast as a victim in horror films. Aside from her acting career, Quigley is also a singer (she formed an all-female band The Skirts in the early 1980s) and an author (she wrote three books; The Linnea Quigley Bio & Chainsaw Book, I'm Screaming as Fast as I Can: My Life in B-Movies, and Skin). She is also a devoted animal rights activist and an active member of PETA. Career =Early life and career beginnings= Quigley as a senior in high school, 1976 Quigley was born on May 27, 1958 in Davenport, Iowa, the daughter of Dorothy (November 29, 1922 ‚Äì December 21, 2009) and William Heath Quigley (June 27, 1915 ‚Äì May 18, 2006). Her father was a chiropractor and psychologist. He worked as an executive vice president at Palmer College of Chiropractic. An only child, Quigley attended Garfield Elementary and Sudlow Middle schools in Davenport. In 1972, she began attending Bettendorf High School in Bettendorf, Iowa. Quigley later reminisced about her school years: \\"I was so shy. I didn't move my mouth, didn't sing in glee club or anything like that, didn't do any plays. I was terribly, terribly shy.\\" Shortly after graduating from high school in 1976, Quigley moved with her parents to Los Angeles. She landed a job at Jack LaLanne's health spa, where she met models who worked in films by doing work as extras. Encouraged by her friends, Quigley began taking acting and guitar-playing classes. One of her earliest acting jobs was a television commercial for the Close-Up toothpaste. After getting a few extra parts, she got her first acting role in the Charles Band- produced erotic comedy Fairy Tales (1978), wherein she appeared as Sleeping Beauty. Her next role was in the pseudo-documentary Auditions (1978), again produced by Band and directed by Harry Hurwitz. She continued receiving small parts in films such as Don't Go Near the Park (1981) and the Troma slasher Graduation Day (1981). She was given the role of Dolores after the original actress refused to do nude scenes. In 1981, the producer and director Jim Feazell decided to shoot some additional footage for the reissue of his unsuccessful 1975 psychological thriller Wheeler. In one of the scenes, Quigley played a waitress menaced by a truck driver. The movie was re-released under the title The Hurting and later changed to Psycho from Texas. Besides modeling and auditioning for films, Quigley also began auditioning for bands that would let her join in. She first played guitar in an all-female band, Mad Whistle, started by the singer and songwriter Lucrecia Sarita Russo. Russo's then-husband Jeffrey Spry appeared alongside Quigley in the film Graduation Day with his band Felony. Quigley then managed to form her own band called The Skirts. Her friend Haydee Pomar, whom she met on the set of Cheech & Chong's comedy Nice Dreams (1981), played the bass guitar. They practiced in the basement of the punk rock club The Masque and their music got featured in some of Quigley's later movies. Their song \\"Santa Monica Blvd. Boy\\" was released on Mystic Records' 1983 compilation The Sound of Hollywood Girls. =Acting career= Quigley is best known for her role in The Return of the Living Dead (1985) (directed by Dan O'Bannon). She has also starred in dozens of other horror films, including Savage Streets (with Linda Blair), Silent Night, Deadly Night, Nightmare Sisters, Creepozoids, Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-O-Rama, Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers, Night of the Demons (the 1988 original and the 2009 remake), and A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master. Quigley is the author of two books about her career as a B-movie actress, Chainsaw and I'm Screaming as Fast as I Can. She has been called the \\"Queen of the B's\\". Linnea co-starred with Daniel Baldwin in Stripperland (2011). She played in David DeCoteau's movies 1313: Cougar Cult (2012) and 3 Scream Queens (2014) and Charles Band's web series Trophy Heads (2014) with Brinke Stevens and Michelle Bauer. In 2012, Quigley guest appeared in Massachusetts death metal band Sexcrement's music video entitled \\"Trucker Bombed\\". Alongside regular co-stars Brinke Stevens, and Michelle Bauer, Quigley appeared in and was a main subject for the 2011 documentary Screaming in High Heels: The Rise & Fall of the Scream Queen Era and its 2020 follow up Screaming in High Heels: The Reunion . Personal life =Relationships= Linnea‚Äôs father was Dr. William ‚ÄúNip‚Äù Heath Quigley, a Dean of Education and Vice President at Palmer College of Chiropractic in Davenport, IA. Her mother Dorothy was a homemaker. After she graduated from Bettendorf High School in 1976, she moved to California with her parents when her father became the president of the Los Angeles campus of Palmer College. He left the college in the late 1980s to open a private practice. During the filming of Night of the Demons (1988), Quigley began a relationship with special effects artist Steve Johnson. Later, while working on the film A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master (1988), Johnson proposed to Quigley on the set. \\"I actually got engaged on the set of that movie right after coming out of Freddy's chest. He gave me a ring so that was funny. While he's hosing my K-Y Jelly off me and after it fell over almost killing us and some others, he still managed to ask me to marry him.\\" They married on January 17, 1990 but divorced in 1992. According to public records, Linnea was married to Gerald Wayne Carter Jr. on March 22, 2004 in Pompano Beach, FL. They divorced the same year. According to her father‚Äôs obituary in the Quad-City Times published on May 24, 2006, she was married to Frank J. NaCarlo of Pompano Beach, FL. =Veganism= Quigley is a vegan. She switched to a vegetarian diet in the late 1970s after her move to Los Angeles, first by eliminating red meat, then chicken and fish, and eventually all dairy and all other foods from animals. She is an animal rights activist and an active member of the animal rights organization PETA. In October 1990, she appeared on the cover of Vegetarian Times. However, the cover story met with heavy criticism from the readers attacking Quigley for appearing in films that depict violence against women.

The Sierra Madre is part of the American Cordillera, a chain of mountain ranges (cordillera) that consists of an almost continuous sequence of mountain ranges that form the western 'backbone' of North America, Central America, South America and West Antarctica. Etymology The Spanish name sierra madre means \\"mother mountain range\\" in English, and occidental means \\"western\\", these thus being the \\"Western mother mountain range\\". To the east, from the Spanish oriental meaning \\"eastern\\" in English, the Sierra Madre Oriental range or \\"Eastern Mother Mountains\\" runs generally parallel to the Sierra Madre Occidental along eastern Mexico and the Gulf of Mexico. The range extends from northern Sonora state near the Mexico-U.S. border at Arizona, southeastwards to the Trans- Mexican Volcanic Belt and Sierra Madre del Sur ranges. The high plateau that is formed by the range is cut by deep river valleys. This plateau is formed from volcanic rock overlying a basement of metamorphic rock. This uplift has caused changes in weather patterns; increased rainfall occurring in the mountains has provided areas where ecosystems can form in wetter areas than surrounding land. This water source forms watersheds that provide the arid surroundings with water that makes it possible to irrigate and farm crops. The wet ecosystems are islands of biodiversity, differing significantly from what would otherwise be a desert landscape. Oak forests are the predominant plant life, and extend into the lowland deserts. This forest and canyon land provided a place for a variety of indigenous people to live, until Spanish settlers with associated mestizos came into the area to found towns for the silver mines in the area. The major industries in the area now are agriculture and forestry, which have become contentious because of land degradation and the native population's opposition to these practices. Geography Copper Canyon in Chihuahua, Mexico Basaseachic Falls The range trends from the north to southeast. Canyons cut by the rivers of the wet western slopes exist in addition to those of the northeast slopes, notably the Copper Canyon. =Location= The range runs parallel to the Pacific coast of Mexico, from just south of the Arizona-Sonora border southeast through eastern Sonora, western Chihuahua, Sinaloa, Durango, Zacatecas, Nayarit, Jalisco, Aguascalientes to Guanajuato, where it joins with the Sierra Madre del Sur and the Eje Volc√°nico Transversal (Transverse Volcanic Axis) of central Mexico after crossing . The mountains range from from the Gulf of California in the north, but begin to approach within of the Pacific in the south. These mountains are generally considered to be part of the much larger American cordillera, the mountains extending from Alaska down to these across western North America. =Regions= Sierra Tarahumara or Tarahumara is the name for the region of the Sierra Madre beginning at the Durango border and extending north. This name comes from the Tarahumara natives. This is a dramatic landscape of steep mountains formed by a high plateau that has been cut through with canyons including Copper Canyon, larger and, in places, deeper than the Grand Canyon. This plateau has an average elevation of with most of the more eroded canyons on the western slope, due to the higher moisture content. The highest elevations occur in the Tarahumara range. The exact elevations of the highest peaks are not known within accurate enough ranges to determine their relative elevation. The highest point is probably Cerro Mohinora, located at . Estimates for the height of the mountain start around and go up to . However, Cerro Barajas, at , may be as high as although other sources give as the elevation. Cerro Gordo, at , may have an elevation between and . The southern end of the mountains may be referred to as the Sierra Huichola. In this area, the Sierra Madre begins to give way to the basin and range province. Subranges of this area include the Sierra de Alica and the Sierra Pajaritos, both in Nayarit. =Water= The Rio Santiago The mountains act as a source of water, in an otherwise arid environment from the increased precipitation from the mountain range. As such, rivers that have headwaters in the mountains provide water for irrigation in the surrounding lands. The need for water to irrigate prompted the construction of dams, which has been the source of several environmental concerns in the area. The northern end of the range is more arid; hence, the Yaqui River, which drains that area, is an important source of irrigation in the state of Sonora. The Yaqui drains into the Gulf of California, as do the Humaya River in Sinaloa and the Fuerte River further south. The R√≠o Grande de Santiago drains from the southern slopes of the Sierra Madre. Along the more arid eastern slopes of the mountains, the Nazas River and Aguanaval River drain the mountains into a closed basin. These mountains supply 90% of the water used for irrigation within the watershed. North of this system is the Conchos River which drains into the Rio Grande. Along many rivers the arid conditions have caused courses to be dammed to provide water for irrigation. These dams have caused concerns along with those caused by other activities. The Yaqui has been dammed with three large reservoirs along its course. The R√≠o Grande de Santiago has also been dammed, including the Aguamilpa Dam begun in 1991 and the El Caj√≥n Dam (Mexico) upstream from it. To provide irrigation water for farming the dry basin, the Nazas river was dammed in the 1930s and 1940s. This has led to the former drainage lakes in the area drying up, and soil depletion from the elimination of the river as a source of soil. Due to the continued logging in the area, erosion on the slopes of hillsides has increased. =Human= Numerous small populations live in Copper Canyon, some of them around old missions. Many settlements consist of single families or small family groups near agricultural fields. There are also a few towns of note, including Creel, Chihuahua, with 5,000 inhabitants; it serves as a stop on the train line. South of Copper Canyon is the town of El Salto, Durango, situated along highway 40. To the west is Copala, Sinaloa. To the south live the indigenous Cora people in the towns of Jes√∫s Mar√≠a and La Mesa del Nayar. In addition, 1,000 people live in the village of Huajimic in Nayarit. The Bola√±os River valley of Jalisco is populated with mining communities, such as San Mart√≠n de Bola√±os, which has a population of around 3,000. Few paved roads cross the mountains, meaning that travel times can be long, even between cities that are relatively close. In the north, Mexico Federal Highway 16 connects Hermosillo, Sonora and La Junta, Chihuahua. In the mountains, the La Entrada al Pacifico Corridor is an incomplete road intended to connect Los Mochis, Sinaloa and Chihuahua. Durango and Mazatlan are connected by highway 40, around 24 degrees north latitude. Geology The Sierra Madre Occidental is a high plateau of volcanic rock that is eroded in areas to reveal a basement composed of plutonic and sedimentary rocks underlying the two groups of extrusive volcanics. The lower of these groups is a series of volcanic rocks formed by lava flows. The surface of the plateau is made up of a second series of volcanic ignimbrites, covered mostly by clay rich organic soils. Some intrusions in the area have deposited ore veins that are commercially viable. The landscape was shaped after rock placement. Rivers cut valleys into the plateau, following folds in the rocks. Rocks have broken off of the slopes, forming rocky sides. The bedrock is covered by the clay rich soils, except in eroded areas, where water carries away deposits leaving a stony surface. =Geological history= The basement is thought to be Older North American basement, especially in the North, and a number of different accreted terranes, which are mostly covered by Cenozoic volcanism. The northern extent of the Sierra Madre is the Cort√©s Terrane, although the northern extreme of this contains a small portion of the Carborca Terrane. Some of the northern end may also be underlain by a Precambrian basement placed around the same time as the Grenville Orogeny. Some of this area has a series of Paleozoic sedimentary sequences from a deep marine environment underlying it, considered by some to be part of the Cotes Terrane and by others to be transported. In some areas, distinct sedimentary rocks can be identified by shallow-water Silurian and Mississippian sedimentary rocks underlying deep-water Pennsylvanian and Permian, which are divided by Mississippian rhyolite. The Permian clastics contain some detrital rock that sit alongside low-grade metamorphosed sedimentary and volcanic rocks with serpentinite. South of the Cortes and Carborca Terranes is the San Jos√© de Garc√≠a Terrane, which is a combination of Cretaceous arc volcanics and volcaniclastics, which may be thrusting over the Cortes terrane. The southern part of the range is made up of the Guerrero Composite Terrane, a large body, which is actually a complex of five different subterranes, not all of them within the main body of the Sierra Madre. However, the terrane is mostly covered by volcanics and sedimentary deposits, so it is only visible where erosion has revealed it. The main subterranes of the Guerrero Composite Terrane that are within the Sierra Madre are the Tahue and Zihuatanejo terranes. Dividing the Guerrero Terrane from the rest of the Sierra Madre terranes is a boundary that is thought to represent the Early Cretaceous Arperos Basin, a marine basin which separated the island arc that came to form the Guerrero terrane from the accretions that came to form the Sierra Madre terrane. It contains a lower formation made up of pillow basalts with pillow breccias, tuffs, and shales underlying a group of pelagic limestones, oozes, and turbidites. Covering the southern basement are sedimentary and metamorphosed sedimentary rocks containing argillite, limestone, volcanic schist, slate, and greywacke which were exposed in the canyon of the Santiago River. Near these sediments late Oligocene to early Miocene granite and granodiorite intrusive bodies occur. A possible cause of this is that these bodies were roof pendants which were uplifted by plutons. Mesozoic limestone also occurs in northern portion of the mountains, mostly from the Cretaceous. The Durango Volcanic field Towards the end of the Cretaceous, the Laramide orogeny increased the activity of magmatism in the area, forming the first major igneous series in the area. The igneous series are made up of formations of plutonic and volcanic rock, which would later be exposed. Interbedded with these rocks are sedimentary deposit rocks. In the center of the range, some of these rocks have been deformed by tectonic forcing that occurred at the same time. The southern part of the range contains none of the volcanism that is apparent in the northern range. These formations ended in the Paleocene. Eocene volcanism formed a series of andesitic and rhyolitic formations in the area, with spatial and temporal variations throughout. Most of the gold and silver deposits are also in these rocks. An example of the ignimbrite units In the Oligocene, ash flows became the predominant deposit of the area, with interbedded lava flows between. These ash flows began the second series of high magmatism formations. The Mid- Tertiary ignimbrite flare-up formed a series of ignimbrite formations, layered one atop another, that are sometimes broken by lava flows. The ignimbrite formations in this area cover the largest area of any known series, with ten calderas identified in the province. Three of these calderas are in Copper Canyon. The lava has formed a series of mafic rocks that comprise the Southern Cordilleran Basaltic Andesite Suite. The tuffs are above a thick formation of lava rock. Around five or six units have been identified, mostly around the Copper Canyon area. These tuffs have allowed wide-ranging correlation with formations in other geographical areas, for example Death Valley. During the Miocene, three periods of volcanism marked separate events in the Sierras. Each period is marked by different volcanic processes. The first was a continuation of the Oligocene flare-up, which lasted through the early Miocene. This may be a distinct second occurrence of the same process, placing silica-rich lava above Oligocene rocks. Also in the early Miocene more intermediate Basaltic andesites occur along faults and in grabens. Beginning in the early Miocene and continuing into the middle, an arc of andesite was placed during the spreading of the Gulf of California. The basin and range- style faulting of the middle-late Miocene took place at the same time as the placement of alkali basalts, In the westernmost slopes mafic dikes formed. These events have also been linked to the subduction of the Farallon Plate. Episodes of volcanism continued into the Quaternary. =Structures= The Sierras are believed to be a thick core covered by volcanics and eroded by numerous rivers. Some have suggested that the basement of the mountains have numerous intrusions made by mafic magma. At their surface, the mountains are made up of large-scale ignimbrite sheet that has been incised by rivers flowing from rainfall in the mountains. The surface of the plateau is almost exclusively from the second series of flows causing the rock that is most visible to be ignimbrites with lava flow layers. The region has a general strike from just west of north to just south of east. Faults in the area tend to be younger than the upper volcanics, excluding those associated with calderas, but do occur in distinct periods. The large faults along the eastern slope have caused the slope to be made up of large escarpments that face into the interior basins. These faults are commonly covered by alluvium and basalt, making them difficult to discern, but can be found in certain fault blocks. Grabens have formed in the north, and some of these are filled with volcanic and sedimentary floors, and long depressions have formed in the southern Sierra Madre. The faulting decreases in the center of the range where the faults are mostly small normal faults, but increases once again on the western slope. In fact, the major normal faults tend to diverge around the center of the core and join at either end. Some of these faults may have allowed ignimbrites to erupt from the surface, and so there may be some association between the ignimbrite occurrence and faults; this can be used to find out information about different kinds of basement rock present. There are two faults dividing the Sierra Madre from the central Mexican Plateau. The more southern one is the north‚Äìsouth Aguascalientes fault extending from Altos de Jalisco to near Zacatecas, where it joins the more northern northwest‚Äìsoutheast trending San Luis‚ÄìTepehuanes fault extending from Guanajuato to Durango. The southern boundary of the Sierra Madre Occidental with the Jalisco block is a series of folds, thrust, and left lateral faults date from the middle Miocene. This may be evidence for a left transpressional shear zone. The area between this boundary and the Aguascalientes fault is filled with numerous grabens and half-grabens, as well an east‚Äìwest left shear zone, the El Roble shear zone. At the west end of these grabens and half- grabens are the Pochotitan and the more northerly San Pedro fault systems, which form the western boundary of the faults in the southern mountains. In the north there is an unknown boundary between the Cortes Terrane and the Guerrero Composite Terrane. Some theorize that this is a section of the Mojave‚ÄìSonora Megashear, but this theory is not universally accepted; however, the Megashear is important, and, in fact, is necessary for reconstructions of the opening of the Gulf of California, as of 2003. =Mineral deposits= On a smaller scale, mineral deposits are distributed in formations of the Sierra Madre, although the events that placed these deposits vary throughout the mountains. The Guerrero composite terrane contains many of the economic deposits, often found in ore bodies younger than the Cretaceous. Gold and silver deposits most commonly occur in the altered andesites of the early volcanics, typically these deposits are between 30 and 50 million years old. These are believed to be caused by later intrusions into the early flows. Fissure-vein deposits have been divided into two groups of fissure vein deposits, which are divided geographically into an eastern and western series. In the east, the gold and silver are accompanied by lead and zinc. In the south, the Bola√±os mine district is contained with the Bola√±os Graben. Some also occur as epithermal deposits. Also, some gold occurs along with copper in Cenozoic iron-oxide skarn and replacement deposits along the Pacific. In addition to gold and silver and their related deposits, tin, iron, and mercury occur, sometimes in later units, mostly in later volcanics, and Molybdenum occurs in the mountains, often along with older copper deposits or in Oligocene deposits in the east. The belt of tin deposits lies mostly within the eastern slopes from Durango to Guanajuato. In these areas, tin occurs in rhyolitic ignimbrites in many, possibly over 1000, small deposits of cassiterite. Typically these deposits are divided from overlying ignimbrites by breccia, which may also contain ore. Many of these are thought to be hydrothermal deposits To the east of these units is a belt of more mercury deposits, followed by another belt of manganese deposits, although these deposits are mostly limited to Chihuahua and Hidalgo. Iron occurs in three different regions placed by different mechanisms. Along the Pacific there the numerous skarn and replacement deposits mentioned above with relation to gold. Iron occurs in Durango in the form of magnetite lava flows, which are often surrounded by smaller hematite deposits, thought to be ash flows. There is also a belt of iron deposits further east. =Soil= Most soil in the mountains is covered by an organic-rich layer over layers rich in clay. Soils are commonly phaeozems that are up to . Some soils are cambisols that are less than deep and well-drained. Due to the high clay content, which blocks water from being absorbed into the soil, larger rock particles in the soil help reduce runoff and soil losses from erosion. Areas that are covered in stone are known as lithosols, and make up most of the remaining surface in the mountains, especially on upper slopes. The last major soil type are vertisols, which are thin mineral-poor soils. Soils at higher elevations experience more leaching, due to increased rainfall. Acidic soils may have lower calcium content, leading to lower plant soil quality. Soils along the eastern slopes have increased organic content and a clay heavy layer that is developed more than those of the more arid eastern lands. The thickness of soil layers also increases. Problems with soil degradation have been aggravated by the cultivation of drug crops, leading to deforestation of many areas. Other problems include overgrazing, which has led to terracing from cattle paths and the formation of a soil crust, and soil acidification, which poses a risk to some grasslands as of 2002. Climate The climate varies considerably between the northern and southern extents of this long mountain range. Seasonal variations also occur due to the presence of large bodies of warm water delivering warm damp air from each side of the range. This region undergoes a seasonal variety with two wet seasons, including a summer monsoon, and two dry seasons each year. =Temperature, pressure, and wind= Air pressure changes in northwestern Mexico and the southwest United States are the main causes of seasonal variation in the Sierra Madre. A high pressure area that rests over the mountains in the winter begins to move north of the mountains into New Mexico during the month of June. The high pressure begins to break down and move south during September or October; however, the breakdown is usually at a slower pace than the movement north. This high pressure belt is associated with the mechanics that form the Bermuda High. The climate in the mountains is mild. Summer temperatures maintain a constant level. Maximum temperatures are typically in July at around 31 C with average temperatures of the order of 16 C during this same period. Mean annual temperatures are between above . Below-freezing temperatures can occur in the higher mountains, with precipitation occurring as snowfall certain times of year. During the summer monsoon, wind patterns undergo large-scale changes. In May there is very little large-scale wind current through the mountains, most circulates around the mountains, although onshore flow is present. As the high pressure moves north, air is pulled off the Gulf of Mexico, bringing easterly winds aloft to the mountains. On the east slope of the mountain, daytime upslope winds flow to the crest, where the flow joins westerly winds. The mountains cause convection during the following monsoon season, during which nocturnal winds at low levels in the atmosphere move moisture overnight. After the high pressure breaks down, wind patterns return to those prior to the monsoon season. = Precipitation and humidity= Precipitation varies on both annual and seasonal scales in the Sierra Madre. Annual differences in regional climate are associated with the El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation with El Ni√±o years leading to a wetter climate. Monsoon rains come to the Sierra Madre in June as the high pressure area moves north, leading to wet summer seasons. This causes east winds bringing moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. On the western side of the mountains, which are affected by the largest change in precipitation between the dry season and monsoon season, in the monsoon season rainfall can exceed in a single month. The southern region receives more of the rainfall than the northern. Much of this precipitation occurs as tropical storms. As the high pressure over New Mexico breaks down, rainfall in the Sierra Madre ends. Because of the monsoon, the summer accounts for the majority of rainfall in the area. The spring and fall dry season separate out a weaker wet season in the winter. In addition to increasing in the southern ranges of the mountains, rainfall increases in the higher elevations of the Sierra Madre Occidental. Humidity in the mountains varies at wide levels as does rainfall. In the early morning before dawn, the air is almost saturated (often over 90% relative humidity) near the mountain tops with low clouds over the range. Lower in the range, air is not as near saturated in the morning. Seasonal variation in humidity is also present with average May and June relative humidity around 50%, with 25% possible during the day. Also during the day, relative humidity drops and cloud levels rise as temperatures rise. The humidity of the range is also influenced by the same seasonal changes as rainfall. In the dry season dew points are low at high elevations (500 hPa), around in the south of the range, and in the north in May. In June, dew points begin to increase from the May levels up to in the north and in the south. By July these dew points are at throughout the range. The range allows higher dew points throughout these periods than the surrounding low lands. This rise in humidity accompanies the monsoon. Ecology Sierra Madre Occidental pine-oak forests The mountains create a diverse setting for plants and animals by creating a different set of conditions from the surroundings. The Sierra Madre Occidental pine-oak forests are found at elevations of throughout the range, but the forests in the mountains vary by elevation and place in the range. This ecoregion is noted for its high biodiversity and large number of endemic species, and for allowing some species to extend their range. =Flora= The dominant plants vary across the range, and the habitat that they present varies from scattered woodland to both deciduous and coniferous forest. The elevation and latitude in the range are the major determining factors in the dominant plants. Oaks dominate the lower reaches of the mountains, where stands grow down to about . Some oak species even continue into the surrounding ecosystems. In the western slopes of the range, cloud forest also occurs, mostly on mid-elevation slopes with little exposure to wind or sun in the southern end of the range. At higher elevations pines begin to grow alongside the oaks, and pines begin to dominate the oaks at higher elevations. At high elevations and in the north, mixed conifer forests become the dominant ecosystem. These forests are composed primarily of pines and firs, which begin to grow at these elevations. There are also grasslands on some mountain tops, surrounded by the forest that occur in those areas. Plants in the area typically have large responses to the change in climate with each season. Monsoon season is the largest of these effects, with leaf buds following only a few months after the rains begin. Flowering season occurs in the months preceding the summer monsoon. This is only the peak flowering season, with plants flowering throughout the year. Due to the early flowering, fruit is ripe and seeds are dispersed at the beginning of the rains. There are also areas where plants have little response to the seasons, particularly those areas that experience moist conditions, caused by the elevations. These plants may maintain leaves through times when other areas are in the dry season, during which most deciduous trees have no leaves. =Fauna= The mountains are often a corridor for species allowing more diversity in the area, by combining species from different regions. Animals typically associated with arid and mountainous habitats share the mountains with species associated with habitats further south. There are many carnivorous and omnivorous mammals native to the area, although several are extirpated or are part of threatened populations. The Mexican wolf's range in the mountains is limited to the foothills of Durango or the animal may have been extirpated; the black bear population is small, and the Mexican grizzly bear that once resided here is confirmed extinct. Jaguars and ocelots are also now rare. On the other hand, mountain lion and bobcat are more common. On the eastern slopes there are American badger, coyote and gray fox that live across the mountains. Native ungulates include the white tailed deer, mule deer, and collared peccary. Rodents and lagomorphs include the eastern cottontail, which lives in the forests of the western slopes, cliff chipmunk, rock squirrel, Mexican fox squirrel, and various species of Cricetidae. Raccoons, hog-nosed skunk, and hooded skunk live in the mountains. The white-nosed coati lives on the western slopes, and the ring-tailed cat lives throughout. Many species of bats live in the mountains also. A variety of lizards live in the area and surroundings. The Tarahumara frog lives in the oak and pine stands preferring moving water to pools. The southern extent of the Sonoran mountain kingsnake's range is the Chihuahuan desert into the mountains. Other snakes and frogs live in the mountains, and many species live in the western slopes. Birds frequent the mountains, some as a migratory path and others as native species. The migratory birds often use the area to the west as an overwintering area, and migrate north along the western slopes. In the northern canyons birds may be divided into different habitats, or more specifically, the different types of forest, leading to differences in range by altitude. Some of this difference by altitude may even extend the range of some species, enabling tropical species to use the mountain valleys for migration. Bird species endemic to the Sierra Madre Occidental include tufted jay, the \\"gray-eared\\" subspecies of red warbler, eared quetzal, thick-billed parrot, and formerly included the imperial woodpecker, which now may be extinct. The rivers and streams of the range contain some of the southernmost trout populations in North America. These populations may be native, although this is not universally accepted. Invasive fish compete with the native species which has been a cause of concern among researchers, along with concerns about the effects of logging on these species. =Surroundings= The Sonoran Desert is found in the northwestern foothills at . The Chihuahuan Desert is found to the northeast and east, the Meseta Central matorral and Central Mexican matorral to the southeast, and the Sinaloan dry forests to the west and southwest. These lower elevations are usually graded into by a stand of tropical deciduous forest, which has a large portion of flora made up of flowering plants and legumes. These flowering plants are mostly from the genus Bursera. The ecotone, made up of the tropical deciduous forest, is commonly sparsely populated, sometimes only by small stands of trees. It may be referred to as savanna. =Preservation= Preservation efforts in the modern day, include those from Edwin Bustillos. Other groups, including Conservation International, work to protect animal species in the area. Basaseachic Falls National Park is a national park in the mountains containing the highest waterfalls in the country. Since 1979, there has also been a national park in the transition between the Chihuahuan Desert and the Sierra, the Cumbres de Majalca National Park. Additionally, there are reserves such as La Michilia in the southern Sierra Madre, or the Tutuaca reserve in western Chihuahua, which was established in 2000 under a new system of management. People and history An early picture of Tarahumara The mountains are home to several indigenous nations speaking Uto-Aztecan languages, including the Tarahumara in the central portion of the range, the Huichol in the southern part of the range, and the Tepehuanes in the eastern slopes. =Prehistory= Archaic cultures are known to have inhabited the Sierra Madre along with the rest of the surrounding lands, but little is known of the culture, although it does vary between the northern and southern extremes of the range. The agrarian Chalchihuites Culture began as farming communities around the first century AD and remained small communities until 300 AD when new agricultural techniques caused a large growth in population until around 500 AD. This culture began to decline in the ninth century. The Mogollon culture has been described in the northern foothills. Sites date the emergence of the culture to around 900 AD, and its abandonment to around 1000‚Äì1100 AD. During the period estimated for Mogollon abandonment, the Rio Sonora culture began agricultural developments along the Rio Sonora and rivers flowing into it. This culture produced pottery and lived in pit houses, until 1150 to 1200 when they began to construct surface dwellings. Construction of these houses ended around AD1550. =Spanish Sierra Madre= Francisco de Ibarra came to Durango in 1554, and began to settle the area. He would explore the western coast and cross the Sierra Madre in 1564. Early Spanish influence in the area came from the new silver mines, the first of which was established in 1567 at Santa Barbara. As sites opened for mining, missionaries came to the areas and had a strong presence by 1595. The first meeting with the Tarahumara came in 1607, when a missionary went up the valley to meet them. Opposition to the missionaries built up, leading to the Tepehu√°n Revolt. This revolt began in 1616 in the town of Santa Catarina de Tepehuanes in Durango,{cite web  title = History of Mexico - The State of Durangoyear=2017url=http://www.houstonculture.org/mexico/durango.htmlaccessdate=23 April 2019} and lasted for two years. The discovery of silver at Parral in 1631 led to the northern limit of settlement moving into Tarahumara lands. The Jesuits renewed missionary activity in the 1630s, with a new program that increased in scope until around 1650. Tarahumara moved further into the mountains in order to escape the conditions. A smallpox epidemic caused a revolt in 1645. A revolt arose in 1648, primarily among the Tarahumara. A drought caused a pair of revolutions in 1650 and 1652. The last major revolt began in March 1690 among the Tarahumara and ended in 1698. Demands from labor drafts increased in the 1720s, placing a new pressure on missions. Criticism of the Jesuits rose in the 1730s with complaints of Jesuit Commerce, which was established by mission stores. In 1767, Jesuits were expelled from New Spain, ending the mission program. A new colonial official, Jos√© de G√°lvez, came to New Spain and established new laws that caused a boom in silver mining activity in the 1770s. After the Apache faced heightened resistance to raiding from the Spanish in Chihuahuan, they moved down to the Sierra Madre in 1794. By 1800, raiding had essentially ended. =Mexican Sierra Madre= Pancho Villa After leaving San Carlos in the fall of 1881, Geronimo and other Apache moved to the mountains, and became known as the Nednai, sometimes referred to as the \\"Pinery Apache\\" or \\"Bronco Apache\\". From there they raided Sonora and the surrounding land until General George Crook entered the mountains in 1883 to discuss Geronimo's return. Geronimo eventually surrendered in 1886. Pancho Villa fled to the mountains in 1894, becoming a bandit. 19th century Railroads came to the area starting in the 1880s and 1890s, which allowed many old mines in the region to reopen at a profit. Since most of the railroads were American, the foreign influence led to unrest among the people living in the mountains, causing the Tomochic rebellion in 1892. In addition to the railroads, canals were constructed in the 1890s in the Yaqui and Mayo river valleys. These canal projects failed, however, owing to the resistance that the natives of the valleys put up against the projects. Loggers began arriving in the mountains in the late 1800s. In response to the new industry, the Tarahumara moved further into the canyons. 20th century The 1910 revolution began in Chihuahua and spread over the mountains throughout the winter of 1910‚Äì1911. Silver mines were forced to make payments to the rebels, but were allowed to continue operating. General John J. Pershing began to follow Pancho Villa in 1916 and entered the mountains; however, he received no information from the local population. The raids subsided by 1919, and Villa returned peacefully to the foothills. In order to construct irrigation projects in the lowlands below the valleys, irrigation projects were never completed in the Sonoran hills; instead, the Yaqui River was dammed in the 1930s. Dams continued to be constructed in the 1940s and 1950s on the Yaqui River and its tributaries with the largest reservoir, behind the Oviachic dam, completed in 1952. Dams were also constructed on the Mayo river. Because of the dams, soil condition deteriorated, and more work was required to improve soil quality. The mountain range was crossed by the Ferrocarril Chihuahua al Pacifico railroad, completed in 1961. The railroad went up for sale in 1996, but no transaction was ever completed.

Early life  Panoz was an Italian-American. His father, Eugene Panunzio, immigrated to the United States from Avezzano, Italy in the 1900s. Eugene, who shortened his surname from the original Panunzio to Panoz, was a champion featherweight boxer. Panoz attended Greenbrier Military School in Lewisburg, West Virginia, where he met Nancy, whom he would later marry. The two both served in Japan with the United States Army, then moved to Pittsburgh upon their return to the United States.  Business career  Panoz operated two drug stores in Pittsburgh while studying business at Duquesne University. In 1961, Panoz and Milan Puskar formed Milan Pharmaceuticals (which would later be renamed Mylan) in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia. While head of this company, Panoz headed a research group that invented time-release medication through a transdermal patch, known most commonly in today's market for its nicotine application. Panoz left Mylan in 1969 when the company refused to develop the patch, and subsequently moved the family to Ireland where he formed √âlan Corporation. This company has since become an industry leader in drug delivery products and technology, continues to hold the worldwide patent for the nicotine patch, and was the first Irish company to be publicly listed in the U.S. stock market. Panoz gradually reduced his stakes in the company, and it was bought by Perrigo in 2013. Don and Nancy Panoz founded Ch√¢teau √âlan Winery & Resort in Braselton, Georgia, in 1992. At the time of Don's death on 2018 the couple still owned the resort, which has since grown to . The Panozes sold a portion of their businesses to three partners in 2004. Similarly in Patterson, California, 35 miles east of San Jose, the Panozes developed Diablo Grande gated community and the Diablo Grande Winery and Resort, which was sold In 2005; and later they founded the St. Andrews Bay Resort and Spa in Scotland. This venue has since been sold and is now managed by Fairmont Hotels and Resorts as the Fairmont St Andrews. These venues feature golf course designs and collaborations from Bruce Devlin, Denis Griffiths, Jack Nicklaus, Gene Sarazen, and Sam Torrance. He was also the co-Founder and chairman of a water pollution control firm, HydroMentia, and was the Chairman of the Board of Directors for the Norcross, GA based indoor LED display manufacturer, NanoLumens. He was also the owner of Panoz, LLC located at 1089 Highway 124, Hoschton, Georgia 30548. In 2014, he began manufacturing the 25th Anniversary Limited Edition Panoz Motorsports car made exclusively in the United States.  Panoz in motorsports  In 1989, Panoz funded an upstart company started by his son Dan, called Panoz Auto Development. Reportedly, the senior Panoz was skeptical at first of his son's venture, but later used his position in the business world to bring celebrity motorsport figures such as Mario Andretti on board with the goal of entering a Panoz race car in the 24 Hours of Le Mans race. Panoz Motorsports was formed in 1997 in Braselton and entered its brand new car, the Panoz Esperante GTR-1, at Le Mans. The team was competitive, finishing ahead of all but two of the major factory teams in its class. In 1999, Panoz founded the American Le Mans Series with the aim of bringing European-style endurance sports car racing to the Americas.

Origin and Petula Clark recording \\"This is My Song\\" was intended for the film A Countess from Hong Kong, which Charlie Chaplin wrote and directed. Chaplin saw his film as a throwback to the shipboard romances that were popular in the 1930s, and wrote \\"This Is My Song\\" with the intent of evoking that era. To reinforce the evocation, Chaplin was determined to have Al Jolson sing the song‚Äîso determined that he only accepted the information that Jolson had died on 23 October 1950 when shown a photograph of Jolson's tombstone. Ultimately, the song would be featured in the film only as an instrumental. After being disillusioned with regard to Jolson, Chaplin considered having \\"This Is My Song\\" recorded by Petula Clark, who had a home in Switzerland near his residence. Clark's husband and manager Claude Wolff‚Äîwho at the time was with Clark in Reno, Nevada‚Äîreceived a copy of \\"This Is My Song\\" in September 1966, and liked the song which Clark felt had special potential for success in France. However, Clark's regular collaborator Tony Hatch was not impressed with the song, and refused Wolff's invitation to arrange it for Clark to record. French label Vogue Records then commissioned a then successful French arranger Jacques Denjean whose work was judged unsuitable by Wolff. Ultimately, Vogue's U.S. distributor Warner Bros. records sent Ernie Freeman who flew to Reno to prepare for the song's recording session which was to be produced by Sonny Burke at Western Studios in Los Angeles. Clark recorded the song not only in English, but in French as \\"C'est Ma Chanson\\" (lyrics by Pierre Delano√´, who also felt the song a poor choice for Clark), German as \\"Love, So Heisst Mein Song\\" (lyrics by Joachim Relin) and Italian as \\"Cara Felicit√†\\" (lyrics by Ciro Bertini). Clark did not even wish to record the song in English, because she disliked the deliberately old- fashioned lyrics, which Chaplin refused to modify; however, after the translated versions of the song had been recorded, some time remained on the session, and Burke coaxed Clark to use this to record Chaplin's lyrics. The recording session featured the backing of the Wrecking Crew. UK hit Clark had assumed her recording of \\"This Is My Song\\" with the original quaint Chaplin lyrics would only be used as an album track; on learning of Pye Records' plan to release the track as a single she attempted to block its release. Instead, she found herself atop the UK Singles Chart for the first time in six years when \\"This Is My Song\\" reached no. 1 on the chart dated 16 February 1967, a position it retained the next week. Certified Silver for sales of 250,000, the total sales of \\"This Is My Song\\" in the UK would exceed 500,000. The breakout of \\"This Is My Song\\" in the UK in February 1967 caused Pye Records to withdraw Clark's current album release Colour My World, which was rush re-released with \\"This Is My Song\\" added on to reach no. 16 on the charts. \\"This Is My Song\\" was also included on Clark's next album: These Are My Songs, which reached no. 38 UK later that year. \\"This is My Song\\" (in English) is one of four Petula Clark hits for which she has expressed dislike, the others being: \\"Sailor\\", another UK no. 1 hit; \\"Monsieur\\", a German language no. 1 hit which won a gold disc for sales in Germany alone ; and \\"My Love\\". International success Petula Clark's \\"This Is My Song\\" was no. 1 for three weeks in Ireland and six weeks in Australia; it also topped the charts in Rhodesia and South Africa, and reached the top of the Dutch charts for both the Netherlands and Belgium. \\"This Is My Song\\" also earned hit status in Finland (#8), India (#5), Malaysia (#1), New Zealand (#15),Petula Clark - Flavour of New Zealand. Flavour of New Zealand Norway (#6), Singapore (#1), Spain (#8), Thailand (#9) and Venezuela (#5). The North American single release omitted the opening lyrical section, following the instrumental introduction, owing to the length of the song. \\"This Is My Song\\" reached #3 in the U.S. and #4 in Canada. The These Are My Songs album peaked at #27 in the U.S., becoming Clark's second‚Äîand final‚ÄîUS Top 30 album (Downtown at #21 would remain Clark's top-ranking U.S. album). \\"C'est Ma Chanson\\" reached #1 in France and #3 on the chart for Belgium's French-speaking sector, also reaching #10 on Belgium's Dutch chart where the English version had hit #1; total sales of the French-language version were reported as 350,000 by 8 April 1967. In Germany, the English version competed with the German-language version with the former more successful, reaching #16 while \\"Love, So Heisst Mein Song\\" peaked at #23. In Italy, the rendering \\"Cara Felicit√†\\" reached #23. In United Kingdom sales have reached 500,000 mark, while in Belgium 70,000. Sales in Belgium and France by 22 April 1967 have reached 500,000 total sales. Aftermath Although Clark had become a fixture on the upper realms of the U.S. charts through her collaboration with writer/producer Tony Hatch on \\"Downtown\\", her UK singles chart success had been more hit-and-miss. The two singles before \\"This Is My Song\\", \\"Who Am I?\\" and \\"Colour My World\\", had failed to reach the UK Top 50. This made the strong UK showing of \\"This Is My Song\\"‚ÄîClark's first single release since \\"Downtown\\" to be neither written nor produced by Hatch‚Äîthe more remarkable. The follow-up single \\"Don't Sleep in the Subway\\" resumed the Clark/Hatch collaboration and was a UK hit (#12) but, like all Clark's releases after \\"This Is My Song\\", would fail to return her to the UK Top Ten. Despite Clark's reservations about the English version of \\"This is My Song\\": * the song's popularity mandates its inclusion in any concert Clark gives in the English-speaking world; Clark generally performs the song combining French lyrics with the English. * the one published biography of Clark written to date (by Andrea Kon in 1983) is This Is My Song (W.H. Allen & Co. Ltd.). Other versions The first recording of \\"This Is My Song\\" was made by Harry Secombe, with Wally Stott responsible for arranging and conducting. Secombe himself found the lyrics risible; several takes were necessitated due to his bursting into laughter when he tried to sing the line: \\"I care not what the world may say\\". Despite the eventual UK release of Clark's version as a single, \\"This Is My Song\\"'s appeal was strong enough to sustain two versions high on the chart. Secombe's version debuted at number 44 on 25 February 1967 (the second week Clark's version was number one) to rise as high as number two on the chart dated 1 April (which featured Clark's version at number eight). (Clark's previous UK #1 song, \\"Sailor\\", had also had a rival version, in that instance by Anne Shelton, which had reached the Top 10. Wally Stott, who'd regularly produced Clark for the Polygon label in the early 1950s, had also overseen the Shelton recording.) Secombe's version of \\"This Is My Song\\" was included on the album Secombe's Personal Choice, an April 1967 release whose chart peak of #6 in May 1967 bests that of both the Petula Clark albums which parented the song. Besides selling over 300,000 units in the UK,Cash Box Vol 28 #50 (8 July 1967) p. 280 Secombe's version of \\"This Is My Song\\" also became a hit in Australia (#6), Ireland (#20) and South Africa (#15). Versions of \\"This Is My Song\\" have been recorded by Ronnie Aldrich, The Ray Charles Singers, Ray Conniff and the Singers (from the This Is My Song album/ 1967), Dada, James Darren, Percy Faith, Connie Francis (live version), Bobby Hendricks, Engelbert Humperdinck (whose \\"Release Me\\" succeeded Clark's version of \\"This Is My Song\\" at #1 UK and kept Secombe's version at #2), Morgana King, James Last, the Lennon Sisters, the Lettermen, the Patrick Linder and Thilo Wolf Big Band, Mantovani, Lena Martell, Al Martino, Paul Mauriat, Jane McDonald, Jim Nabors, Frank Sinatra, Jerry Vale, Bobby Vinton, Andy Williams, Taiwanese singer Tracy Huang (1980 with EMI) and Hong Kong artists, Nancy Sit (1967 with Crane Brand Records), Judy Jim Ë©πÂ∞èÂ±è (1969 with EMI Columbia Graphophone Company) & The Chopsticks (Sandra & Amina) (1970 with Crown Records). The Seekers also recorded a version of \\"This Is My Song\\" in 1967; however, the track was unreleased until 1995 when it was included on The Seekers - Complete box set. On the Seekers' Night of Nights...Live! release from 2002, \\"This Is My Song\\" follows \\"Ten Thousand Years Ago\\" - which only features the group's male members - to showcase Judith Durham as a solo vocalist. (accessed 2011-04-03); (accessed 2011-04-03). Foreign language covers of \\"This Is My Song\\" contemporary with the Petula Clark hit version include: the Czech rendering \\"Obra≈• Se S D≈Øvƒõrou\\" recorded by Helena Bleh√°rov√° (cs); the Dutch rendering \\"Sjungas till s√∂mns\\" recorded by Lize Marke to chart in Belgium (Flemish Region) at #26 (as a double A-side hit with \\"Lara's lied\\"); another Dutch rendering: \\"Daar Straalt Eeen Licht\\", recorded by the Netherlands-based group the Shephards; the Polish rendering \\"Moja Piosenka\\" recorded by Halina Kunicka (pl); and the Serbian rendering \\"Ljubav Je To\\" recorded by Senka Veletanliƒá. 1967 also saw at least thirteen recordings of renderings of \\"This Is My Song\\" made by artists local to Scandinavia (Denmark/ Finland/ Norway/ Sweden) beginning with the Swedish \\"En serenad till dig\\" introduced by Ann-Louise Hanson and also recorded by Gunnar Wiklund: other Scandinavian renderings included the Danish \\"Min sang till dig\\" recorded by both Gitte and Katy B√∏dtger and the Finnish \\"T√§m√§ on lauluni\\" recorded by Matti Heinivaho (fi). Contemporary covers of \\"C'est ma chanson\\" include those by Lucky Blondo (fr) and Mireille Mathieu while \\"Cara Felicit√†\\" was recorded by 15 Italian singers in 1967.Billboard vol 79 #16 (22 April 1967) p60 In Spain \\"Amor es mi cancion\\" had been recorded by Juan Bau, Dova, Gelu (es) and Los Javaloyas.

Antitrust portrays young idealistic programmers and a large corporation (NURV) that offers a significant salary, an informal working environment, and creative opportunities for those talented individuals willing to work for them. The charismatic CEO of NURV (Tim Robbins) seems to be good-natured, but new employee and protagonist Milo Hoffman (Ryan Phillippe) begins to unravel the terrible hidden truth of NURV's operation. The film stars Phillippe, Rachael Leigh Cook, Claire Forlani, and Robbins. Antitrust opened in the United States on January 12, 2001, and was generally panned by critics. Plot Working with his three friends at their new software development company Skullbocks, Stanford graduate Milo Hoffman is contacted by CEO Gary Winston of NURV (Never Underestimate Radical Vision) for a very attractive programming position: a fat paycheck, an almost-unrestrained working environment, and extensive creative control over his work. Accepting Winston's offer, Hoffman and his girlfriend, Alice Poulson (Forlani), move to NURV headquarters in Portland, Oregon. Despite development of the flagship product (Synapse, a worldwide media distribution network) being well on schedule, Hoffman soon becomes suspicious of the excellent source code Winston personally provides to him, seemingly when needed most, while refusing to divulge the code's origin. After his best friend, Teddy Chin, is murdered, Hoffman discovers that NURV is stealing the code they need from programmers around the world‚Äîincluding Chin‚Äîand then killing them to cover their tracks. Hoffman learns that not only does NURV employ an extensive surveillance system to observe and steal code, the company has infiltrated the Justice Department and most of the mainstream media. Even his girlfriend is a plant, an ex-con hired by the company to manipulate him. While searching through a secret NURV database containing surveillance dossiers on employees, he finds that the company has information of a very personal nature about a friend and co-worker, Lisa Calighan (Cook). When he reveals to her that the company has this information, she agrees to help him expose NURV's crimes to the world. Coordinating with Brian Bissel, one of Hoffman's friends from his old startup, they plan to use a local public-access television station to hijack Synapse and broadcast their charges against NURV to the world. However, Calighan turns out to be a double agent, foils Hoffman's plan, and turns him over to Winston. Hoffman had already confronted Poulson and convinced her to side with him against Winston and NURV. When it becomes clear that Hoffman has not succeeded, a backup plan is put into motion by Poulson, the fourth member of Skullbocks, and the incorruptible internal security firm hired by NURV. As Winston prepares to kill Hoffman, the second team successfully usurps one of NURV's own work centers‚Äî\\"Building 21\\"‚Äîand transmits the incriminating evidence as well as the Synapse code. Calighan, Winston and his entourage are publicly arrested for their crimes. After parting ways with the redeemed Poulson, Hoffman rejoins Skullbocks.

I'm not Bill! Similarly, Ebert felt NURV \\"seems a whole lot like Microsoft\\". Parallels between the fictional and real-world software giants were also drawn by Lisa Bowman of ZDNet UK, James Berardinelli of ReelViews, and Rita Kempley of The Washington Post. Microsoft spokesman Jim Cullinan said, \\"From the trailers, we couldn't tell if the movie was about or Oracle.\\" Production Principal photography for Antitrust took place in Vancouver, British Columbia, California, and Portland, Oregon. Stanley Park in Vancouver served as the grounds for Gary Winston's house, although the gate house at its entrance was faux. The exterior of Winston's house itself was wholly computer- generated; only the paved walkway and body of water in the background are physically present in the park.Howitt (commentary), 07:51 For later shots of Winston and Hoffman walking along a beach near the house, the CG house was placed in the background of Bowen Island, the shooting location.Howitt (commentary), 13:04 Catherine Hardwicke designed the interior sets for Winston's house, which featured several different units, or \\"pods\\", e.g., personal, work, and recreation units. No scenes take place in any of the personal areas, however; only public areas made it to the screen. While the digital paintings in Winston's home were created with green screen technology, the concept was based on technology that was already available in the real world. The characters even refer to Bill Gates' house which, in real life, had such art. The paintings which appeared for Hoffman were of a cartoon character, \\"Alien Kitty\\", developed by Floyd Hughes specifically for the film.Howitt (commentary), 1:16:37 Simon Fraser University served as an outdoor shooting location for NURV headquarters. Simon Fraser University's Burnaby campus stood in for external shots of NURV headquarters.Howitt (commentary), 17:28 UBC's Chan Centre for the Performing Arts served as an indoor shooting location and inspiration for NURV headquarters' \\"The Egg\\". The Chan Centre for the Performing Arts at the University of British Columbia (UBC) was used for several internal locations. The centre's foyer area became the NURV canteen; the set decoration for which was inspired by Apple's canteen, which the producers saw during a visit to their corporate headquarters.Howitt (commentary), 18:57 The inside of the Chan‚Äîused for concerts‚Äîserved as the shape for \\"The Egg\\", or \\"The NURV Center\\", where Hoffman's cubicle is located.Howitt (commentary), 19:30 Described as \\"a big surfboard freak\\" by director Peter Howitt, production designer Catherine Hardwicke surrounded \\"The Egg\\" set with surfboards mounted to the walls; Howitt has said, \\"The idea was to make NURV a very cool looking place.\\"Howitt (commentary), 20:23 Both sets for NURV's Building 21 were also on UBC's campus. The internal set was an art gallery on campus, while the exterior was built for the film on the university's grounds. According to Howitt, UBC students kept attempting to steal the Building 21 set pieces.Howitt (commentary), 51:06 Hoffman and Poulson's new home‚Äîa real house in Vancouver‚Äîwas a \\"very tight\\" shooting location and a very rigorous first week for shooting because, as opposed to a set, the crew could not move the walls.Howitt (commentary), 23:56 The painting in the living room is the product of a young Vancouver artist, and was purchased by Howitt as his first piece of art.Howitt (commentary), 01:10:23 The new Skullbocks office was a real loft, also in Vancouver, on Beatty Street.Howitt (commentary), 26:09 =Open source= Antitrusts pro‚Äìopen source story excited industry leaders and professionals, with the prospects of expanding the public's awareness and knowledge level of the availability of open-source software. The film heavily features Linux and its community, using screenshots of the Gnome desktop, consulting Linux professionals, and including cameos by Miguel de Icaza and Scott McNealy (the latter appearing in the film's trailers). Jon Hall, executive director of Linux International and consultant on the film, said \\"[Antitrust] is a way of bringing the concept of open source and the fact that there is an alternative to the general public, who often don't even know that there is one.\\" Despite the film's message about open source computing, MGM did not follow through with their marketing: the official website for Antitrust featured some videotaped interviews which were only available in Apple's proprietary QuickTime format. Reception Antitrust received mainly negative reviews, and has a \\"Rotten\\" consensus of 24% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 106 reviews, with an average score of 4 out of 10. The summary states \\"Due to its use of clich√©d and ludicrous plot devices, this thriller is more predictable than suspenseful. Also, the acting is bad.\\" The film also has a score of 31 out 100, based on 29 reviews, on Metacritic. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film two stars out of four. Linux.com appreciated the film's open-source message, but felt the film overall was lackluster, saying AntiTrust is probably worth a $7.50 ticket on a night when you've got nothing else planned.\\" James Keith La Croix of Detroit's Metro Times gave the film four stars, impressed that \\"Antitrust is a thriller that actually thrills.\\" The film won both the Golden Goblet for \\"Best Feature Film\\", and \\"Best Director\\" for Howitt, at the 2001 Shanghai International Film Festival.\\"Golden Goblet Winners\\" . 2001 Shanghai International Film Festival.

He was named the 50th greatest African player of all time by the African football expert Ed Dove. Early life Hadji was born in Ifrane Atlas-Saghir, Morocco. He emigrated with his family to France at the age of ten. Club career Hadji began playing football in France. He signed his first contract with AS Nancy, where he spent his first season as a youth player before joining the senior squad in his second year with the club. After playing five seasons for Nancy, Hadji joined Sporting Lisbon and then Deportivo la Coru√±a, but it was with Coventry City where he became well known, especially in Britain, after he was signed by Gordon Strachan in 1999. Hadji was a goal-scoring attacking midfielder with great pace and skill. At Coventry, he was joined by Moroccan international, Youssef Chippo, sparking a brief trend for City fans to wear fezzes to games in their honour. After Coventry were relegated in 2001, he joined local rivals Aston Villa, having scored against them three times in the previous season. But after only playing sporadically, scoring in the league against Southampton and Everton and once in the UEFA Cup against Varteks, he was released on a free transfer to Espanyol in Spain where he remained until June 2004. Hadji later played for Al Ain in the United Arab Emirates, where he remained for one year before returning to Europe. In 2005, he signed a two- year contract with Saarbr√ºcken in the German Second Division. At the request of the coach Horst Ehrmantraut, Hadji made a midfield pairing with another Moroccan international, Faysal El Idrissi. On 4 August 2005, Hadji made his d√©but for Saarbr√ºcken, on the first day of the 2. Bundesliga season, against Bochum, losing the match 4‚Äì0. After another defeat, Ehrmantraut was sacked. Rudi Bommer took over as coach and Saarbr√ºcken lost 2‚Äì1 after extra time in the second round of the German Cup against Unterhaching. Hadji scored to give his team the lead, but was sent off in the 85th minute and was suspended for three cup matches by the German Football Association. In August 2007, Hadji signed for Fola Esch, in Luxembourg's First Division. He ended his playing career in July 2010. International career At the 1994 FIFA World Cup, Hadji played in all three group games for Morocco, two as substitute. In Morocco's third game against the Netherlands, Hadji set up the equalizer for Hassan Nader with his first touch after coming on as substitute. Despite this, Morocco lost all three games and were eliminated. Hadji scored a great goal in Morocco's 2‚Äì2 draw with Norway in the 1998 FIFA World Cup but Morocco again failed to qualify for the knock-out stages. He was named African Footballer of the Year after the World Cup in France. He played in 13 FIFA World Cup qualification matches. Other projects Hadji was selected as an ambassador for the 2010 World Cup by FIFA to represent Africa. He is also involved in a partnership with plans to invest in Morocco, thus providing opportunities for the local people, to help rid poverty from his homeland. Hadji is also a supporter of the charity Show Racism The Red Card. He would have been ambassador for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, representing his country if Morocco had been selected as the host. Managerial career =Umm Salal= He was appointed as an assistant manager at Qatari club Umm Salal by the manager Bertrand Marchand in the 2012‚Äì13 Qatar Stars League. The whole staff was sacked after the team finished fifth and failed to qualify for the 2014 AFC Champions League. =Morocco= He was appointed as an assistant manager for the Morocco national team by manager Badou Ezzaki before the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations. Morocco withdrew as hosts following the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and were suspended from the tournament.

Biography Born in Newcraighall on the outskirts of Edinburgh, he was brought up initially by his maternal grandmother, Jean Beveridge; following her death, he lived with his father and paternal grandmother. He undertook his National Service in Egypt, where he met his lifelong friend, Peter Jewell. On returning to Britain, Douglas moved to London and began a career of acting and writing. After spending some time with Joan Littlewood's 'Theatre Workshop' company at the Theatre Royal Stratford East, he was cast in the Granada television series, The Younger Generation in 1961 and had a musical, Solo, produced in 1962 at Cheltenham. Filmmaking career Having been interested in film-making all his life, in 1969 Douglas enrolled at the London School of Film Technique, where he wrote the screenplay for a short autobiographical film called Jamie. After initial difficulties in finding support for the project, he eventually found a champion at the British Film Institute in the newly appointed head of Production, Mamoun Hassan, who secured funding on the basis that Jamie should form part one of a trilogy ‚Äì echoing the great childhood trilogies of Ray and Gorky. The film was renamed My Childhood, and its success on the international festival circuit paved the way for the second and third instalments of the trilogy of Douglas's formative years: My Ain Folk (1973) and My Way Home (1978). The Bill Douglas Trilogy recounts the harrowing experiences of a young boy, Jamie, growing up in material and emotional poverty with his brother and grandmother; followed by incarceration in a children's home, and then living in a hostel for down-and-outs. Eventually the call-up for national service allows Jamie to find freedom through his friendship with Robert, a young middle class Englishman who introduces him to books and the possibility of a more optimistic and fulfilling future. The austere black and white images of the films embody a stillness and intensity reminiscent of silent cinema and this visual style is augmented by the equally spare and precise use of sound. Just as the stillness of the image forces the audience to look, so the relative silence encourages greater attention to specific sounds ‚Äì boots scraping on asphalt, the chirping of birds and the timbre of voices ‚Äì granting an emotional power that many considered lost in the aural bombardment characterising much contemporary cinema. The Trilogy gained a wealth of critical plaudits but Douglas struggled to raise financing for his next project, and was forced to find other ways of earning a living. Mamoun Hassan, the former head of BFI Production, invited him to teach at the National Film and Television School from 1978 and he proved to be an inspiring presence. Hassan was also able, in his role as director of the National Film Finance Corporation to help realise the project of Comrades, Douglas's film about the 'Tolpuddle Martyrs', six Dorset farm labourers who in 1834 were arrested and tried for forming a trade union and subsequently transported to Australia. Even so, the film did not appear until 1986, six years after the screenplay had been completed. Dubbed a 'poor man's epic', Comrades continues Douglas's interest in the perseverance of the human spirit in the face of material adversity. It also brings to the fore his fascination with the world of optics and image-making, through a number of references to various forms of Victorian optical entertainments such as the magic lantern, the zoetrope, the peep show and the camera obscura. The story itself is mediated by the character of an itinerant magic lanternist who reappears in a number of roles. Comrades was to be Bill Douglas's last film. He died of cancer and is buried in the churchyard of Bishop's Tawton in Devon. He left behind him two unmade screenplays: Justified Sinner, an adaptation of James Hogg's celebrated novel The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner, and Flying Horse, based on the life of pre-cinema pioneer Eadweard Muybridge. Another posthumous script, Ring of Truth, written during a fellowship to Strathclyde University in 1990, was produced by BBC Scotland in 1995. Legacy Douglas's legacy was not confined to his films. Along with Peter Jewell (on whom Robert of the Trilogy was based), he was a voracious collector of books, memorabilia, and artefacts relating to the history and prehistory of cinema. This core collection formed the basis of The Bill Douglas Cinema Museum, formerly The Bill Douglas Centre for the History of Cinema and Popular Culture housed at the University of Exeter, when it opened six years after his death. The Bill Douglas Cinema Museum contains an exhibition on Bill Douglas's life and work and holds his working papers, which can be accessed by researchers. In 2012, the Glasgow Short Film Festival announced the inaugural Bill Douglas Award for their International Short Film Competition, named in his honour.

As a result of the riots, Northern Ireland's two main cities, Belfast and Derry, had become more segregated than before. Many neighbourhoods became entirely Irish nationalist or entirely unionist.

The germ cell of burgeoning nerdism is difference. The yearning to be understood, to find opportunities to share experiences, to not be left alone with one's bizarre interest. At the same time one derives an almost perverse pleasure from wallowing in this deficit. Nerds love deficiency: that of the other, but also their own. Nerds are eager explorers, who enjoy measuring themselves against one another and also compete aggressively. And yet the nerd's existence also comprises an element of the occult, of mystery. The way in which this power is expressed or focused is very important.Interview with Johannes Grenzfurthner about Traceroute, Boing Boing magazine; 14 April 2016 Grenzfurthner uses his personal history and upbringing as a source for his work.

It is roasted flour, usually barley flour and sometimes also wheat flour. It is usually mixed with the salty Tibetan butter tea. It is also eaten in Turkestan and Mongolia, where it is known as zamba. Preparation A bowl of unprepared tsampa, served on the table of a Tibetan restaurant in Chengdu, China. Tsampa is quite simple to prepare; indeed, it is known as a convenience food and often used by the Sherpas, nomads and other travellers. While traditional tsampa is prepared with tea, sometimes water or beer is used in its place. It may also be prepared as a porridge. Andr√© Migot described its preparation: Cultural significance A bowl of tsampa in the process of having yak butter tea blended in to produce tsampa dumplings or porridge. Besides constituting a substantial, arguably predominant part of the Tibetan diet, its prominence also derives from the tradition of throwing pinches of tsampa in the air during many Buddhist rituals. It is believed that tsampa-throwing actually predates Buddhist beliefs in the area and was originally used as an offering to animistic gods to request their protection. The tradition was consequently incorporated into Buddhism as a \\"mark of joy and celebration\\" used at celebratory occasions such as marriages and birthdays. Today it is particularly known in that regard for its use in New Year celebrations, where it is accompanied by chanted verses expressing the desire for good luck in the forthcoming year, for both oneself and others. Tsampa-throwing also occurs at most Buddhist funerals, where the action is intended to release the soul of the deceased. Tsampa is used in a number of other ways. Mashes of tsampa and cumin are sometimes applied to toothaches or other sore spots. Tsampa is also known among Tibetan sportsmen for its ability to provide rapid energy boosts; the roasting of the flour breaks it down to an easily digestible state, allowing the calories therein to be quickly incorporated by the body. Reflecting its foundational role in Tibetan culture, \\"Tsampa\\" is also the name of a Tibetan typeface.Tsampa Keyboard font Political significance The phrase \\"tsampa-eater\\" was used to promote a unified Tibetan identity. Whereas Tibetans speak various dialects, worship in different sects, and live in different regions, all Tibetans were thought to eat tsampa. In 1957, the India-based Tibet Mirror addressed a letter to \\"all tsampa-eaters\\", encouraging them to participate in what would become the 1959 Tibetan Rebellion. Recently, with the rise of the Tibetan diaspora, less emphasis has been placed on tsampa and more emphasis on Tibetan Buddhism in constructing a unified Tibetan identity.

The Indian glassy fish has an extraordinarily transparent body, revealing its bones and internal organs; the male develops a dark edge to the dorsal fin. The fish grows to a maximum overall length of . It occurs in standing water, especially in impoundments, and it breeds prolifically during the rainy season. The species feeds on crustaceans, annelid worms, and other invertebrates. It is, in turn, prey for larger fish, including snakeheads (family Channidae). The Indian glassy fish is not important as a food fish for humans, but is very common in the aquarium trade. Formerly classified as Chanda ranga, the species is also known as the Indian glassfish, Indian glass perch, and Siamese glassfish. In the aquarium Glassfish have been kept in aquarium for many years, but have a reputation for being delicate and difficult to keep.

United States (1919), and overruled Whitney v. California (1927), which had held that speech that merely advocated violence could be made illegal. Under the imminent lawless action test, speech is not protected by the First Amendment if the speaker intends to incite a violation of the law that is both imminent and likely. While the precise meaning of \\"imminent\\" may be ambiguous in some cases, the court provided later clarification in Hess v. Indiana (1973) in which the court found that Hess's words did not fall outside the limits of protected speech, in part, because his speech \\"amounted to nothing more than advocacy of illegal action at some indefinite future time,\\"Hess v.

Popiah is often eaten in the Fujian province of China (usually in Xiamen) and its neighbouring Chaoshan (and by the Teochew and Hoklo diaspora in various regions throughout Southeast Asia) and in Taiwan (due to the majority of Taiwanese being Hoklo), during the Qingming Festival. The origin of popiah dates back to the 17th century. Etymology In the Chaoshan dialect, popiah is pronounced as /po îÀ©pi√£À•Àß/ (), which means \\"thin wafer\\". In varieties of Hokkien, it is also commonly referred to as /lunÀ©pi√£À•Àß/ (), which is the etymological origin of \\"lumpia\\" in Indonesia and the Philippines. It is referred to as r√πnb«êng () or b√°ob«êng () in Mandarin, and also as b√≥p√≠ju«én (). Wrapper and fillings A popiah \\"skin\\" () is a soft, thin paper-like crepe or pancake made from wheat flour. The method of producing the wrapper involves making an extremely wet and viscous dough. A ball of this dough is held to the right hand, then quickly \\"rubbed\\" (Êì¶ÊΩ§È§ÖÁöÆ, Hokkien: chhat j≈´n-pi√°‚Åø ph√™, literally \\"to rub a lumpia crepe\\") against a hot steel plate in a circular fashion, and lifted. Through this process, a very thin layer of the wet dough adheres to the plate and begins to cook. The upper surface of the crepe is then usually cleaned of excess pieces of dough using the dough ball through a dabbing process. Description: A beginner learning the proper techniques and tricks of how to \\"rub\\" a popiah crepe. When the dough has been cooked to completion, it is peeled off of the hot steel plate before being removed. The rubbing is typically done over two or three plates at once, which allows the baker to continuously produce crepes and gives the proper time for each crepe to be properly cooked. A popiah vendor in Keelung, Taiwan. Popiah crepes are produced through \\"rubbing\\" (foreground) and then filled and rolled (background) It is eaten in accompaniment with a sweet sauce (often a bean sauce), a blended soy sauce or hoisin sauce or a shrimp paste sauce (hae-ko, ), and optionally with hot chilli sauce before it is filled. The filling is mainly finely grated and steamed or stir-fried turnip, jicama (known locally as bangkuang), which has been cooked with a combination of other ingredients such as bean sprouts, French beans, and lettuce leaves, depending on the individual vendor, along with grated carrots, slices of Chinese sausage, thinly sliced fried tofu, chopped peanuts or peanut powder, fried shallots, and shredded omelette. Other common variations of popiah include pork (lightly seasoned and stir-fried), shrimp or crab meat. Seaweed is often included in the Xiamen versions. Some hawkers in Malaysia and Singapore, especially in non-halal settings, will add fried pork lard. As a fresh spring roll, the popiah skin itself is not fried. Two common ways of eating this are holding them like a burrito, which some prefer, while others cut the popiah roll into slices and pick them up with chopsticks. Types In mainland China, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia there are \\"popiah parties\\" at home, where the ingredients are laid out and guests make their own popiah with proportions ingredients to their own personal liking. =Taiwanese= Ingredients for making a popiah in Taiwan In Taiwan, popiah is called runbing () in Mandarin (j≈´n-pi√°nn(-kauh) in Taiwanese Hokkien). The stuffing itself is quite diverse among different places. The basic stuffing includes vegetables that grow in spring, meat and thinly shredded omelette. In some places, they also add noodles, Chinese sausages, stewed vegetables instead of blanched ones, tofu, seafood, sticky rice, and so on. Furthermore, the way of cooking the stuffing is very different as well. In northern Taiwan, the stuffing is flavoured, stir-fired, sometimes it goes with peanut powder, and the sauce is salty. In southern Taiwan, the popiah stuffing is water blanched without additional seasoning, and flavoured primarily with sugar and peanut powder. For people who live in southern Taiwan, the addition of sufficient sugar is key for popiah. Moreover, some people like to heat or steam the spring roll again after it is made. =Southeast Asia= In Malaysia and Singapore, popiah is part of Chinese cuisine of these two countries. However, in both countries, as well as in Brunei, popiah especially the fried variant is also popular as part of local street food. In Vietnam, b√≤ b√≠a is the Vietnamese variant of popiah, introduced by Teochew immigrants. It is common to see an old Teochew man or woman selling b√≤ b√≠a at their roadside stand. In Thai cuisine, two types of popia () are popular: popia sot (fresh spring roll) and popia thot (deep-fried spring roll). In addition, Thai cuisine has also incorporated the Vietnamese summer roll under the name kuaitiao lui suan (). While in Burma/Myanmar, it is known as kawpyan (·ÄÄ·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∫·Äï·Äº·Äî·Ä∑·Ä∫). Similar foods in other cuisines include the Indonesian Lumpia Basah and the Filipino lumpiang sariwa spring rolls which are served with peanut sauce, etymologically derived from the Hokkien name Lum Pia.

Adam Adami, O.S.B. (1603 or 1610 ‚Äì 19 February 1663) was a German monk, diplomat and priest. Born in M√ºlheim am Rhein, Adami seems to have made his first studies in Cologne. At the age of 19, he entered the Benedictine abbey of Brauweiler and occupied himself with theology and law studies. In 1633, he received the ordination to priesthood, one year later he became rector of the Benedictine seminary in Cologne, where he also acquired a doctorate in theology. In 1637 he followed a call to the abbey of St. Jacob in Mainz, where he served as prior and acquired a good reputation as a diplomat. In the following year, Adami was elected to become prior of the monastery of Murhart. Murhart, like many surrounding abbeys, was subject of an administrative dispute between the Diocese of W√ºrzburg and the dukes of W√ºrttemberg. Adami was chosen because he was expected to be able to best defend the rights of the abbeys in the years to come, during and following the Peace of Westphalia. Therefore he was sent in 1643 as the envoy of the restituted monasteries and chapels of Swabia to the peace negotiations. During the negotiations, his legitimation as envoy was disputed, but he could obtain a second authorisation from the prince-abbot of Korvei. Adami's records of the proceedings of the negotiations are today the primary source of information on the Peace of Westphalia. He belonged to \\"Trimuvirate\\" of Franz Wilhelm von Wartenberg and Johann_von_Leuchselring to the group of Catholic maximalists against Trauttmansdorff and the Emperor. From his point of view, the negotiations failed, though. Later he was sent to Rome by the Prince-elector and archbishop of Cologne, Maximilian Henry of Bavaria. With a recommendation from the former papal legate Fabio Chigi, Pope Innocent X appointed Adami as titular bishop of Hierapolis. Maximilian Henry also offered him the post as suffragan bishop of Hildesheim out of gratitude. Adami served in Hildesheim until his death there, while publishing several tracts on national law.

During the next 25 years, he became famous throughout South Africa, where his schools have taught almost a million pupils of all races. Smith also won the 'Teacher of the Year' award. In 1990, Smith began producing The Learning Channel educational television programmes with the financial backing of Hylton Appelbaum, then executive director of the Liberty Life Foundation. As a result of his work on this programme, Smith was voted as one of the top three presenters on South African television in 1998. Other achievements Smith is also a renowned conservationist and owned the Featherbed Nature Reserve in Knysna, where he lived until the sale of the land and company in 2004. He was also the owner of 'Rivercat Ferries', which has several craft that cruise in the Knysna lagoon and out to sea. He appeared along with Jeremy Mansfield in the popular South African television quiz show, A Word or 2. Smith was also a judge for the Miss South Africa Pageant in 1998 and 1999. Smith was voted 86th in the Top 100 Great South Africans in 2004. In 2019 he was awarded the Order of the Baobab (silver) in recognition of his services to teaching and the \\"demystification of mathematics and science\\".

With a population of around 60,000, the town is the second largest in the Ostalb district and the whole East W√ºrttemberg region after Aalen. The town is a Gro√üe Kreisstadt since 1956, i.e. a chief town under district administration; it was the administrative capital of its own rural district until the local government reorganisation on 1 January 1973. There are some institutions of higher education in the city, most notably the P√§dagogische Hochschule Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd (University of Education Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd) and the Landesgymnasium f√ºr Hochbegabte (State Highschool for gifted children). Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd was a self-ruling free imperial city from the 13th century until its annexation to W√ºrttemberg in 1802. Geography Market place on a spring day Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd is situated within the northern foothills of the Swabian Jura Mountains on the Rems river, about east of the state capital Stuttgart. It marks the place where the Josefsbach (Waldstetter-bach) meets the River Rems. The municipal area comprises the localities (Ortschaften) of Bargau, Bettringen, Degenfeld, Gro√üdeinbach, Herlikofen, Hussenhofen, Lindach, Rechberg, Rehnenhof-Wetzgau, Stra√üdorf, and Weiler. History From about AD 85, the Neckar-Odenwald line was part of the northern frontier of the Roman Empire. The Romans built the Limes Germanicus to secure this border; i.e., a line of fortifications at regular distances, which included a small castrum on the site of the present- day Schirenhof field in Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd. A first major settlement in this area arose around the 2nd century AD, when Roman soldiers were deployed near the Upper Germanic limes. From 223 onward, the border lines were assaulted and taken by the Alemanni, who settled down in the areas abandoned by the Romans. In the 8th century a counterfeit document in the name of Charlemagne, prepared at the Abbey of St Denis near Paris, mentioned a monastic cell called Gamundias built by Abbot Fulrad of St Denis. Whether or not this refers to Gm√ºnd is uncertain. There are no archaeological indications of a cell of this type in Gm√ºnd. Territory of Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd, c. 1750 Panorama of Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd, c. 1750 The town of Gm√ºnd was first mentioned in an 1162 deed issued at nearby Lorch Abbey, then under the rule of the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick Barbarossa. The self-proclaimed Stauferstadt achieved the status of an Imperial City in 1268, which it held until 1802, when it was mediatised to the Electorate of W√ºrttemberg. By the end of the 14th century, the name \\"Etzel castle\\" was used for the remains of the Roman fort, which had been built to protect the Neckar-Odenwald border of the Roman Empire. In a Baroque chronicle of the city of Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd, written by the councillor Friedrich Vogt (1623‚Äì1674), the \\"Castle\\" was mentioned in ancient writings as \\"Etzel castle\\". Even at the time of Vogt, the Roman remains were cheaper than stones from quarry, and these were thus removed to the ground. Only parts of the moat would still be visible. The demesne officer, wine expert and archaeologist Carl Friedrich Christoph Gok (1776‚Äì1849), a half brother of the poet Friedrich H√∂lderlin, suspected in 1847, that the alleged castle on the Schirenhof manor had probably once been a Roman fort.Hans Ulrich Nuber: Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd in fr√ºhgeschichtlicher Zeit. In: Geschichte der Stadt Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd. Konrad Theiss Verlag, Stuttgart 1984, , S. 26. The first modern and scientific excavations took place under the guidance of retired army chief of staff of the W√ºrttemberg army, General Eduard von Kallee and by Major Heinrich Steimle in the years 1886 to 1888, i.e. before the Empire-Limes-Commission (Reichslimeskommision) had been set up. The so-called Schirenhof Castrum is now part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Limes Germanicus. =U.S. Army= From 1963 to November 1968, the United States Army's 56th Field Artillery Group, equipped with Pershing missiles, was headquartered at the Hardt Kaserne along with A and D batteries of the 4th Battalion, 41st Artillery. Headquarters & Headquarters Battery then moved down the hill to the Bismarck Kaserne in November 1968. Family housing and the commissary were across the street from the Hardt Kaserne and overlooked a hill above Bismarck Kaserne. There was a school for military dependents (Kindergarten through eighth grade) within walking distance of the family housing. Teachers at this school were credentialed U.S. educators employed by USAREUR (United States Army Europe). In the late 1950s and early 1960s, there were also two local civilians employed to teach the German language (Herr Geis) and German song and dance (Frau Kn√∂pfle). The Hardt Kaserne, formerly Adolf Hitler Kaserne, which was finished in 1937 and used to train officers for the war, was later home to the 4th Battalion, then in 1972 reactivated as 1st battalion 41st Field Artillery, Headquarters, B, C and Service Batteries, Headquarters and Headquarters Battery 56th Field Artillery Brigade, and A Company, 55th Support Battalion. The brigade command had four additional support units: an aviation company, a signal battalion, an infantry battalion, and a forward support battalion. In 1986 the name of the brigade was changed to 56th Field Artillery Command (Pershing). In March 1955 the 6th Field Artillery Battery arrived from Fort Bragg, NC. This was an Honest John missile battery. A medical battalion and the 567th field artillery battalion (155 mm self-propelled) of the 9th Infantry Division were already there. The 3d Battalion, 17th Field Artillery was stationed at Hardt Kaserne until late 1963. The unit's mission was reinforcing fire for the 7th Army Light and medium Artillery units. The 8\\", M-55 Howitzer (SP) was considered the most accurate weapon in the Army's arsenal. In 1957 The 2 Battalion 16thField Artillery, 4th Armored Division was stationed in Bismark Karserne from 1957 through 1962. =Spring 2016 Storm= On some of the last days of May 2016, a major storm that hit parts of France and southwestern Germany resulted in extensive flooding and damage to Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd and the death of two people in the town.  Notable structures  The Rathaus of Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd as of 1 July 2017 Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd is home to many historically structures and buildings. These include fortifications and civic and religious buildings. The Altes Rathaus of Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd as pictured in the town chronicle of Dominikus Debler. = The Rathaus (Town Hall) = Sitting at the south end of the Marktplatz there lies the Rathaus. Before becoming the town hall, the Rathaus was the Debler patrician house and was originally constructed by city architect Johann Michael Keller. In fact, Dominikus Debler, remembered for his work writing the town chronicle, spent his childhood there. However, in 1793 a fire destroyed much of the city between Kornhaus and the Kl√∂sterle, leaving city leadership concerned for the safety of the old town hall. The Altes Rathaus (Old Town Hall) was a fachwerk structure reminiscent of Kornhaus that stood between the Marienbr√ºnnen and the present-day Rathaus. Both the initial construction of the building and the conversion of the Debler patrician house into the Rathaus were undertaken by Johann Michael Keller. The Altes Rathaus was deconstructed in two weeks and the only remaining artifacts that can be found on the present-day Rathaus are two of the bells on the bell tower and the clock face. The M√ºnster as seen from the south window on the tower of the Johanniskirche = The Holy Cross Minster = The east of the Johanneskirche as seen from the Marktplatz The Holy Cross Minster () is the city's main Catholic church. It stands on the site of a former, much smaller romanesque church. It took about 500 years to be completed, though not consecutively. Initial construction began around 1325 under the leadership of an unknown master builder on what was left of the previous romanesque church, the towers of which were still standing. In 1497, the south tower fell onto the north tower, which knocked over the north tower after a bow connecting the two was removed and in 1515, all repair work was finished. = The Church of Saint John = Sitting on the southeast of the Marktplatz (only 78 meters northeast of the Rathaus), there lies a late Romanesque and neo-Romanesque church called the Johanneskirche, or Church of Saint John, also a Catholic church. As the story of its founding goes, Agnes of Hohenstaufen was out hunting in the Remstal one day and she lost her wedding band. She vowed to have a church built at the site where it would be recovered. Later, the ring was found in the antlers of a fallen stag at the site where the church now sits, and accordingly, Agnes commissioned the construction of the church. A cannonball fired during the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) remains visibly lodged in the apse of the church. Institutions The University of Maryland University College opened a four-year German campus on the Bismarck Kaserne in 1992, which closed in 2002 due to financial difficulties and a lack of students. Festival Europ√§ische Kirchenmusik was established in 1989. In 2004, the state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg opened the Landesgymnasium f√ºr Hochbegabte (State Grammar School for the Highly Gifted) in some of the renovated buildings of the Bismarck Kaserne.Landesgymnasium f√ºr Hochbegabte Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd One of the oldest universities in the town is the Hochschule f√ºr Gestaltung Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd, a design school established in 1776. University of Education Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd main campus The P√§dagogische Hochschule Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd, also known as the University of Education Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd, was established in 1825 and is one of six universities in Baden-W√ºrttemberg that were established for the sole purpose of educating upcoming teachers. The European Academy of Surface Technology (EAST) is a scientific and technological institute on surface finishing and electroplating has its headquarters in the city since 1989. EAST grants annually the Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd Prize for young scientists since 2017, in honor to the local tradition of craftsmanship of precious metals. Local industry Since the 17th century, Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd has been home to producers of gold and silver handicrafts. An almost forgotten craft was the so-called \\"Silberporzellan\\", \\"Metallporzellan\\" or \\"Silberbelagwaren\\". Today it is known as Silver overlay and Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd was home of inventor Friedrich Deusch who began to decorate not only porcelain but also glass with this unique technique in the end of 19th century. All the important items which are dealt on the art market today are originated in Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd. The town is also home to the Forschungsinstitut f√ºr Edelmetalle und Metallchemie, an institute for precious metal work and surface technology. Other important industries include automotive suppliers like Robert Bosch Automotive Steering, manufacturers of machinery and glass, and a large subsidiary of the Swiss toiletries and medicine producer Weleda.See Weleda (Unternehmen) on the German Wikipedia Notable people Johannes Scherr * Juri Herter (born 1987), politician * Peter Parler (c. 1330‚Äì1399), architect * Hans Judenk√∂nig (c. 1450‚Äì1526), lutenist * Jerg Ratgeb (c. 1480‚Äì1526), painter * Hans Baldung (1484/85‚Äì1545), painter * Veit Warbeck (c. 1490‚Äì1534), scientist and diplomat * Jakob Woller (c. 1510‚Äì1564), sculptor * August Franz Josef Karl Mayer (1787-1865), physician, anatomist and physiologist * Emanuel Leutze (1816‚Äì1868), history painter * Johannes Scherr (1817‚Äì1886), novelist and literary critic * Hermann Pleuer (1863-1911), Impressionist and landscape artist * Robert von Ostertag (1864-1940), veterinarian * Emil Molt (1876-1936), businessman, social reformer and anthroposophist * Hermann Weller (1878-1956), Indiologist and neo-Latin poet * Alfred Haag (1904‚Äì1982), politician * Lina Haag (1907‚Äì2012), anti-Fascist activist * Theodor Schwenk (1910‚Äì1986), anthroposophist, engineer and pioneering water researcher * Karl Ramsayer (1911‚Äì1982), geodesist * Albert B√ºrger (1913‚Äì1996), Luftwaffe officer and fireman * Karl Leiberich (1920-2012), Army Officer * Hartmut Esslinger (born 1944), Industrial designer * Norbert Barthle (born 1952), politician * Michael Braungart (born 1958), chemist * Aron Strobel (born 1958), lead guitarist for M√ºnchener Freiheit * Richard Arnold (born 1959), politician * Uwe Messerschmidt (born 1962), track cyclist and road bicycle racer * Biljana Seƒçivanoviƒá (born 1976), Serbian pop- folk singer * Simon Tischer (born 1982), volleyball player * Andreas Hofmann (born 1986), football player * Daniel H√§gele (born 1989), football player * Julian Grupp (born 1991), football player * Carina Vogt (born 1992), ski jumper Twin towns ‚Äì sister cities Imperial Eagle and unicorn coat of arms on display at the town hall Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd is twinned with: * Barnsley, United Kingdom, since 1971 * Antibes, France, since 1976 * Bethlehem, United States, since 1991 * Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r, Hungary, since 1991 * Faenza, Italy, since 2001 References External links * * Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd Live Webcam * Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd ‚Äî The oldest Staufertown * Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd portal, links, image gallery, artists * Wikisource (German) - some hundred of PD texts Category:1802 disestablishments Category:States and territories established in 1268 Category:Towns in Baden-W√ºrttemberg Category:Ostalbkreis Category:W√ºrttemberg ","title":"Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd"},{"id":"1152703","text":"Torqabeh (, also Romanized as ≈¢orqabeh, ≈¢oroqbeh, and Torqebeh; also known as Targhobeh) is a city and capital of Torqabeh and Shandiz County, in Razavi Khorasan Province, Iran.

Overview Rules of Play expresses the perspective that a theoretical framework for interactive design has not yet been established. This is not the first time this has been recognized or explored, but is explored in a fresh way in great detail - with one review stating that: \\"the book manages to bridge the emerging field of game studies methodologies and design theory\\". Another review was also positive: \\"And if you already are a game designer? In this case, you stand a good chance of becoming a better game designer. Your perception of the internal workings of games will be heightened. You will see structure where before you saw chaos. You will see possibilities where before you saw dead ends. You will see opportunities for meaningful play in every nook and cranny of the game you are working on right now.\\" The book is divided into four units, first introducing core concepts, then expanding on these with a detailed discussion of rules, play and culture. =Unit 1: Core Concepts= * Meaningful play - The authors introduce the concept of meaningful play as the goal of successful game design, providing their own definitions. * Design - The authors discuss definitions of design, and introduce their own. They go on to discuss semiotics, the study of meaning, describing Charles Sanders Peirce's semiotic elements. * Systems - The authors introduce four elements all systems share, as defined by Stephen Littlejohn in his textbook Theories of Human Communication, and go on to identify each of these elements in the game of chess, when framed as a formal (mathematical), experiential (social), or cultural (representational) system. * Interactivity - The authors connect interactivity with the concepts introduced thus far, and identify various modes of interactivity, citing examples of cognitive, functional, explicit, and \\"beyond-the-object\\" interactivity. * Defining Games - The authors discuss the relationship between play and games, highlight existing definitions of a game, and provide their own intentionally narrow definitions of games and game design. * Defining Digital Games - The authors insist that \\"the underlying properties of games and the core challenges of game design hold true regardless of the medium in which a game manifests,\\" but they do identify four traits that are particularly strong in digital games: Immediate but narrow interactivity, the manipulation of information, automated complex systems, and networked communication. * The Magic Circle - The authors borrow the term magic circle from the book Homo Ludens by Johan Huizinga, using it to describe the space within which a game takes place. They explain how players enter into the magic circle by adopting a lusory attitude, another borrowed term, taken from Bernard Suits' book Grasshopper: Games, Life, and Utopia. =Unit 2: Rules= * Defining Rules * Rules on Three Levels * The Rules of Digital Games * Games as Emergent Systems * Games as Systems of Uncertainty * Games as Information Theory Systems * Games as Systems of Information * Games as Cybernetic Systems * Games as Game Theory Systems * Games as Systems of Conflict * Breaking the Rules =Unit 3: Play= * Defining Play * Games as the Play of Experience * Games as the Play of Pleasure * Games as the Play of Meaning * Games as Narrative Play * Games as the Play of Simulation * Games as Social Play =Unit 4: Culture= * Defining Culture * Games as Cultural Rhetoric * Games as Open Culture * Games as Cultural Resistance * Games as Cultural Environment Guest contributions The book is punctuated by guest contributions, including one essay and four commissioned games, each discussed alongside various prototype materials. * Foreword: Frank Lantz * Commissioned Essay: Reiner Knizia * Unit 1: Commissioned Game: Richard Garfield * Unit 2: Commissioned Game: Frank Lantz * Unit 3: Commissioned Game: Kira Snyder * Unit 4: Commissioned Game: James Ernest See also * List of books on computer and video games References  External links  * Official MIT Press website, featuring a couple of downloadable chapters and a Table of Contents Category:2003 non-fiction books Category:Books about video games Category:MIT Press books ","title":"Rules of Play"},{"id":"1152717","title":"Powerage"},{"id":"1152729","text":"Katie Salen during Union Square Adventures in March 2009 Katie Salen Tekinbas is a game designer, animator, and educator.

Several of its highest peaks have snow all year long, and during clear weather, they are visible to a large percentage of those who live on the many high plateaus from which these volcanoes rise. History The Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt spans across Central-Southern Mexico from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico between 18¬∞30'N and 21¬∞30'N, resting on the southern edge of the North American Plate. This approximately 1000 kilometer long, 90‚Äì230 km broad structure is an east‚Äìwest, active, continental volcanic arc; encompassing an area of approximately 160,000 km2. Over several million years, the subduction of the Rivera and Cocos plates beneath the North American Plate along the northern end of the Middle America Trench formed the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. The Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt is a unique volcanic belt; it is not parallel to the Middle American Trench, and many of the main stratovolcanoes are positioned obliquely to the general position of the arc. In addition to the physiographic complexities, igneous compositions vary‚Äîdominant subduction related products contrast with intraplate geo- chemical signatures. The many intriguing aspects of the belt has spurred several hypotheses based on a typical subduction scenario; Intra-plate leaky transform faults, mantle plumes, continental rifting, and jump of the eastward Pacific Rise. These features are partially related to the reactivation of early fault systems during the Trans-Mexican Volcanic belt's evolution. The main brittle fault system's geometry, kinematics, and age define a complex array of what could be multiple factors affecting the deformation of the belt. It exhibits many volcanic features, not limited to large stratovolcanoes, including monogenetic volcano cones, shield volcanoes, lava dome complexes, and major calderas. Geologic framework Major Volcanoes of Mexico. From west to east, volcanoes part of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic belt are Nevado de Colima, Par√≠cutin, Popocat√©petl, and Pico de Orizaba. Prior to the formation of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, an older, but related volcanic belt, the Sierra Madre Occidental occupied the area. Resuming in the Eocene, post- Laramide deformation, subduction related volcanism formed the Sierra Madre Occidental silic volcanic arc at a paleo-subduction zone off the coast of Baja California, before the peninsula rifted away. From the Late Eocene to the Middle Miocene, counterclockwise rotation of the volcanic arc transitioned the once active Sierra Madre Occidental to a now active Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. By the Middle Miocene, the transition from the silicic to more mafic compositions was complete, and can be considered the beginning of the Trans- Mexican Volcanic Belt. Due to the orthogonal orientation of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt in relation to the trend of Mexican tectonic provinces, its Pre- Cretaceous basement is highly heterogeneous. The Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt east of 101¬∞W rests upon Precambrian terranes, assembled into the Oaxaquia microcontinent and on the Paleozoic Mixteco terrane. West of 101¬∞W, the Trans- Mexican Volcanic Belt resides on top of the Guerro composite terrane - a make up of Jurassic to Cretaceous marine marginal arcs, which are built on Triassic - Early Jurassic siliclastic turbidites. Assemblage of these basement rocks results with a thickness of 50‚Äì55 km east of 101¬∞W and 35‚Äì40 km west of 101¬∞W. Plate evolution The subducting plates originated from the breakup of the Farallon Plate at approximately 23 Ma, which created two plates at equatorial latitudes, the Cocos Plate and southern Nazca Plate. The Rivera Plate was the last fragment detached from the Cocos Plate, becoming a microplate at around 10 Ma. This small plate is bounded by the Rivera fracture zone, the East Pacific Rise, the Tamayo fracture zone, and the Middle American Trench. The larger Cocos Plate is bordered by the North American Plate (NAM) and the Caribbean Plate to the northeast, the Pacific Plate to the west, and to the south by the Nazca Plate. The Cocos and Rivera are relatively young oceanic plates (25 and 10 Ma) that are subducting along the Middle American Trench at different convergence rates (Rivera = ~30 mm/yr and the Cocos = ~ 50‚Äì90 mm/yr). Commonly found subduction related rocks such as calc-alkaline rocks volumetrically occupy a majority of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt but smaller volumes of intraplate-like lavas, potassium rich rocks, and adakites are associated with the area. Middle Miocene adakitic (more felsic) rocks are found furthest from the trench and along the volcanic front of the central Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt during the Pliocene-Quaternary. It has been suggested that slab melting contributed to the adakitic imprint on the Trans- Mexican Volcanic Belt, prompted by the prolonged flat subduction of the Cocos Plate. Belt evolution =Formation= thumb530pxVolcanic Evolution and changes in composition over time. 1) Early to Late Miocene the belt the Cocos and Rivera plate begin subduction beneath Central Mexico. 2) Late Miocene to Early Pliocene the slab tear begins to propagate West to East across the back northern area of the belt, allowing Asthenospheric heat in to generate the Mafic episode. 3)Latest Miocene - Early Pliocene was the onset of more silic volcanics generated by Flat Slab Subduction which pushed the belt further inland to the north. 4)Late Pliocene to Holocene is characterized by slab rollback sending the volcanic arc trenchward to the present day position * 1) From the early to mid Miocene ~20 to 8 Ma, the initial Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt volcanic arc consisted of intermediate effusive volcanism, producing andesitic and dacitic polygenetic volcanoes extending from western Michoacan (longitude 102¬∞W) to the Palma Sola area (longitude 98¬∞30'). The plate boundary geometry and sub-horizontal subducting slab's thermal structure are the controlling factors for initial arc volcanism. Magmatism migrated away from the trench, moving northeast towards the Gulf of Mexico‚Äîgiving the arc its characteristic E-W orientation, the inland push of the arc showed progressively drier melting, and eventually slab melting began to occur‚Äîsuggesting flattening of the subducted slab. The oldest rocks of this age may be exposed near the modern volcanic front, in Central Mexico. * 2) A Late Miocene ~11 Ma eastward traveling pulse of mafic volcanism swept across the whole of Central Mexico, north of the previously formed arc, ending ~ 3 Ma. The onset of the mafic lavas indicates lateral propagation of slab tear, prompted by the end of subduction beneath Baja California, allowing the influx of asthenosphere into the mantle wedge. This volcanism created basaltic plateaus through fissures, or less commonly, small shield volcanoes and lava cones, with diminishing lava volume eastward. * 3) West of 103¬∞W, silicic volcanism between 7.5 and 3.0 Ma became bimodal (mafic-silicic) in the early Pliocene, creating large dome complexes and ignimbrites, and marked the beginning of trenchward migration of volcanism. East of 101¬∞W dome complexes, lava flows, and large calderas that produced significant quantities of ignimbrites (>50 km3) of dacitic to rhyolitic composition can be found dating between 7.5 and 6 Ma. There is an absence of silicic volcanism between these regions during the whole Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt history. Since the late Miocene, silicic volcanism migrated trenchward over 200 km in the eastern sector (east of 101¬∞W) and 100 km in the western sector (West of 103¬∞W). * 4) Since the late Pliocene, the style and composition of volcanism in the Trans- Mexican Volcanic Belt became more diverse. In several areas, volumetrically dominant calc-alkaline rocks are associated with modest volumes of intraplate- like lavas or other potassium rich rocks, accompanied by Quaternary rhyolitic peralkaline rocks. This modern arc consists of a frontal belt dominated by flux and slab melting and a rear belt characterized by the differentiated rocks stated previously. Absent since ~9 Ma, stratovolcanoes began to be created in the last 1 Ma ~100 km behind the volcanic front in the Western Sector, oriented West - Northwest and East - Southeast. In the eastern sector, all stratovolcanoes are found within the volcanic front. One exception to the location of these stratovolcanoes is the Colima volcanic complex, which is positioned south of the southern tip of the Cocos and Rivera slab tear and is the largest volcanic edifice in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. In addition to stratovolcanoes, monogenetic volcanic fields are also characteristic for this episode, the most prominent being the Michoac√°n‚ÄìGuanajuato volcanic field. =Cause of flat slab subduction= Flat slab subduction can commonly be explained by oceanic plateau subduction and a fast overriding plate. Central Mexico's flat subduction is not evident. The Trans-Mexican Volcanic belt's flat slab is confined between ~101¬∞W and 96¬∞W; this region may be explained by thicker continental crust. Existence of thick strong crust combined with decreasing fluid input contributed to narrowing the asthenospheric wedge, increasing viscosity and suction forces, which led to flat subduction‚Äîpreventing the oceanic plate from entering the mantle. Geography =Region= From the west, the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt runs from Colima and Jalisco east through northern Michoac√°n, southern Guanajuato, southern Quer√©taro, M√©xico State, southern Hidalgo, the Distrito Federal, northern Morelos, Puebla, and Tlaxcala, to central Veracruz. The Mexican Plateau lies to the north, bounded by the Sierra Madre Occidental to the west and Sierra Madre Oriental to the east. The Cofre de Perote and Pico de Orizaba volcanoes, in Puebla and Veracruz, mark the meeting of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt with the Sierra Madre Oriental. To the south, the basin of the Balsas River lies between the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and the Sierra Madre del Sur. This area is also a distinct physiographic province of the larger Sierra Madre System physiographic division. The Sierra de Ajusco- Chichinauhtzin also forms part of the belt. =Peaks= Pico de Orizaba The highest point, also the highest point in Mexico, is Pico de Orizaba () also known as Citlalt√©petl, located at . This, and several of the other high peaks, are active or dormant volcanoes. Other notable volcanoes in the range include (from west to east) Nevado de Colima (), Par√≠cutin (), Nevado de Toluca (), Popocat√©petl (), Iztacc√≠huatl (), Matlalcueitl () Cofre de Perote () and Sierra Negra, a companion of the Pico de Orizaba (). Ecology The mountains are home to the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt pine-oak forests, one of the Mesoamerican pine-oak forests sub-ecoregions. The Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt has many endemic species, including the Transvolcanic jay (Aphelocoma ultramarina).

Kuchum Khan's attempt to spread Islam and his cross-border raids met with vigorous opposition from the Russian Tsar Ivan the Terrible (reigned 1547‚Äì1584), who sent a force of Cossacks to confront him head-on (c. 1580). Kuchum is particularly noted for the vigorous resistance he offered to the Russian invaders. Background Kuchum was the son of prince Mortaza from the Shayban dynasty (≈û√§yban). In 1554, he contested the throne of the Siberia Khanate against the incumbents brothers Yadegar (Y√§deg√§r) and Bekbulat, who were both vassals of Russia. In 1563, Yadegar was defeated and Kuchum assumed the throne. In 1573, Kuchum conducted a raid on Perm. It was this and other minor raids which prompted the Tsar of Russia to support a Cossack invasion of Siberia. War with Russia The fall of Qashliq to Yermak, and the flight of Kuchum. A miniature from the Kungur Chronicle In 1582, the Siberia Khanate was attacked by the Cossack ataman Yermak, who defeated Kuchum's forces and captured the capital Qashliq. Kuchum retreated into the steppes, and over the next few years regrouped his forces. He suddenly attacked Yermak on August 6, 1584 in the dead of night, and killed Yermak and most of his army; regaining control of the now ruined Qashliq. Kuchum attempted to unite the rival factions within the khanate nobility but met with resistance. After an unsuccessful attempt on his life by Qarachi Sayet khan (S√§yet), Kuchum was forced to move his horde to the steppe south of the Irtysh river. There he attempted to establish a new khanate, engaging in war against Russian governors. In 1590 Kuchum raided the Tatars around Tobolsk who were paying yasak to the Russians. In 1591 Koltsov caught Kuchum on the Ishym River and captured two of his wives and his son Abdul- Khair who was later given estates in Russia. In 1594 the fort at Tara was built in part to control Kuchum who was in the area. In 1595 Kuchum's followers were raided on the upper Irtysh. In 1597 Kuchum asked for negotiations and the Tsar and Abdul-Khair wrote from Russia offering estates in Russia in return for surrender. Before September 1598 Andrey Voyeykov caught a large group of his followers at a place called Ub Lake and later caught Kuchum on the Ob River. Kuchum fled, but the Russians killed two of his sons and captured five other sons, eight wives and eight daughters. A Muslim cleric was sent to negotiate. Kuchum replied, describing himself as deaf and blind and without subsistence and said that he had not submitted before and would not submit now. This was his last contact with the Russians. He is believed to have died c. 1605 in Bukhara. In 1620 his son Ishim-khan married a daughter of Kho Orluk who was then leading his people from Dzugharia to the Volga. Kuchum is portrayed in numerous Tatar and Russian songs and legends. His descendants remained in Muscovy, eventually assuming the title of Sibirsky. In 1591, Kuchum's son, Abul Khayir was the first of his dynasty to convert to Christianity. His conversion was followed by the conversion of his entire family who eventually assimilated into the Russian nobility. For instance, although Abul Khayir's son was known as Vasily Abulgairovich, his grandson's name, Roman Vasilyevich, could no longer be distinguished from a native Russian name. In 1686, the tsar decreed that the dynasties of the ruler of Imeretia in the Caucasus along with the Tatar princes of Siberia and Kasimov were to be into the Genealogical Book of the Russian nobility.Michael Khodarkovsky, Russia's Steppe Frontier, Indiana University Press, 2002, , M1 Google Print, p. 265. In 1661 a man who was said to be a descendant of Kuchum fought the Russians in Bashkiria. In 1739, during the Bashkir War, Karasakal was said by some to be a Kuchumid.Alton S Donnelly, 'The Russian Conquest of Bashkiria', 1968, pages 23 and 127 References External links Category:16th-century births Category:1600s deaths Category:16th-century monarchs in Asia Category:History of Siberia Category:Khans Category:Khanate of Sibir Category:Tatar people Category:Muslim missionaries Category:Siberian Tatar people ","title":"Kuchum"},{"id":"1152809","text":"John Baptiste Bernadou (November 14, 1858 ‚Äì October 2, 1908) was an officer in the United States Navy during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Born in Philadelphia, Bernadou graduated from the Naval Academy in 1880. He was promoted ten numbers for gallantry in action while commanding at the First and Second Battle of Cardenas, Cuba, from May 8 to May 11, 1898. John Baptiste Bernadou died at the Naval Hospital in Brooklyn, New York, on October 2, 1908 and is buried with his wife Florence Whiting in Arlington National Cemetery Section S. Div Site 2004 W.S Background John Baptiste Bernadou‚Äîborn on November 14, 1858 in Philadelphia‚Äîwas appointed to the United States Naval Academy on September 12, 1876 and graduated with the class of 1880. After a short tour of shore duty at Claymont, Delaware, he served at sea in the screw sloop until 1882. Warranted midshipman on June 2 of that year, he was assigned to the Bureau of Navigation in Washington, D.C., and was commissioned ensign (junior grade) on March 3, 1883. Between 1883 and 1885, Bernadou served on special duty in Korea. He was one of 18 naval officers serving with the Smithsonian Institution. His travels to Korea were to investigate that country's economic and strategic potential. On June 26, 1884, he was promoted to ensign. Pre-Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War duties Upon returning to the United States, Bernadou was assigned to the recently revitalized Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI). There, he went to work studying world economic conditions with a particular emphasis on the world's supply of nickel ore. The importance of that commodity resulted from the navy's adoption of nickel-processed steel for its new ship construction. He also collected information on foreign seaports, assisting in the writing of a book on international ports and coaling stations. His facility with foreign languages put him in an ideal position to translate articles of value to ONI from French, German, Russian, Swedish, Spanish, and other languages. Between February 1891 and May 1893, he served in the cruiser . On July 1, 1892, he was promoted to lieutenant (junior grade). He took a leave of absence because of illness from May to July 1893 and then returned to sea in (Gunboat No. 4). In that warship, he made a cruise to European and Mediterranean waters, there transferring to the protected cruiser . In September 1894, Bernadou began three years of service at the Naval Torpedo Station located at Newport, Rhode Island, where he continued the work of Charles Munroe developing a satisfactory smokeless powder for naval artillery. While in that assignment, he was promoted to lieutenant in June 1896. In 1897 he patented a nitrocellulose powder colloided with ether and alcohol.Davis, Tenney L. The Chemistry of Powder & Explosives (1943) pages 296-297 The Navy licensed or sold patents for this formulation to DuPont and the California Powder Works while retaining manufacturing rights for the Naval Powder Factory, Indian Head, Maryland constructed in 1900. The United States Army adopted Bernadou's formulation in 1908 and began manufacture at Picatinny Arsenal.Sharpe, Philip B. Complete Guide to Handloading 3rd Edition (1953) Funk & Wagnalls pp.146-149 In December 1897, Bernadou went to the Norfolk Navy Yard where he put (Torpedo Boat No. 5) into commission on the 29th as her first commanding officer. Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War War with Spain erupted late in April 1898, and Bernadou was soon patrolling the northern coast of Cuba in Winslow. On May 8, Barnadou blockaded the port of Cardenas with USS Machias. That day, Machias left for a patrol leaving only the Winslow for blockading. Three Spanish guboats which were trapped in the port decided to sortie and attempt to lift the blockade, in the ensuing battle, Winslow damaged all three Spanish vessels and sent them back into port. On May 11, he took Winslow to take on coal from one of the larger warships there. Upon reporting to the commanding officer of (Gunboat No. 8), he received orders to take Winslow into the bay at Cardenas and scout for mines. Winslow and the revenue cutter Hudson searched the harbor entrance but found no mines. They rejoined Wilmington about noon to make their report. Wilmington's commanding officer decided to take the three warships into the bay in search of the three Spanish gunboats reported there. Bernadou's command marked shoal water to Wilmington's portside during the entry. Upon reaching a point about 3,000 yards from the city, a lookout spied a small, gray steamer moored alongside the wharf. Bernadou then received orders to move his ship in closer to determine whether or not the ship was an enemy warship. At around 1335, his warship reached a point about 1,500 yards from the object of his interest when a white puff of smoke announced the opening of an artillery duel that would last an hour and 20 minutes. Bernadou responded with Winslow's 1 pounders, and then enemy batteries ashore joined the deadly contest. Bernadou's little ship bore the brunt of the Spanish fury, and she soon received a number of direct hits. The first shell to strike Winslow destroyed both her steam and manual steering gear. Bernadou's crew tried to rig some type of auxiliary steering gear while he steered her with the propellers in an attempt to keep her bow gun unmasked and to present the enemy with as small a target as possible. All at once, however, Winslow swung broadside to the shore batteries. Quickly, a shot knocked out her port main engine. Bernadou then tried to maneuver his warship with the remaining engine to evade Spanish fire and to keep his guns in action. At some point before that time, a shell burst on the top of the forward conning tower; and a fragment from it struck Bernadou in the thigh. Almost simultaneously, Wilmington and Hudson brought their larger guns to bear on the Spanish shore batteries. The Spanish gunboat received fatal hits, and her crew abandoned her, while the shore batteries slackened fire. Bernadou requested Hudson to tow his all-but-disabled torpedo boat out of action. A towline was passed between the two ships, but it soon parted. Spanish shore batteries continued their fire, and one shell burst near the after engine room hatch killing four of the crew and Ens. Worth Bagley, the only American naval officer killed by enemy action in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. The towline was finally rerigged, and Winslow, badly damaged, was towed clear of the action. Bernadou relinquished command of the ship to Chief Gunner's Mate George P. Brady and went over to Wilmington with the rest of the wounded. For his gallantry at Cardenas, Bernadou received a commendation and advancement (10 numbers) in seniority. Post war After recovering from his wounds, Bernadou returned to duty at the Bureau of Ordnance where he served from late 1898 until sometime in 1899. No doubt, he resumed the work on perfecting smokeless gunpowder that he had performed previously at Newport, Rhode Island In 1899, he returned to sea in (Battleship No. 1). In 1900, he transferred briefly to newly commissioned (Battleship No. 6) before joining the training ship . He made two cruises to Mediterranean waters and served briefly on the South Atlantic Station. On February 9, 1902, probably while still assigned to Dixie, Bernadou was promoted to lieutenant commander. Later that year, he began another tour of duty with ONI in Washington, D.C. That assignment lasted until 1904 when he returned to sea as executive officer of Kearsarge (Battleship No. 5). He served in that billet until sometime early in 1906. After a brief tour of duty at the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, Bernadou went to Europe to serve as naval attach√© in Rome and Vienna. On December 11, 1906 while in Europe, Bernadou was promoted to commander. He remained on diplomatic duty until sometime in mid 1908 when complications caused by the wound he received at Cardenas forced him to return home. Bernadou died at the Naval Hospital, Brooklyn, New York, on October 2, 1908. Three days later, he was buried with full military honors in the National Cemetery at Arlington, Virginia.

The plea was available at least as early as 1387 and was eventually rendered obsolete by the Sentence of Death (Expectant Mothers) Act 1931, which stated that an expecting mother would automatically have her death sentence commuted to life imprisonment with hard labour. The plea did not constitute a defense, and could only be made after a verdict of guilty was delivered. Upon making the plea, the convict was entitled to be examined by a jury of matrons, generally selected from the observers present at the trial. If she was found to be pregnant with a quick child (that is, a fetus sufficiently developed to render its movement detectable) the convict was granted a reprieve of sentence until the next hanging time after her delivery. Scholarly reviews of the Old Bailey Sessions Papers and Assize records from the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I have shown that women granted such reprieves were often subsequently granted pardons or had their sentences commuted to transportation. Even those women who were subsequently executed pursuant to their original sentences were often executed behind schedule. The famous female pirates Anne Bonny and Mary Read both used this plea to delay execution, although Read died of fever in prison. It appears that women were often fraudulently or erroneously found to be quick with child. Daniel Defoe's Moll Flanders includes a character who successfully pleaded her belly despite being \\"no more with child than the judge that tried [her]\\". John Gay's The Beggar's Opera includes a scene where the character Filch picks up income working as a \\"child getter ... helping the ladies to a pregnancy against their being called down to sentence\\". As a check against this abuse of the system, the law held that no women could be granted a second reprieve from the original sentence on the ground of subsequent pregnancy, even if the fetus had quickened. In the event that a female prisoner became pregnant, her gaoler or the local sheriff was subject to a fine.

The company was founded in Tokyo in 1947 by Kosaku Kikuchi, who had worked for a radio parts distributor in Tokyo before and during World War II. Due to the poor quality of radio parts Kikuchi had to deal with, he decided to start his private radio part manufacturer facility in December 1944 in Yoyogi, Tokyo. He picked transformers as his initial product line. Kikuchi's thought was \\"Even with higher prices, let's make the higher quality of products.\\"tube-amps.net 2015-01-02, Sansui in Early Days, retrieved 2020-04-23. In 1954 manufacturing Pre-Amp, Main-Amp kits, as well as finished amplifiers which used tubes, was started; in 1958 Sansui introduced the first stereo tube Pre- and Main amplifiers. By the 1960s Sansui had developed a reputation for making serious audio components. They were sold in foreign markets through that and the next decade. Sansui's amplifiers and tuners from the 1960s and 1970s remain in demand by audio enthusiasts. Since 1965 the iconic matte-black-faced AU-series amplifiers were released.hifiengine.com 2020, Sansui AU-111, retrieved 2020-04-25.audiocircuit.com, Sansui AU-111, retrieved 2020-04-25. In 1967 Sansui produced its first record player.HiFi Classics 2009, Sansui-Geschichte und Informationen (Archive, German), retrieved 2020-04-23. In 1971, Sansui introduced the Quadphonic Synthesizer QS-1, which could make simulated four- channel stereo from two-channel sources. Sansui developed the QS Regular Matrix system, which made it possible to transmit four-channel Quadraphonic sound from a standard LP. The channel separation was only 3 dB, but because of the human way of hearing it sounded relatively good. In 1973, Sansui introduced the more advanced QS Vario Matrix decoder with 20 dB separation. Unfortunately, the SQ system developed by Columbia/CBS was the most popular matrix system. But later QS decoders could also play SQ records. Some Sansui receivers could also play the most advanced four-channel system ‚Äì CD-4 (or Quadradisc) by Japanese JVC and American RCA. Most big record companies used either SQ or CD-4, but Decca used the Sansui QS system. For completeness, it should be mentioned that the 2-channel-range was extended by tape machines and cassette decks, too.hifiengine.com, reel tapes by Sansui 1970-1974, retrieved 2020-04-23. In 1974 Kosaku Kikuchi resigned, and vice-president Kenzo Fujiwara became president.Billboard 1974-10-26, page 4; at Google Books, retrieved 2020-04-22. In the late 1970s, the first-generation '07' models included the dual-mono power supply AU-517 and AU-717, and the second generation featured the updated AU-719, 819, and 919 were released. The separate pre-amp/power-amp CA-F1/BA-F1 topped the model range along with the AU-X1 integrated amplifier (1979).audio-database.com, SANSUI BA-F1, retrieved 2020-04-23. In the UK around 1982, the Sansui AU-D101 amplifier and its more powerful sibling the AU-D33,Bigger version AU-D55, https://audio- database.com/SANSUI/amp/au-d55f-e.html , retrieved 2020-04-22. were acclaimed by audiophilesGerman HiFi magazine Stereoplay 04/1982: \\"Spitzenklasse IV\\"; best integrated amplifiers these times were in this magazine \\"Spitzenklasse I\\" (German \\"Spitzenklasse\\" means top class.) and were so well matched to a pair of KEF Coda III speakers that they could be bought as a set from some outlets. These amplifiers used a complex feed-forward servo system which resulted in very low 2nd order harmonic distortion. Despite this success, Sansui failed to follow up with further mass-market audiophile components. As the mid-1980s arrived, sales were lost to competitors (Sony, Pioneer, Matsushita's Technics). Sansui began to lose visibility in the United States around 1988, and then focused on manufacturing high-end components in Japan. The company began to manufacture high-end television sets and other video equipment, but ceased exportation. In the late 1990s, the company's brand was used on video equipment manufactured by other companies. The current manufacturer of the rebranded sets is Orion Electric, based in Osaka and Fukui, Japan. Its U.S. subsidiary markets products under the Sansui brand, among others. Sansui is thus a mere umbrella brand at present. This radical change in Sansui's corporate identity has resulted in a notable change in its product quality as consumers now tend to consider Sansui a mass-market brand rather than a maker of high-end electronics.sansui.us 2006-01-24, International v.s.

The mountains' highest point is Cerro Nube ‚Äì , in southern Oaxaca, and just one major highway crosses the range between Acapulco and Mexico City. Although separated from the main part of the Sierra Madre del Sur by the deep canyon of the lower R√≠o Balsas, the mountains of southern Michoac√°n around Coalcom√°n are usually considered part of the Sierra Madre del Sur. Ecology The range is noted for its very high biodiversity and large number of endemic species. The Sierra Madre del Sur pine-oak forests ecoregion occupies the higher reaches of the range. These forests are part of a chain of Mesoamerican pine-oak forests that stretch from the Southwestern United States to Costa Rica along the American Cordillera. Lower elevations of the range are covered by tropical dry forests, ecoregions in the Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests Biome. The Jalisco dry forests occupy the western end of the range's Pacific slope.

The side chain is a hydrocarbon branching element of a molecule that is attached to a larger hydrocarbon backbone. It is one factor in determining a molecule's properties and reactivity. A side chain is also known as a pendant chain, but a pendant group (side group) has a different definition. Conventions The placeholder R is often used as a generic placeholder for alkyl (saturated hydrocarbon) group side chains in chemical structure diagrams. To indicate other non-carbon groups in structure diagrams, X, Y, or Z are often used. History The R symbol was introduced by 19th-century French chemist Charles Fr√©d√©ric Gerhardt, who advocated its adoption on the grounds that it would be widely recognizable and intelligible given its correspondence in multiple European languages to the initial letter of \\"root\\" or \\"residue\\": French racine (\\"root\\") and r√©sidu (\\"residue\\"), these terms' respective English translations along with radical (itself derived from Latin radix below), Latin radix (\\"root\\") and residuum (\\"residue\\"), and German Rest (\\"remnant\\" and, in the context of chemistry, both \\"residue\\" and \\"radical\\").Jensen W.B., Journal of Chemical Education 87, 360 (2010) Usage =Organic chemistry= In polymer science, the side chain of an oligomeric or polymeric offshoot extends from the backbone chain of a polymer. Side chains have noteworthy influence on a polymer's properties, mainly its crystallinity and density. An oligomeric branch may be termed a short-chain branch, and a polymeric branch may be termed a long-chain branch. Side groups are different from side chains; they are neither oligomeric nor polymeric. =Biochemistry= In proteins, which are composed of amino acid residues, the side chains are attached to the alpha-carbon atoms of the amide backbone. The side chain connected to the alpha-carbon is specific for each amino acid and is responsible for determining charge and polarity of the amino acid. The amino acid side chains are also responsible for many of the interactions that lead to proper protein folding and function. Amino acids with similar polarity are usually attracted to each other, while nonpolar and polar side chains usually repel each other. Nonpolar/polar interactions can still play an important part in stabilizing the secondary structure due to the relatively large amount of them occurring throughout the protein. Spatial positions of side-chain atoms can be predicted based on protein backbone geometry using computational tools for side-chain reconstruction.

In 1988, he was awarded the Right Livelihood Award for \\"his contribution to protecting the natural environment in Brazil and worldwide.\\" Biography He was born in a German-Brazilian family in Porto Alegre, the capital city of southernmost state of Rio Grande do Sul, as the only son of architect Joseph Franz Seraph Lutzenberger. He graduated in Agronomy at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in 1950. For more than 15 years he worked in Germany, Venezuela and Morocco for a German chemical company, BASF, selling the same products he would later campaign against. In 1971, Lutzenberger founded the Associa√ß√£o Ga√∫cha de Prote√ß√£o ao Ambiente Natural (Agapan), an environmentalist organization. He became famous for defending the environment together with Magda Renner, Hilda Wrasse Zimmermann, Giselda Castro and others during the time of military government in Brazil. He was appointed to the Environment Ministry in the Fernando Collor de Mello federal government, in the early 1990s. \\"He was Brazil's first internationally known environmental activist, and the fact he was chosen environment minister in Brazil's first democratically elected government in 30 years was just one indication of the tremendous mark he made in that area,\\" said Stephan Schwartzman, senior scientist at Environmental Defense. Lutzenberger's time as the Secretary of the Environment came to an abrupt end. In December 1991, \\"L. Summers, who at the time was chief economist and a vice-president of the World Bank, made an internal note (leaked to the environmental community) that asserted that the economically correct policy for the disposal of environmental poisons was to dump them in developing countries. Lutzenberger wrote to Summers expressing very strong disapproval of these ideas (calling them 'totally insane'), and was removed from his post immediately thereafter.\\"Page 100, Economics Unmasked, Philipp Smith & Manfred Max-Neef In 1987 Lutzenberger founded a group called Gaia, which focused on global issues, and a year later he won the Right Livelihood Award in recognition of his work. Like millions of others in southern Brazil, the Kroeff-Lutzenberger family was bilingual, speaking both Portuguese, the national and official language of the land, but also German, a strong regional language in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. Lutzenberg also achieved a high level of fluency in English, Spanish and French. The Guarita State Park in Torres, Rio Grande do Sul, was renamed the Jos√© Lutzenberger State Park in his honor in January 2003. Death Lutzenberger died in 2002 at the age of 75. He was buried as he wished: naked, without a coffin, close to a tree in a farm he restored, the Rinc√£o Gaia, in Pantano Grande, also in the Rio Grande do Sul state.

He later achieved the rank of commodore in the United States Navy and also served in the War of 1812. Early life and family He was born in Baltimore. He went to sea in 1771 at the age of 12. In 1775, he served as second-in-command to his brother- in-law aboard a merchant ship bound for Europe; after his brother-in-law died, he assumed command and sailed the ship to Nice. Barney married twice, and had children with both wives. While on his way to Kentucky, where he planned to retire, he died in Pittsburgh. His widow Harriet settled in Kentucky with their three children. His grandson Joseph Nicholson Barney was also a United States Navy (and Confederate States Navy) officer. Revolutionary War Barney served in the Continental Navy beginning in February 1776, as master's mate of where he took part in Commodore Esek Hopkins's raid on New Providence. Later he served aboard and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant for gallantry in the action between Wasp and a British brig, the tender Betsey. While serving on he took a prominent part in the defense of the Delaware River. Barney was taken prisoner and exchanged several times. In 1779, he was again taken prisoner and imprisoned in Old Mill Prison, Plymouth, England, until his escape in 1781. He wrote an account of this in The Memoirs of Commodore Barney, published in Boston in 1832. =Battle of Delaware Bay= In April 1782, he was put in command of the Pennsylvania ship Hyder Ally, in which he captured the more heavily armed warship HMS General Monk in the Battle of Delaware Bay.General Monk was the captured Rhode Island privateer General Washington. He was given command of Monk (renamed General Washington) and sailed for France with dispatches for Benjamin Franklin, returning with news that peace had been declared. The ship also carried a party of Austrian naturalists under the leadership of Franz Jozef Maerter and including Franz Boos.Ignaz von Born to Benjamin Franklin, 21 November 1783; Benjamin Franklin, The Papers of Benjamin Franklin: Volume 41: September 16, 1783, through February 29, 1784, Yale University Press, 2014, p.214. Barney was an original member of the Pennsylvania Society of the Cincinnati and later transferred to the Maryland society. After the Revolution, Barney joined the French Navy, where he was made commander of a squadron. Service in the French Navy Between 1796 and 1802 Joshua Barney served as a captain in the French Navy.Hamilton et al. (1974), footnote on p.326. Between 7 June and 17 October 1796 he was captain of the French frigate . He sailed her from Rochefort to ferry weapons and ammunition to Cap-Fran√ßais. He then cruised in the Caribbean between Havana and Chesapeake Bay, returning to Cap-Fran√ßais on 17 October.Fonds Marine, p.153.Fonds Marine, p.178. War of 1812 =Chesapeake Bay Flotilla= At the outbreak of the War of 1812, after a successful but unprofitable privateering cruise as commander of the Baltimore schooner , in which he captured the Post Office Packet Service packet ship Princess Amelia, Barney entered the US Navy as a captain, and commanded the Chesapeake Bay Flotilla, a fleet of gunboats defending Chesapeake Bay. He authored the plan to defend the Chesapeake, which was submitted to Secretary of the Navy, William Jones and accepted on August 20, 1813. The plan consisted of using a flotilla of shallow-draft barges, each equipped with a large gun which would be used in large numbers to attack and annoy the invading British, then retreating to the safety of shoal waters abundant in the Chesapeake region. Barney was commissioned as a captain in the United States Navy on 25 April 1814. On 1 June 1814, Barney's flotilla, led by his flagship, the sloop- rigged, self-propelled floating battery , mounting two long guns and two carronades, were coming down Chesapeake Bay when they encountered the 12-gun schooner (the former Baltimore privateer Atlas), and boats from the 74-gun third rates and near St. Jerome Creek. The flotilla pursued St Lawrence and the boats until they could reach the protection of the two third rates. The American flotilla then retreated into the Patuxent River where the British quickly blockaded it. The British outnumbered Barney by 7:1, forcing the flotilla on 7 June to retreat into St. Leonard's Creek. Two British frigates, the 38-gun HMS Loire and the 32-gun , plus the 18-gun sloop-of-war blockaded the mouth of the creek. The creek was too shallow for the British warships to enter, and the flotilla outgunned and hence was able to fend off the boats from the British ships. Battles continued through 10 June. The British, frustrated by their inability to flush Barney out of his safe retreat, instituted a \\"campaign of terror,\\" laying waste to \\"town and farm alike\\" and plundering and burning Calverton, Huntingtown, Prince Frederick, Benedict and Lower Marlboro. On 26 June, after the arrival of troops commanded by United States Army Colonel Decius Wadsworth, and United States Marine Corps Captain Samuel Miller, Barney attempted a breakout. A simultaneous attack from land and sea on the blockading frigates at the mouth of St. Leonard's creek allowed the flotilla to move out of the creek and up-river to Benedict, Maryland, though Barney had to scuttle gunboats No. 137 and 138 in the creek. The British entered the then-abandoned creek and burned the town of St. Leonard, Maryland. The British, under the command of Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane then moved up the Patuxent, preparing for a landing at Benedict. Concerned that Barney's flotilla could fall into British hands, Secretary of the Navy Jones ordered Barney to take the flotilla as far up the Patuxent as possible, to Queen Anne, and scuttle it if the British appeared. Leaving his barges with a skeleton crew under the command of Lieutenant Solomon Kireo Frazier to handle any destruction of the craft, Barney took the majority of his men to join the American Army commanded by General William Henry Winder where they participated in the Battle of Bladensburg. Frazier scuttled all but one of the vessels of the Chesapeake Bay Flotilla, which the British captured. =Battle of Bladensburg= During the Battle of Bladensburg, Barney and 360 sailors and 120 Marines defended the national capital‚Äîfighting against the enemy hand-to- hand with cutlasses and pikes. The battle raged for four hours, but the British eventually defeated the Americans. The defenders were forced to fall back after nearly being cut off, and the British went on to burn the Capitol and White House. Barney was severely wounded, receiving a bullet deep in his thigh that could never be removed. During the battle, President James Madison personally directed the Marines led by Barney. (Prior to the battle, Madison had narrowly avoided capture.) This battle is one of only two instances of a sitting president exercising direct battlefield authority as Commander-in- Chief, the other being when George Washington personally crushed the Whiskey Rebellion.Ellis, His Excellency, George Washington, 225. Death Commodore Barney died in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on 10 December 1818 en route to Kentucky, from complications related to the wound he received at the Battle of Bladensburg. His remains rest in Allegheny Cemetery in Pittsburgh.War hero Commodore Joshua Barney honored at Allegheny Cemetery, Pittsburgh Post- Gazette, August 4, 2012 Namesakes and honors Four US Navy ships were named for him: * , an American Civil War ferryboat * , a torpedo boat built at the Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine in 1900 * , a , built at Cramps' Shipbuilding in Philadelphia, launched 5 September 1918 * was a guided missile destroyer, built at New York Shipbuilding in Camden, New Jersey, launched 10 Dec 1960.

In some cases, contraposition involves a change of the former's quality (i.e. affirmation or negation).Brody, Bobuch A. \\"Glossary of Logical Terms\\". Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Vol. 5-6, p. 61. Macmillan, 1973. Also, Stebbing, L. Susan. A Modern Introduction to Logic. Seventh edition, p.65-66. Harper, 1961, and Irving Copi's Introduction to Logic, p. 141, Macmillan, 1953. All sources give virtually identical definitions. For its symbolic expression in modern logic see the rule of transposition. Contraposition also has distinctive applications in its philosophical application distinct from the other traditional inference processes of conversion and obversion where equivocation varies with different proposition types.  Traditional logic  In traditional logic the process of contraposition is a schema composed of several steps of inference involving categorical propositions and classes.Irving Copi's Introduction to Logic, pp. 123-157, Macmillan, 1953. A categorical proposition contains a subject and predicate where the existential impact of the copula implies the proposition as referring to a class with at least one member, in contrast to the conditional form of hypothetical or materially implicative propositions, which are compounds of other propositions, e.g. If P, then Q, where P and Q are both propositions, and their existential impact is dependent upon further propositions where in quantification existence is instantiated (existential instantiation). Conversion by contraposition is the simultaneous interchange and negation of the subject and predicate, and is valid only for the type \\"A\\" and type \\"O\\" propositions of Aristotelian logic, with considerations for the validity an \\"E\\" type proposition with limitations and changes in quantity. This is considered full contraposition. Since in the process of contraposition the obverse can be obtained in all four types of traditional propositions, yielding propositions with the contradictory of the original predicate, contraposition is first obtained by converting the obvert of the original proposition. Thus, partial contraposition can be obtained conditionally in an \\"E\\" type proposition with a change in quantity. Because nothing is said in the definition of contraposition with regard to the predicate of the inferred proposition, it can be either the original subject, or its contradictory, resulting in two contrapositives which are the obverts of one another in the \\"A\\", \\"O\\", and \\"E\\" type propositions.Brody, p. 61. Macmillan, 1973. Also, Stebbing, p.65-66, Harper, 1961, and Copi, p. 141-143, Macmillan, 1953. By example: from an original, 'A' type categorical proposition, : All residents are voters, which presupposes that all classes have members and the existential import presumed in the form of categorical propositions, one can derive first by obversion the 'E' type proposition, :No residents are non- voters. The contrapositive of the original proposition is then derived by conversion to another 'E' type proposition, :No non-voters are residents. The process is completed by further obversion resulting in the 'A' type proposition that is the obverted contrapositive of the original proposition, :All non-voters are non-residents. The schema of contraposition:Stebbing, L. Susan. A Modern Introduction to Logic. Seventh edition, p. 66. Harper, 1961. { style=\\"margin:auto;border:#ddd 1px solid;white-space:nowrap;\\" - class=\\"navbox-title\\" ! Original Proposition ! Obversion ! ! Contraposition !

It is not valid for \\"I\\" propositions, where the obverse is an \\"O\\" proposition which has no converse. The contraposition of the \\"E\\" proposition is valid only with limitations (per accidens). This is because the obverse of the \\"E\\" proposition is an \\"A\\" proposition which cannot be validly converted except by limitation, that is, contraposition plus a change in the quantity of the proposition from universal to particular. Also, notice that contraposition is a method of inference which may require the use of other rules of inference. The contrapositive is the product of the method of contraposition, with different outcomes depending upon whether the contraposition is full, or partial. The successive applications of conversion and obversion within the process of contraposition may be given by a variety of names. The process of the logical equivalence of a statement and its contrapositive as defined in traditional class logic is not one of the axioms of propositional logic. In traditional logic there is more than one contrapositive inferred from each original statement. In regard to the \\"A\\" proposition this is circumvented in the symbolism of modern logic by the rule of transposition, or the law of contraposition. In its technical usage within the field of philosophic logic, the term \\"contraposition\\" may be limited by logicians (e.g. Irving Copi, Susan Stebbing) to traditional logic and categorical propositions. In this sense the use of the term \\"contraposition\\" is usually referred to by \\"transposition\\" when applied to hypothetical propositions or material implications.

In addition to \\"min\\" and \\"max\\" nodes of the traditional minimax tree, this variant has \\"chance\\" (\\"move by nature\\") nodes, which take the expected value of a random event occurring. In game theory terms, an expectiminimax tree is the game tree of an extensive- form game of perfect, but incomplete information. In the traditional minimax method, the levels of the tree alternate from max to min until the depth limit of the tree has been reached. In an expectiminimax tree, the \\"chance\\" nodes are interleaved with the max and min nodes. Instead of taking the max or min of the utility values of their children, chance nodes take a weighted average, with the weight being the probability that child is reached. The interleaving depends on the game. Each \\"turn\\" of the game is evaluated as a \\"max\\" node (representing the AI player's turn), a \\"min\\" node (representing a potentially- optimal opponent's turn), or a \\"chance\\" node (representing a random effect or player). For example, consider a game in which each round consists of a single die throw, and then decisions made by first the AI player, and then another intelligent opponent. The order of nodes in this game would alternate between \\"chance\\", \\"max\\" and then \\"min\\".

Although its main focus is football, the club hosts many other activities including basketball, futsal, tennis, cycling, volleyball, and chess. In domestic tournaments, Nacional has won the Primera Divisi√≥n title 47 times, most recently in the 2019 season. Domestic cups honours include Copa de Competencia (8 times) and Copa de Honor (7 times), among others. At international level, Nacional has won 22 titles, nine of them recognised by FIFA and CONMEBOL,Las competiciones oficiales de la CONMEBOL on Conmebol website, 19 Ago 2015 including three Copa Libertadores. In this tournament, Nacional is the all-time leader with 553 points. Nacional has also won all three Copa Intercontinental it has competed in, becoming the second three time world champion in 1988. In addition, Nacional is the only Uruguayan team to have won the Copa Interamericana (two times) and the Recopa Sudamericana. In the latter competition Nacional won the inaugural edition in 1989. Besides, Nacional won four Copa de Honor Cousenier,Honor Cup on RSSSF three Copa AldaoCopa Aldao ‚Äì Campeonato Rioplatense overview two Tie Cup,Cup Tie on RSSSF and one Copa Escobar-Gerona,Copa de Confraternidad Escobar ‚Äì Gerona on RSSSF all of them organized jointly by the Argentine and Uruguayan Associations. Nacional is identified with the white, blue and red colours inspired by the flag of Uruguay's national hero Jos√© Gervasio Artigas. While the club hosts some games at Montevideo's Estadio Centenario, Nacional plays most of its home matches at the Parque Central, located in the La Blanqueada neighbourhood and popularly known as El Parque, where on 13 July 1930 Belgium and the United States played one of the two opening games of the 1930 FIFA World Cup, and where Argentina and Brazil, among others, made their debut in the FIFA World Cup. Parque Central was also the only venue in the 1923 and 1924 edition of the Copa Am√©rica. Nacional has fierce rivalries with many clubs, notably with cross-town team Pe√±arol, in clashes known as El cl√°sico del f√∫tbol uruguayo. Along with Pe√±arol, Nacional has never been relegated from the top flight of Uruguayan football. According to CONMEBOL, Nacional was the Uruguayan team with the best international performance in the 2007‚Äì2012 period. Also, according to IFFHS, it was the best Uruguayan team of the 2001‚Äì2010 period and the seventh best team in South America. In February 2013, Nacional reached 60,000 associates History =Foundation and first years= Nacional in 1905. That squad won the Copa de Honor Cousenier defeating legendary Argentine team Alumni. Nacional is a result of the fusion between Montevideo Football Club and Uruguay Athletic Club, 14 May 1899. It was decided there that the club's flag should include the three colours (red, blue and white) historically connected to Jos√© Gervasio Artigas, Uruguay's national hero. The club's uniform was mostly red and blue. In 1900 Nacional included the Club Defensa and its players, and started playing at the Estadio Gran Parque Central. That same year four clubs governed by foreigners (Albion F.C., CURCC, Uruguay Athletic Club and Deutscher F.K.) founded the Uruguay Association League. Nacional's petition to be included was dismissed on the thought that criollo clubs and their players lacked category. However, the League's clubs had to admit Nacional in 1901, after the club was invited to join the Argentinean League, due to their impressive performances in a number of friendly matches. In 1902 Nacional won their first Uruguayan Championship. The red jersey was substituted by the white jersey in 1902. In September 1903 Nacional fully represented the Uruguay national football team and beat Argentina 3‚Äì2, winning the first international match ever (between national teams) in the history of Uruguayan football (the first international club match ever, was won by Albion over Argentine team Retiro A.C. 3‚Äì1 in 1896 in Buenos Aires). In 1905 Nacional won its first international title, the Copa de Honor Cousenier. In a general assembly which took place in 1911, the populist majority led by club president Jos√© Mar√≠a Delgado obtained a victory over the elitist minority which resulted in an institutional transformation: the club opened its doors to players from lower classes, such as Abd√≥n Porte, who would eventually become one of the club's biggest symbols, playing in Nacional until his premature death in 1918. Nacional in 1915, posing with the three trophies won that year: Tie Cup, Primera Divisi√≥n and Copa de Honor Cousenier. Nacional's players started developing already around 1900 a new playing style that introduced a less physical and more imaginative game, made out of fast combinations and frequent dribblings. Magari√±os says: \\"The action of these teams [the British-Uruguayan teams, that is] was conducted according to the purest and standardized virtues of British sport: positional play, long passes, furious shots, and strong physical play. The body was used as a weapon, both offensively and defensively. (...) Nacional, formed mainly by smaller and faster players (...) abandoned the physical confrontation that was allowed back then, and chose to play according to their own possibilities. They chose to perform dribblings, fast and short passing, very fast sprints, and a hectic activity in the pitch.\\"[3 Magari√±os Pittaluga, \\"Del f√∫tbol heroico\\", Montevideo, 1943, p. 74 ss.] After winning the 1912 championship, they won the 1915 Triple Crown (Tri-championship), which included the three major domestic and international tournaments of that time: Primera Divisi√≥n, Tie Cup and Copa de Honor Cousenier. Nacional would go on to win the first Copa Uruguaya en propiedad (meaning they were the first club to win three championships in a row), by winning both the 1916 and 1917 championships. The other championships obtained during the amateur era were the 1919, 1920, 1922, 1923 and 1924. On the international level, Nacional won three Copa Aldao in 1916, 1919 and 1920, three Copa de Honor Cousenier in 1915, 1916 and 1917, and two Tie Cup in 1913 and 1915. =International tours and success= Nacional in Paris, during the 1925 tour on Europe. After two very successful initial decades in the national league of Uruguay and at the regional level, Nacional became the foundation of Uruguay's first international success at the world level. In 1924, Nacional contributed players (Mazzali, Urdinar√°n, Scarone, Romano, Zibechi and Pascual Somma) for Uruguayan national representative that won the Summer Olympics in Paris. Nacional made also a substantial contribution to the Uruguayan teams of 1928 and 1930, Olympic and World champions respectively. Nacional is the only Uruguayan club that contributed players to every Uruguay national team that has won international tournaments. In 1925, due to the success of Uruguay and players from Nacional in the 1924 Summer Olympics, Nacional was invited to make an extensive European tour, playing 38 matches over six months. During that tour, Nacional played against both national squads and professional club teams from 9 European countries. Nacional won 26 matches, tied 7, and lost 5, scoring 130 goals and allowing 30. An estimate of 800,000 tickets were sold during that tour, which is considered the largest tour in the history of world football. In 1927, Nacional made an American tour, with similar results to the ones obtained in the European adventure made two years before, with 16 wins, 2 ties and 1 loss. =The show team: 1932‚Äì43= Nacional in 1934, when winning the Torneo Competencia. One forward line of the Quinquenio (1939‚Äì43). In 1932, football became professional in Uruguay and Nacional formed a team that would be nicknamed La M√°quina Blanca (The White Machine). The team scored 28 goals in the first four games of the 1932 season. In 1933 Nacional won its 12th. first division title, repeating the next year. The 1933 championship is remembered as the longest ever, since it ended in November 1934, after a series of final games against Pe√±arol, the last won by Nacional by 3‚Äì1 with 3 goals by H√©ctor Castro. In 1938, Argentine footballer Atilio Garc√≠a came to the club. That same year Nacional won the \\"Nocturno Rioplatense\\". Between 1939 and 1943, coached by former player H√©ctor Castro Nacional won the Quinquenio de Oro (five consecutive championships from 1939 to 1943). Some highlights of those times was the 5‚Äì1 victory over Pe√±arol, with 4 goals by Atilio Garc√≠a. Nacional also made an outstanding campaign in the 1941 season, winning all the games disputed (20/20). In those five years the team played 96 Copa Uruguaya games, won 77, tied 9 and only lost 10, made 318 goals and allowed 108. Nacional's superiority over Pe√±arol during this era is best exemplified by some particular feats: * Between 1938 and 1943 there were 23 cl√°sicos, with 18 victories for Nacional and only 4 for their rivals. * On 14 December 1941 Nacional obtained the largest win in the history of Uruguayan Cl√°sico, defeating Pe√±arol 6 ‚Äì 0. (That year, Nacional won all 20 games of the championship.) * On 23 November 1943 Nacional won their tenth Campeonato uruguayo cl√°sico in a row. Notable players of that period include Atilio Garc√≠a (all-time Nacional's top scorer, also Uruguayan Cl√°sico all-time top scorer with 34 goals, eight times Uruguayan Champion, eight times league's highest scorer); An√≠bal Paz (nine times Uruguayan champion and World Champion defending Uruguay in 1950); Schubert Gambetta (nine times Uruguayan Champion and World Champion in 1950); Luis Ernesto Castro (seven times Uruguayan Champion); An√≠bal Ciocca (eight times Uruguayan Champion), Eugenio Pato Galvalisi (seven times Uruguayan Champion), Roberto Porta (six times Uruguayan Champion), Bibiano Zapirain (six times Uruguayan Champion). =International achievements= The Nacional team that won its first Copa Libertadores (1971). The 1980 team that won both, Copa Libertadores and the first edition of Copa Intercontinental played in Tokio. Nacional's international reputation relied on the tournaments played during the first half of the 20th century in the R√≠o de la Plata region, where the most important international tournaments in America were played before the Copa Libertadores was created. Historical rivalries with longtime enemy Pe√±arol and famous Argentinian teams like Boca, River Plate, Racing, Independiente, San Lorenzo, Rosario Central and Newell's Old Boys, among others, were established in those championships. Nacional participated in the Libertadores for the first time in 1962, when they were defeated in the semi-finals by Pe√±arol. They got to the Finals in 1964, but lost to Independiente, and in 1967 to Racing. With President Miguel Restuccia, Nacional formed the basis of a team that would eventually achieve its goal, with players such as Ubi√±a, Mujica, Montero Castillo, Esp√°rrago, Cascarilla Morales, Brazilian goalkeeper Manga, Cubilla and the great Argentinean striker Artime. In the 1969 Libertadores, after defeating Pe√±arol in semi-finals, Nacional lost its third Finals, this time against Estudiantes de La Plata. In 1971, coached by Washington Etchamendi, Nacional finally won its first Copa Libertadores, beating Estudiantes de La Plata in Lima, Peru. That year, Nacional won its first World Club title, the 1971 Intercontinental Cup, in memorable matches against Panathinaikos from Greece, with goals from striker Luis Artime. Panathinaikos played because the reigning European champion, AFC Ajax, refused to play due to the violent conduct common among top South American teams during this period. The following year, Nacional won its first Copa Interamericana, defeating Cruz Azul from Mexico. During this period, Nacional also regained supremacy in the domestic field, obtaining four Uruguayan Championships in a row (1969, 70, 71 and 72), keeping an unbeaten match record against classic rivals Pe√±arol: between March 2, 1971 and January 31, 1974, Nacional remained undefeated in 16 games. Nacional repeated its achievement in the Copa Libertadores in 1980, beating Internacional from Brazil in the finals. After becoming South American champions, Nacional won the Intercontinental Cup for the second time, defeating European champions Nottingham Forest from England 1‚Äì0, with goal by forward Waldemar Victorino. That year Nacional also won the Uruguayan championship. Nacional won its third copa Libertadores in 1988, beating Argentine side Newell's Old Boys 3‚Äì0 in the Estadio Centenario, with goals from Ernesto Vargas, Santiago Ostolaza and Hugo De Le√≥n. That same year, Nacional would contest its third Intercontinental Cup. In a breath-taking final against Dutch side PSV Eindhoven coached by Guus Hiddink, Nacional would win in the penalty shootout after the game ended 2‚Äì2 with two goals by Ostolaza (the second one scored at the last minute of overtime). The next year, Nacional won its second Copa Interamericana, this time beating C.D. Olimpia from Honduras, and the Recopa Sudamericana, defeating Racing from Argentina. =Recent history= In most of the 90s the club suffered a financial crisis and obtained few sportive results. It won the 1992 Championship with great performances by Julio C√©sar Dely Vald√©s and Antonio Vidal Gonz√°lez. After Pe√±arol's second Quinquenio (1993‚Äì97) Nacional's Directive board changed: returning President Dante Iocco brought back club's idol Hugo de Le√≥n as coach to prevent Pe√±arol from obtaining the hypothetical Sexenio. That year Nacional won the 1998 Campeonato Uruguayo by winning both short tournaments Apertura and Clausura. This was the first time any club achieved this feat since that system was implemented in 1994, having been repeated only by Danubio in 2006‚Äì07 season. Maintaining the basis of its squad, Nacional dominated the national ambitus for three consecutive years (2000, 2001 and 2002.) In 2005 Nacional decided to restore its stadium, the Estadio Gran Parque Central, where the team has returned to host most of their games instead of state-owned Estadio Centenario. Nacional is the most successful team since the beginning of the century, having won also the 2005, 2005‚Äì06, 2008‚Äì09, 2010‚Äì11, 2011‚Äì12, 2014-15 and 2016 championships. 2016 was the 46th Uruguayan Championship won by Nacional. It was a one-round tournament, which marked the return of the domestic calendar to fit the calendar year instead of the European calendar. Atl√©tico de Madrid by The EuroAmericana Cup. Nacional qualified for the 2018 Copa Libertadores. It will be Nacional's 45th appearance in the tournament, and the twenty second consecutive (absolute record in the cup's history). After Mart√≠n Lasarte's resignation, the club's board appointed former star and reserve team coach Alexander Medina as the principal team's new coach. Stadium Estadio Gran Parque Central (Central Park Stadium) Nacional plays most home games at its own stadium, the Montevideo-based 26,500 (and growing) capacity Gran Parque Central (soon to be 30,000), first built in 1900. It is located in \\"Quinta de la Paraguaya\\" a historic place where a Oriental revolutionary leader Jos√© Gervasio Artigas was named \\"Jefe de los Orientales\\" in 1811. In recent decades the stadium had not been used very often because Nacional played at the national stadium Estadio Centenario, sharing it with Pe√±arol, but in 2005 Nacional decided to the return to the Gran Parque Central. Since then, its ongoing renovation has allowed Nacional to play most of its home domestic matches there, as well as many international matches. High-risk matches and derbies are still played at the Centenario. The four stands of the stadium are named in memory of four symbolic figures: * the official stand, which includes press and VIP boxes is called Jos√© Mar√≠a Delgado, after one of the club's most important Presidents. * the largest stand, opposed to the Delgado, is the Atilio Garc√≠a, after Nacional's all-time top scorer. * the Abd√≥n Porte, after one of Nacional's biggest symbols: a player who after being relegated from the team shot himself dead in the center of the field. This is the stand where the organized supporter group attends. * the H√©ctor Scarone, after another historical striker, nicknamed el Mago (the Wizard). After the completion of the second tire of the Atilio Garc√≠a, Abd√≥n Porte and H√©ctor Scarone stands, the current work involves the construction of a corner structure joining the Atilio Garc√≠a and Porte stands. Future additions include a third tire on the three aforementioned stands. Supporters =The First \\"Hincha\\"= The Spanish word to describe football fans is \\"\\", and it was coined by Nacional fans. An employee of Nacional of the early 20th century, Prudencio Miguel Reyes, was famous for his continuous support to the team. The other fans that attended the games started to call him by one of his duties: pumping air to the balls (in Spanish: \\"inflar\\" the balls, in Uruguay: \\"hinchar\\" the balls). Within a few games, Reyes was known as the \\"hincha\\" of Nacional. This is the origin of a word that is frequently used by Spanish speakers worldwide. =\\"The biggest flag in the world\\"= In June 2013, Nacional supporters displayed for the first time the biggest flag of the world as they called the emblem during a match vs. Deportivo Toluca played for the 2013 Copa Libertadores.

It happened again with Uruguay's teams of 1928 and 1930, Olympic and world champions respectively, in which Nacional contributed the majority of players.

They played two seasons, 1876 and 1877, and compiled a record of 65-61\\\\. Their home games were at the Louisville Baseball Park. The Grays were owned by businessman Walter Newman Haldeman, owner and publisher of the Louisville Courier-Journal newspaper.  Overview  1876 Louisville Grays team The Grays were undone by Major League Baseball's first gambling scandal. The team was in first place in August 1877, then suddenly lost seven games and tied one against the Boston Red Stockings and Hartford Dark Blues. Boston ended up winning the pennant, seven games ahead of the second-place Grays. A Courier- Journal story questioning the team's conduct was written by John Haldeman, the owner's son.http://www.davidpietrusza.com/1877.html Team president Charles Chase received two anonymous telegrams. One noted that gamblers were favoring the less talented Hartford team in an upcoming series. The second telegram predicted Louisville would throw the next game versus Hartford on August 21. The Grays committed a number of suspicious errors and lost that game 7-0\\\\. League president William Hulbert investigated and ordered players to authorize Western Union to release all telegrams sent or received during the 1877 season. All players complied except shortstop Bill Craver, the team's captain. The telegrams indicated that pitcher Jim Devlin, left fielder George Hall, and utility player Al Nichols intentionally lost games in exchange for money. No direct evidence was found implicating Craver. All four were banned from baseball for life, Craver for refusing to comply with the investigation. Devlin pitched every inning for the 1877 Grays, leading the league in games and innings pitched. Hall played every inning in left field; he was a good batter, and was the 1876 home run leader with five. The original St. Louis Brown Stockings had signed Devlin and Hall for 1878 and went out of business with the Grays after the investigation.Cash 38-54 See also * Louisville Grays all-time roster * 1876 Louisville Grays season * 1877 Louisville Grays season * 1877 Louisville Grays scandal * Sports in Louisville, Kentucky References * Cash, Jon David.

The academy is located within the town limits of Oak Ridge, North Carolina, which is named after the school. It is seven miles north of the Piedmont Triad International Airport and Interstate 40, and is approximately eight miles northwest of Greensboro, North Carolina's third-largest city. The current Chairman of the Committee on Trustees,William Northrop, has been accused of fraud for his claims about his service in Vietnam. History Oak Ridge was established in 1852 by local families in the surrounding community, some of them associated with the Society of Friends (Quakers). The school traces its origins to April 7, 1850, when forty-three local citizens of the northwestern Guilford County community \\"desirous of promoting the cause of education\\" contributed a total of $629 for the construction of a new schoolhouse. The school, originally conceived as Oak Ridge Male Institute, changed its name to Oak Ridge Institute prior to opening, to reflect that a limited number of females from the local community would also attend the school. Oak Ridge Institute opened on March 3, 1853, with a classical curriculum of 18 courses and 63 students from North Carolina and Virginia. By 1856 it had 85 students, roughly three-quarters of whom were from places other than Oak Ridge. Through 1861, the school continued to evolve from a local community school to a regional boarding \\"finishing\\" school. The American Civil War closed the school from 1862 to 1866, with scores of eligible aged students (probably about 100) enlisting or conscripted into Southern units. The school re-opened after the Civil War, but found challenges operating during Reconstruction. However, from 1875 to 1914 Oak Ridge was led by two brothers, Professors J. Allen Holt and Martin Holt. Under their leadership the Oak Ridge Institute became one of the best prep schools in North Carolina, boasting business and humanities departments, literary and debating societies, and sports teams which regularly played Wake Forest College (University), the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Trinity College (later Duke University) in football and baseball. Several of the academy's baseball players went on to play in the major leagues. In 1914, the leadership of the school transitioned to Professor Thomas E. Whitaker. After a devastating fire that destroyed the main schoolhouse and the Chapel on January 14, 1914, Professor Whitaker rebuilds Oak Ridge into a military academy. During the First World War the Junior Reserve Officer Training Program (JROTC) was admitted to the campus and in 1929 Oak Ridge officially becomes an all-male military secondary school, with a name change to Oak Ridge Military Institute. From 1929 to 1967 Oak Ridge also included a junior college program, in addition to the high school curriculum. During the Second World War 127 of the academy's alumni were awarded a Purple Heart during the conflict, while another 27 alumni earned the Silver Star. In 1972, Oak Ridge became the first military high school in the United States to admit females, which prompted a name change to Oak Ridge Academy, dropping \\"military\\" from the name as JROTC participation was optional for girls. By 1981, all students, male and female, are required to participate in JROTC, and the school name was changed to Oak Ridge Military Academy. Today, Oak Ridge is the oldest military high school in the United States still in operation The Oak Ridge Military Academy Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The district encompasses 21 contributing buildings and 1 contributing structure. They include the Queen Anne style Oakhurst (1897) designed by Frank P. Milburn (1868-1926), the home of Martin H. Holt; Maple Glade (1905), the home of J. Allen Holt; the Oakland Park Hotel (Benbow Hall, 1905, destroyed in fire in 1993); the old Donnell and Holt Store (now Cottrell Hall, c. 1900); the Alumni Building (1914); Chapel (1914); Whitaker Dormitory, Holt Dormitory, and King Gymnasium (1920s); and Infirmary (1938). Oak Ridge Today Since 1972 Oak Ridge has been a private, coeducational, college- preparatory military boarding school (with a limited day student enrollment, mostly from the local community). The Academy is divided into a middle school (grades 7-8), and a high school (grades 9-12). Oak Ridge is the official military school of North Carolina, as designated by the state legislature in 1991. Oak Ridge is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS), and it was first accredited by SACS in 1899. ORMA is also a member of the National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS), the North Carolina Association of Independent Schools (NCAIS), and the Association of Military Schools and Colleges of the United States (AMSCUS). It is the only active military school to have won the National High School Drill Team Championship (1996).

The rebels, led by generals Bento Gon√ßalves da Silva and Ant√¥nio de Sousa Neto with the support of the Italian fighter Giuseppe Garibaldi, surrendered to imperial forces in 1845. It is considered the longest and third bloodiest of the failed wars of secession in the Brazilian Empire, after the Cabanagem Revolt and Balaiada Revolt. History =Beginning of the war= The uprising is believed to have begun due to the difference between the economy of Rio Grande do Sul and the rest of the country. Unlike the other provinces, the economy of Rio Grande do Sul focused on the internal market rather than exporting commodities. The province's main product, charque (dried and salted beef), suffered badly from competition from charque imported from Uruguay and Argentina. The people that benefited from these markets were called \\"Gauchos,\\" nomadic cowhands and farmers who lived in Rio Grande do Sul. The Gauchos also lived in Argentina and Uruguay. In 1835, was nominated president of Rio Grande do Sul and at first, his appointment pleased the liberal farmers, but that soon changed. In his first day in the office, he accused many farmers of being separatists. On 20 September 1835, General Bento Gon√ßalves captured the capital, Porto Alegre, beginning an uprising against the perceived unfair trade reinforced by the provincial government. The provincial president fled to the city of Rio Grande, to the south. In Porto Alegre, the rebels, also known as \\"ragamuffins\\" (farrapos) after the fringed leather worn by the gauchos, elected their new president. Responding to the situation and further upsetting the rebels, the Brazilian regent, Diogo Ant√¥nio Feij√≥, appointed a new provincial president, who was forced to take office in exile in Rio Grande. =Declaration of independence= Piratini Republic. Battle of Fanfa, battle scene in Southern Brazil Pushing to consolidate their power, Ant√¥nio de Souza Neto declared the independence of the Riograndense or Piratini Republic on 11 September 1836, with Bento Gon√ßalves as president nominee. However, Gon√ßalves was arrested and jailed by imperial forces until he escaped in 1837, returning to the province and bringing the revolution to a head. Nonetheless, Porto Alegre was recaptured by the empire and the rebels never managed to regain it. In Bahia, there was another revolt called the Sabinada Revolt in 1837. They managed to create another Republic but it fell quickly within 4 months. The Brazilian Army had a number of problems at the time and were not able to handle the secessionist threat. Through military reforms, the mass recruitment of civilians was made possible and they were able to quell the rebels in 1845. The Italian revolutionary Giuseppe Garibaldi joined the rebels in 1836. With his help, the revolution spread north through Santa Catarina, which adjoined Rio Grande do Sul. One of the main cities of Santa Catarina, Laguna, was taken by the rebels but fell back into imperial hands after four months. It was in this struggle that Garibaldi gained his first military experience and got on the road leading to his becoming the famed military leader of the Unification of Italy. The rebel forces were also aided financially and indirect military support by the Uruguayan government led by Jos√© Fructuoso Rivera. The Uruguayans had the intention of creating a political union with the Riograndense Republic to create a new stronger state. =Resultant peace= The rebels refused an offer of amnesty in 1840. In 1842, they issued a Republican constitution as a last attempt to maintain power. The same year saw General Lima e Silva take command of Imperial forces in the area, and try to negotiate a settlement. Declaration of the Brazilian Government announcing the end of the war, in 1845. On 1 March 1845, the peace negotiations led by Lima e Silva and Ant√¥nio Vicente da Fontoura concluded with the signing of the Ponche Verde Treaty between the two sides, in Dom Pedrito. The treaty offered the rebels a full amnesty, full incorporation into the imperial army and the choice of the next provincial president. All the debts of the Riograndense Republic were paid off by the Empire and a tariff of 25% was introduced on imported charque. The Riograndense and Juliana Republics remained in the Empire of Brazil and are now two states of the Federative Republic of Brazil, Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina respectively. As a goodwill gesture, the rebels chose Lima e Silva as the next provincial president. Legacy The Brazilian Army reorganized itself to be a proper fighting force during the Ragamuffin War. The military would be able to defeat insurgencies that rose up during the Imperial Era of Brazil. However, this reformed military would prove disastrous against the Emperor when they rebelled to create a Republic.

He was educated at Harvard and the University of Chicago. He is an actor with a number of film and television appearances to his credit. He is a musician: he plays the guitar and the banjo. He speaks fluent French, Russian and Spanish and has contributed many foreign language songs to the Limeliters' repertoire. The Limeliters When the Limeliters first broke up at the height of their fame in 1963, Alex Hassilev turned to acting and operating a recording studio in his home, producing records for a variety of other artists as well as the Limeliters. He appeared in the 1966 movie The Russians are Coming, The Russians are Coming as Hrushevsky, a Soviet sailor. For over thirty years he has been a successful record producer and songwriter, and today he continues to produce many of the Limeliters' recordings. The original Limeliters (Lou Gottlieb, Alex Hassilev and Glenn Yarbrough) had numerous reunion tours throughout the 1970s. In the early 1980s, Alex and Lou wanted to keep the Limeliters together on a more full-time basis. They brought on tenor Red Grammer, who stayed with the Limeliters for the next 10 years. In about 1990, Red left the group to devote more time to a career as a singer of children's songs, and he has had a very successful career in that field. Alex and Lou found Rick Dougherty to take Red's place, another tenor. In 1996, Gottlieb died of cancer. Alex and Rick decided to keep the group going, and brought on Bill Zorn to take Lou's place in the Limeliters. Zorn had played with the Kingston Trio in the 1970s, and then went to England to focus on his music there. In 2004, Bob Shane of the Kingston Trio was forced to retire due to health reasons. Bill Zorn left the Limeliters and joined the Kingston Trio. At about this time, Rick Dougherty also left the Limeliters to go on tour with Glenn Yarbrough, and former Brothers Four member Dick Foley. Alex sued both Zorn and Dougherty over their leaving the group, but the case eventually resolved. Dougherty then joined Bill Zorn in the Kingston Trio, replacing Bob Haworth. After Zorn and Dougherty left the group, Hassilev brought on Mack Bailey and Andy Corwin to take their spot in the Limeliters. In 2006, Alex retired from the group, and brought on Gaylan Taylor to take his place. However, occasionally he makes a special appearance with the Limeliters.

She is one of the most prolific recorded bass guitarists in rock and pop music, playing on an estimated 10,000 recordings in a career spanning over 50 years. Kaye began playing guitar in her early teens and after some time as a guitar teacher, began to perform regularly on the Los Angeles jazz and big band circuit. She started session work in 1957, and through a connection at Gold Star Studios began working for producers Phil Spector and Brian Wilson. After a bassist failed to turn up to a session in 1963, she switched to that instrument, quickly making a name for herself as one of the most in-demand session players of the 1960s, playing on numerous hits. She moved into playing on film soundtracks in the late 1960s, particularly for Quincy Jones and Lalo Schifrin, and began to release a series of tutoring books such as How To Play The Electric Bass. Kaye became less active towards the end of the 1970s, but has continued her career and attracted praise from other musicians. During the peak of her years of session work, she became part of a stable of Los Angeles- based musicians which went by a variety of informal names, but has since become known as \\"The Wrecking Crew\\". Her work with the group led to her prominent role in the eponymous 2008 documentary film. Early life Kaye was born in Everett, Washington, to professional musicians Clyde and Dot Smith. Her father was a jazz trombonist who played in big bands. In 1942, he sold a piano in order to finance a move to Wilmington, California. She later said her father was violent towards her, and she persuaded her mother to separate from him, but music was the one thing that could unite the family. At age 13, Kaye received a steel string guitar from her mother, and began teaching professionally the following year. She began playing sessions in jazz clubs around Los Angeles. During the 1950s, Kaye played bebop jazz guitar with several groups on the Los Angeles club circuit, including Bob Neal's group, Jack Sheldon backing Lenny Bruce, Teddy Edwards and Billy Higgins. She played with the Henry Busse Orchestra in the mid-1950s, and toured the US with them. Career =Pop sessions= In 1957, Kaye was playing a gig at the Beverly Cavern, Hollywood, when producer Robert \\"Bumps\\" Blackwell invited her to a recording session for Sam Cooke's arrangement of \\"Summertime\\". She realised she could make significantly more money with session work than playing in jazz clubs, so took it up as a full-time career. In 1958, she played acoustic rhythm guitar on Ritchie Valens' \\"La Bamba\\", recorded at Gold Star Studios, Hollywood. Through Gold Star, she began to work with producer Phil Spector, playing electric guitar on Bob B. Soxx & the Blue Jeans' \\"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah\\" and The Crystals' \\"Then He Kissed Me\\", and acoustic guitar on The Righteous Brothers' \\"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\\". Along with several other musicians including drummer Hal Blaine and guitarist Glen Campbell, her work with Spector attracted the attention of other record producers and she found herself in demand as a regular session player. In 1963, when a bass player failed to show for a session at Capitol Records in Hollywood, she was asked to fill in on the instrument. She quickly discovered she preferred playing bass, and found it was a key component of a backing track and allowed her to play more inventively than the relatively simpler guitar parts she had been playing until then. From a pragmatic viewpoint, it was easier to carry a single bass to sessions instead of swapping between three or four guitars depending on the song. After bassist Ray Pohlman left studio work to become a musical director, Kaye became the most in-demand session bassist in Los Angeles. Kaye continued to play guitar on numerous other hit songs in the 1960s and 1970s, including the twelve-string electric guitar on several Sonny & Cher songs. She also played twelve-string on Frank Zappa's album Freak Out! At the time, it was unusual for women to be experienced session players; nevertheless Kaye remembered sessions being generally good-humoured and united by the music. Kaye was the sole regular female member of The Wrecking Crew (though she has said the group were never known by this name, which was later invented by Hal Blaine), a group of studio musicians who played on a large number of hit records from Los Angeles in the 1960s. Throughout the decade, while at the time unknown to the public, Kaye played bass on a substantial number of records that appeared on the Billboard Hot 100. According to the New York Times, she played on 10,000 recording sessions. She appeared on sessions by Frank Sinatra, Simon and Garfunkel, Stevie Wonder, Barbra Streisand, The Supremes, The Temptations, the Four Tops and The Monkees. She played electric bass on Nancy Sinatra's \\"These Boots Are Made For Walkin'\\", while Chuck Berghofer played double bass. She also came up with the introduction on fellow session player Glen Campbell's hit \\"Wichita Lineman\\". Kaye later said that during the 1960s she would sometimes play three or four sessions per day, and was pleased that so many of them created hit records. Through her work with Spector, Kaye caught the attention of The Beach Boys' Brian Wilson, who used her on several sessions, including the albums Beach Boys Today, Summer Days (and Summer Nights!!), Pet Sounds and Smile. Unlike other sessions, where she was free to work out her own bass lines, Wilson always came in with a very specific idea of what she should play. By Pet Sounds, Wilson was asking musicians such as Kaye to play far more takes than typical sessions, often running over ten passes of a song, with sessions stretching well into the night. Kaye is often credited for playing on the Beach Boys' \\"Good Vibrations\\" single, but a session list compiled by Craig Slowinski for The Smile Sessions box-set liner notes states that, although she played on several sessions for the song, none of those recordings made the final edit as released on the single. Brian Wilson remembers Kaye as one of the session players hired for the many sessions devoted to the song: \\"The bass part was important to the overall sound. I wanted Carol Kaye to play not so much a Motown thing, but a Beach Boys-Phil Spector riff\\". =Soundtracks, tutoring and later work= By 1969, Kaye was exhausted and had become disillusioned from doing session work, saying that the music had \\"started to sound like cardboard\\". At the same time, many newer rock bands disapproved of using session players, preferring to play the instruments themselves. She decided to make a change so her career evolved from playing primarily pop music to performing mostly soundtrack work, as well as writing and teaching. She wrote How To Play The Electric Bass, the first in a series of tutoring books and instructional video courses. Her soundtrack sessions from this time included playing on the themes to M.A.S.H. and Shaft. Kaye had already performed on a number of soundtracks and had worked closely with Lalo Schifrin, playing on the theme to Mission: Impossible and the soundtrack for Bullitt. Following that she regularly collaborated with Quincy Jones, later saying that he \\"wrote some of the most beautiful themes I've ever heard in my life\\". In the early 1970s, she toured with Joe Pass and Hampton Hawes, and continued to do sessions. In 1973, she played on Barbra Streisand's single \\"The Way We Were\\", which was cut live, and was told off by producer Marvin Hamlisch for improvising bass lines. In 1976, she was involved in a car accident, and semi-retired from music. She continued to play sporadically, appearing on J.J. Cale's 1981 album Shades. In 1994, Kaye underwent corrective surgery to fix injuries stemming from the accident, and resumed playing and recording. She collaborated with Fender to produce a lighter version of the Precision Bass that reduced strain on her back and made it more comfortable to play. In 1997, she collaborated with Brian Wilson again, playing on his daughters' album, The Wilsons, while in 2006, Frank Black asked her to play on his album Fast Man Raider Man alongside fellow session stalwart, drummer Jim Keltner. She was featured in the 2008 film The Wrecking Crew along with a cast of other studio musicians. In one interview segment, she said that she believed at the peak of her session activity she was making more money than the US President. Style and equipment Kaye's main instrument during the 1960s was the Fender Precision Bass, though she also used the Danelectro bass on occasion. During the 1970s, she sometimes used the Gibson Ripper Bass, and in the 21st century she has used an Ibanez SRX700 bass. She uses flatwound strings with a high action and preferred to use guitar amplifiers in the studio when playing bass, including the Fender Super Reverb and the Versatone Pan-O-Flex. Kaye primarily uses a pick, or plectrum, on both guitar and bass, rather than plucking the strings with her fingers. She put a piece of felt between the strings behind the bridge on her bass to enhance the sound and reduce unwanted overtones and undertones. Later she said, \\"for 25 cents, you could get the best sound in town\\". Kaye preferred to play melodic and syncopated lines on the bass, rather than simply covering a straightforward part. In the studio, she particularly liked to use the upper register on her bass, while a stand-up double bass would be used to cover the low end. Legacy Kaye has achieved critical acclaim as one of the best session bassists of all time. Michael Molenda, writing in Bass Player magazine, said that Kaye could listen to other musicians and instantly work out a memorable bass line that would fit with the song, such as her additions to Sonny & Cher's \\"The Beat Goes On\\". Paul McCartney has said that his bass playing on The Beatles' Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band was inspired by her work on Pet Sounds. Alison Richter, writing in Bass Guitar magazine, has called Kaye the \\"First Lady\\" of bass playing, adding \\"her style and influence are in your musical DNA.\\" Kaye's solo bass line in Spector's production of \\"River Deep, Mountain High\\", was a key part to the song's \\"Wall of Sound\\" production. The recording is now in the Grammy Hall of Fame. Quincy Jones said in his 2001 autobiography Q that \\"... women like... Fender bass player Carol Kaye... could do anything and leave men in the dust.\\" Brian Wilson has said that Kaye's playing on the \\"Good Vibrations\\" sessions was a key part of the arrangement he wanted. \\"Carol played bass with a pick that clicked real good. It worked out really well. It gave it a hard sound.\\" Dr. John has said that Kaye \\"is a sweetheart as well as a kick-ass bass player\\". Despite being admired as one of the studio greats, Kaye never expected to be well-remembered. At the time of the sessions, most of the players thought pop music would not last longer than ten years, and she is surprised that people still listen to tracks that she played on. Although the Amazon hit series The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel paid homage to Kaye and her career with the character of Carole Keen, introduced in season three and played by Liza Weil, Kaye described the character as \\"having nothing to do with me or my history. They took a few things out of my book and created a character that's not even me at all.\\" In 2020, Rolling Stone magazine ranked Kaye number five in its list of the 50 greatest bassists of all time. Personal life Kaye was raised a Baptist, but practiced Judaism in the early 1960s. She has been married three times and has two living children. Selected discography Kaye played on hundreds of commercially released recordings and soundtracks.

It concerns Sammy, a man who pretends to be deaf and mute, when in reality he can hear and speak perfectly well. The movie starred Matthew Modine and James Earl Jones. Based on the novel What the Deaf Mute Heard by G.D. Gearino. The Ira Gershwin/Kurt Weill song \\"My Ship\\" (sung by Bernadette Peters) is heard at the end of the film, as Sammy listens to a music box. Plot summary Helen Ayers and her young son Sammy board a intercity bus to move to a better life. Sammy‚Äôs curious questions annoy Helen but she won‚Äôt reveal the surprise and admonishes him to be silent, putting him to sleep. At a rest stop, Helen goes into a bar to get a drink but is dragged into a vacant lot and murdered as the bus leaves. Sammy sleeps through the night until the bus arrives at the end of the route, Barrington, Georgia. When a despondent Sammy ignores him, the cynical bus driver believes he is deaf and abandoned by his mother. Norm Jenkins, the kindhearted terminal manager, takes an immediate liking to Sammy and is very protective, as is Lucille, the owner and cook at the terminal‚Äôs cafe. Norm sees Sammy and Lucille as his surrogate son and wife as he had lost his own family to the Influenza pandemic of 1918. Young Tolliver Tynan stops with his adopted sister, Tallasse, and mother, Maddie, to watch Sammy being questioned by the police chief and tries to spook Sammy by lighting a cherry bomb. Sammy sees Tolliver‚Äôs activity in a reflection and steels himself to not react to the blast, which convinces the entire town that he is in fact deaf. Norm sets up Sammy to sleep in the storage room. Looking through Helen‚Äôs suitcase left on the bus, Norm finds important documents. Sammy spends the next decades living in the terminal and working as the town‚Äôs handyman, hearing various secrets from people who believe him to be deaf. Norm backtracks along the route of the bus and eventually tracks down Helen‚Äôs cold case. Tallasse has returned after years away with dreams of becoming a professional photographer. Tolliver is still arrogant and patronizing as the treasurer of the town church. As his inheritance is tied up in a trust until his mother dies, he has various unsuccessful moneymaking schemes, all financed by funds he has embezzled from the church. Sammy hears all of Tolliver's secrets. Black junk dealer Archibald Thacker and his sons masquerade as poor but are actually Harvard-educated businessmen as well as moonshine runners. They scheme to temporarily store a shipment of the liquor in the church‚Äôs large, new baptismal font. The Tynan house hosts the church‚Äôs newly ordained and unsure preacher, Reverend Pruitt. Seeing a newspaper article where a rock & roll group, the Weevils, claimed to be bigger than God (inspired by Beatle John Lennon‚Äôs ‚ÄúMore popular than Jesus\\" remark), Pruitt is inspired to hold a record-burning event. The event grows out of control and gains a festive atmosphere. Embers from the bonfire ignite nearby fireworks, sending a skyrocket into the church and directly into the font full of alcohol, burning the church down. Tolliver is put on trial for his embezzlement as the church is revealed to be uninsured. Sammy is called as the first witness and everyone is surprised when he speaks. Tolliver‚Äôs mother collapses and dies from shock. Tolliver believes he is finally entitled to his inheritance. Norm reveals the notarized affidavit he found decades earlier in which Tolliver‚Äôs father identifies Sammy as his illegitimate son by Helen, born just before Tolliver. As firstborn, Sammy is the legal heir to the Tynan fortune according to the terms of the will. Tolliver is sentenced to jail. Sammy gives away much of his newfound wealth to charity as well as to Norm and Lucille. He boards a bus to begin exploring the country. Tallasse chases down the bus in her car and joins Sammy on his trip.

It met from February 15, 1819, to July 31, 1821, when the Congress of C√∫cuta began its sessions. It consisted of twenty- six delegates representing Venezuela and New Granada (today Colombia).  Historical background  Important parts of the countries were still under Spanish rule, so elections only took place in the areas of southern Venezuela and Margarita Island controlled by the patriot forces. The delegates from New Granada were chosen from among the exiles fighting alongside the Venezuelan patriots. At its first meeting on February 19, 1819, Bolivar gave his famous Address at Angostura, but not all of the proposals contained in it were accepted (most notably the suggestions of a highly exalted ceremonial president-for-life who would govern through powerful ministers accountable to parliament and a hereditary senate, both modeled on the British example, and a \\"fourth\\" branch of government, the \\"moral\\" one, loosely modeled on the Classical Areopagus). The Congress of Angostura is considered Venezuela's second legislative congress, the first being the one that met in 1811. Its culminating piece of legislation was the Venezuelan Constitution of 1819, officially adopted on August 15, but quickly made obsolete by the creation of the Republic of Colombia on December 17, 1819. This new nation joined Venezuela, New Granada and Quito (today Ecuador). In order to differentiate it from the present Republic of Colombia, historians have traditionally called the nation Gran Colombia. A constitution for the new nation was created at the Congress of C√∫cuta in August 1821. The congress established three large departments for the new country: Venezuela (corresponding to the modern country of Venezuela), Cundinamarca (what today is Colombia, Panama and some parts of Central America) and Quito (today Ecuador). Simon Bol√≠var was elected president, Francisco Antonio Zea vice president, Juan Germ√°n Roscio vice president of Venezuela and Francisco de Paula Santander vice president of Cundinamarca. The Fundamental Law of the Republic of Colombia (1819) = Contents of the Fundamental Law = On December 17, 1819, the Fundamental Law of the Republic of ColombiaDucoudray Holstein (1830), pp. 271-273 (Ley Fundamental de Colombia,Archivo del Libertador, Caracas. Tomo 27, fol. 1 / Estante C, Cuerpo 1, tramo VI. in Spanish) was enacted by the congressmen in the city of Angostura (nowadays Ciudad Bol√≠var). It consisted on fourteen articles in which the Republic of Gran Colombia established its political structure, considering the fact that \\"the provinces of Venezuela and New Grenada (sic)\\" are \\"united in a single republic\\" that could not stand if divided in two different nations, even if they are \\"united by the closes ties\\". Therefore, the birth of Gran Colombia would be created \\"by necessity and mutual interest\\". Basically, the document explained how Colombia was going to be as an independent nation, in relation to the reasons that motivated the political union of Venezuela and New Granada. Then, the Fundamental Law of the Republic of Colombia is as follows: # From 1819, the Republic of Colombia is created from the fusion of Venezuela and New Granada, both nations with republican system. # The captain-generalship of Venezuela and the viceroyalty of New Granada join together their territories, which comprise \\"an extent of a hundred and fifteen thousand square leagues\\". # The national debt of Colombia consolidates \\"in solidum\\" the debts of both Venezuela and New Granada debts. # The executive power is in the hands of the president and the vice-president, \\"both to be provisionally appointed by the present congress\\". # Venezuela, Quito and Cundinamarca are the three great departments of the Gran Colombia; the name of the last one substitutes the old New Granada.

His main field of research is on the history of modern and contemporary witchcraft and magic. His interest in the history of witchcraft and magic developed out of a childhood interest in folklore and mythology, which was spawned in part from reading the books of Alan Garner. From around the age of sixteen, he also became interested in archaeology and began to get involved with field-walking and earthwork surveying. He then went on to study archaeology and history at Cardiff University and spent many weeks over the next six years helping excavate Bronze Age and Neolithic sites in France and England, mostly in the area around Avebury. He developed a strong interest in archaeology in general, and the ritual monuments and practices of the Neolithic and Bronze Age. From Cardiff, he went on to write a doctorate at Lancaster University, and worked on a thesis looking at the continuation and decline of popular belief in witchcraft and magic from the Witchcraft Act 1735 to the Fraudulent Mediums Act 1951 (1991‚Äì1994).

Several nations have experimented with prototypes, notably the Soviet Union during the tenure of Nikita Khrushchev (projects Object 167, Object 137Ml, Object 155Ml, Object 287, Object 775), but only the West German Jaguar 2 saw service as a standard vehicle, although the Soviet IT-1 missile tank also saw limited service. The term is sometimes applied more loosely to conventional tanks which are able to launch anti-tank guided missiles, to supplement their main gun for very long-range fire. Examples are the U.S.-German prototype MBT-70, the defunct U.S. M551 Sheridan and French AMX-13, and several Soviet, Russian, and Ukrainian tanks: T-64, T-72, T-80, T-84, T-90 and T-14. Some of the T-55's currently in use with the Peruvian Army also seem to have racks with missiles fitted to their turrets. A Polish combat engineering version of the Soviet T-55A main battle tank was also equipped with PW-LWD rockets. Although these were actually a rapid breaching system and not a weapon as such.

SATS controls about 80% of Changi Airport's ground handling and catering business. SATS provides gateway and food services in Asia. SATS food services comprises airline catering, food distribution and logistics, industrial catering and linen and laundry services. Its gateway services span airfreight, baggage and ramp handling, passenger services, aviation security, cargo, warehousing, perishables handling to cruise handling and terminal management. SATS subsidiaries includes SATS Airport Services, SATS Catering, SATS Security Services, Aero Laundry & Linen Services, Aerolog Express, Country Foods Pte Ltd. and Singapore Food Industries. History =Origin= The history of SATS can be traced back to the very beginning of commercial aviation in Singapore. In the early years, ground-handling services were provided by a department of Malayan Airways, which became Malaysia-Singapore Airlines (MSA) in 1967. Five years later, MSA ceased operations and paved the way for two new entities ‚Äî Singapore Airlines (SIA) and Malaysian Airline System (MAS). As SIA concentrated on its core business of running an airline, the establishment of SATS as a separate, yet wholly owned subsidiary company evolved naturally. On 15 December 1972, SATS was formally corporatised with 1,673 staff. By the end of the first year, staff numbers rose to 2,000 while gross revenue increased by 25 per cent. =Early history= In 1977, SATS opened an airfreight terminal at Paya Lebar Airport capable of handling 160,000 tonnes of cargo a year. In 1980, SATS made the move to Singapore's new Changi Airport after investing S$147 million in a new headquarters building, a new inflight catering centre, which at that time was the largest single-building inflight kitchen in the world, and two new airfreight terminals. By the mid-1980s, SATS was able to handle about 20,000 passengers a day at Changi Airport, a 60 per cent increase over the 12,700 passengers handled daily at Paya Lebar Airport in 1980. Cargo also registered double-digit growth rates. In 1985, SATS was restructured into four companies so that it could better manage demand for its services. Singapore Airport Terminal Services became the parent company and subsidiaries were formed out of the four operating divisions: Apron Services, Cargo Services, Passenger Services and Catering. In 1989, SATS added two new airfreight terminals and invested in new passenger handling equipment for Changi Airport's Terminal 2. This increased its passenger handling capacity to more than 20 million passengers a year. =1992-2009= In 1992, three companies within SATS ‚Äî Apron, Cargo and Passenger Services ‚Äî were merged to form a new company, SATS Airport Services (SAS). This consolidation was designed to improve co-ordination and communication, and strengthen the SATS Group's competitiveness. Over the next four years, an express courier centre, capable of handling 40,000 tonnes of cargo a year, was opened along with the S$215 million Airfreight Terminal 5, the S$172 million Inflight Catering Centre 2 and a S$40 million SATS Maintenance Centre. At the end of the 1999-2000 financial year, SATS owned and operated five airfreight terminals with a combined handling capacity of 1.3 million tonnes of cargo a year and two catering centres capable of producing 27 million meals a year. A second Express Courier Centre for partner DHL Worldwide Express, costing S$30 million, was completed in December 2001. In the first quarter of 2001, a sixth airfreight terminal costing S$270 million with a handling capacity of 800,000 tonnes of cargo per annum commenced operations. 2003 saw the launch of SATS' web-based system, CargoNet, to further complement its cargo tracking service. It also upgraded the materials handling system in Airfreight Terminals 1 to 4 to improve cargo handling efficiency and equipment serviceability. In July 2005, SATS launched a range of new products and service upgrades. On 2 January 2008, SATS sold the Express Courier Centre Two (ECC2) to DHL Express. 1st re-branding exercise SATS underwent a re-branding exercise in Apr 2007, adopting a completely new brand identity after bearing the SIA ‚Äòbird' logo for many decades. =2010-present= In December 2010, SATS Ltd completed the acquisition of Japan Airlines International's entire stake of 50.7 per cent in TFK Corporation. The 7.8 billion yen (S$122 million) purchase, was fully satisfied in cash and funded through debt through its wholly owned subsidiary SATS Investments Pte Ltd (SIPL). Following the completion, SIPL now owns 504,195 shares in TFK and has voting rights of 53.8 per cent. On 25 October 2011, SATS announced that it will be selling Daniels Group to Hain Celestial Group. On 23 December 2011, the SATS-Creuers consortium (a joint venture between SATS Ltd. (SATS) and Creuers del Port de Barcelona S.A. (Creuers)) won the bid to manage the new Marina Bay Cruise Centre Singapore. SATS-Creuers beat out competition from the Singapore Cruise Centre (SCC), the incumbent cruise port operator in Singapore, which operates the existing facilities at HarbourFront and Jurong Port. 2nd re-branding exercise SATS used to be part of the Singapore Airlines Group and was divested from SIA on 1 Sep 2009. On 08 January 2010, it unveiled a new uniform for its front-line staff at the Singapore Changi Airport. The uniform change is SATS‚Äô eleventh since 1973. The company also changed its name from \\"Singapore Airport Terminal Services Limited (Simplified Chinese:Êñ∞Âä†Âù°Êú∫Âú∫Ëà™Á´ôÊúçÂä°ÊúâÈôêÂÖ¨Âè∏)\\" to \\"SATS Ltd. (Simplified Chinese:Êñ∞ÁøîÈõÜÂõ¢ÊúâÈôêÂÖ¨Âè∏)\\" on 30 July 2010. On 7 June 2011, SATS unveiled a new brand identity. The group was initially engaged in ground handling and airline catering in Singapore. It has since transformed itself into Asia's largest gateway services and aviation food services network and has operations at 35 airports in 10 countries. Gateway Services SATS Gateway Services encompass Passenger Services, Ramp and Baggage Handling, Cargo Handling, Aviation Security, Aircraft Interior Cleaning and Cargo Delivery and Management. SATS runs ground handling and airline catering operations at nearly 44 airports across Asia Pacific and the Middle East.

Following the acquisition, it was renamed as SATS HK Limited on 7 April 2009. SATS HK is one of the four ground handling agents at the Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA). It is also one of the four licensed ramp handlers at HKIA. SATS HK provides passenger and ramp handling services including baggage handling, load control and flight operations to 11 airlines. Amongst its key customers are American Airlines, Asiana Airlines, Etihad Airways, HK Express and Hong Kong Airlines.http://www.satshk.com/index.php/en/about/customer-airlines =Asia- Pacific Star= In March 2009, SATS launched a low-cost ground handling services under a new wholly owned subsidiary, Asia-Pacific Star. Together with the low-cost inflight catering unit, SATS serves the growing low-cost segment of the airline market. =Affinity Membership= The ‚ÄúAffinity‚Äù Membership, by Singapore Airport Terminal Services Ltd (SATS), offers passenger preferential check-in services at their specially designated ‚ÄúAffinity‚Äù check-in counters and the use of SATS Premier Club lounges available in all terminals of Singapore Changi Airport as well as the lifestyle ‚ÄúRainforest‚Äù lounge in Terminal 1, regardless of the class of travel. Since 2015, the Rainforest lounge has been taken over by Plaza Premier Group's Plaza Premier Lounge. =Coolport @ Changi= On 18 August 2009, SATS announced its plans to launch Coolport @ Changi, Singapore's first on-airport perishables handling centre, in mid-2010. Costing approximately S$16 million to build, Coolport @ Changi will be the first dedicated on-airport facility in Singapore for handling terminal and transit perishables cargo within the Free Trade Zone. Located within SATS Airfreight Terminal 2, Coolport @ Changi will have an annual operating capacity of around 250,000 tonnes, with scope for expansion from the current 8,000 square metres to 14,000 square metres. Services include Warehousing and Distribution, Live Tanking, Inventory Management & Control, and Ripening facilities. Food SATS' \\"Food solutions\\" comprises in-flight catering, food logistics, industrial catering as well as chilled and frozen food manufacturing, and airline linen and laundry.

Colombo was born in New York City, where his father was an early member of what was then the Profaci crime family. In 1961, the First Colombo War unfolded, instigated by the kidnapping of four high-ranking members in the Profaci family by Joe Gallo. Later that year, Gallo was imprisoned, and in 1962, family leader Joe Profaci died of cancer. In 1963, Bonanno crime family boss, Joseph Bonanno made plans with Joseph Magliocco to assassinate several rivals on The Commission. When Magliocco gave the contract to one of his top hit men, Colombo, he revealed the plot to its targets. The Commission spared Magliocco's life but forced him into retirement, while Bonanno fled to Canada. As a reward for turning on his boss, Colombo was awarded the Profaci family. His only jail term would come in 1966, when Colombo was sentenced to 30 days in jail for contempt by refusing to answer questions from a grand jury about his financial affairs. In 1970, Colombo created the Italian-American Civil Rights League. Later that year, the first Italian Unity Day rally was held in Columbus Circle to protest the federal persecution of all Italians everywhere. In 1971, Gallo was released from prison, and Colombo invited Gallo to a peace meeting with an offering of $1,000, to which Gallo refused, instigating the Second Colombo War. On June 28, 1971, Colombo was shot three times by Jerome A. Johnson, one being in the head, at the second Italian Unity Day rally in Columbus Circle sponsored by the Italian-American Civil Rights League; Johnson was immediately killed by Colombo's bodyguards. Colombo was paralyzed from the shooting. On May 22, 1978, Colombo died of cardiac arrest. Early life Joseph Colombo Sr. was born into an Italian American family on June 16, 1923, in Brooklyn. His father, Anthony Colombo, was an early member of the Profaci crime family, which would eventually be renamed after his son. In 1938, he was found strangled in a car with his mistress. Joe Colombo attended New Utrecht High School in Brooklyn for two years, then dropped out to join the U.S. Coast Guard. In 1945, he was diagnosed with neurosis and discharged from the service. His legitimate jobs included ten years as a longshoreman and six years as a salesman for a meat company. His final job was that of a real estate salesman. Colombo owned a modest home in Dyker Heights, Brooklyn and a five-acre estate in Blooming Grove, New York. He married Lucille Faiello in 1944, and had five children including sons Christopher Colombo, Joseph Colombo Jr. (1946‚Äì2014) and Anthony Colombo (1945‚Äì2017). First Colombo War Colombo followed his father into the Profaci family. He became one of the family's top enforcers, and soon became a capo. On February 27, 1961, the Gallos kidnapped four of Profaci's top men: underboss Magliocco, Frank Profaci (Joe Profaci's brother), capo Salvatore Musacchia and soldier John Scimone. Profaci himself eluded capture and flew to sanctuary in Florida.Cage, Nicholas (July 17, 1972) \\"Part II The Mafia at War\\" New York pp.27-36 While holding the hostages, Larry and Albert Gallo sent Joe Gallo to California. The Gallos demanded a more favorable financial scheme for the hostages' release. Gallo wanted to kill one hostage and demand $100,000 before negotiations, but his brother Larry overruled him. After a few weeks of negotiation, Profaci made a deal with the Gallos. Profaci's consigliere Charles \\"the Sidge\\" LoCicero negotiated with the Gallos and all the hostages were released peacefully.Capeci (2001), p.303 However, Profaci had no intention of honoring this peace agreement. On August 20, 1961 Joseph Profaci ordered the murder of Gallo members Joseph \\"Joe Jelly\\" Gioielli and Larry Gallo. Gunmen allegedly murdered Gioilli after inviting him to go fishing. Larry Gallo survived a strangulation attempt in the Sahara club of East Flatbush by Carmine Persico and Salvatore \\"Sally\\" D'Ambrosio after a police officer intervened.Raab (2006), pp.321-324 The Gallo brothers had been previously aligned with Persico against Profaci and his loyalists; The Gallos then began calling Persico \\"The Snake\\" after he had betrayed them. the war continued on resulting in nine murders and three disappearances. With the start of the gang war, the Gallo crew retreated to the Dormitory. In late November 1961, Joe Gallo was sentenced to seven-to-fourteen years in prison for murder.Capeci (2001) p.305 On June 6, 1962, Profaci died and was succeeded by longtime underboss Joseph Magliocco. In 1963, Joseph Bonanno, the head of the Bonanno crime family, made plans to assassinate several rivals on the Mafia Commission‚Äîbosses Tommy Lucchese, Carlo Gambino, and Stefano Magaddino, as well as Frank DeSimone.Staff (September 1, 1967) \\"The Mob: How Joe Bonanno Schemed to kill ‚Äì and lost\\" Life p.15-21 Bonanno sought Magliocco's support, and Magliocco readily agreed. Not only was he bitter from being denied a seat on the Commission, but Bonanno and Profaci had been close allies for over 30 years prior to Profaci's death. Bonanno's audacious goal was to take over the Commission and make Magliocco his right hand man. Magliocco was assigned the task of killing Lucchese and Gambino, and gave the contract to one of his top hit men, Colombo. However, the opportunistic Colombo revealed the plot to its targets. The other bosses quickly realized that Magliocco could not have planned this himself. Remembering how close Bonanno was with Magliocco (and before him, Profaci), as well as their close ties through marriages, the other bosses concluded Bonanno was the real mastermind. The Commission summoned Bonanno and Magliocco to explain themselves. Fearing for his life, Bonanno went into hiding in Montreal, leaving Magliocco to deal with the Commission. Badly shaken and in failing health, Magliocco confessed his role in the plot. The Commission spared Magliocco's life, but forced him to retire as Profaci family boss and pay a $50,000 fine. As a reward for turning on his boss, Colombo was awarded the Profaci family. At the age of 41, Colombo was one of the youngest crime bosses in the country. He was also the first American-born boss of a New York crime family. When NYPD detective Albert Seedman (later the NYPD chief of detectives) called Colombo in for questioning about the death of one of his soldiers, Colombo came to the meeting without a lawyer. He told Seedman, \\"I am an American citizen, first class. I don't have a badge that makes me an official good guy like you, but I work just as honest for a living.\\"Raab, Selwyn. The Five Families: The Rise, Decline & Resurgence of America's Most Powerful Mafia Empire. New York: St. Martins Press, 2005. p. 187 On May 9, 1966, Colombo was sentenced to 30 days in jail for contempt by refusing to answer questions from a grand jury about his financial affairs. Italian-American Civil Rights League In April 1970, Colombo created the Italian-American Civil Rights League, the month his son Joseph Colombo Jr. was charged with melting down coins for resale as silver ingots. In response, Joseph Colombo Sr. claimed FBI harassment of Italian-Americans and, on April 30, 1970, sent 30 picketers outside FBI headquarters at Third Avenue and 69th Street to protest the federal persecution of all Italians everywhere; this went on for weeks. On June 29, 1970, 50,000 people attended the first Italian Unity Day rally in Columbus Circle in New York City. In February 1971, Colombo Jr. was acquitted of the charge after the chief witness in the trial had been arrested on perjury charges. Under Colombo's guidance, the League grew quickly and achieved national attention. Unlike other mob leaders who shunned the spotlight, Colombo appeared on television interviews, fundraisers and speaking engagements for the League. In 1971, Colombo aligned the League with Rabbi and political activist Meir Kahane's Jewish Defense League, claiming that both groups were being harassed by the federal government. At one point, Colombo posted bail for 11 jailed JDL members. =The Godfather movie= In the spring of 1971, Paramount Pictures started filming The Godfather with the assistance of Colombo and the League. Due to its subject matter, the film originally faced great opposition from Italian-Americans to filming in New York. However, after producer Albert Ruddy met with Colombo and agreed to excise the terms \\"Mafia\\" and \\"Cosa Nostra\\" from the film, the League cooperated fully. Shooting In early 1971, Joe Gallo was released from prison. As a supposedly conciliatory gesture, Colombo invited Gallo to a peace meeting with an offering of $1,000. Gallo refused the invitation, wanting $100,000 to stop the conflict, to which Colombo refused. At that point, acting boss Vincenzo Aloi issued a new order to kill Gallo. On March 11, 1971, after being convicted of perjury for lying on his application to become a real estate broker, Colombo was sentenced to two and half years in state prison. The sentence, however, was delayed pending an appeal. On June 28, 1971, Colombo was shot three times by Jerome A. Johnson, one being in the head, at the second Italian Unity Day rally in Columbus Circle sponsored by the Italian- American Civil Rights League; Johnson was immediately killed by Colombo's bodyguards. Death and aftermath Colombo was paralyzed from the shooting. On August 28, 1971, after two months at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan, Colombo was moved to his estate at Blooming Grove. In 1975, a court-ordered examination showed that Colombo could move his thumb and forefinger on his right hand. In 1976, there were reports that he could recognize people and utter several words. On May 22, 1978, Colombo died of cardiac arrest at St. Luke's Hospital (later St. Luke's Cornwall Hospital) in Newburgh, New York. Colombo's funeral was held at St Bernadette's Catholic Church in Bensonhurst and he was buried in Saint John Cemetery in the Middle Village section of Queens. Although many in the Colombo family blamed Joe Gallo for the shooting, the police eventually concluded that Johnson was a lone gunman after they had questioned Gallo. Since Johnson had spent time a few days earlier at a Gambino club, one theory was that Carlo Gambino organized the shooting. Colombo refused to listen to Gambino's complaints about the League, and allegedly spat in Gambino's face during one argument. However, the Colombo family leadership was convinced that Joe Gallo ordered the murder after his falling out with the family. Gallo was murdered on April 7, 1972. After the Colombo shooting, Joseph Yacovelli became the acting boss for one year before Carmine Persico took over.

Iron is almost always present and a solid solution exists between Mg-rich cordierite and Fe-rich sekaninaite with a series formula: (,)2() to (,)2(). A high-temperature polymorph exists, indialite, which is isostructural with beryl and has a random distribution of Al in the (,)6 rings. Name and discovery Cordierite, which was discovered in 1813, in specimens from N√≠jar, Almer√≠a (Spain) is named after the French geologist Louis Cordier (1777‚Äì1861). Occurrence Cordierite typically occurs in contact or regional metamorphism of pelitic rocks. It is especially common in hornfels produced by contact metamorphism of pelitic rocks. Two common metamorphic mineral assemblages include sillimanite-cordierite-spinel and cordierite-spinel-plagioclase-orthopyroxene. Other associated minerals include garnet (cordierite-garnet-sillimanite gneisses) and anthophyllite. Cordierite also occurs in some granites, pegmatites, and norites in gabbroic magmas. Alteration products include mica, chlorite, and talc. Cordierite occurs, for example, in the granite contact zone at Geevor Tin Mine in Cornwall. Commercial use Catalytic converters are commonly made from ceramics containing a large proportion of synthetic cordierite. The manufacturing process deliberately aligns the cordierite crystals to make use of the very low thermal expansion along one axis. This prevents thermal shock cracking from taking place when the catalytic converter is used. Gem variety As the transparent variety iolite, it is often used as a gemstone. The name \\"iolite\\" comes from the Greek word for violet. Another old name is dichroite, a Greek word meaning \\"two-colored rock\\", a reference to cordierite's strong pleochroism. It has also been called \\"water-sapphire\\" and \\"Vikings' Compass\\" because of its usefulness in determining the direction of the sun on overcast days, the Vikings having used it for this purpose. This works by determining the direction of polarization of the sky overhead. Light scattered by air molecules is polarized, and the direction of the polarization is at right angles to a line to the sun, even when the sun's disk itself is obscured by dense fog or lies just below the horizon. Gem quality iolite varies in color from sapphire blue to blue violet to yellowish gray to light blue as the light angle changes. Iolite is sometimes used as an inexpensive substitute for sapphire. It is much softer than sapphires and is abundantly found in Australia (Northern Territory), Brazil, Burma, Canada (Yellowknife area of the Northwest Territories), India, Madagascar, Namibia, Sri Lanka, Tanzania and the United States (Connecticut). The largest iolite crystal found weighed more than 24,000 carats, and was discovered in Wyoming, US.Topix Local News: Casper, WY, Wyoming is Most Gemstone-Rich State in US, Sept. 13, 2011 File:Cordierite.jpgLeft: rough specimen showing dichroism; right: cut stone File:Iolite.JPGFacet cut Iolite gemstone File:Cordierite_pl√©ochro√Øsme.jpgPleochroism of Cordierite Another name for blue iolite is steinheilite, after Fabian Steinheil, the Russian military governor of Finland who observed that it was a different mineral from quartz..

It takes its name from, and is best known for its use by, Colin Chapman of Lotus. The characteristic feature of the Chapman strut is a long upright strut combining a coil spring and shock absorber, with a universal-jointed drive shaft itself forming the lower link of the suspension.  Origins  = Stout Scarab = The design's origin lies with William Stout's 1932 Stout Scarab. This rear-engined car used swing axle independent rear suspension, with long near-vertical coilover struts from high mounting points on the space frame chassis. Stout had also been an aircraft designer and considered that the long-travel oleo struts made, 'the airplane landing gear [is] the easiest type of running gear for comfort yet devised.' The lower ends of the struts were attached to the swing axle casings by swivel bushes. Forward radius rods handled the longitudinal forces. = MacPherson strut = In 1947 Earle MacPherson patented the MacPherson strut for use on the Chevrolet Cadet. This was the first true strut suspension for cars: the stub axle was rigidly fixed to the strut, thus always keeping the same angle with it, rather than being attached through a swivelling joint as for Stout's Scarab. MacPherson's strut took advantage of the unitary car bodies appearing in new factories after World War II: the strut requires a high top mounting point, which would be difficult to arrange for a ladder chassis, but is also advantageous for unitary construction as it distributes suspension loads over a greater volume of the bodyshell. New car designs were also lighter and faster than pre-war cars, a cheap mass- production car now having performance that would previously have been the preserve of an expensive sports car. Drivers demanded roadholding and comfort that required independent front suspension. MacPherson's strut was cheap to manufacture and reliable in service, having few moving joints and using the new telescopic shock absorbers, rather than the previous lever arms. MacPherson's strut also integrated an anti-roll bar, not only for control of body roll but also re-using it as an integral part of the suspension and so avoiding the need for a wishbone or radius rod in favour of a simple track control arm. The MacPherson strut appears to have had little influence on Chapman at this time (although he would later use it unsuccessfully for the front suspension of his Lotus 17). Double wishbone suspension was already well-established for the front of high-performance cars. A front strut would also have required much greater height than was available in a racing car. = Goggomobil = In 1957, the lightweight Goggomobil used a similar suspension design to the Scarab. Much simpler though, the Goggomobil had bare drive shafts that also acted as the suspension links, with suspension forces passing through the inboard Hooke joints. The swing axle shafts were only carried by the trailing radius rods, rather than an axle casing, and the long struts were shortened to a simple coilover shock absorber. = Chapman's design = Lotus Twelve. The strut spring, driveshaft below and radius rod can just be seen In 1956 Chapman was using de Dion rear axles for his Lotus racing cars and also the Vanwall. These had initially used transverse leaf springs, but later changed to coilover shock absorbers. Chapman had identified some of the de Dion's disadvantages as including its high unsprung weight, the need for sliding splines in the rear driveshafts, and also (a typical Chapman fixation) its insensitivity to changes in weight as fuel is consumed. The first Lotus Twelve Formula 2 cars used the same system, although the de Dion's mass was a drawback for a lightweight single-seater racing car. At a 750 Motor Club meeting in 1957, Chapman saw the Goggomobil system and was impressed by its Lotus-like simplicity and light weight. The use of the drive shafts for both drive and as a suspension component appealed to Chapman, who always favoured solutions that could make one component do double duty. Chapman struts were introduced in Lotus' first single-seater car, the Lotus Twelve. This was developed as a 1.5-litre Formula 2 in 1957, but re-engined in 1958 it also competed in Formula 1. This same car also introduced Lotus' wobbly-web wheel. There were two differences from these precursors to the Chapman strut. As the Lotus Twelve had inboard disk brakes, there was no need to pass the braking torque through the radius rods. Chapman also avoided the swing axle and its camber changes with suspension travel, in favour of a drive shaft with two universal joints. The connection between the hub carrier and the shock absorber base was made rigid, making the spring unit into a strut and also controlling the camber angle. Using the drive shaft itself to control the rear track meant that the shaft could be of fixed length, avoiding the need for a sliding spline joint and its stiction problems. Chapman applied for a patent on his strut design on 13 June 1957. The Chapman strut also appeared on the Lotus Sixteen of 1958. In 1959 this design was revised to use a lower wishbone. This in turn required a return to a sliding joint in the drive shaft.  Comparison to the MacPherson strut  The Chapman strut is often confused with the MacPherson strut, as both use a near-vertical upper strut, The distinction is that the MacPherson strut always requires a lower track control arm where the Chapman uses the drive shaft and a light radius rod. As it requires a drive shaft, the Chapman strut can only be used at the driven end of the vehicle. For the Lotus designs to which it was applied, this was their rear. MacPherson struts are most commonly used for front suspension and the strut axis forms the kingpin bearing, for steering movement. There is little reason why a Chapman strut could not be used similarly, although there is no record of this being tried on a front-wheel or four-wheel drive car. Both designs are struts, where the strut base is rigidly attached to the hub carrier. Chapman did use MacPherson struts for the front suspension of the Lotus 17. These were unsuccessful, owing to the stiction problems that Chapman had worked to avoid with the sliding drive shaft joint. A wishbone conversion kit was later developed by ex-Lotus engineer Len Terry.  Applications  Lotus 16 Grand Prix car Note the height of the rear strut = Racing cars = :* Lotus Twelve :* Lotus 15 :* Lotus Sixteen :* Lotus 17 = Road cars = Lotus Elan backbone chassis Lotus road cars after the Twelve also used the Chapman strut for rear suspension. These included the fibreglass platform-chassis Elite and the backbone chassis Elan. Chapman struts, and their wide separation of load paths into the chassis, were a good fit to a stressed-skin structure such as the Elite and may have been an influence on its choice. They were less appropriate for a backbone chassis, requiring broad outriggers to carry the strut top loads, an un-Chapman-like feature that added weight for only a single purpose and was difficult to make stiff enough. It has been suggested that the spring forces from these struts would have been better supported as torsion bars, which could then have been anchored to the main suspension spine. The mid- engined Europa used a modified version of the Chapman strut. Owing to the need to isolate the engine and transaxle from the chassis in order to reduce noise and vibration, the rubber mounts led to an excessive sideways movement of the driveshafts. In this case, sideways location of the hubs was controlled by an enlarged diagonal radius rod to the front. Rubber sandwich mounts were developed that allowed vertical movement whilst controlling lateral movement. Similar vibration problems were encountered with the Elite, but as these only had the vibration of the differential to control rather than engine vibration, it could be managed by suitable design of the rubber mounts. :* Lotus Elite (Lotus 14) :* Lotus Elan :* Lotus Europa  Successor designs  Lotus 18 with wishbone suspension The successful mid-engined Lotus 18 of 1960 no longer had the high bodywork behind the driver's seat on which to mount the tops of the struts. Instead it used a wishbone rear suspension with wide-based tube lower wishbones carrying coilover shocks. The upper wishbones though were, once again in the style of the Chapman strut, using the driveshafts themselves and a front radius rod. This is similar to the Jaguar independent rear suspension, which also uses the driveshafts as an upper control arm. The 2016 all wheel drive version of the Fiat 500X crossover based on the Jeep Renegade uses multi-link Chapman strut suspension at the rear, with MacPherson struts at the front. Although the driveshafts are a suspension link, making this a Chapman strut, there are additional transverse links as well.

During his time at Rockhurst College, he founded a chapter of the Catholic fraternity Alpha Delta Gamma. He worked in printing and publishing prior to entering the Society of Jesus in 1935, and was ordained a Roman Catholic priest in 1946. In 1941 Ong earned a master's degree in English at Saint Louis University. His thesis on sprung rhythm in the poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins (see An Ong Reader, 2002: 111-74) was supervised by the young Canadian Marshall McLuhan. Ong also received the degrees Licentiate of Philosophy and Licentiate of Sacred Theology from Saint Louis University. After completing his dissertation on the French logician and educational reformer Peter Ramus (1515-1572) and Ramism under the supervision of Perry Miller at Harvard University in 1954, Ong returned to Saint Louis University, where he would teach for the next 30 years. In 1955 he received his Ph.D. in English from Harvard University. In 1963 the French government honored Ong for his work on Ramus by dubbing him a knight, Chevalier de l'Ordre des Palmes acad√©miques. In 1966-1967 Ong served on the 14-member White House Task Force on Education that reported to President Lyndon Johnson. In 1971 Ong was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In April and May 1974, he served as Lincoln Lecturer, presenting lectures in French in Cameroun, Zaire, and Senegal and in English in Nigeria. In 1967 Ong served as president of the Milton Society of America. In 1978 Ong served as elected president of the Modern Language Association of America. He was very active on the lecture circuit as well as in professional organizations. Ong died in 2003 in St. Louis, Missouri. Summary of Ong's works and interests A major concern of Ong's works is the impact that the shift from orality to literacy has had on culture and education. Writing is a technology like other technologies (fire, the steam engine, etc.) that, when introduced to a \\"primary oral culture\\" (which has never known writing) has extremely wide-ranging impacts in all areas of life. These include culture, economics, politics, art, and more. Furthermore, even a small amount of education in writing transforms people's mentality from the holistic immersion of orality to interiorization and individuation. Many of the effects of the introduction of the technology of writing are related to the fact that oral cultures require strategies of preserving information in the absence of writing. These include, for example, a reliance on proverbs or condensed wisdom for making decisions, epic poetry, and stylized culture heroes (wise Nestor, crafty Odysseus). Writing makes these features no longer necessary, and introduces new strategies of remembering cultural material, which itself now changes. Because cultures at any given time vary along a continuum between full orality and full literacy, Ong distinguishes between primary oral cultures (which have never known writing), cultures with craft literacy (such as scribes), and cultures in a transition phase from orality to literacy, in which some people know of writing but are illiterate - these cultures have \\"residual orality\\". Some of Ong's interests: # the historical development of visualist tendencies in Western philosophic thought # the mathematical transformation of thought in medieval and early modern logic and beyond # oral cyclic thought, which is characteristic of primary oral cultures, versus linear or historical or evolutionary thought, which depends on writing # the movement from oral heroic poetry to mock-heroic poetry in print culture to the realist tradition in literature to the modern antihero # the historical development in manuscript culture and print culture of the inward turn of personalized ego- consciousness, or individuality # the new dimensions of orality fostered by modern communication media that accentuate sound, which Ong calls secondary orality as it succeeds from, relies on, and coexists with writing # the origins and development of the Western educational system # the role and effects of Learned Latin in Western culture Major works =Ramus, Method, and the Decay of Dialogue (1958)= According to Adrian Johns' foreword to the 2004 edition, Ong was urged to research Ramus after his graduate mentor, Marshall McLuhan had no particular interest in Ong's original subject, Gerard Manley Hopkins. McLuhan vigorously encouraged Ong's work, and eventually drew upon his former student's perspective on Ramism to write his own pivotal work, ‚ÄòThe Gutenberg Galaxy.‚Äô Johns, Adrian. Foreword. Ramus, Method, and the Decay of Dialogue. Chicago: U of Chicago P, 2004. v-xiii. Ramus, Method, and the Decay of Dialogue: From the Art of Discourse to the Art of Reason (1958) elaborates the contrast between the visual and the oral that Ong found in Louis Lavelle's La parole et l'ecriture (1942). Ong details how the spatialization and quantification of thought in dialectic and logic during the Middle Ages enabled \\"a new state of mind\\" to emerge in print culture, which is associated with the emergence of modern science. The companion volume, Ramus and Talon Inventory (1958) is a notable work that contributes to the field known today as book history. Therein, Ong briefly describes more than 750 volumes (mostly in Latin) that he had tracked down in more than 100 libraries in Europe. Peter Ramus (1515-1572), was a French humanist, logician, and educational reformer whose textbook method of analyzing subjects was very widely adopted in many academic fields. In \\"Ramist Classroom Procedure and the Nature of Reality\\" (Studies in English Literature, 1500‚Äì1900, Vol. 1, No. 1, The English Renaissance (Winter, 1961), pp. 31‚Äì47), Ong discusses Ramism as a transition phase between the Classical style of education and the modern one. He writes, \\"...Ramism might seem merely quaint, perhaps artistically lethal, but of no great importance. Yet its great spread will hardly allow us to regard it as educationally insignificant. As a matter of fact, it has educational significance of the headiest sort, for it implies no less than that it is the \\"arts\\" or curriculum subjects which hold the world together. Nothing is accessible for \\"use,\\" that is, for active intussusception (the assimilation of new material and its dispersal among preexistent matter) by the human being, until it has first been put through the curriculum. The schoolroom is by implication the doorway to reality, and indeed the only doorway.\\" (p. 47) =The Presence of the Word (1967)= The Presence of the Word: Some Prolegomena for Cultural and Religious History (1967) is an expanded version of his 1964 Terry Lectures at Yale University. It is a pioneering work in cultural studies and media ecology. He writes, \\"[my] works do not maintain that the evolution from primary orality through writing and print to an electronic culture, which produces secondary orality, causes or explains everything in human culture and consciousness. Rather, [my] thesis is relationist: major developments, and very likely even all major developments, in culture and consciousness, are related, often in unexpected intimacy, to the evolution of the word from primary orality to its present state. But the relationships are varied and complex, with cause and effect often difficult to distinguish\\" (Interfaces of the Word, 1977: 9-10). =Fighting for Life (1981)= Ong subsequently developed his observations regarding polemic in The Presence of the Word (192-286) in his book length study Fighting for Life: Contest, Sexuality, and Consciousness (1981), the published version of his 1979 Messenger Lectures at Cornell University. =Orality and Literacy (1982)= In Ong's most widely known work, Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing of the Word (1982), he attempts to identify the distinguishing characteristics of orality by examining thought and its verbal expression in societies where the technologies of literacy (especially writing and print) are unfamiliar to most of the population. Ong drew heavily on the work of Eric A. Havelock, who suggested a fundamental shift in the form of thought coinciding with the transition from orality to literacy in Ancient Greece. Ong describes writing as a technology that must be laboriously learned, and which effects the first transformation of human thought from the world of sound to the world of sight. This transition has implications for structuralism, deconstruction, speech-act and reader-response theory, the teaching of reading and writing skills to males and females, social studies, biblical studies, philosophy, and cultural history generally. =An Ong Reader (2002)= This 600-page selection of Ong's works is organized on the themes of orality and rhetoric. It includes his 1967 encyclopedia article on the \\"Written Transmission of Literature\\" (331-44); his most frequently cited article, his 1975 PMLA article \\"The Writer's Audience Is Always a Fiction\\" (405-27); and his most frequently reprinted article, his 1978 ADE Bulletin article \\"Literacy and Orality in Our Times\\" (465-78). Taken together, these three essays make up a coherent approach to the study of written literature against the background of oral tradition.

Coilover visible in the front suspension of a Microcar Virgo A coilover is an automobile suspension device. The name coilover is an abbreviation of \\"coil-over shock absorber\\". Description Coilovers are found on many vehicles, from RC cars to normal passenger cars, race cars and 4x4 vehicles. They are sometimes used as a factory suspension option on new cars. Coilovers are used in double wishbone suspension systems, and are often a component of MacPherson struts. Two of the main types of coilovers are full coilovers and slip-on coilovers. Full coilovers are matched up with a shock absorber from the factory, while with slip-on coilovers, the dampers and springs are bought separately and then assembled. There are a large number of companies who make aftermarket coilovers for vehicles, many of which allow the customer to adjust various settings such as ride height and damping. Camber and caster angles can also be adjusted if the car's suspension allows, and if the coilovers are supplied with adjustable top mounts. This high degree of adjustment is what gives coilovers an advantage over typical MacPherson struts. Coilovers can be used to lower the vehicle's centre of gravity, and to increase the roll stiffness of the vehicle to reduce weight transfer when the vehicle changes direction.  Components  A coilover consists of a damper with a coil spring encircling it. The damper and spring are assembled as a unit prior to installation, and are replaced as a unit when either of the sub-components fails. Some coilovers are adjustable. Most, if not all, adjustable coilovers have variable ride height and preload, adjusted using a simple threaded spring perch similar to a nut. Alternatively, the damper's threaded body is matched to a threaded bottom mount which allows ride height adjustment without affecting bump travel. Most coilovers also have adjustable dampers, which are usually adjusted with an adjustment knob on top of the damper. Stiffness can be changed by switching the spring for one with a different spring rate or by adjusting the stiffness of the damper. Coilovers are made up of several components, including the damper, coil spring, bushing, bump stops, upper and lower mounts, various nuts and washers, threaded sleeves, and collars. = Springs = The purpose of coilover springs is to prevent the chassis from bottoming out, support each individual wheel on the vehicle, and to mitigate or reduce body roll when taking turns and cornering, particularly at higher speeds. The springs also help to reduce squatting when accelerating and diving when decelerating. They are often used to adjust the vehicle's ride height, which directly affects handling and comfort.  Spring preload  Preload is the pressure exerted on a spring over the distance it is compressed. A higher preload means a stiffer spring and a lower preload results in a softer spring with more travel. This is true if the coilover uses progressive springs. On coilovers with linear springs preload has no effect on spring rate. More preload can increase grip when cornering, but too much preload can make a spring too stiff. In coilovers with adjustable spring seats, linear rate springs and no helper or tender springs, ride height must be adjusted through preload. This can present a problem for vehicles whose ride height needs to be lowered but whose springs are already stiff enough. = Dampers = A mono-tube coilover is a single piston and rod assembly in a damping case in which both compression and rebound occur. A larger mono-tube shock will be able to displace more hydraulic fluid, providing a more sensitive response to small suspension movements than twin-tube shocks. A twin-tube coilover is more complex than a mono-tube assembly. Twin-tubes have an inner cylinder which moves up and down, and an outer cylinder which serves as a hydraulic reserve. This design allows for an increase in suspension stroke, which provides better ride quality and handling. = Adjustable coilovers = Adjustable coilovers allow adjustment of the vehicle's suspension in four main areas: * Roll stiffness: By fitting springs with a higher spring rate, roll stiffness can be increased. Likewise, a lower spring rate results in increased roll. * Ride height: By using threaded spring seats or threaded bottom brackets, the ride height of the vehicle can be raised or lowered. The bottom mount is a threaded sleeve with two adjuster nuts that are used to preload the coils and increase or decrease ride height. * Compression and rebound: The stiffness of the compression and rebound of the suspension can be adjusted if the coilovers use adjustable dampers. Adjustable dampers fall into three main categories: those that adjust compression only, those that adjust rebound only, those that adjust rebound and compression in parallel, and those that are adjustable for rebound and compression independently. This later category can be split further into dampers that have low-speed adjustment and those that have independent high- and low-speed adjustment. An example of high speed in the context of suspension movement would be a car hitting a bump; an example of slow speed movement would be a car changing direction. * Camber and caster: Some coilover suspension kits may also be supplied with adjustable top mounts. Depending on the design of the car's suspension these top mounts can allow the adjustment of camber and/or caster. Some coilovers use the car's original top mounts and are therefore not adjustable.  Compression & rebound  Compression occurs when the piston inside the damper is moved inwards, increasing the pressure of the fluid in the chamber. Adjusting compression changes the motion of the vehicle's unsprung weight, modifying how quickly weight will shift downwards towards the wheel. Rebound is the result of the piston moving back after having been compressed, resulting in compression of the fluid once more. Adjustments made to rebound control the motion of the vehicle's sprung weight, changing how rapidly weight will be shifted away from the wheel.  Coilover Alternatives  Nitrogen charged struts can be used as a more stable alternative to coilovers since they do not unload or push off, increasing stability.

It has been used in some forms of traditional medicine. Preparation Piperine is extracted from black pepper by using dichloromethane. Aqueous hydrotropes can be used in the extraction to result in high yield and selectivity. The amount of piperine varies from 1‚Äì2% in long pepper, to 5‚Äì10% in commercial white and black peppers. Further, it may be prepared by treating the solvent-free residue from an alcoholic extract of black pepper, with a solution of potassium hydroxide to remove resin (said to contain chavicine, an isomer of piperine) and solution of the washed, insoluble residue in warm alcohol, from which the alkaloid crystallises on cooling. Reactions Piperine yields salts only with strong acids. The platinichloride B4¬∑H2PtCl6 forms orange-red needles (\\"B\\" denotes one mole of the alkaloid base in this and the following formula). Iodine in potassium iodide added to an alcoholic solution of the base in the presence of a little hydrochloric acid gives a characteristic periodide, B2¬∑HI¬∑I2, crystallising in steel-blue needles, melting point 145 ¬∞C. History Piperine was discovered in 1819 by Hans Christian √òrsted, who isolated it from the fruits of Piper nigrum, the source plant of both black and white pepper. Piperine was also found in Piper longum and Piper officinarum (Miq.) C. DC. (=Piper retrofractum Vahl), two species called \\"long pepper\\". Research A component of pungency by piperine results from activation of the heat- and acidity-sensing TRPV ion channels, TRPV1 and TRPA1, on nociceptors, the pain-sensing nerve cells. Piperine is under preliminary research for its potential to affect bioavailability of other compounds in food and dietary supplements, such as a possible effect on the bioavailability of curcumin.

Life Dughet was born in Rome, the son of a French pastry-cook and his Italian wife. He has always generally been considered as a French painter, although in fact he never visited France. In around 1635 he became a pupil of Nicolas Poussin, who had married his sister Anne five years earlier. Because of this connection he was widely known as \\"Gaspard Poussin\\" He specialised in painting landscapes of the Roman Campagna becoming, along with his exact contemporary Salvator Rosa, one of the two leading landscape painters of his time. He painted several cycles of frescoes, including one, showing various sites around Rome, at the Colonna Palace. He worked with Pier Francesco Mola, Cozza, and Mattia Preti at the Palazzo Pamphilj in Valmontone. He often collaborated with Guillaume Courtois who painted the staffage in his landscapes.

The Vandal king supported his cause, providing him money but no men, and in 510 and 511 the Vandal navy supported Gesalec's invasion of Spain. However, after receiving some stern letters from Theodoric, Thrasamund recognized he was no match for the Ostrogoths and withdrew his support for Gesalec, offering an apology and gold to Theodoric.Cassiodorus, Variae, 5.43-4; Wolfram, History of the Goths, p. 308 Abandoned by Thrasamund, Gesalec fled to Aquitania, where he remained for a year.

The Integrity brand name was inherited by HP from Tandem Computers via Compaq. In 2015 HP released the Superdome X line of Integrity Servers based on the x86 Architecture. It is a 'small' Box holding up to 8 dual Socket Blades and supporting up to 16 processors/240 cores (when populated with Intel Xeon E7-2890 or E7-2880 Processors). General Over the years, Integrity systems have supported Windows Server, HP-UX 11i, OpenVMS, NonStop, Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server operating systems on Integrity servers.. As of 2020 the operating systems that are supported are HP-UX 11i, OpenVMS and NonStop. Early Integrity servers were based on two closely related chipsets. The zx1 chipset supported up to 4 CPUs and up to 8 PCI-X busses. They consisted of three distinct application-specific integrated circuits; a memory and I/O controller, a scalable memory adapter and an I/O adapter. The PA-8800 and PA-8900 microprocessors use the same bus as the Itanium 2 processors, allowing HP to also use this chipset for the HP 9000 servers and C8000 workstations. The memory and I/O controller can be attached directly to up to 12 DDR SDRAM slots. If more slots than this are needed, two scalable memory adapters can be attached instead, allowing up to 48 memory slots. The chipset supports DIMM sizes up to 4 GB, theoretically allowing a machine to support up to 192 GB of RAM, although the largest supported configuration was 128 GB. The sx1000 chipset supported up to 64 CPUs and up to 192 PCI-X buses. The successor chipsets were the zx2 and sx2000 respectively.

This design allows the servers to be divided into hardware partitions, or groups of cell boards. Each partition is able to perform as if it were a separate server. =rx7600 series= The 10U rx7620 is based on the SX1000 chipset which supports both PA-RISC and Itanium 2 CPUs. The 10U rx7640 is based on the SX2000 chipset which supports both PA-RISC and Itanium 2 CPUs. * Maximum of 2 cell boards * 4 CPU sockets per cell board * 16 DIMM slots per cell board * Maximum of 4 SCSI disks and 2 tape and/or CD/DVD-ROM internally (half to each cell board) * 7 hot-pluggable I/O slots per cell board plus 1 core I/O slot per cell board for SX1000 The rx7600 series are the smallest cell-based servers from HP. Just like the bigger rx8600 (see below) and the HP Superdome (see below), these servers can be partitioned, either as one big partition (two cells in one partition) or as two independent cells. =rx8600 series= The 17U rx8620 is based on the SX1000 chipset which supports both PA-RISC and Itanium 2 CPUs. The 17U rx8640 is based on the SX2000 chipset which supports both PA-RISC and Itanium 2 CPUs. * The rx8620 was announced in 2003, along with the rx4640 and rx7620https://www.pcworld.com/article/113249/article.html * Maximum of four cell boards * Four CPU sockets per cell board * 16 DIMM slots per cell board * Maximum of four SCSI disks and two tape and/or CD/DVD-ROM internally (half to cell board 0, half to cell board 1) * Eight hot-pluggable I/O-slots per cell board and 1 core I/O slot per cell board for SX1000 Just like the smaller rx7600 (see above) and the HP Superdome (see below), the rx8600 can be partitioned using any combination of the four available cell boards (minimum of one, maximum of four separated partitions). The maximum number of partitions is four when used with an I/O-expander unit. Because each partition requires an available I/O slot, and the rx8600 series' integrated I/O-chassis statically maps its two I/O slots to cell board 0 and 1, an rx8600 series system is limited to two partitions unless an IOX is installed. Cells can be freely moved from a rx7600 series to a rx8600 series as long as the chipset is the same on the cells, and the firmware is compatible. High-end servers =Superdome= The Superdome server is available in several models, including the SD-16, SD-32, and SD-64. HP announced Superdome 2 in April 2010, offering resiliency improvements, a modular, bladed design, common components and crossbar fabric that routes transactions to the optimal pathway between blades and I/O. Superdome 2 addresses requirements for high-performance computing by providing flexible scalability and fault tolerance necessary for mission- critical workloads.http://www.networkcomputing.com/data-center/hps- superdome-2-bigger-badder-computing.php In November 2011 HP announced Project Odyssey, a development roadmap to unify server architectures on a single platform. The roadmap includes blades with Intel Xeon processors for the HP Superdome 2 enclosure (code name ‚ÄúDragonHawk‚Äù) and the scalable c-Class blade enclosures (code named ‚ÄúHydraLynx‚Äù), while supporting Windows and Linux environments with features from HP-UX within the next two years.

The court found that a statutory scheme requiring the approval of the Ontario Film Review Board before films can be distributed or shown in Ontario violated the guarantee of freedom of expression in section 2 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Background Bad Attitude is a lesbian magazine featuring stories of mild sado-masochism; it is published in the United States. In 1993 the magazine was the first publication to fall foul of feminist-inspired pornography laws in Canada. According to the court's description, the magazine : consists of a series of articles where the writers fantasize about lesbian sexual encounters with a sadomasochistic theme. Photographs loosely complement some of the articles. A story in the magazine featuring a lesbian stalking, ambushing and pleasuring another woman was found to be obscene, and the Glad Day Bookshop, which sold the investigating officer her copy, was fined C$200. Significance The case was symbolic for pornography advocates, who at the time were trying to demonstrate that the arguments of anti-porn feminists Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin were antithetical to women's interests. MacKinnon and Dworkin had provided arguments for new obscenity law in Canada; in this case the law disproportionately limited the voices of gay and lesbian writers, and even led to the impounding of two titles written by Dworkin.

The NSP provides education, outreach, and credentialing related to outdoor recreation and safety. It is currently composed of more than 26,000 members who serve in over 600 patrols. NSP members, both volunteer and paid, ensure the safety of outdoor recreation enthusiasts in ski areas throughout the United States of America and certain military areas of Europe. For its dedication to the promotion of public safety in skiing and other winter sports, the group was granted a congressional charter under Title 36 of the United States Code in 1980. History The National Ski Patrol was founded in 1938 in Stowe, Vermont, when the president of the National Ski Association, Roger Langley convinced the founder and leader of the Mt. Mansfield Ski Patrol, Charles Minot Dole, to form a national ski patrol. Dole was convinced of the need for a national ski rescue organization due to both the loss of a friend due to injuries suffered in a ski related accident the year prior and an on slope accident in which he himself was seriously injured. With Roger Langley's assistance, Charles Minot Dole organized and formed the National Ski Patrol Committee of the National Ski Association. The resulting organization became the National Ski Patrol. Upon his retirement in 1950 as president, Dole had built the NSP into an organization of 300 ski patrols and 4,000 members. Since its founding, the National Ski Patrol has worked closely with other countries in outdoor emergency care education, and has assisted in establishing ski patrol organizations in Canada, Korea, New Zealand, Israel, Turkey, Argentina and Chile, as well as the Victorian Rescue Service in Australia. In addition to its own ski safety programs, works closely with the United States Ski Team, Professional Ski Instructors of America, US Forest Service, National Park Service, and other organizations and agencies in the promotion of skiing and ski safety. = Activities During World War II = Beginning in February 1940, Charles Minot Dole began writing to officials in the United States Army and the War Department about the need for specialized mountain troops. Dole had been inspired by Finnish efforts during the Winter War, and believed the United States should train specialized soldiers to fight in winter and alpine conditions. Due to the lobbying efforts by Charles Minot Dole, in November 1941 the National Ski Patrol was appointed by the United States Army to recruit and vet soldiers for the 87th Mountain Infantry Regiment. The National Ski Patrol continued in this capacity until February 1944, by which time it had recruited around 8,000 soldiers for the 87th Regiment and eventually the 10th Mountain Division. The National Ski Patrol also assisted in training for the new troops. Membership Membership within the NSP falls under five individual categories: patrollers, medical associates, alumni members, associate members, and mountain hosts. Patrollers are those members who are actively involved in providing emergency care to injured guests and are members of a local patrol affiliated with the NSP. Medical associates are physicians who volunteer their time to assist with medical training of patrollers. Patrollers who are no longer actively involved in providing emergency care to injured guests are able to maintain their affiliation with the NSP as alumni members. Associate members are personnel who are interested in courses offered by the NSP but are not members of a ski patrol. The mountain host category of membership is reserved for individuals who participate in on mountain customer service, are expected to be able to render first aid, but not part of an organization's ski patrol. Educational Programs Pursuant to its mission of promoting outdoor recreation safety, the NSP has developed a number of educational programs designed to increase safety awareness and injury prevention. =Outdoor Emergency Care (OEC)= =Transportation= The transportation education program is designed to teach members of the NSP safe techniques for the transportation of sick or injured guests from the wilderness to safety. Specific skills taught through the NSP system include safe toboggan handling, ski enhancement, and snowboard enhancement. =Avalanche Program= The NSP began instructing ski patrollers and other search and rescue personnel in avalanche safety in 1957, making it the oldest and most experienced provider of avalanche education. In addition to courses designed for the ski patroller and the search and rescue personnel, the NSP offers avalanche education to the general public. NSP avalanche education courses are based on curriculum developed in conjunction with the American Avalanche Association. =Mountain Travel and Rescue= Developed to improve safety of non-patroller outdoor enthusiasts, the mountain travel and rescue program emphasizes skills necessary to survive in the wilderness These skills include nutrition, wilderness physiology, weather patterns, survival skills, group dynamics, navigation, and basic search and rescue skills. This program is designed to ensure that those who venture into the wilderness have the necessary skills to do so safely. Ski Patrollers A ski patroller with a rescue toboggan in tow Patrollers are those members of the NSP who, as part of a ski patrol organization, provide assistance to ill or injured guests at a mountain area. To recognize and develop a continued commitment to patroller education and excellence, the NSP classifies patrollers based on completion of NSP approved courses. The classification schema is as follows: *Candidate refers to a member who has just joined but not passed the Outdoor Emergency Care (OEC) course. *Patroller refers to any member of a patrol organization who has completed the Outdoor Emergency Care (OEC) course. Unlike other classifications, ski or snowboarding skills are not necessary. While patrollers may provide first aid and assistance to ill or injured guests, they are not authorized to transport guests in rescue toboggans. *Alpine Patroller and Nordic Patroller: are classifications used for patrollers who have passed OEC and have completed transportation education and are authorized to transport ill or injured guests in rescue toboggans. Alpine patroller refers to those patrollers who are authorized to transport patients in rescue toboggans while using alpine skiing (downhill) equipment. Nordic patroller refers to those patrollers who are authorized to transport patients in rescue toboggans while using nordic skiing (cross country) equipment. *Senior Patroller refers to those patrollers who have completed additional training in emergency management in addition to that taught through OEC. A senior patroller may or may not be authorized to transport ill or injured guests in rescue toboggans. Those that have previously completed transportation education (alpine and nordic patrollers) maintain this ability, whereas those that have not (patrollers) may not transport guests. *Senior Alpine Patroller and Senior Nordic Patroller are alpine patrollers and nordic patrollers who have completed additional training in emergency management (that taught to senior patrollers) and who have completed additional transportation education and can demonstrate skills not required of the alpine or nordic patroller. *Certified Patroller and Master Nordic Patroller refer to the highest level of certification offered by the NSP for alpine and nordic patrollers respectively. In addition to emergency management and transportation skills, certified patrollers and master nordic patrollers must demonstrate excellence in all areas of patrol operations including avalanche safety and resort management. *Young Adult Patroller is a program which provides a learning environment where young adults can develop skills and knowledge to become a Patroller. Young Adult Patrollers (YAP) are NSP members (ages 15 through high school graduation) who complete all of the required training and responsibilities of adult members of their patrol, we well as special training and events geared towards the YAPs within the region.

Retrieved 16 July 2016 was an English author best known for the Lone Pine series of children's books, many of which are set in Shropshire. His work emphasises location; the books include many vivid descriptions of English countryside, villages and sometimes towns. Early life and career He was born in Hastings, Sussex, and was educated at Richmond Hill School, in Richmond, Surrey. His working life began at Oxford University Press in 1918,The Author, Witchend.com. Retrieved 16 July 2016 then continued as a publicist with Cassell & Co (1920‚Äì1922), Associated Press (1922‚Äì1936), and George Newnes (1936‚Äì1941). He was also the associate editor of My Garden magazine, before taking over editorship of Sunny Stories from Enid Blyton in 1954, when she left to set up her own magazine in direct competition. Saville's writing career, from 1943 to 1982, was initially a diversion from his working life. His first book, Mystery at Witchend, was set in Shropshire and was written when his children had been evacuated to the county from the family home in Hertfordshire. It was adapted for BBC radio broadcast in 1943, and was followed by a further 19 children's books in the Lone Pine series, the last one published in 1978. Several of his 90 books were serialised for broadcast on radio, many on Children's Hour, and his 1953 book The Ambermere Treasure, part of the Jillies series, was serialised by Associated-Rediffusion, the first commercial television company to broadcast in the United Kingdom, in late 1955 and early 1956; it was therefore one of the first ITV children's drama series. Saville also wrote many short stories and magazine articles. Personal life His marriage to Dorothy (n√©e McCoy) in 1926 produced four children. Saville had strong moral convictions, and was a practising Christian. He died in Hastings in 1982, aged 81. Book list All dates in the list below refer to the first date of publication.

The initial rock and roll boom of the 1950s was preceded by a long tradition of popular culture. Suomirock may refer to Finnish rock music in general or more narrowly rock music sung in the Finnish language. Timeline Finnish rock followed the common trends during the 50s and 60s. Usually Finnish rock bands performed covers or hit songs translated into Finnish. Eero Raittinen and his brother Jussi Raittinen are among the earliest rockers of the 1960s, alongside groups such as Jormas, Topmost and Ernos. The British band The Renegades found their biggest success in the 1960s Finland. Helsinki was the centre of Finnish rock and pop music during this period. Love Records was one of the first domestic record labels dedicated to Finnish rock, even though the label's roster also included jazz and political songs. Suomen Talvisota 1939-1940 represented Finnish underground, and their only album Underground-Rock (1970) is cited as a big influence among many current Finnish music-makers. Other Finnish underground/psychedelic bands of this era were The Sperm, Apollo and the ground-breaking Blues Section, which spawned Wigwam and Tasavallan Presidentti after its split. At the beginning of the 1970s new artists emerged. Singer- songwriters such as Hector and Juice Leskinen started writing songs in Finnish, combining shades of irony, poetry and introspection with rock sound. Later in the seventies the new wave and punk brought more artists such as Pelle Miljoona, Eppu Normaali and Hassisen kone. Finnish rock had by now become independent. Names such as Dave Lindholm, Tuomari Nurmio and Ismo Alanko continued with their own styles. Tampere became at the turn of the 1970s and 80s the most vibrant town in rock culture, spawning \\"Manserock\\" as rock music by the town's artists was called. Hurriganes, fronted by Remu Aaltonen, was one of the most well-known groups in Finland. This 1970s group played hard-hitting, boogie-based simple rock, and their song \\"Get on\\" is almost anthemic in Finland. Ex-Hurriganes guitarist Albert J√§rvinen would later collaborate with the likes of Lemmy Kilmister of Mot√∂rhead fame, issuing the Countdown 12\\" single, with Lemmy featuring on lead vocals on the title track, under the name of Albert J√§rvinen Band. Other seminal groups were Dingo, a pop-rock group idolized by teenagers, and Y√∂, whose \\"Joutsenlaulu\\" remains to the day one of the most played songs in radio and karaoke. Kingston Wall was a cult band of the early 90s, combining psychedelic influences with hard rock, played by power trio and fronted by Petri Walli. J. Karjalainen has also remained popular since the early 1980s. Well-known Finnish band CMX also formed in 1985, transforming from a hardcore punk sound through progressive, metal, and hard rock sounds. Success abroad HIM was the first Finnish band to release an album that would become gold in US The earliest Finnish rock bands to gain any notoriety were progressive rock bands like Tasavallan Presidentti and Wigwam. Though for a time they seemed poised to break through in Europe, international fame eluded them. 1980s bands were similarly unable to find an international following, such as Gringos Locos and Havana Black; one exception to this was Hanoi Rocks, a popular glam rock band. They are still the most respected Finnish group abroad. For example, in Japan there's still almost fanatic Hanoi Rocks fans. Though the band collapsed on the verge of final international breakthrough, they were the source of inspiration for glam rock bands of the 1980s including Guns N' Roses. Some modern bands who have achieved some mainstream rock success abroad include Leningrad Cowboys, known for performing with the Red Army Choir, surf band Laika & the Cosmonauts and prog-related rock band Von Hertzen Brothers. 22-Pistepirkko has had a cult status in Europe, notably in the Netherlands and Germany. The trio's indie- rock incorporates blues and melancholy melodies, with a touch of Tom Waits. Heavy metal Nightwish is one of the most popular Finnish metal bands. Like much of Scandinavia (or, more accurately Fennoscandia), Finland's main contribution to modern popular music may be heavy metal and related fields. Early 80s Finnish hard rock and heavy metal bands of note include Riff Raff, Oz, and Zero Nine while Stratovarius and thrashers Stone would first emerge in the late 80s. Since then the Finnish scene has given rise to bands like Children of Bodom, Amorphis, Nightwish, Apocalyptica, Impaled Nazarene, Waltari, Entwine, The 69 Eyes, Sinergy, Sentenced, Sonata Arctica, Am I Blood, Ensiferum, Korpiklaani, Finntroll, Wintersun, Battlelore, Machine Men, Mannhai, To/Die/For, Turisas, Battle Beast, Beast in Black and Ter√§sbetoni. A popular Finnish band abroad is HIM whose music has been labeled \\"love metal\\". HIM and The Rasmus topped album charts in several European countries with their most popular albums. HIM got also a gold record in the USA in 2006. The international success of HIM and The Rasmus during the current decade is wider than any Finnish group has gotten before. Finland were also the winners of the 2006 Eurovision Song Contest, with the first heavy metal band to enter the competition, Lordi. Lordi won with their Hard Rock Hallelujah composition, sporting elaborate costumes. Since then, they have found success across Europe and limited publicity outside of the continent. Lordi have also competed in Kuorosota, the Finnish version of Clash of the Choirs. Throughout the Finland and Scandinavian countries there has been an uprising of 80s era \\"glam metal\\" bands heavily influenced by bands like M√∂tley Cr√ºe and Guns N' Roses with a modern twist like Reckless Love, Santa Cruz, Crashd√Øet and Hardcore Superstar. Extreme metal Finland, like its Scandinavian neighbors, also has a vibrant extreme metal scene, which while propagating a more underground and slightly less accessible sound is still notably not only internationally successful but also on a few occasions giving the more mainstream heavy metal bands competition in the nation's awards ceremonies. The most famous Finnish bands in extreme metal are most probably Amorphis, Children of Bodom, Impaled Nazarene, and the grindcore band Rotten Sound, which recently signed to the renowned American label Relapse Records. The extreme metal scene in Finland is highly dominated by death metal of various subgenres ranging from melodic death metal such as Omnium Gatherum to more old school traditional death metal bands like Demilich and Convulse, which recently had their sole album reissued by Relapse Records.

Location The village was situated in a flat area on the southern coastal plain. It was probably named after the al-Hut tribe, originally from Najd in central Arabia, who camped near the site at the end of the fifth century A.D.Khalidi, 1992, p. 100 History The Arab geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi (d. 1228) referred to the village as Hattawa and said it was the home of the Islamic scholar ¬¥Amru al- Hattawi. =Ottoman era= Hatta, like the rest of Palestine, was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517, and in the tax registers of 1596 it appeared under the name of Hatta as-Sajara as being in the nahiya of Gazza, part of the Sanjak of Gaza. It had a population of 15 households, all Muslim. The inhabitants paid a fixed tax rate of 25% on wheat, barley, sesame, goats and/or beehives; a total of 5,600 ak√ße.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 147 Edward Robinson passed by the village in 1838, and described its houses as being made of adobe bricks.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 2, p. 370 It was also noted as a Muslim village in the Gaza district.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, 2nd appendix, p. 118 In 1863 Victor Gu√©rin visited the village, which he estimated it to have 600 inhabitants. He noticed that beside the well were four barrels of broken columns, three gray-white marble, and the fourth of bluish marble. The latter, placed horizontally at the orifice was deeply furrowed by the rope that animals or men had used to raise the water. In a oualy dedicated to Neby Amran he noticed some stones with the same ancient look. Around the village were large plantations of tobacco, here and there also stood several groups of beautiful pine, olive and fig trees.Gu√©rin, 1869, p.125 An Ottoman village list of about 1870 showed that Hatta had 78 houses and a population of 211, though the population count included only men.Socin, 1879, p. 155Hartmann, 1883, p. 133, also noted 78 houses In 1883 the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) described the village as being surrounded by gardens, some of which contained a few tamarisk trees. SWP also wrote that the name Hatteh preserved the name of the Hittites.Conder and Kitchener, 1883, SWP III, p. 260. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 100 =British Mandate era= In the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Hatta had a population of 570 Muslims,Barron, 1923, Table V, Sub-district of Gaza, p. 9 increasing in the 1931 census to 646, still all Muslim, in 140 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 3.

Geography It occupies a total area of 103.9 km¬≤ (around 80 km¬≤ urban area) at circa 30 km from the State Capital, Porto Alegre. The climate is sub-tropical, with temperatures varying from -2 ¬∞C minimum at Winter to more than 40 ¬∞C maximum during summer time. Summers are fairly dry. History Established on July 25, 1824, by German immigrants, S√£o Leopoldo is considered the cradle of German culture in Brazil, that is to say, it is the first official city designed by the national Brazilian governor to start the German plan of immigration in the country. It had, in 2006, a population of approximately 210,000. S√£o Leopoldo is one of the 13 cities along the Rota Rom√¢ntica ('Romantic Route'), a touristic scenic route that runs from the State Capital towards the Serra Ga√∫cha. Minority language Riograndenser Hunsr√ºckisch German is a regional language in South America like Pennsylvania Deitsch is in North America. They are also similar because of their origin in the Rhine region of southwest Germany. As a Brazilian variant of European Moselle Franconian, it is also spoken beyond the state of Rio Grande do Sul, where for almost two hundred years it has been historically centered and where most of its 2 to 3 millions speakers live (there are speakers in neighboring southern Brazilian states, as well as in Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay). There are many other municipalities with this bilingual profile throughout the state and the German language is experiencing a strong revival: In 2012 the state chamber of deputies voted unanimously in favor of recognizing the Hunsr√ºckisch Germanic dialect of Rio Grande do Sul an official historical Intangible cultural heritage to be preserved.LEI 14.061 - Declara integrante do patrim√¥nio hist√≥rico e cultural do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul a ‚ÄúL√≠ngua Hunsrik‚Äù, de origem germ√¢nicaLEI N¬∫ 14.061, de 23 de julho de 2012 - Declara integrante do patrim√¥nio hist√≥rico e cultural do estado do Rio Grande do Sul a l√≠ngua hunsrik, de origem germ√¢nica Education The area had a German school, Instituto Preteologico.\\"Deutscher Bundestag 4.

Biography Smith was born October 29, 1748 in Stafford County, Virginia, the son of Henry Smith and Sarah Ann Crosby. He attended the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia. Becoming a surveyor, he moved to Augusta County, Virginia, serving as deputy surveyor of the county in 1773. In Washington, Virginia on June 10th of that same year he married Sarah Michie (30 Jan 1755 - 2 Apr 1831). She was daughter of George and Elizabeth (Michie) Michie. As a militia officer, he helped defend the Virginia frontier during Dunmore's War and the American Revolution. He became sheriff of Augusta County in 1780 and was commissioned a colonel in the militia, taking part in the later battles of the Revolutionary War, including Guilford Courthouse and Kings Mountain. On October 5, 1781, Smith was appointed \\"Assistant Deputy Surveyor\\" in the Southern Department of the Continental Army under Thomas Hutchins. At the war's end, Smith moved to what is now Sumner County, Tennessee to claim the land grant for his military service. As county surveyor, he surveyed what became the site of the town of Nashville, Tennessee. He was prominent in local affairs and was appointed a brigadier general in the militia. He was a member of the 1789 North Carolina convention which voted to ratify the United States Constitution. In 1790, President George Washington named him Secretary (chief deputy) of the Southwest Territory. Smith was a member of the convention that wrote the Tennessee State Constitution of 1796, which came into effect with its statehood on June 1, 1796. Smith prepared the first official map of Tennessee. Smith was later appointed as United States Senator when Andrew Jackson resigned from that position (for the first time), serving from October 6, 1798 to March 3, 1799. He was later elected to his own Senate term, serving from March 4, 1805 to March 31, 1809 when he resigned and returned to his Sumner County estate, Rock Castle in Hendersonville, pursuing his agricultural and business interests until his death there, being interred in an adjacent family plot. Rock Castle State Historic Site is preserved today as an historical landmark and one of the early examples in Middle Tennessee of a plantation.

Although the dish varies from region to region, it optionally includes wheat or barley, meat and lentils. Popular variations include ke≈ükek in Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and northern Iraq; Hareesa in the Arab world and Armenia; Halim in Bangladesh and West Bengal, India; Khichra in Pakistan and India. Composition Haleem lentils and grains Haleem is made of wheat, barley, meat: usually minced beef or mutton; goat meat; or Lamb and mutton; or chicken, lentils and spices. Sometimes rice is also used. This dish is slow cooked for seven to eight hours, which results in a paste-like consistency, blending the flavors of spices, meat, barley and wheat. Origin Bengali- style Haleem The origin of Haleem lies in the popular Middle Eastern dish known as Harees (also written as Jareesh). According to Shoaib Daniyal, writing in The Sunday Guardian, the first written recipe of Harees dates back to the 10th century, when Arab scribe Abu Muhammad al-Muzaffar ibn Sayyar compiled a cookbook of dishes popular with the \\"kings and caliphs and lords and leaders\\" of Baghdad. \\"The version described in his Kitab Al-Tabikh (Book of Recipes), the world‚Äôs oldest surviving Arabic cookbook, is strikingly similar to the one people in the Middle East eat to this day\\" it reported. The Harees was cooked as the Arab empire was extended to different parts of the world. Harees was introduced in the Indian subcontinent by the Arab soldiers of the Hyderabad Nizam's army to the city. Today, Harees is still available in the Arab quarter of Hyderabad, an area called Barkas, where the dish is called Jareesh. Later on, the people of Hyderabad modified it to suit their palate thus creating modern haleem. Cultural history Haleem is sold as a snack food in bazaars throughout the year. It is also a special dish prepared throughout the world during the Ramadan and Muharram months of the Muslim Hijri calendar, particularly among Pakistanis and Indian Muslims. In India, haleem prepared in Hyderabad during the Ramadan month, is transported all over the world through a special courier service. Haleem is traditionally cooked in large, wood-fired cauldrons. Haleem is also very popular in Bangladesh, especially during the holy month of Ramadan, when it is a staple dish. In Pakistan, Haleem is available all year round, as well as in most Pakistani restaurants around the world. Haleem is sold as a snack food and street food in Pakistani bazaars throughout the year. Hyderabadi haleem Hyderabadi Haleem Haleem has become a popular dish in the cities of Hyderabad, Telangana and Aurangabad, Maharashtra (Aurangabad, the first capital of Hyderabad State) in India. Originating from an Arabic dish called Harees, Haleem was introduced to the region during the Mughal period by foreign migrants. Khichra In the Indian subcontinent, both haleem and khichra are made with same ingredients. In khichra, the chunks of meat remain as cubes, while in haleem the meat cubes are taken out of the pot, bones are removed, meat is crushed and put back in the pot. It is further cooked until the meat completely blends with the lentils, wheat and barley mixture. Haleem.JPGHaleem Khichra.JPGKhichra Preparation A traditional haleem is made by firstly soaking wheat, barley and gram lentil overnight. A spicy meat gravy called Korma is prepared until the meat becomes tender. The wheat, barley and gram are boiled in salt water until they are tender. The cooked wheat, barley and lentils are then mixed with the meat (Beef or Mutton or Chicken) gravy and blended with a heavy hand mixer to obtain a paste-like consistency. The cooking procedure takes about 6 hours to complete. In the end the cooked haleem is garnished with fried onions, julienne cut ginger, sliced green chillies, coriander leaves, lemon wedges and chaat masala. However, haleem preparation varies in different regions.  Nutrition  A high-calorie dish, haleem provides protein from the meat and fibre and carbohydrates from the various combinations of grains and pulses. Serving Haleem can be served with chopped mint leaves, lemon juice, coriander leaves, fried onions, chopped ginger root or green chilies. In some regions of Pakistan, Haleem is eaten with Naan or with any type of bread or rice.

Temples According to the Perforated Relief of King Ur-Nanshe, temples attributed to Ur-Nanshe include Ningirsu's temple in Girsu, Nanshe's temple in Nina, and Apsubanda. He is known to have originally built the Ibgal of Inanna, because of Eanatum's honorary inscriptions left after temple renovation. The Ibgal of Inanna is located in modern-day al-Hiba (ancient city of Lagash). An oval wall surrounds the main mud brick temple and it is located on the southwest edge of the city. This placement within the city is different because temples were usually centrally positioned in ancient Sumer.

The king is portrayed as a builder of temples and canals, thus a preserver of order perceived to be bestowed upon them by the gods. It is a perforated limestone slab that was probably part of a wall as a votive decoration and is inscribed in Sumerian: The carved illustration is in two registers, top and bottom, both depicting Ur-Nanshe in different roles as king. In the top register he is dressed in a kaunakes (tufted wool skirt), carrying a basket of bricks on his head while surrounded by other Lagash elite, his wife, and seven of his sons. Inscriptions on their respective garments identify each person. On the bottom register, Ur-Nanshe is at a banquet, which is to celebrate the building of the temple. He is seated on a throne wearing the same outfit as the top register surrounded by other court members. In both registers Ur-Nanshe is shown using hierarchical proportion in which he is considerably larger than everyone surrounding him.

Kingdom. History The union was founded in 1887 as the Tea Operatives and General Labourers' Association, to organise opposition to a cut in wages for workers involved in unloading and processing tea at the East and West India Dock Company's Cutler Street warehouse. From the start, it included other supportive workers, with secretary Ben Tillett working at nearby Monument Quay Warehouse. Considered part of the New Unionism movement, it grew rapidly, with 2,300 members by the end of 1888.Arthur Marsh and Victoria Ryan, Historical Directory of Trade Unions, vol.3, pp.280-281 The union was central to the London dock strike of 1889, many of the participants in the strike joining the union immediately after the strike. By the end of the year, it had 30,932 members, and had been renamed as the \\"Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Labourers' Union\\", reflecting the broader base of its membership. However, most dock labourers working in the docks on the south bank of the River Thames instead joined a new rival, the South Side Labour Protection League, in protest at the degree of centralisation in the Dockers' Union, and its refusal to allow branch meetings to take place in pubs. The Dockers' Union rapidly became the principal union for dockworkers in London, Bristol, Cardiff, and other ports in the south and south-west. In South Wales it attracted a large following amongst metal-workers. Keith Laybourn, A History of British Trade Unionism (1992) pp 72-76 The union was renamed the Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Workers' Union of Great Britain and Ireland in 1899.Jonathan Schneer, Ben Tillett: portrait of a labour leader (1982) By this time, it had lost most of its members in London, but continued to grow as more workers joined elsewhere in the country. The union was a constituent of the National Transport Workers' Federation and was keen to amalgamate with other similar unions. Ernest Bevin became a prominent official in the union from 1910, and he initiated the merger process which formed the Transport and General Workers' Union in 1922.

Also related is the Avestan word ahura, found as the title of the god Ahura Mazda. Linguistics The Proto-Germanic form of Old Norse √°ss, deduced by comparison to other Germanic languages, living and dead, is *ansuz. The plural of this Proto-Germanic word was *ansiwiz, which by regular sound changes into √¶sir. The word √°sura·∏• can be postulated to come from Proto-Indo-Iranian *nÃ©suras, where *nÃ©su- is the zero-grade form equivalent to the Gemanic *ansu-, both from a Proto-Indo-European root *H2ensu-. In Sanskrit, √°su·∏• (PIIr *nÃ©sus) means \\"vital spirit\\" or \\"life\\", and is presumably related, suggesting a common meaning \\"spirit\\". Meaning Both words describe a family of divine beings, the √Üsir is the pantheon of the principal Norse gods, and Asuras are a group of Hindu deities. Each group is set up against another group of gods; the √Üsir warred with the Vanir, whereas the Asuras oppose the Devas. In Norse mythology the √Üsir are generally approved of (and worshipped) while the asuras have a more negative reputation in the Indian religions. However, the use of ahura to refer to the greatest god of Zoroastrianism implies that the word once had more favorable connotations. In the earlier Vedic literature also those we know of as Devas, like Indra, are called Asuras. The relationship between the √Üsir and Vanir parallel the Asuras and Devas in another way; like the √Üsir, the Asuras were associated in Vedic myth with human phenomena (contracts, the arts, fate), while the Vanir, like the Devas, are associated with natural phenomena (such as Njord and Freyr, associated with fertility).

It is free software released under GNU General Public License 2.0, runs on Windows, and is implemented as a Video for Windows (VFW) codec and a DirectShow filter. Installation and configuration ffdshow does not include a media player or container parsers. Instead, after installation of ffdshow, compatible DirectShow or VFW media players such as Media Player Classic, Winamp, and Windows Media Player will use the ffdshow decoder automatically, thus avoiding the need to install separate codecs for the various formats supported by ffdshow. The user configures ffdshow's audio and video settings by launching the ffdshow video decoder configuration program independently of any media player. For playing transport stream files such as AVC(H.264) an additional mediasplitter should also be installed. There are several free mediasplitters available such as the LAV Filters and Haali Media Splitter. Format and filter support ffdshow can be configured to display subtitles, to enable or disable various built-in codecs, to grab screenshots, to enable keyboard control, and to enhance movies with increased resolution, sharpness, and many other post-processing video filters. It has the ability to manipulate audio with effects like an equalizer, a Dolby decoder, reverb, Winamp DSP plugins, and more. Some of the postprocessing is borrowed from the MPlayer project and AviSynth filters. ffdshow uses the libavcodec library and several other free, open source software packages to decode video in most common formats, such as: *MPEG-4 Part 2 (including video encoded with Xvid, 3ivx, and all versions of DivX). *Flash Video, H.263 and VP6 (used by sites such as YouTube). *H.264/AVC, Theora, WMV as well as numerous others. ffdshow also decodes audio, such as: *MP3, *AAC, *Dolby AC3, *WMA *FLAC, and *Vorbis formats, among others. The post-processing video filters of ffdshow can be used in video editors such as VirtualDub or AviSynth, by configuring the VFW settings. In these editors, ffdshow can also be used to encode MPEG-4 video compatible with Xvid, DivX, or x264 codecs, as well as lossless video and a few other formats supported by libavcodec. History The first versions of ffdshow were published in May 2002, as an alternative to the DivX ;-) 3.11 and DivX 5.02 (which came bundled with Gatorhttps://web.archive.org/web/20030401082827/http://www.divx.com/divx/) decoders of the time, and as a way to combine the speed and quality of MPlayer with popular Windows video players. It continues to support more formats, new and old, as FFmpeg developers add support for them. The main developer was Milan Cutka. When he stopped updating the project in 2006, new maintainers opened the ffdshow tryouts as a fork, where bug-fixes, stability fixes, new features, and codec updates continued. Development of ffdshow tryouts was discontinued in 2012 with users recommended to use LAV Filters instead.

The data was recorded between 1981 and 1990. The joint discovery of the W and Z bosons by this experiment and the UA2 experiment in 1983 led to the Nobel Prize for physics being awarded to Carlo Rubbia and Simon van der Meer in 1984. Peter Kalmus and John Dowell, from the UK groups working on the project, were jointly awarded the 1988 Rutherford Medal and Prize from the Institute of Physics for their outstanding roles in the discovery of the W and Z particles. It was named as the first experiment in a CERN \\"Underground Area\\" (UA), i.e. located underground, outside of the two main CERN sites, at an interaction point on the SPS accelerator, which had been modified to operate as a collider. The UA1 central detector was crucial to understanding the complex topology of proton-antiproton collisions. It played a most important role in identifying a handful of W and Z particles among billions of collisions.http://worldwidescience.org/topicpages/u/ua1+central+detector.html Section of the UA1 detector at Museo nazionale della scienza e della tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci of Milan After the discovery of the W and Z boson, the UA1 collaboration went on to search for the top quark. Physicists had anticipated its existence since 1977, when its partner ‚Äî the bottom quark ‚Äî was discovered. It was felt that the discovery of the top quark was imminent. In June 1984, Carlo Rubbia at the UA1 experiment expressed to the New York Times that evidence of the top quark \\"looks really good\\". Over the next months it became clear that UA1 had overlooked a significant source of background. The top quark was ultimately discovered in 1994‚Äì1995 by physicists at Fermilab with a mass near 175 GeV. The UA1 was a huge and complex detector for its day. It was designed as a general-purpose detector.http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/28849/1/cernwz2_5-03 The detector was a 6-chamber cylindrical assembly 5.8 m long and 2.3 m in diameter, the largest imaging drift chamber of its day. It recorded the tracks of charged particles curving in a 0.7 Tesla magnetic field, measuring their momentum, the sign of their electric charge and their rate of energy loss (dE/dx). Atoms in the argon-ethane gas mixture filling the chambers were ionised by the passage of charged particles. The electrons which were released drifted along an electric field shaped by field wires and were collected on sense wires. The geometrical arrangement of the 17000 field wires and 6125 sense wires allowed a spectacular 3-D interactive display of reconstructed physics events to be produced.http://worldwidescience.org/topicpages/u/ua1+central+detector.html The UA1 detector was conceived and designed in 1978/9, with the proposal submitted in mid-1978. Since the end of running, the magnet used in the UA1 experiment has been used for other high energy physics experiments, notably the NOMAD and T2K neutrino experiments.

To bring some order in this extremely diverse genus, 29 subgenera and 25 sections had been created. Much of this work has been done by Dr. C. Luer. In 2004 this genus has almost been halved by incorporating many species into new genera (Monogr. Syst. Bot. Missouri Bot. Gard. 95: 256. February 2004). A new analysis, based on DNA testing, has confirmed on the whole this classification of the subtribe Pleurothallidinae, with however Pleurothallis as the main difference. This should not surprise anyone, since this somewhat artificial genus has been the dumping ground for species that did not fit into any other genus. New genetic insight has broken up this huge genus and made it more consistent with the principles of monophyletic genera and evolutionary relationships. Several times a splitting up had been attempted, but there were always too many intermediate forms. Finally, in 2004 the new genera Acianthera, Ancipitia, Antilla, Apoda- prorepentia, Areldia, Atopoglossum, Brenesia, Colombiana, Crocodeilanthe, Cucumeria, Didactylus, Dracontia, Elongatia, Empusella, Kraenzlinella, Lindleyalis, Madisonia, Proctoria, Rubellia, Specklinia, Talpinaria, Unciferia, and Xenosia have been created, incorporating a large number of former Pleurothallis species (Monogr.

It is located in the village of Logtun. It is an annex church for the Frosta parish which is part of the Stiklestad prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Nidaros. It is also a museum and historic cultural site that was gifted from the parish to the Society for the Preservation of Ancient Norwegian Monuments. The stone church was built in a long church style during the late 12th century by an unknown architect. The church was the main church for the parish of Frosta until the new Frosta Church was built nearby in 1866. After that, the church was not regularly used. During the 1950s, the church was restored and it is now used infrequently as a wedding venue and it holds some summer worship services. History Logtun is located on the Frosta peninsula close to Tinghaugen, the site of the early Norwegian Frostating court. There was already a church at Logtun at the time of Archbishop Eystein Erlendsson (from 1157 to 1180), but no sources indicate when this particular church was built. It is assumed that it dates back to the late 12th century, and that it has been rebuilt several times. The church was constructed with double walls of stone and brick and with lime and sand. In 1640, the church underwent extensive interior repair. The church has a special altarpiece that was carved in 1652 and painted in 1655. Johan Bildthugger performed the carpentry and wood carving and Johan Hansen Kontrafeier the painting. The church has had several additions: sacristy, veranda tower, and porches. All these were of wood and were probably built after the Reformation in 1537. In 1857, Frosta municipality bought the church. The nearby Frosta Church was built in 1866 to replace it as the main church for the area. Logtun Church was restored in 1950, after lying in ruins for many years. The church is now owned by the Society for the Preservation of Ancient Norwegian Monuments, but it is still used for baptisms, wedding ceremonies, some religious services, and concerts.

A trade mark is a way for one party to distinguish themselves from another. In the business world, a trade mark provides a product or organisation with an identity which cannot be imitated by its competitors. A trade mark can be a name, word, phrase, logo, symbol, design, image, sound, shape, signature or any combination of these elements. In UK law, as in most common law countries other than the United States and Canada, the term is written as \\"trade mark\\" (as in the Trade Marks Act 1994), not \\"trademark\\".  Conferred rights  The owners of a trade mark can legally defend their mark against infringements. To do so, the trade mark must either be registered, or have been used for a period of time so that it has acquired local distinctiveness (Prior Rights). The extent to which a trade mark is defendable depends upon the similarity of the trade marks involved, the similarity of the products or services involved and whether the trademark has acquired distinctiveness. A registered trade mark is relatively simple to defend in a court of law. An unregistered trade mark relies on the law of passing off (where one party's goods or services are presented in a way that causes confusion between them and the goods or services of another party). Rights have also been recently extended with regard to well-known trade marks. The Trade Marks Act 1994 states that \\"a person infringes a registered trade mark if he uses in the course of trade a sign which is identical with the trade mark in relation to goods or services which are identical with those for which it is registered\\".Trade Marks Act 1994, s 10(1) A person may also infringe a registered trade mark where the sign is similar and the goods or services are similar to those for which the mark is registered and there is a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public as a result.Trade Marks Act 1994, s 10(2) A person also infringes a registered trade mark where a sign is identical but the goods are dissimilar if the trade mark has a reputation in the UK and its use takes unfair advantage of, or is detrimental to, the mark's distinctive character or reputation.Trade Marks Act 1994, s 10(3)  Registering trade marks  The registration of trade marks in the UK is achieved through the UK Intellectual Property Office (UKIPO). If registration is accepted by the UKIPO, a number of exclusive rights are bestowed upon the trade mark owner. These rights allow the owner to prevent unauthorised use of the mark on products that are identical or similar to the registered mark. When a trade mark application is made to the UKIPO, it examines the application to decide whether the trade mark that is being applied for is distinctive enough to be a trade mark. Registration usually takes about three and a half to four months. However, this time span can be greatly increased if any objections are raised to the mark's registration by owners of similar registered trade marks or by the UKIPO themselves. Once a trademark is registered, it is kept on the register for ten years, after which it needs to be renewed to preserve the owner's rights over it. It can also be allowed to lapse. Trade marks are registered in one or more of 45 classes. There are 34 classes of goods and 11 for services. These classes group products that are deemed to be similar in function, and are identified by their number. For example, the registration of a trade mark for a range of gymnastic and sporting articles is classified by the trademark registry in \\"class 28\\".  Registrability of a trade mark  Some of the main objections that the UKIPO will make when trademarks are submitted for registration are usually related to the \\"distinctiveness\\" of the mark. An inherently distinctive mark is the easiest to register, as it has no prior meaning. These marks are not to be found in dictionaries. A good example of such a distinctive trademark is iPod. Words that appear in the dictionary can still be registered. These arbitrary trademarks are meaningless in the context of their use. For example, Apple Computer, or Apple Corps. Suggestive trade marks do not describe a characteristic of the product, but with some imagination, are identifiable with their connected product. For example, ColdSeal Windows. Descriptive trade marks use words that appear in the dictionary that describe the product to which they relate. They are usually difficult to register, and the registrar needs to prove that the mark has become distinctive through its long term use. Descriptive marks can be made distinctive by the addition of other elements to the name or logo.  Acquired distinctiveness  A descriptive trade mark can only be registered if it has \\"acquired distinctiveness\\". This is achievable through its use, although proving that \\"acquired distinctiveness\\" has been achieved usually relies on sales figures and advertising budgets.  Registration exclusions  Most countries exclude certain terms and symbols from being registrable. These include emblems, flags, royal insignia, and the rings of the Olympic Games. In addition, marks that are deceptive as to the country of the product's origin and marks that are obscene are unregistrable.  Historical legislation  In 1862 the Merchandise Marks Act made it a criminal offence to imitate another's trade mark \\"with intent to defraud or to enable another to defraud\\". In 1875, the Trade Marks Registration Act was passed which allowed formal registration of trade marks at the UK Patent Office for the first time. Registration was considered to comprise prima facie evidence of ownership of a trade mark and registration of marks began on 1 January 1876. The first trade mark to be so registered was the red triangle of the Bass Brewery. The 1875 Act defined a registrable trade mark as \\"a device, or mark, or name of an individual or firm printed in some particular and distinctive manner; or a written signature or copy of a written signature of an individual or firm; or a distinctive label or ticket\\". However, any word or name that was in use as a trade mark before the passing of the Act (in August 1875) was entitled to registration, whether or not the mark fulfilled these criteria.Bently, Lionel, \\"The Making of Modern Trade Marks Law: The Construction of the Legal Concept of Trade Mark (1860‚Äì80)\\" in Lionel Bently, Jane C. Ginsburg & Jennifer Davis (eds), Trade Marks and Brands: An Interdisciplinary Critique (Cambridge University Press, 2008) In 1883 the Patents and Trade Marks Act substantially revised trade mark law, reducing the cost of application, and included the facility to register \\"fancy words not in common use\\" and \\"brands\\" as new marks for the first time.Mercer, John, \\"A Mark of Distinction: Branding and Trade Mark Law in the UK from the 1860s\\", Business History (2010) Further major trademark acts were passed in 1888 and 1905 (which both further refined definitions of a trade mark), 1919 (which separated the trade mark register into Parts A and B, each of which had different registration criteria) and 1938, the last of which remained in force until it was superseded in 1994.  Recent legislation  The current UK Trade Mark legislation is the Trade Marks Act 1994, which implements the European Trade Marks Directive into national law. The UK Intellectual Property Office radically altered the way UK national trade mark applications were examined in October 2007. Previously, UK national trade mark applications underwent a full examination both on absolute (distinctiveness) and relative (prior rights) grounds. In October 2007, the search which formed a part of the examination of applications on prior rights grounds became an advisory search in a similar fashion to the Community Trade Mark system, bringing into force Section 8 of the Trade Marks Act 1994. No longer will the UKIPO unilaterally be able to prevent the grant of a UK national trade mark application on the basis of an earlier pending application or prior registration for a conflicting mark. Instead, it will be up to the proprietor of that right to oppose the application when it advertised for opposition purposes, although the UKIPO will still advise owners of conflicting application where citations including their marks have been sent to the applicant to assist them in making an opposition. A fast-track application process has also been available to applicants since 7 April 2008. Aspects of UK common law also relate to trade marks, most notably the common law tort of passing off.

When the number of requests proved unmanageable, the Zork Users Group began a pay-per-hint telephone system. The invention of InvisiClues replaced this system and was revolutionary: a player could often buy a hint book at the same time and at the same location as the game itself. Questions relating to the game were printed in the book, for example, the InvisiClues for Zork IInvisiClues for Zork I from the Infocom Homepage contained the question \\"How can I kill the songbird?\\"\\"How can I kill the songbird?\\" question from the InvisiClues page from the Infocom Homepage A series of \\"empty\\" boxes located below or following the text contained the answers, printed in invisible ink. The contents of each box could be revealed by using a highlighter-like marker that came with the book. Over time, the ink degraded and the text reverted to invisibility. To discourage players from accidentally learning what awaited by reading all the questions, each booklet contained a number of plausible-sounding \\"fake\\" questions. Revealing these answers usually resulted in a mild scolding. Several \\"non-puzzles\\" also had questions, such as the songbird example used above. The answer to these was usually a tersely-worded statement saying \\"You can't do that\\", often followed by one or more items reading \\"This space intentionally left blank\\" or, on occasion, showed false clues such as \\"How Do I get off the roof of the House?\\" the clue being \\"How did you get up there?\\". Even the answers to real questions began with vague hints, so a player could choose to stop short of getting explicit solutions to the puzzles. The InvisiClues books were very popular. By late 1984 Infocom had sold more than 500,000 copies at $9.95 each for its games, including about 200,000 for the Zork I book. Richard E. Snyder of Simon & Schuster amazed InvisiClues author Mike Dornbrook by stating that such volumes made him \\"one of the bestselling authors on the planet ... In terms of dollars you're at Stephen King level!\\" For a short time, The Status Line, the Infocom Game newsletter, included \\"Visiclues\\". These were just select InvisiClues questions from a couple of newer games, with answers written in a simple cryptogram. InvisiClues books were almost always packaged with the navigation map for the same given game. Though InvisiClues, like the games themselves, are no longer available, a few Internet sites have recreated the booklets. Typically, either all the answers are printed normally on the site or the user must \\"highlight\\" a section by clicking and dragging the mouse to reveal the hints. The InvisiClues were included in a hint booklet packaged with The Lost Treasures of Infocom. However, the InvisiClues packaged with the Treasures were not produced to Infocom's high standards: * The clues were not written in invisible ink, which made it easy to accidentally get answers to puzzles. * Some of the hints were missing * There were many errors, such as misspellings, mis-capitalizations, formatting issues, and punctuation errors. The clues were not included with The Lost Treasures of Infocom II. However, there was a pay-per-minute card included. In the Solid Gold line, typing \\"HINT\\" twice would allow you to access Invisiclues from in-game.

He was the son of Ant√≥nia Pais and Trist√£o da Cunha, the famous Portuguese navigator, admiral and ambassador to Pope Leo X. Nuno da Cunha proved his mettle in battles at Oja and Brava, and at the capture of Panane, under the viceroy Francisco de Almeida. Named by Jo√£o III ninth governor of Portuguese possessions in India, he served from April 1528 to 1538. Diu On his passage to Goa, he subdued the pirates at Mombasa who had been harassing the coast of Portuguese Mozambique. Mozambique had been brought within the Portuguese trading orbit and provided watering stations essential to Portugal's lifeline to the west coast of India. Nuno's brothers Pero Vaz da Cunha and Sim√£o da Cunha were expected to serve under him as second and third in command, a form of nepotism that was expected in the Portuguese Estado da √çndia. However, they died on the voyage, and Nuno was forced to rely upon local networks of clientage in Goa during his long rule. Bassein (c. 1539), drawn by Nuno da Cunha, Governor of Portuguese India (1528-38). In 1529, Nuno sent an expedition that sacked and burned the city of Dam√£o on the Arabian Sea at the mouth of the Dam√£o River, about 100 miles north of Mumbai in the Muslim state of Gujarat. Forces under his control captured Baxay (now Vasai, often mistaken for Basra in Iraq) from the Muslim ruler of Gujarat, Bahadur Shah, on January 20, 1533. The next year, renamed Bassein, the city became the capital of the Portuguese province of the North, and the great citadel of black basalt, still standing, was begun. (It was completed in 1548.) Forced to return to Portugal as a result of court intrigues, he was shipwrecked at the Cape of Good Hope and drowned. His first marriage was to Maria da Cunha, and his second marriage was to Isabel da Silveira. The main source for Nuno da Cunha's career is the Portuguese historian Jo√£o de Barros (1496‚Äì1570), famous for his history of the Portuguese in their overseas territories. The work, is full of lively detail, with incidents described like the king of Viantana's killing of the Portuguese ambassadors to Malacca with boiling water and their bodies thrown to dogs.

Education  * Africa Beza College  History  In April 1941 the Italian troops retreating from Harar, Somalia and Shoa, concentrated in Shashamane after suffering several attacks by the British Army, R.A.F. and Ethiopian Roomaa. The British troops arrived at the beginning of May and the line of the Italian defense was held by Infantry and Artillery battalions on Little Dadaba river. On May 10 started an intensive shelling between South African and Indian artilleries on one side (supported by Hurricane planes) and the Italian artillery, on the other. After two days of reciprocal bombardment, on May 13 the British attacked with Natal Mounted Rifles, King's African Rifles, anti-tank rifles, mortars, tanks and armoured cars. Since Lieut. Col. Noel Douglas McMillan became ill, the attack was led by Major Leonard Montague Harris. The Italian 12th Colonial Somali Battalion (commanded by Major Gioacchino Nadalini), reinforced by Black Shirts, and the 121.st Artillery Battalion (commanded by Lieut. Col. Nicol√≤ Bonessa), reinforced by tankettes, an A.A. battery, machine gunners and infantrymen, were overwhelmed. Most of the Italian officers died on the battlefield, as well as both cited commanders. The Promised Land Twelve Tribes of Israel headquarters in Shashamane In the 1950s Emperor Haile Selassie I donated approximately of African soil to African Americans who were victims of racism and injustice after their ancestors had been forced into slavery in the United States of America. Haile Sellassie I formed the First Ethiopian World Federation in Harlem, NY and prepared a series of events to bond with African Americans for the Ethiopian culture before breaking the news about The Land Grants. While one of the female members of the E.W.F. was visiting Jamaica she was very excited and could not keep the news to herself. She shared the information about the Land Grant with the natives of Jamaica. The Land Grants were specifically intended for African American descendants of slaves in the U.S. in return for the favor that America played in coming to The Royal Families rescue in a time of need. Once everyone found out about the possibility of returning to the Homeland not only Jamaicans tried their hardest to get over there, divisions of the E.W.F. started popping up all over the World to take advantage of the Land Grants His Majesty left for African Americans.by Ayele Bekerie, Tadias Magazine The official letter confirming the \\"Land Grant\\" of 1948 was submitted to the members and executives of the Ethiopian World Federation in New York City, 1955. The first West Indian family and Federation members were Mr. James Piper and his wife Helen who arrived that same year as the first Land Grant administrators, returning to make a permanent settlement in 1955 on behalf of the federation. Haile Sellassie I visited Jamaica one time in an effort to get the natives to focus on uplifting their communities before visiting Ethiopia. By the time he left the entire community was infatuated with the thought that His Imperial Majesty was Jesus Christ in the flesh. He never returned. He did however try his best to encourage them to take care of the land that they had already been given in their own country. His Majesty left specific instructions with the U.S. and Africa pertaining to the Land Grant. African Americans were extremely traumatized as they fought for Civil Rights in America. They had a very hard time trying to stabilize their families, their citizenship, their equal rights all while figuring out their nationality while America was repairing itself for desegregation. They were promised that the land would be there when they were tired of fighting for Civil Rights and equality in The United States. Shashemane is their Promised Land. Meanwhile, the Rastafarian community in Jamaica was growing and many were looking for a way out.https://books.google.com/books?id=UVmt2VNyT7UC&pg;=PA138&lpg;=PA138&dq;=selassie+visit+1954+ethiopian+world+federation&source;=web&ots;=noBp52uW0r&sig;=hi8tpPeCdXKh3TrD8JS9s0HVRhI&hl;=en&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&resnum;=4&ct;=result by Ras Nathaniel The Rastafarians by Leonard E. Barrett The first actual Rastafarian that settled in Ethiopia, Gladstone Robinson, was also an official delegate of a division of the E.W.F. that went to Shashemane on behalf of the organization in June 1964, followed by Papa Noel Dyer, who hitchhiked and found his way to Ethiopia from England, eventually arriving in September 1965. Mr. Robinson, however, would later be appointed as the Land Grant administrator by a Division of The Federation executive council in 1967 thus replacing Mr. Piper and his wife in Ethiopia.\\\\- \\"EWF Presents Its Charter & Early Rastafari Leaders\\" It was within a couple of years that a moderate trickle of Rastafari immigrants began, with the population swelling past 2000 at one point. In fact, it was reported in 2004 that their numbers had dwindled from more than 2,000 to fewer than 300 according to a recent CNN Interview with Dr. Robinson and other Rastafari settlers.\\\\- INSIDE AFRICA, voiceover narrated by SEEMA MATHUR, CNN CORRESPONDENT Jamaican settlers petitioned Emperor Haile Selassie I for Ethiopian citizenship and other benefits several times. His Imperial Majesty was a kind Ruler, He set aside a small area for a couple of settlers to rest their heads. Once the Jamaican Settlers began having children and inviting more people to The African Americans soil they began asking for more. They grew leary in their beliefs that The King was their Messiah after a while. A few weeks later, the Jamaican Daily Gleaner reported that E.W.F. members in Jamaica left for Ethiopia on September 5 to develop the settlement with no money or support from their original country. A lot of the settlers there that are not African American do not even have passports or identification yet they are still asking for citizenship. They cannot be given citizenship in a land that belongs to African Americans in The United States, especially when The Land Grants were not meant for them with respect to the wishes of Emperor Haile Selassie I King of Kings Lord of Lords conquering Lion of The Tribe of Judah. After leaders of both Jamaican political parties, Hugh Shearer and Michael Manley, each paid visits to the community in September 1969, Selassie himself again visited and, according to EWF #37 leader Mortimer Planno, cautioned them against bringing Jamaican politics to Ethiopia. The following year, the Imperial Court ordered ten hectares apiece to be parceled out to twelve \\"pioneer\\" Rastafari settlers, as reported in The Gleaner on September 5, 1970.Repatriation in the context of NEPAD , citing Carole Yawney, Exodus: Rastafari, Repatriation, and the African Renaissance (2001). According to the EWF, Selassie again paid a visit on 1 October 1970, asking to speak to the then land grant administrator, James Piper, who was not a Rastafari. Piper declined to appear, claiming it was his Sabbath. This resulted in a change in administration at the settlement. It is reported that due to this and other incidents, Mr. Robinson replaced the Pipers as administrators the land prior to the Derg revolution. However, because of the \\"anti-organization\\" sentiments of many Rastas of that day, the federation's official authority was compromised. Many created other organizations, entities and groups in attempts to further deal with their own ways and means of repatriation. For example, one of the Rasta settlers, Clifton Baugh, was a main representative for the Rasta community in palace discussions on the land grant with minister Ato Tesfi, and Baugh also continually delivered the first fruits of their produce to the palace in Addis right up until 1974 when stopped by the Derg Revolution.Welcome to Sheshemane When Haile Selassie I was deposed in 1974 the new government of Mengistu Haile Mariam confiscated all but eleven hectares. In January 2005 there were reports in the media that Bob Marley's remains were to be exhumed and reburied at Shashemane. His wife Rita Marley described Ethiopia as his spiritual home, provoking controversy in Jamaica, where his remains still lie. The following month, thousands of fans gathered in Shashamane for a month of celebrations for what would have been Marley's 60th birthday. Rita Marley did not perform in Shashemane, The Prime Minister did not acknowledge the fact that the decedents of slaves in America will need their land. They just decided not to entertain in Shashemane. In January 2007 the settlers organized an exhibition and a bazaar in the city. It was also reported recently prior to the Ethiopian millennium that various pro-Ethiopian World Federation groups, consisting of indigenous Ethiopians and Rastafari, have given support to one of many five- year plans proposed for sustainable development of Shashemane, Ethiopia.\\\\- Ethiopian World Federation Ethiopian Millennium website ‚ÄúShashamane‚Äù, a 2017 documentary film about Shashamane and its relationship to repatriation, was released in 2016.

The quartzite rock of the ridge formed some 480 million years ago. During the last Ice Age Stiperstones lay on the eastern margin of the Welsh ice sheet. The hill itself was not glaciated though glaciers occupied surrounding valleys and it was subject to intense freezing and thawing which shattered the quartzite into a mass of jumbled scree surrounding several residual rocky tors. At above sea level it is the second-highest hill in the county, surpassed only by Brown Clee Hill (). Stiperstones' summit ridge is crowned by several jagged outcrops of rock, which may be seen silhouetted against the sky. Geography The Stiperstones is noted for its tors of quartzite. The principal ones are named as follows, from north-east to south-west: * Shepherd's Rock () * Devil's Chair () * Manstone Rock () * Cranberry Rock () * Nipstone Rock () * The Rock () Manstone Rock is the highest of these at , and is topped with a trig point. The Devil's Chair is the largest and best known. The Stiperstones ridge is a good place to view the upland landscape of the Shropshire Hills, particularly the Long Mynd to the east, and also gives extensive views towards the North Shropshire plain and the hills of Mid Wales. Geology The tors are formed from heavily faulted Ordovician age, grey-white quartzose sandstones known as the Stiperstones Quartzite Formation. This Arenigian age rock unit which dips steeply to the WNW is between 120 and 325m thick. The western slopes of the hill dropping to Stiperstones village are formed in the overlying Mytton Flags Formation, whereas the eastern slopes are formed in the underlying, and hence older, mudstones of the Shineton Shale Formation. Faulting narrows the outcrop of the Mytton Flags along the southern part of the Stiperstones ridge and the mudstones of the Hope Shale Formation with their interbedded volcaniclastics form much of the afforested ground to the west. The outcrop of the Stipertones Quartzite continues south-southwest to Black Rhadley Hill and peters out just beyond Heath Mynd. To the north-northeast, it continues as far as Pontesbury. Much of the ground around the tors is covered by head, a gravelly and bouldery deposit arising during the present Quaternary period and deriving from the rocks immediately beneath it. There are also some isolated peat deposits in places. Of particular note is the patterned ground surrounding the tors; some of the best examples of the periglacial features known as stone stripes and polygons in England. Wildlife and conservation The Stiperstones is a National Nature Reserve and Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). and is within the Shropshire Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It is a haven for wildlife, with birds that are normally associated with upland areas present, including red grouse, Eurasian curlew, peregrine falcon and the rare ring ouzel. Recently, a project called Back to Purple has commenced, to clear some of the hill of remaining plantations of coniferous and wooded areas, restoring the land to heather-based heath, with seasonal purple-flowering heather covering the summits around the tors and enhancing the views of the Stiperstones from the surrounding peaks and valleys. Back to Purple is managed by a partnership of Natural England, Forest Enterprise and the Shropshire Wildlife Trust. Their work has so far seen removal of thousands of pine trees and conifers, including the whole Gatten Plantation (still shown on OS maps) and the previously covered Nipstone Rock has emerged from hiding. Thousands of heather seedlings have been successfully planted to supplement natural regeneration. To balance this out and complement it further work below summit level has also aimed at restoring grasslands, rich in herbs, hay meadows, wet flushes which produce bog cotton, Heath Bedstraw and the rarer Mountain Pansy and natural woodlands. Cultural references The general area has a long history of lead mining, most notably during the Roman occupation of Britain. Several pigs of lead have been found nearby, and the tradition continued into Victorian times. The area around the Stiperstones is rich in myths and folklore relating to the rocks of the Devil's Chair. According to one legend, the ghost of Wild Edric, a Saxon earl who held lands that were confiscated after 1066 and successfully defied the Normans, for a time at least, rides the hills whenever England is threatened by invasion. The Stiperstones feature in the literary works of Mary Webb, who drew it as The Diafol (translated from Welsh, \\"Devil's\\") Mountain in her novel The Golden Arrow (1916), of children's author Malcolm Saville, and in a jazz work commissioned by Music at Leasowes Bank, written and performed by the Clark Tracey Quintet. D.H. Lawrence used the Stiperstones and the Devil's Chair in particular as a setting for his novel St Mawr (1925). The Half Man Half Biscuit album 90 Bisodol (Crimond) contains a track entitled \\"Descent of the Stiperstones\\". Bog Mine and Visitor Centre Until the early 20th century lead was mined at The Bog, just west of Stiperstones. The mine at The Bog and the adjacent Stiperstones outcrop were only viable because of a geological movement; over time the movement of the tectonic plates landed at this site, combined with the movement of the earth it crumpled the layers and the softest layers were then eroded away. After mining stopped, the undisturbed remnants provided a range of wildlife habitats: birds nest in the old buildings, bats roost in the old mine tunnels, and reservoirs and ponds are ideal for aquatic life. The Bog Visitor Centre is the main facility for visitors to the Stiperstones. It is housed in the former village school and retains its old interior design. It provides historical information about the past workers, mining, and present- day work to restore the landscape. Facilities at the centre include toilets and car parking (with facilities for the disabled including reserved parking, toilets and ramps). Activities include walking, with two main circular walks called Mucklewick Walk and Flenny Bank Walk and a variety of riding routes. 2012 fire On 25 July 2012 part of the reserve was devastated by fire, said to have been a result of the sudden upturn in dry, hot weather coupled with the large amount of dry heather on the hills. More than 70 firemen battled the fire between 15.00 and 22.00 BST; smoke could be seen up to 10 miles away in the county town of Shrewsbury. Firefighters remained on site throughout the night because of the severity of the fire and the extent of the affected areas.

Early life Upshur‚Äîborn John Henry Nottingham in Northampton County, Virginia December 5, 1823 changed his name at the request of his mother to her maiden name Upshur gratifying her wish, as the Upshur family was conspicuous in naval annals. He was appointed a midshipman on 4 November 1841 and initially served at sea with the Mediterranean Squadron. During the war with Mexico, Upshur was assigned to St. Mary's as that brig participated in operations against Tampico. He also served ashore with the naval battery during the attacks against Vera Cruz in March 1847. In the years preceding the Civil War, Upshur carried out assignments in the Mediterranean, the West Indian, and the African Squadrons. He also performed brief tours of duty at the Naval Academy and at the Washington Navy Yard as an ordnance officer. From 1853 to 1856, Upshur served in Supply during Commodore Matthew Calbraith Perry's expeditions to Japan which opened that nation to the west. Civil War Unlike cousin Robert E. Lee Upshur stayed with the Union military during the American Civil War, resisting much family pressure to choose the Confederacy. He was assigned to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, and participated in the capture of the Southern forts at Hatteras Inlet 1861 which opened the North Carolina sounds to Union forces. Upshur was executive officer of Wabash during the expedition which wrested Port Royal, South Carolina, from Confederate hands. He also commanded four boats in Commander C. R. P Rodgers's expedition in the inland coast waters in the vicinity of Port Royal and Beaufort, South Carolina. Later on, Upshur served in the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron in charge of the steamer during operations against Charleston. He returned to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron in time for the abortive joint expedition against Fort Fisher late in December 1864. Upshur was in the expedition which finally carried the Southern works guarding Wilmington in mid-January 1865.

It is home to Whiteleys, many restaurants, caf√©s, pubs, souvenir shops and a few high-street retail chains. Queensway and Westbourne Grove are identified in the London Plan as one of 35 major centres in Greater London. The street is numbered the B411 in the British road numbering scheme. Queensway is currently undergoing a major redevelopment on all sides, with a building on the top of the road being developed for ¬£500m, Whiteleys for ¬£1.2BN and a series of other redevelopments happening at the same time. History Bayswater and Lancaster Gate were first developed as residential suburbs of London in the early 19th century. Bayswater Road, for example, the road at the Bayswater southern end (Bayswater Road) was already a long-established route across the countryside, and a road roughly following the present Queensway can be seen on early maps running north from Bayswater Road across fields under the name of Black Lion Lane. It was subsequently renamed Queen's Road in honour of Queen Victoria, who had been born at nearby Kensington Palace: a name, however, which somewhat lacked distinctiveness, for this reason the present name of Queensway was eventually substituted. Near the northern end of the street was Whiteleys, on the site of London's first department store, opened by William Whiteley in 1867. The store was awarded a Royal Warrant by Queen Victoria in 1896. The facade of the current building is from 1911, but the building itself was demolished and rebuilt in 1989. In recent years, Queensway has become a centre for the entertainment and leisure industry in London. London's biggest ice rink, the Queen's Ice & Bowl in Queensway was recently renovated after investment and development by Robert Bourne (developer) and Bourne Capital. This has led the way for further developments in the area's entertainment and leisure industry. Queensway's retail industry is also booming with the famous Queensway Market showing significant growth in recent years. Modern Development It is reported that a Brunei family, in conjunction with Meyer Bergman and others, has acquired a large part of Queensway, which is bordered by the more prestigious Notting Hill and Kensington areas, in order to re-develop it. The purchases include the Queensway Estate, location of the ice skating rink and Queensway Market, and the Whiteley's shopping centre which was purchased from Standard Life Investments.Brunei family‚Äôs secret ¬£500m swoop on Queensway by Suzie Neuwirth, City A.M., 16 September 2013.

The Runway bus is a 64-bit wide, split transaction, time multiplexed address and data bus running at 120 MHz. This scheme was chosen by HP as they determined that a bus using separate address and data wires would have only delivered 20% more bandwidth for a 50% increase in pin count, which would have made microprocessors using the bus more expensive.

Debuting as a villain, the Shade was best known for fighting against two generations of superheroes, most notably the Golden Age and Silver Age versions of the Flash. He eventually became a mentor for Jack Knight, the son of the Golden Age Starman, Ted Knight, a hero the Shade had also fought.Harris, Tony, Starman, DC Comics, 1994 Though initially portrayed in the Golden Age comics as a thief with a cane that could manipulate shadows, the character was reinvented in 1994 as a morally ambiguous Victorian-era immortal who gained the ability to manipulate shadows and immortality from an unexplained mystical event. In 2009, the Shade was ranked as IGN's 89th- greatest villain of all time.Shade is number 89 IGN. Retrieved 10-05-09 Shade made his first live-action appearance on the third season of The Flash played by Mike McLeod. The Shade appears on the season one finale of the DC Universe streaming service show Stargirl and will appear in the second season on The CW network. Character inspiration Charles Dickens' story The Old Curiosity Shop features an English rake also named Richard, and a dwarf named Quilp. In continuity, it is suggested that Shade's story inspired Dickens to write The Old Curiosity Shop. James Robinson has stated that he drew some inspiration for the Shade's mannerisms and speech patterns from the British stage and screen actor Jonathan Pryce. It was announced by Robinson in 2010 that a solo Shade series was then in development. The series, written by Robinson and drawn by Cully Hamner, launched in late 2011 and dealt with Shade and his descendants, flashing back to various points in his life as he travelled the globe trying to find who is behind a plot to kill him. Fictional character biography The 'Shade' draws his alias and source of power from Dante Alighieri's epic poem The Divine Comedy, specifically its first book, Inferno, which describes the Nine Rings of Hell. This poem is the most cited depiction of Hell, and the various characters in the story referred to as \\"the Shade\\" are references to the perpetual darkness of Hell itself. The comic book villain \\"the Shade\\" uses his power of perpetual night to cast a blanket of darkness over various parts of the world. In darkness, evil triumphs. =Pre- Crisis= The Shade was introduced in Flash Comics #33, as a villain for the original Flash, Jay Garrick. He was portrayed as a thief who could manipulate the shadows with a magical cane. He fought both Garrick and the second Flash, Barry Allen. He was a member of several supervillain teams, including the Injustice Society. Shade was one of three villains used for the first meeting of the two heroes in the famous \\"Flash of Two Worlds\\" story, which reintroduced the Golden Age Flash to the Silver Age. He was jailed along with the Thinker and the Fiddler. In the \\"Crisis on Earth-S\\" story (Justice League of America #136) he is one of King Kull's agents positioned on Earth-S to wipe out humanity there. With Doctor Light he causes perpetual night and darkness on either side of the planet, but is met by Bulletman and Hawkman. =Post- Crisis= The Shade returned in print in 1986, as a member of the Wizard's new incarnation of the Injustice Society. The Shade's next appearance was in a flashback story in Secret Origins #50 (1989), which presented a post-Crisis retelling of \\"Flash of Two Worlds\\". =Post-Zero Hour= After Zero Hour, the Shade's origin was changed drastically. The Shade was retconned to an English gentleman named Richard Swift, a young man in the year 1838. One night in London, Swift is trapped amidst an unexplained mystical tragedy, which killed 104 people. The most immediate effect on him is the permanent loss of his memories prior to the incident. Coincidentally, a passerby named Piers Ludlow offers to take in Swift while he recovers. The whole affair is a setup; the Ludlow family is in fact a band of killers and swindlers, who have grown wealthy killing their wealthy business partners and then kill a vagrant in the vicinity to give the impression of a failed robbery/homicide. Before they can make Swift their next scapegoat, he reflexively unleashes his shadows, killing all the present Ludlows. Only a young pair of twins, absent from the excursion, survive. The following evening Swift meets one of his true friends, the author Charles Dickens.The Shade miniseries #1 (DC Comics, 1997). DC Comics. Decades later, Swift is ambushed by Rupert Ludlow, one of the surviving twins. Rupert and his sister have been plotting revenge for years, going so far as to raise their children as future assassins. Though grievously injured, Swift manages to kill Ludlow, as his shadow power has made him both immortal and resistant to injury. Afterward, he leaves England and starts a career as an adventurer/assassin/observer on life, which spans whole continents and leads him to many adventures. While traveling, he meets Brian Savage (Scalphunter) and visits Opal City for the first time. He establishes himself in Opal, acquiring real estate and generally living well, even encountering Oscar Wilde. During his journeys, he meets a similar immortal born of the same incident and bearing his same powers, a dwarf by the name of Simon Culp, who becomes his mortal enemy.The Shade #2 (1997). DC Comics. During all of the Shade's escapades, he is pursued by the Ludlows, whom he kills by the dozens. He is nearly killed by one Ludlow, Marguerite Croft, when he falls in love with her in Paris during the 1930s. She tries to kill Shade with poison, but is unsuccessful. Shade survives and is forced to kill Marguerite when she confesses that though she loves him, her loyalty to her family would force her to make more attempts on his life. This leaves Shade with a sense of general depression and the feeling he could never love again. Because of this and the death of Brian Savage, he resumes his activities as an assassin.The Shade #3 (1997). DC Comics. During World War II, he leaves America to defend England, and fights Simon Culp again. An exploding bomb causes Culp's body to fuse inside Shade's body. Unaware of this, the Shade returns to Keystone City. This was the time of the Golden Age of Heroes, and of them all he chooses Jay Garrick, the first Flash, as his adversary. During this time, Culp is able to subtly affect the Shade's behavior, and was even able to take over Shade's body completely when the latter is tired. When the Flash retires in the 1950s, a new hero called the Spider takes his place. Shade investigates the Spider's background and discovers he is both a criminal (using his role to get rid of the competition) and a Ludlow by birth. Ludlow's move to Keystone City was part of his plan to kill the Shade. Shade instead kills the Spider, and rescues Flash and his wife from a murder attempt.Starman vol. 2 #46 (1997). DC Comics. During the 1960s, Shade briefly teams up with Doctor Fate to take down one of Culp's criminal ventures, a mystic organization called the Wise Fools, who wished to repeat the ritual that created him by summoning a wild, uncontrolled bubble of shadow (actually Culp's shadow, separated from the Shade by Culp). Unaware that Culp's consciousness is actually within the Shade, he and Dr. Fate destroy the Wise Fools operation and throw the bubble into an empty dimension (where it continues to grow in power and size). This was all part of Culp's larger plan, one which almost culminates in the destruction of Opal City.Showcase #4‚Äì5 (1996). DC Comics. =Starman (vol. 2)= James Robinson gave the character a starring role in his new Starman series in 1994. In the first story arc, Sins of the Father, Jack believes Shade to be his enemy when he kidnaps Jack's father, retired Starman Ted Knight, on the orders of the senile Mist, who wishes for a final showdown. Shade later betrays the Mist by allying himself with the O'Dare family, a clan of police officers who assist Jack in the memory of their father Billy O'Dare, a policeman who had often assisted the original Starman. Shade, with the O'Dares, assaults the Mist's hideout and rescues Ted Knight. Shade befriends the family's \\"black sheep\\", Matt O'Dare.Starman vol. 2 #0‚Äì6 (1997). DC Comics. Much of the Shade's past is revealed through journal entries included in the Starman comics, including the flashback issues called \\"Times Past\\". They often deal with different Starmen, including Jack's father Ted, as well as other characters from the Starman mythos, such as Brian Savage. There were a total of 10 \\"Times Past\\" issues in the 80-issue series. \\"Excerpts\\" from the Shade's journal often replaced the Starman letters column, frequently giving additional background related to the story or background into Shade's motivations. These excerpts are written as prose, as opposed to a more traditional comic style, with occasional illustrations, and as journal entries being written by the Shade himself at different points in his existence.Starman vol. 2 #11, 18, 28, 36, 42, 44, 46, 54 and 74 (1997). DC Comics. Shade has an active part in an adventure of Jack's involving a demon hidden within a poster that can snatch innocent people and drag them into Hell. Shade does not like Merritt, the human guardian of the poster, who has gained immortality for his protection of it, and was the inspiration for Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray. In a fight for possession of the poster, Matt O'Dare is dragged within and Shade follows. Inside the poster, Shade, Jack and Matt separately agree to sell their souls in exchange for the liberation of all the souls contained within. The demon, unable to accept a selfless deal, is forced to release everyone (but takes Merritt's soul instead). Matt decides to turn over a new leaf and put his crooked past behind him. Shade assists him in his efforts, while influenced by the revelation that O'Dare is the reincarnated lawman Scalphunter, who happens to be an old friend.Starman vol. 2 #24‚Äì26, 41 (1997). DC Comics. A particularly important point in the life of Shade comes when he meets the demon-lord Neron. Neron offers, as he has done so with many supervillains before him, to enhance Shade's power. Shade sees little use in Neron's offer, as he has no need to increase his already substantial wealth, sees no way of heightening his shadows' power and is already immortal. Neron, angered by his rejection, swears vengeance against Shade.Showcase '95 #12 (1995). DC Comics. Over the years the Ludlow attacks have dwindled. This lasts until the wife of the last Ludlow calls him to talk her husband out of attempting an attack that would certainly cost him his life. Shade talks Ludlow out of pursuing his family's vendetta, burying a legacy of hate that has lasted more than 150 years.The Shade #4 (1997). DC Comics. Another notable point during the series' run came when the Godwave struck the DC universe, depowering almost all superheroes. In a confrontation between Starman, Matt O'Dare, Green Lantern, and the Infernal Doctor Pip, Pip almost blows up a large section of an Opal skyscraper, but Shade appears at the last minute and draws Pip into the Darklands, which serve as his power source, before the bomb can explode.Starman vol. 2 #30‚Äì33 (1997). DC Comics. At various times, Culp is able to take control over or subtly influence Shade. At one point, Culp takes full control to talk to Jack, in the process making a mistake about the name of a Wilde story. Around the time Jack returns from space in the \\"Stars, My Destination\\" story arc, Culp is able to assume full control over Shade's body for an extended period of time and imprison or neutralize most of Opal City's heroes in a bid to loot and destroy Opal - with seemingly no motive other than to destroy what Shade loves most. Gathering an army of villains whom Jack has battled over the course of the series, Culp absorbs Shade's powers, in addition to the shadow force Shade and Dr. Fate had exiled decades before, to cast a spell allowing him to trap Opal City in an impenetrable bubble of shadow and force a confrontation with the city's heroes. Many of the supervillains helping Culp have been gathered by either Neron, the still- vengeful daughter of the Mist, or one of the last Ludlows in existence: the son of the false hero the Spider. This story is the climax of the series, told in the \\"Grand Guignol\\" story arc. Shade eventually is able to cast out Culp, while losing his shadow powers in the process. However, Culp underestimates the Shade, and is tricked into allowing a small shadow imp loyal to Shade to be absorbed into his own shadow, leading to a battle of wills in which Shade draws all the darkness into himself, leaving Culp powerless. Culp attempts to buy his freedom by threatening the younger Mist, but is killed by the elder Mist. This is a turning point for Shade, as he now has freedom of choice, and is able to decide whether he wishes to remain a villain or become a true hero. He is present at the final showdown with the Mist and leaves the building with Ralph Dibny, Jack and Theo Kyle Knight.Starman vol. 2 #61‚Äì73 (1997). DC Comics. =Post-Starman (vol. 2)= Since the end of the Starman (vol. 2) series, the Shade has made cameo appearances in several comic series, including Green Arrow and JSA and was listed alongside magical-based villains such as Felix Faust and Circe. He also has a brief appearance in DC's Brave New World in 2006. During the Infinite Crisis, he is seen using his powers to help Opal citizens by protecting the buildings they are in (though, in a remark full of his trademark cynicism, he comments he is not doing it to save the citizens themselves, but, rather, he is \\"saving the architecture\\"). He shows up in Robinson's Justice League: Cry for Justice, waiting for his old rival Jay Garrick in his home. He informs Garrick that the insane supervillain Prometheus has ordered a series of attacks on various superheroes (including Batwoman, Barry Allen, Crimson Avenger, and Stargirl) in order to distract them from a sinister master plan. Shade accompanies Jay to the JLA Watchtower in order to warn the other heroes of the impending doom.Justice League: Cry For Justice #5. DC Comics. He and Jay arrive at the Watchtower just as Prometheus (who had disguised himself as Freddy Freeman and defeated the entire League) attempts to escape. Though Jay is easily floored, the Shade proves difficult to defeat (as he is technically not a \\"hero\\", meaning Prometheus has no file on how to stop him), and ultimately ends up stopping Donna Troy from killing the supervillain after he has been beaten into submission. The Shade later creates a portal that gives Green Arrow access to Prometheus' otherdimensional lair,Justice League of America (vol. 2) #42 (February 2010). DC Comics. where the archer kills Prometheus in revenge for Star City, the dismemberment of his former protege Red Arrow, and the death of Red Arrow's daughter.Justice League: Cry for Justice #7 (March 2010). DC Comics. During Blackest Night, Shade is in a relationship with Hope O'Dare, and claims that he is in love with her. After a night of sex, Shade and Hope are confronted by David Knight, reanimated as a Black Lantern. David rips out Shade's heart, but, due to his powers, he survives as he is unable to be killed, which allows Shade to resist the call of a black ring that seeks to turn him into another undead Lantern. After David threatens to kill Hope and later Jack, an enraged Shade uses his powers to trap the Black Lantern within the Shadowlands after decrying the Lantern as a mockery and a fake, saying he has \\"no light of his own\\", and uses his own heart as a channel to bind and banish him. Afterwards, Hope admits that she loves Shade as well, and they depart from the scene of the battle.Starman (vol. 2) #81. DC Comics. Shortly after the events of \\"Blackest Night\\", the Shade is approached by Hal Jordan and Barry Allen, and he takes them to the Ghost Zone where they find the rotting corpse of Prometheus.Justice League: The Rise and Fall Special. DC Comics. During Brightest Day, Jay Garrick arrives at the Shade's home with Doctor Mid-Nite, Sebastian Faust, and Wildcat to see if he can help track down the missing Obsidian, who possesses abilities similar to those of the Shade. After entering the house, the JSA members find Obsidian and Doctor Fate standing over the Shade's comatose body. Obsidian, now possessed by a cosmic entity known as the Starheart, tells the heroes that the Shade would have told them his \\"secrets\\", and that the Starheart commanded that he and Fate silence him.Justice Society of America (vol. 3) #41. DC Comics. Following the defeat of the Starheart, Congorilla mentions that the Shade has been missing since his assault at the hands of Obsidian, and that nobody has been able to contact him.Starman/Congorilla #1. DC Comics. Shade's disappearance is explained shortly after this, when it is revealed that he had been captured and brainwashed by Eclipso.Justice League of America (vol. 2) #54. DC Comics. Realizing that Shade could turn the tide of the battle, Saint Walker sends the Atom and Starman inside his body to fight off the effects of Eclipso's brainwashing.Justice League of America (vol. 2) #58. DC Comics. The heroes narrowly manage to free the Shade's mind, and he turns against Eclipso and ultimately helps the Justice League defeat the villain once and for all.Justice League of America (vol. 2) #59. DC Comics. =The New 52= In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, a 12-issue series has the Shade survive an assassination attempt, then travel the world to uncover the people behind it. Along the way he deals with his past before the shadows, as well as the encounters he had with his descendants through the years. It is also explained how he first met Culp, and exactly how he gained the shadow powers.The Shade vol. 2 #1-12. DC Comics. =DC Rebirth= In DC Rebirth, Iris West, Barry Allen and Wally West II get sucked into the Shadowlands. Separated from Iris, Barry and Wally meet up with the Shade, who reveals he has lost control of his shadows. His shadows have also kidnapped Hope, and both she and Iris are corrupted by the Shade's darkness. The Flashes and Shade are able to free Hope and Iris from the shadows, with the Shade regaining his powers as well as reconciling with Hope O'Dare.The Flash vol. 5 #12. DC Comics. =Possible futures= During the Starman story arc \\"Stars, My Destination\\" Jack is thrown by a shadowy corridor created by a future Shade across time and space into a future where Shade's powers overtake him due to a disease that Culp had infected him with during their final battle. His shadow begins expanding into the universe and threatens areas protected by the Legion. Rescuing him, the future Shade explains how Jack may be able to stop it from ever happening by using his cosmic rod on him in the past. He later opens another time portal to allow Jack to journey across time again to reach his destination, Throneworld. In the final issue of Starman, Jack apparently is able to stop the disease before it has the chance to affect Shade; whether this actually changes the future is never revealed. Starman Annual #1 shows a possible future for Shade as the protector of a Utopian planet thousands of years from the present. As with the current Shade, he enjoys telling tales of his past. The planet's technology and possibly the planet itself seemed to be made almost entirely out of Cosmic Rod technology inspired by Starman and his legacy. Powers and abilities Shade is, at present, one of the best, if not the ultimate, channeler of the power of the Shadowlands, which is a quasi-sentient, extra-dimensional mass of malleable darkness. He can use it for many effects, both as an absence of light and a solid substance: he can summon and control \\"demons\\", project as shields and conjure areas of complete darkness, create all kinds of constructs out of shadows, transport himself and others through it over great distances, and can use it as a prison dimension. The darkness itself can be dispelled by sufficiently bright blasts of light or energy. Eventually, his experience with the shadows allows him to create corridors through time. The shadows have also granted Shade agelessness and immortality. Dr. Fate once remarked that even the Spectre would have serious difficulty dealing with the Shade, possibly due to the origin of his powers (the former realm of a divine entity on par with God).Showcase '96 #4. DC Comics. He is heavily resistant to damage, as seen when a demolition bomb falls on him, leaving him only slightly dazed. Even with his heart torn out of his chest by Black Lantern David Knight, he remained alive and unable to die. His only weakness (if it can be called such) is the fact that if he loses his shadow, he becomes vulnerable. However, this can only occur if a survivor from the same event in 1838 drains him of it, or in the event of a light strong enough to completely surround him to the point that he is unable to cast a shadow.

Mossey River was spelled \\"Mossy\\" prior to 1900. The river mouth was the site of the original Fort Dauphin fur trading post, constructed by the son of French explorer Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, sieur de La V√©rendrye, in the late 18th century. Various forts of different companies, such as the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), have stood on this site. The peak of the community's economic boom occurred during the settler-era fur trade and 20th century timber and fishing industries.

When fire destroyed the former building in 1919, a church provided temporary accommodation, until a new two-classroom building opened in the early 1920s. In 1955, a new four-classroom building opened for the collegiate (senior school). Secondary education came under the control of Duck Mountain School Division #34 in 1958, and the elementary followed in 1967.

Himroo was brought to Aurangabad in the reign of Mohammad Tughlaq, when he had shifted his capital from Delhi to Daulatabad, Aurangabad. The word himroo originated from Persian word Hum-ruh which means 'similar'. Himroo is a replication of Kinkhwab, which was woven with pure golden and silver threads in olden days, and was meant for the royal families. Himroo uses Persian designs, and is very characteristic and distinctive in appearance. Himroo from Aurangabad is in demand for its unique style and design. Some historians believe that Himroo was the innovation of local craftsmen with very little Persian influence. Himroo Is woven near Delhi Gate and Zaffar Gate neighborhood in Aurangabad. History According to historians this art originated in Persia, though it has not been proved, himroo is associated with the times of Mohammad Tughlaq who ruled in the 14th century. When Mohammad Tughlaq shifted his capital from Delhi to Daulatabad many weavers came and settled here. During the migration, the weavers instead of returning to Delhi chose to stay back here. They did not want to go back to Delhi. During the reign of Malik Ambar many people were attracted to the city and came and settled here from far and wide. Aurangabad during Aurangzeb's Governorship and the times of Mughal became the capital and the weavers had a gala time making money and becoming prosperous. The handicraft industry in Aurangabad attracted hundreds of craftsman and artisans. Members of the royal family and an elite few used the famous Aurangabad himroo.

Under Naram-Sin the empire reached its maximum strength. He was the first Mesopotamian king known to have claimed divinity for himself, taking the title \\"God of Akkad\\", and the first to claim the title \\"King of the Four Quarters, King of the Universe\\".  Biography  Naram-Sin was born as a son of Manishtushu. He was thus a nephew of King Rimush and grandson of Sargon and Tashlultum. Naram-Sin's aunt was the High Priestess En-hedu-ana. =Reign= Possible relief of Naram-Sin at Darband-i-Gawr, celebrating his victory over Lullubi king Satuni. Qaradagh Mountain, Sulaymaniyah, Iraqi Kurdistan. Naram- Sin defeated Manium of Magan, and various northern hill tribes in the Zagros, Taurus, and Amanus Mountains, expanding his empire up to the Mediterranean Sea and Armenia. His \\"Victory Stele\\" depicts his triumph over Satuni, chief of Lullubi in the Zagros Mountains. The king list gives the length of his reign as 56 years, and at least 20 of his year-names are known, referring to military actions against various places such as Uruk and Subartu. One unknown year was recorded as \\"the Year when Naram-Sin was victorious against Simurrum in Kirasheniwe and took prisoner Baba the governor of Simurrum, and Dubul the ensi of Arame\\".Year-Names of Naram-Sin of Agade Other year names refer to his construction work on temples in Akkad, Nippur, and Zabala. He also built administrative centers at Nagar and Nineveh. At one point in his reign much of the empire, led by Iphur-Kis from the city of Kish rose in rebellion and was put down strongly.Steve Tinney, A New Look at Naram-Sin and the \\"Great Rebellion\\", Journal of Cuneiform Studies, vol. 47, pp. 1-14, 1995 Submission of Sumerian kings The submission of some Sumerian rulers to Naram-Sin, and in general to the Akkadian Empire, is recorded in the seal inscriptions of Sumerian rulers such as Lugal-ushumgal, governor (ensi) of Lagash (\\"Shirpula\\"), circa 2230-2210 BCE. Several inscriptions of Lugal- ushumgal are known, particularly seal impressions, which refer to him as governor of Lagash and at the time a vassal (, arad, \\"servant\\" or \\"slave\\") of Naram-Sin, as well as his successor Shar-kali-sharri.Seal image M4 in: One of these seals proclaims: It can be considered that Lugalushumgal was a collaborator of the Akkadian Empire, as was Meskigal, ruler of Adab. Later however, Lugal-ushumgal was succeeded by Puzer-Mama who, as Akkadian power waned, achieved independence from Shar-Kali-Sharri, assuming the title of \\"King of Lagash\\" and starting the illustrious Second Dynasty of Lagash.\\"Puzur- Mama, who served as a ‚Äúgovernor‚Äù of Lagash, in all probability during the reign of Shar-kali-sharri. After the Akkadian empire had collapsed, Puzur-Mama became fully independent, assuming the title of \\"King of Lagash\\"\\" in Control of Elam Naram-Sin campaigned from Elam in the east, to Ebla and Armanum in the west. Elam had been under the domination of Akkad, at least temporarily, since the time of Sargon. The Elamite king Khita is probably recorded as having signed a peace treaty with Naram-Sin, stating: \\"The enemy of Naram-Sin is my enemy, the friend of Naram-Sin is my friend\\". It has been suggested that the formal treaty allowed Naram-Sin to have peace on his eastern borders, so that he could deal more effectively with the threat from Gutium. Further study of the treaty suggests that Khita provided Elamite troops to Naram-Sin, that he married his daughter to the Akkadian king, and that he agreed to set up statues of Naram-Sin in the sanctuaries of Susa. As a matter of fact, it is well known that Naram-Sin had extreme influence over Susa during his reign, building temples and establishing inscriptions in his name, and having the Akkadian language replace Elamite in official documents. During the rule of Naram-Sin, \\"military governors of the country of Elam\\" (shakkanakkus) with typically Akkadian names are known, such as Ili-ishmani or Epirmupi. This suggests that these governors of Elam were officials of the Akkadian Empire. Conquest of Armanum and Ebla Akkadian soldier of Naram-Sin, with helmet and long sword, on the Nasiriyah stele. He carries a metal vessel of Anatolian type. The conquest of Armanum and Ebla on the Mediterranean coast by Naram-Sin is mentioned in several of his inscriptions: =Nasiriyah stele of Naram-Sin= An alabaster stele representing captives being led by Akkadian soldiers is generally attributed to Narim-Sin on stylistic grounds. In particular, it is considered as more sophisticated graphically than the steles of Sargon of Akkad or those of Rimush. Two fragments are in the National Museum of Iraq, and one in the Boston Museum. The stele is quite fragmentary, but attempts at reconstitution have been made. Depending on sources, the fragments were excavated in Wasit, al-Hay district, Wasit Governorate, or in Nasiriyah, both locations in Iraq. It is thought that the stele represents the result of the campaigns of Naram-Sin to Cilicia or Anatolia. This is suggested by the characteristics of the booty carried by the soldiers in the stele, especially the metal vessel carried by the main soldier, the design of which is unknown in Mesopotamia, but on the contrary well known in contemporary Anatolia. Nasiriyah Victory Stele of Naram-Sin. From Mesopotamia, Iraq, c. 2300 BCE. Iraq Museum.jpgSoldier with sword, on the Nasiriyah stele of Naram-Sin Nasiriyah Victory Stele of Naram-Sin, from Mesopotamia, Iraq, c. 2300 BCE. Iraq Museum.jpgNaked captives, on the Nasiriyah stele of Naram-Sin =The Curse of Akkad= Victory Stele of Naram- Sin, c. 2230 BC. It shows him defeating the Lullibi, a tribe in the Zagros Mountains, and their king Satuni, trampling them and spearing them. Satuni, standing right, is imploring Naram-Sin to save him. Naram-Sin is also twice the size of his soldiers. In the 12th century BC it was taken to Susa, where it was found in 1898. One Mesopotamian myth, a historiographic poem entitled \\"The curse of Akkad: the Ekur avenged\\", explains how the empire created by Sargon of Akkad fell and the city of Akkad was destroyed. The myth was written hundreds of years after Naram-Sin's life and is the poet's attempt to explain how the Gutians succeeded in conquering Sumer. After an opening passage describing the glory of Akkad before its destruction, the poem tells of how Naram-Sin angered the chief god Enlil by plundering the Ekur (Enlil's temple in Nippur.) In his rage, Enlil summoned the Gutians down from the hills east of the Tigris, bringing plague, famine and death throughout Mesopotamia. Food prices became vastly inflated, with the poem stating that 1 lamb would buy only half a sila (about 425 ml) of grain, half a sila of oil, or half a mina (about 250g) of wool. To prevent this destruction, eight of the gods (namely Inanna, Enki, Sin, Ninurta, Utu, Ishkur, Nusku, and Nidaba) decreed that the city of Akkad should be destroyed in order to spare the rest of Sumer and cursed it. This is exactly what happens, and the story ends with the poet writing of Akkad's fate, mirroring the words of the gods' curse earlier on: Its chariot roads grew nothing but the 'wailing plant,' Moreover, on its canalboat towpaths and landings, No human being walks because of the wild goats, vermin, snakes, and mountain scorpions, The plains where grew the heart-soothing plants, grew nothing but the 'reed of tears,' Akkad, instead of its sweet-flowing water, there flowed bitter water, Who said \\"I would dwell in that\\" found not a good dwelling place, Who said \\"I would lie down in Akkad\\" found not a good sleeping place.\\" =Gutian Incursions= These Gutian raids were indeed devastating, but it is unknown how badly they affected Sumer. Naram-Sin may have passed on his empire to his son Shar-Kali-Sharri more or less intact upon his death in c. 2219 BC, or he may have passed on little more than Akkad itself. The Gutians remained there for over 100 years before being replaced by the Ur III state as the dominant political power.Babylonian Life and History, by E. A. Wallis Budge =Victory stele= Naram-Sin's Victory Stele depicts him as a god-king (symbolized by his horned helmet) climbing a mountain above his soldiers, and his enemies, the defeated Lullubi led by their king Satuni. Although the stele was broken off at the top when it was stolen and carried off by the Elamite forces of Shutruk-Nakhunte in the 12th century BCE, it still strikingly reveals the pride, glory, and divinity of Naram-Sin. The stele seems to break from tradition by using successive diagonal tiers to communicate the story to viewers, however the more traditional horizontal frames are visible on smaller broken pieces. It is six feet and seven inches tall, and made from pink limestone. The stele was found at Susa, and is now in the Louvre Museum. A similar bas-relief depicting Naram-Sin was found a few miles north-east of Diarbekr, at Pir H√ºseyin. The inscription over the head of the king is in Akkadian and fragmentary, but reads: The second inscription, to the right over the mountainous cone, is in Elamite and was written about 1000 years later by king Shutruk-Nahhunte, who stole the stele and brought it to Elam. = Children = Among the known sons of Naram-Sin were his successor Shar-Kali- Sharri, Nabi-Ulmash, who was governor of Tutub, and a Ukin-Ulmash. Excavations at Tell Mozan (ancient Urkesh) brought to light a sealing of Tar'am-Agade, a previously unknown daughter of Naram-Sin, who was possibly married to an unidentified endan (ruler) of Urkesh. Excavations by Nabonidus circa 550 BCE A foundation deposit of Naram-Sin was discovered and analysed by king Nabonidus, circa 550 BCE, who is thus known as the first archaeologist. Not only did he lead the first excavations which were to find the foundation deposits of the temples of ≈†ama≈° the sun god, the warrior goddess Anunitu (both located in Sippar), and the sanctuary that Naram-Sin built to the moon god, located in Harran, but he also had them restored to their former glory. He was also the first to date an archaeological artifact in his attempt to date Naram-Sin's temple during his search for it. Even though his estimate was inaccurate by about 1,500 years, it was still a very good one considering the lack of accurate dating technology at the time.

He was the son of Sir Henry Ponsonby, Private Secretary to Queen Victoria and Mary Elizabeth Bulteel, daughter of John Crocker Bulteel. He was also the great-grandson of The 3rd Earl of Bessborough, The 3rd Earl of Bathurst and The 2nd Earl Grey. The 1st Baron Sysonby was his elder brother. Ponsonby is often quoted as the author of the dictum \\"When war is declared, truth is the first casualty\\", published in his book Falsehood in War-time, Containing an Assortment of Lies Circulated Throughout the Nations During the Great War (1928). However, he uses this phrase in quotation marks as an epigram at the start of the book and does not present it as his own words. Its likely origin is the almost identical line spoken in 1917 by the United States Senator Hiram Johnson: \\"The first casualty when war comes is truth\\".Hiram Johnson in U. S. Senate, 1918, quoted in The Quote Verifier: Who Said What, Where, and When, by Ralph Keyes, Macmillan, p. 228, 2006, Education and early career Ponsonby was a Page of Honour to Queen Victoria from 1882 to 1887.

Morel, Arnold Rowntree, and Charles Trevelyan, he was a member of the Union of Democratic Control, which became a prominent antiwar organisation in Britain. Queen Victoria and her page, Arthur Ponsonby Ponsonby was defeated at the 1918 general election in which he stood as an \\"Independent Democrat\\" in the new Dunfermline Burghs constituency.

She grew up in Trinidad and relocated at the age of 19 to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. She currently lives in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Biography =Early life and education= At an early age Mootoo showed a talent for drawing, painting, and writing, and expressed interest in becoming an artist at the age of 10. Her early efforts were encouraged by her mother Indra (n√©e Samaroo). Mootoo's father, Ramesh Mootoo, was a medical family doctor and Trinidadian politician; much of Shani Mootoo's personal and literary life has been focused on political activism. According to Mootoo, her parents were upset by some of her earliest poems because they described love between two men or love between two women. She has also said that her parents worried for what those themes might mean for her future, which is why she put her words away and chose to paint instead. She claims that she came back to writing accidentally and expressed a worry that she was not a writer but a painter first. As an adult, Mootoo has discussed being sexually assaulted by one of her grandfather's friends.Shani Mootoo (2000), 'Shani Mootoo', Journal of Lesbian Studies, 4:4, 107-113, 109. Mootoo earned a Fine Arts BFA Degree at the University of Western Ontario in 1980 and an MA in English and Theatre from the University of Guelph, 2010. As a multimedia visual artist in Vancouver and New York City, where she lived from 1994 to 1999, she explored in her paintings, photographs and videos themes of gender, sexuality, and race. The themes of her work resonated with Mootoo's experiences as an adolescent in Trinidad and as an immigrant adult in Canada. Her visual art and video work have traveled and been acclaimed internationally. She is now teaching the Creative Writing Program at the University of Toronto. =Visual and video art= Mootoo's visual art and video work have been exhibited internationally, including at the New York Museum of Modern Art. On the topic of her visual work, Mootoo has said that as a victim of child abuse she found it safer to use pictures rather than words. Mootoo uses her art as a way to deal with the trauma of her childhood and has discussed feelings of confusion as to why the universe would let child abuse happen, while also claiming that as a survivor, she and all those that have suffered at the hands of abusers must come to terms with the trauma and understand what to do with suffering. Mootoo's film and video work was revisited by Rungh in its program Longing and Belonging: 1990s South Asian Film and Video which was a featured program at the 2019 DOXA Documentary Film Festival. Mootoo reflected on her film and video work in the 1990s in a newly commissioned article, Streams Coming Together: 1990s video in Vancouver and beyond. =Literary career= Mootoo's first literary publication, Out on Main Street, a collection of short stories, was solicited by the Vancouver-based feminist publishing house Press Gang in 1993 and was the beginning of her literary career. Her first full-length novel, Cereus Blooms at Night, published by Press Gang in 1996, was shortlisted for the Scotia Bank Giller Prize in 1997, the Ethel Wilson Fiction Prize, and the Chapters Books in Canada First Novel Award, and was long-listed for the Booker Prize. It has been published in 15 countries and won the New England Book Sellers Award in 1998. Set on a tropical island, the novel is narrated by a male nurse and caretaker, and explores trauma, madness and redemption, the legacies of sexual abuse, and the boundaries between heterosexual and homosexual desire.Andrew Vowles, \\"A New Write of Passage\\", People at Guelph, Volume 53, No. 16, October 28, 2009. In 2002, Mootoo followed her first novel with a collection of poetry, The Predicament of Or. Mootoo's second full-length novel, He Drown She in the Sea, was published in 2005. It made the long list for the International Dublin Literary Award in 2007.\\"Shani Mootoo\\" , Sawnet Bookshelf. Mootoo's 2008 novel, Valmiki's Daughter, is set in San Fernando, Trinidad, and depicts a father and daughter who struggle to come to terms with secrets. Mootoo has said that the story is about a father trying to help his daughter from leading the same kind of closeted life that he has led. Viveka and her father's lives are each underpinned by the constraints of class and race, and most importantly by the sexual conventions of their society. Set against its strongly evoked backdrop of place, the novel charts Viveka's coming to terms with the hard understanding that love faces society's obstacles, and her knowledge of her certain survival. Valmiki's Daughter was long-listed for 2009's Scotiabank Giller Prize.Maureen Phillips, \\"Book review: Valmiki's Daughter - Shani Mootoo crafts treacherous seas\\", November 25, 2008.

The Soldiers and Sailors Monument on Boston Common at Boston, in the U.S. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, was erected in memory of Massachusetts soldiers and sailors who died in the American Civil War. Designed by Martin Milmore, construction began in 1874 and the monument was dedicated on September 17, 1877. Union Generals George B. McClellan and Joseph Hooker were among the estimated 25,000 people attending the dedication on Boston Common. Overview The Soldiers and Sailors Monument is located on a rise called Flag Staff Hill. The monument is neoclassical in design, taking the form of a victory column carved of Hallowell white granite. The monument rises to a height of . The platform is and features four bas-relief bronze tablets. The first tablet is titled The Departure for the War, and depicts a regiment marching by the Massachusetts State House. The second bas-relief tablet depicts the medical care on the battlefield and is titled The Sanitary Commission. The third tablet depicts Union sailors in an engagement between a Federal man-of-war and a Confederate ironclad likely CSS Virginia. The fourth tablet, entitled The Return from the War shows a regiment of veterans marching by the State House to present their battle flags to Governor John Albion Andrew. Above the bas-relief tablets at the base of the column are four carved granite figures representing the northern, southern, eastern and western sections of the reunited nation. The bas reliefs feature images of Edgar Allan Poe and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Bronze statues stand on the corners of the monument to represent peace, holding an olive branch and facing south; history, holding a book and gazing skyward; a sailor, clad in a navy uniform and gazing toward the sea; and the citizen-soldier, wearing an army uniform and standing at ease. The bases that hold the statues were empty for several years leading to conflicting stories that the monument was never finished or the statues had been stolen or placed in storage. The mystery was solved in 2014 when the statues were returned after restoration at the Daedalus Studios in nearby Watertown. Surmounting the doric column is a bronze allegorical female figure entitled AMERICA. She faces south and wears a tiara of thirteen stars. Her left hand holds the United States flag and her right hand clutches a laurel wreath and sword.

Biography  Yarnall was born in Wheeling, Virginia (later West Virginia), Yarnall was appointed midshipman in the Navy on 11 January 1809. Between 1809 and 1812, Yarnall cruised the coastal waters of the United States in Chesapeake and Revenge performing duty that was tantamount to blockading his own country to enforce President James Madison's embargo on trade with the European adversaries during the Napoleonic Wars. In 1813, he was transferred to Oliver Hazard Perry's command on the Great Lakes and became the first lieutenant on board Perry's flagship, Lawrence. He participated in the decisive Battle of Lake Erie on 10 September 1813 and, though wounded, refused to leave his post during the engagement. When Perry shifted his flag to Niagara during the battle, Lt. Yarnall assumed command of Lawrence. After the battle, he took the squadron's wounded on board and carried them back to Erie for medical attention. For his performance in the battle, Yarnall earned Perry's commendation as well as a medal expressing the gratitude of Congress and the country. In the spring of 1815, Yarnall sailed from New York with Stephen Decatur in the frigate Guerriere for the Mediterranean Sea to conduct the Second Barbary War. On 17 June, off the Algerian coast, his ship encountered and captured Mashuda, the flagship of the Algerian Navy. During that engagement, Yarnall again suffered wounds. In recognition of his role in the battle, and perhaps because of his wounds, Decatur chose Lt. Yarnall to carry the dispatches from Decatur's squadron to the government in Washington, D.C.  Disappear and death  In July 1815, Yarnall embarked in the sloop-of-war Epervier for the voyage home. The warship was last seen on 14 July 1815 as she passed through the Strait of Gibraltar and into the Atlantic. Presumably, Yarnall and all others on board went down with her during the transatlantic voyage. Two ships, USS Yarnall, were named for him.
