Listed at 6' 5\\" and 215 pounds, Thomas batted and threw right-handed. He was born in Quantico, Virginia. Career =Philadelphia Phillies= Thomas grew up in Lompoc, California, and was the star pitcher of the Lompoc Nationals Little League team that went to the SoCal finals at El Monte in . He was selected sixth overall in the 1971 MLB draft by the Philadelphia Phillies straight out of Lompoc High School at eighteen years old. After a brief stint with the Northwest League's Walla Walla Phillies in , in which he gave up fourteen earned runs in twelve innings pitched, Thomas went 11-7 with a 3.43 earned run average in 24 starts in his first full minor league season in with the Western Carolinas League's Spartanburg Phillies. He went 17-8 with a stellar 2.14 ERA and 207 strikeouts with the Rocky Mount Phillies and Reading Phillies in to earn an invitation to Spring training the following season, but failed to earn a spot in the Phillies' rotation. =Chicago White Sox= After two more seasons in the Phillies' farm system, the once deemed \\"untouchable\\" Thomas was dealt to the Chicago White Sox along with Dick Ruthven and Alan Bannister in exchange for Jim Kaat and Mike Buskey on December 10, . In his only season in the Sox organization, Thomas went 6-11 with a 3.75 ERA with their Triple-A affiliate, the Iowa Oaks. Afterwards, he was selected by the Seattle Mariners with the 31st pick in the 1976 MLB expansion draft. The Mariners then placed him on waivers toward the end of spring training, then worked out a trade to the Houston Astros for infielder Larry Milbourne. =Houston Astros= Thomas was converted to a relief pitcher in , and went 11-6 with a 3.16 ERA and six saves for the triple A Charleston Charlies to earn a call up to Houston that September. The only two MLB teams Thomas faced in were the last place Atlanta Braves, and the eventual National League champion Los Angeles Dodgers. In his two games against the Braves, Thomas blew a save opportunity while surrendering four hits and two earned runs in 2.1 innings pitched. In his two games against the Dodgers, he pitched four innings and gave up just one hit while striking out two. =St. Louis Cardinals= Thomas returned to Charleston in to go 9-4 with a 3.14 ERA mostly in relief. On June 23, he was selected off waivers by the St. Louis Cardinals, and brought directly to the majors. In his first appearance with the Cardinals, Thomas earned a win by pitching two scoreless innings in an extra innings affair with the Pittsburgh Pirates. He earned saves in his next two appearances against the Montreal Expos, but was roughed up by the Chicago Cubs in his next two outings. After one more relief appearance, he made an emergency start against the San Diego Padres, and gave up five runs in four innings for his first career loss. He returned to the bullpen after that, and earned one save with a 1.54 ERA the rest of the way. Thomas began the season assigned to the triple A Springfield Redbirds, where he was converted back to a starter. He was called up July 1, and immediate made his first start in the second game of a doubleheader with the Phillies. He gave up one earned run in seven innings, but did not figure in the decision. He earned his first win as a starter on August 7 against the New York Mets. Overall, Thomas went 3-4 with a 2.92 ERA and one save mostly in middle relief. He earned a spot in the Cardinals' bullpen in Spring , but got off to a horrible start to the regular season (11.57 ERA & 1 blown save in April). He then entered the starting rotation, and made the finest start of his major league career on May 14 against the Padres. In seven innings, he surrendered five hits and one earned run to earn the win. On May 30, after returning to the bullpen, he struck Montreal Expos outfielder Ellis Valentine in the face with a pitch, shattering his cheekbone. He remained in the Cards' bullpen another month until he was optioned down to Springfield to make room for Silvio Martinez's return from the disabled list. After the season, he was drafted by the Oakland Athletics in the 1980 rule 5 draft. =Seattle Mariners= In , Thomas went 12-8 with a 3.05 ERA and 111 strikeouts for Oakland's triple A affiliate, the Tacoma Tigers, but did not see any major league experience. After the season, he was dealt to the Seattle Mariners for minor leaguers Tim Hallgren and Rusty McNealy. He spent his first Spring with his new club in the majors, but was shipped to the triple A Salt Lake City Gulls just as the season was set to begin. He successfully made the club the following Spring, and spent his first full season in the majors in , when he went 3-1 with a 3.45 ERA and 77 strikeouts in 43 appearances. His 88.2 innings pitched was tops for a right hander on the club. A sore elbow in his pitching arm derailed his season. Though he was only with the M's for a little over half the season, he appeared in 21 games and pitched 49.2 innings. He returned healthy in , but failed to make the club. He actually retired briefly, but reconsidered, and began the season in the Pacific Coast League with the Calgary Cannons. He was brought up to Seattle in late May, and immediately became manager Chuck Cottier's favorite arm out of the bullpen. The Mariners set a franchise record with an eight-game winning streak in late June. Thomas appeared in three games during that stretch, and earned two wins while holding opposing batters to a .190 batting average. When fortunes reversed, and the M's were on a six-game losing streak in late July, Thomas pitched 6.1 brilliant innings of relief against the American League champion Boston Red Sox to break the streak. Despite having missed almost two months of the season, he pitched a team high 93.2 innings in relief, compiling a 7-0 record with a 3.36 ERA and seventy strikeouts. As a result, Thomas earned the distinction of having compiled the most wins without a loss ever on a team with a losing record when he went 7-0 for the 1985 Seattle Mariners (74-88).Sele (7-0), Mariners Keep Up Torrid Pace. Los Angeles Times. Retrieved on February 27, 2016. This record would be matched by Aaron Sele in the 2001 Mariners season. His sore elbow returned just as the season was set to start. As it turned out, he had elbow tendinitis which rendered him unable to pitch the entire season at any level. He was released by the M's in December, but returned the following Spring as a non- roster invitee. He earned a spot with the triple A Calgary Cannons, and was brought to the majors in late June. On July 9, Thomas pitched 4.2 scoreless innings against the Red Sox to earn his first win of the season. Coupled with his 7-0 record in 1985, Thomas ended his major league career with an eight- game winning streak. Having spent most of his career in the American League, Thomas only logged 34 career at-bats. His only career run batted in came off Randy Jones on July 19, 1978. =Senior Professional Baseball Association= Thomas also pitched for the St. Lucie Legends and the Sun City Rays of the Senior Professional Baseball Association from 1989‚Äì1990, until the league folded in the 1990 mideason. =After baseball= Following his playing retirement, Thomas worked as a math teacher at Totem Middle School and Illahee Middle School in the Federal Way, Washington School District. He formerly worked at Milwaukie High School/ Milwaukie Academy of the Arts as a campus monitor but retired early in October of 2017. Thomas currently lives in Beaverton, Oregon along with his wife, Jane.

This blood phenotype was first discovered in Bombay, now known as Mumbai, in India, by Dr. Y. M. Bhende in 1952. It is mostly found in the Indian sub-continent (India, Bangladesh, Pakistan) and parts of the Middle East such as Iran. Problems with blood transfusion The first person found to have the Bombay phenotype had a blood type that reacted to other blood types in a way never seen before. The serum contained antibodies that attacked all red blood cells of normal ABO phenotypes. The red blood cells appeared to lack all of the ABO blood group antigens and to have an additional antigen that was previously unknown. Individuals with the rare Bombay phenotype (hh) do not express H antigen (also called substance H), the antigen which is present in blood group O. As a result, they cannot make A antigen (also called substance A) or B antigen (substance B) on their red blood cells, whatever alleles they may have of the A and B blood-group genes, because A antigen and B antigen are made from H antigen. For this reason people who have Bombay phenotype can donate red blood cells to any member of the ABO blood group system (unless some other blood factor gene, such as Rh, is incompatible), but they cannot receive blood from any member of the ABO blood group system (which always contains one or more of A, B or H antigens), but only from other people who have Bombay phenotype. Receiving blood which contains an antigen which has never been in the patient's own blood causes an immune reaction due to the immune system of a hypothetical receiver producing immunoglobulins not only against antigen A and B, but also against H antigen. The most common immunoglobulins synthesized are IgM and IgG. This seems to have a very important role in the low frequency of hemolytic disease of the newborn among non-Bombay offspring of Bombay mothers. It is very important, in order to avoid any complications during a blood transfusion, to detect Bombay phenotype individuals, because the usual tests for ABO blood group system would show them as group O. Since anti-H immunoglobulins can activate the complement cascade, it will lead to the lysis of red blood cells while they are still in the circulation, provoking an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction. This, of course, cannot be prevented unless the lab technologist that is involved is aware of the existence of the Bombay blood group and has the means to test for it. Incidence This very rare phenotype is generally present in about 0.0004% (about 4 per million) of the human population, though in some places such as Mumbai (formerly Bombay) locals can have occurrences in as much as 0.01% (1 in 10,000) of inhabitants. Given that this condition is very rare, any person with this blood group who needs an urgent blood transfusion will probably be unable to get it, as no blood bank would have any in stock. Those anticipating the need for blood transfusion may bank blood for their own use, but of course this option is not available in cases of accidental injury. For example, by 2017 only one Colombian person was known to have this phenotype, and blood had to be imported from Brazil for a transfusion.  Biochemistry  Biosynthesis of the H, A and B antigens involves a series of enzymes (glycosyl transferases) that transfer monosaccharides. The resulting antigens are oligosaccharide chains, which are attached to lipids and proteins that are anchored in the red blood cell membrane. The function of the H antigen, apart from being an intermediate substrate in the synthesis of ABO blood group antigens, is not known, although it may be involved in cell adhesion. People who lack the H antigen do not suffer from deleterious effects, and being H-deficient is only an issue if they need a blood transfusion, because they would need blood without the H antigen present on red blood cells. The specificity of the H antigen is determined by the sequence of oligosaccharides. More specifically, the minimum requirement for H antigenicity is the terminal disaccharide fucose-galactose, where the fucose has an alpha(1-2)linkage. This antigen is produced by a specific fucosyl transferase (Galactoside 2-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase 2) that catalyzes the final step in the synthesis of the molecule. Depending upon a person's ABO blood type, the H antigen is converted into either the A antigen, B antigen, or both. If a person has group O blood, the H antigen remains unmodified. Therefore, the H antigen is present more in blood type O and less in blood type AB. Hh antigen system - diagram showing the molecular structure of the ABO(H) antigen system Two regions of the genome encode two enzymes with very similar substrate specificities: the H locus (FUT1) which encodes the Fucosyl transferase and the Se locus (FUT2) that instead indirectly encodes a soluble form of the H antigen, which is found in bodily secretions. Both genes are on chromosome 19 at q.13.3. - FUT1 and FUT2 are tightly linked, being only 35 kb apart. Because they are highly homologous, they are likely to have been the result of a gene duplication of a common gene ancestor. The H locus contains four exons that span more than 8 kb of genomic DNA. Both the Bombay and para-Bombay phenotypes are the result of point mutations in the FUT1 gene. At least one functioning copy of FUT1 needs to be present (H/H or H/h) for the H antigen to be produced on red blood cells. If both copies of FUT1 are inactive (h/h), the Bombay phenotype results. The classical Bombay phenotype is caused by a Tyr316Ter mutation in the coding region of FUT1. The mutation introduces a stop codon, leading to a truncated enzyme that lacks 50 amino acids at the C-terminal end, rendering the enzyme inactive. In Caucasians, the Bombay phenotype may be caused by a number of mutations. Likewise, a number of mutations have been reported to underlie the para-Bombay phenotype. The Se locus contains the FUT2 gene, which is expressed in secretory glands. Individuals who are \\"secretors\\" (Se/Se or Se/se) contain at least one copy of a functioning enzyme. They produce a soluble form of H antigen that is found in saliva and other bodily fluids. \\"Non-secretors\\" (se/se) do not produce soluble H antigen. The enzyme encoded by FUT2 is also involved in the synthesis of antigens of the Lewis blood group.  Genetics  Bombay phenotype occurs in individuals who have inherited two recessive alleles of the H gene (i.e.: their genotype is hh). These individuals do not produce the H carbohydrate that is the precursor to the A and B antigens, meaning that individuals may possess alleles for either or both of the A and B alleles without being able to express them. Because both parents must carry this recessive allele to transmit this blood type to their children, the condition mainly occurs in small closed-off communities where there is a good chance of both parents of a child either being of Bombay type, or being heterozygous for the h allele and so carrying the Bombay characteristic as recessive. Other examples may include noble families, which are inbred due to custom rather than local genetic variety. Hemolytic disease of the newborn In theory, the maternal production of anti-H during pregnancy might cause hemolytic disease in a fetus who did not inherit the mother's Bombay phenotype. In practice, cases of HDN caused in this way have not been described. This may be possible due to the rarity of the Bombay phenotype but also because of the IgM produced by the immune system of the mother. Since IgMs are not transported across the microscopic placental blood vessels (like IgG are) they cannot reach the blood stream of the fetus to provoke the expected acute hemolytic reaction.

His most common enemy was the Black Shark, a pirate in scuba gear. He discovered the Atlantean city of Merezonia and its Mermazon population, he later fell in love with its ruler, his former nemesis, Queen Klitra. Hours before the attack on Pearl Harbor, Red Torpedo was recruited by Uncle Sam to join the Freedom Fighters in defending the base. He fell with the other heroes and was left for dead. Later, it was revealed that he was not dead, but he did retire after this. Red Torpedo was seen aiding the Starman of 1951 in building his spaceship, The Flying Star. He was most recently seen as one of the administrators of Windward Home in Aquaman: Sword of Atlantis along with Elsa Magnusson, widow of Mark Merlin.Aquaman: Sword of Atlantis #42 =Android= A new female android Red Torpedo debuted in Red Tornado (vol. 2) #1 (November 2009). This Red Torpedo was revealed to be the first elemental android created by T. O. Morrow during the days of the Soviet Union, years before the conception of the Red Tornado. But much like her younger \\"sibling\\" the Tornado, the Torpedo rebelled against Morrow's control and he deactivated her, hiding her inside the sunken wreck of a battleship in the waters of Pearl Harbor as a type of sick joke. The Torpedo spent years inside the ship when she managed to send out a beacon to the Tornado and her two other \\"siblings\\", the Red Volcano and the Red Inferno. She is eventually found and reactivated by the Tornado, and while she readjusts to the world, she informs the Tornado about the existence of the other two elementals and the Red Volcano's cruelty. At the same time, the Tornado is having a hard time keeping the Torpedo in check, as she exhibits somewhat more lethal methods, although she claims that she doesn't intend to kill people when she tries to defend herself.Red Tornado (vol.2) #1‚Äì3 In other media Both characters were adapted for the Young Justice episode \\"Humanity\\" voiced by Jeff Bennett. For the episode, Jim Lockheart was used as the \\"human\\" identity of Morrow's first android, although his power remained hydrokinesis. This carried through to the android appearing male rather than female. This version of Red Torpedo is presumed to have died by immersion in lava, alongside Red Inferno, in order for them to destroy Red Volcano.

Solomon revealed their true feelings and relationship to the child by suggesting to cut the baby in two, with each woman to receive half. With this strategy, he was able to discern the non-mother as the woman who entirely approved of this proposal, while the actual mother begged that the sword might be sheathed and the child committed to the care of her rival. Some consider this approach to justice an archetypal example of an impartial judge displaying wisdom in making a ruling. Biblical narrative The Judgement of Solomon (School of Giorgione, 1500) recounts that two mothers living in the same house, each the mother of an infant son, came to Solomon. One of the babies had been smothered, and each claimed the remaining boy as her own. Calling for a sword, Solomon declared his judgment: the baby would be cut in two, each woman to receive half. One mother did not contest the ruling, declaring that if she could not have the baby then neither of them could, but the other begged Solomon, \\"Give the baby to her, just don't kill him!\\" The king declared the second woman the true mother, as a mother would even give up her baby if that was necessary to save its life. This judgment became known throughout all of Israel and was considered an example of profound wisdom. Classification and parallels The story is commonly viewed in scholarship as an instance or a reworking of a folktale. Its folkloristic nature is apparent, among other things, in the dominance of direct speech which moves the plot on and contributes to the characterization.Mordechai Cogan, I Kings (Anchor Bible), New York: Doubleday, 2001, p. 196. The story is classified as Aarne-Thompson tale type 926, and many parallel stories have been found in world folklore. In Uther's edition of the Aarne-Thompson index,Hans-J√∂rg Uther, The Types of International Folktales: A Classification and Bibliography, Based on the System of Antii Aarne and Stith Thompson, I, Helsinki: Suomalainen Tiedeakatemia, 2004. this tale type is classified as a folk novella, and belongs to a subgroup designated: \\"Clever Acts and Words\\". Eli Yassif defines the folk novella as \\"a realistic story whose time and place are determined ... The novella emphasizes such human traits as cleverness, eroticism, loyalty, and wiliness, that drive the plot forward more than any other element\\".Eli Yassif, The Hebrew Folktale: History, Genre, Meaning (Folklore Studies in Translation), Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1999, p. 27 Hugo Gressmann has found 22 similar stories in world folklore and literature, especially in India and the far east.See Hugo Gressmann, \\"Das salomonische Urteil\\", Deutsche Rundschau 130 (1907), pp. 212‚Äì28 One Indian version is a Jataka story dealing with Buddha in one of his previous incarnations as the sage Mahosadha, who arbitrates between a mother and a Yakshini who is in the shape of a woman, who kidnapped the mother's baby and claimed he was hers. The sage announced a tug of war: He drew a line on the ground and asked the two to stand on opposite sides of the line, one holding his feet and the other his hands ‚Äì The one who would pull the baby's whole body beyond the line would get him. The mother, seeing how the baby suffered, released him and let the Yakshini take him, weeping. When the sage saw that, he turned the baby back to the hands of the true mother, exposed the identity of the Yakshini and expelled her.See E. B. Cowell (ed.), The JƒÅtaka, or Stories of the Buddha's Former Births, VI, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1907, p. 163. In other Indian versions the two women are widows of one husband.See for example G. R. Subramiah Pantulu, Indian Antiquary 26 (1897), p. 111 Another version appears in the Chinese drama The Chalk Circle (in this version the judge draws a circle on the ground),Theodor Herzl Gaster, Myth, Legend, and Custom in the Old Testament: A Comparative Study with Chapters from Sir James G. Frazer's Folklore in the Old Testament, II, New York: Harper & Row, 1969, p. 493. which has been widespread all over the world and many versions and reworkings were made after it, among them The Caucasian Chalk Circle, a play by Bertolt Brecht. The Judgement of Solomon by Gaspar de Crayer, c. 1620 The common motif in those different parallels is that the wise judge announces an absurd procedure, which is reasonable in some perverse way: Splitting the baby, according to the principle of compromise; Or a tug of war, in which one can possibly assume that the true mother will be motivated to pull harder. But this procedure is actually a concealed emotional test, designed to force each woman to decide whether her compassion to the baby overpowers her will to win.William Hansen, Ariadne's Thread: A Guide to International Tales Found in Classical Literature, Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2002, p. 228. There is indirect evidence that the story was widespread in ancient times in the western world too. A Greek papyrus fragment,P. Oxy. XLI 2944 dating from the beginning of the second century AD, includes a fragmented reference to an ancient legal case which is similar to the judgment of Solomon. The writer ascribes the story to Phliliskos of Miletos, living in the fourth century BC.William Hansen, Ariadne's Thread: A Guide to International Tales Found in Classical Literature, Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2002, pp. 229‚Äì30.Eric G. Turner, The Papyrologist at work (Greek, Roman and Byzantine Monographs 6), Durham, NC: Duke University, 1973, pp. 7-14 A fresco found in the \\"House of the Physician\\" in Pompeii depicts pygmies introducing a scene similar to the biblical story.William Hansen, Ariadne's Thread: A Guide to International Tales Found in Classical Literature, Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2002, pp. 231‚Äì32. A picture of the fresco. Some think that the fresco relates directly to the biblical story,Frederick E. Brenk, \\"Greek, Greeks; C. Religion\\", Encyclopedia of the Bible and its Reception, v. 10, 2015, p. 889. while according to others it represents a parallel tradition. Several suggestions for the genre of the biblical story have been raised, beyond its characterization as a folktale of a known type. Edward Lipinski suggests that the story is an example of \\"king's bench tales\\", a subgenre of the wisdom literature to which he finds parallels in Sumerian literature.Edward Lipinski, \\"Ancient Types of Wisdom Literature in Biblical Narrative\\", in Alexander Rof√© and Yair Zakovitch (eds.), Isac Leo Seeligmann Volume, Jerusalem: E. Rubenstein, 1983, pp. 51‚Äì55 Scholars have pointed out that the story resembles the modern detective story genre. Both king Solomon and the reader are confronted with some kind of a juridical- detective riddle. Meir Sternberg notes that two genres merge in the story: A riddle and a test; The juridical dilemma, which is the riddle, also constitutes a test for the young king: If he will solve it he will be acknowledged to possess divine wisdom.Meir Sternberg, The Poetics of Biblical Narrative: Ideological Literature and the Drama of Reading (Indiana Studies in Biblical Literature), Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1985, p. 167. Stuart Lasine classifies the story as a law-court riddle.Stuart Lasine, \\"The Riddle of Solomon‚Äôs Judgment and the Riddle of Human Nature in the Hebrew Bible\\", Journal for the Study of the Old Testament 45 (1989), p. 61 According to Raymond Westbrook, the story is essentially a hypothetical problem, introduced to the recipient as a pure intellectual challenge and not as a concrete juridical case. In such problems, any unnecessary detail is usually omitted, and this is the reason why the characters in the story have no distinctive characteristics. Also, the description of the case eliminates the possibility to obtain circumstantial evidence, thereby forcing the recipient to confront the dilemma directly and not seek for indirect ways to solve it.Raymond Westbrook, \\"Law in Kings\\", in Andr√© Lemaire, Baruch Halpern, and Matthew J. Adams (eds.), The Book of Kings: Sources, Composition, Historiography and Reception (Supplements to Vetus Testamentum 129), Leiden: Brill, 2010, pp. 446‚Äì47. Some scholars think that the original folk story underwent significant literary reworking so that in its biblical crystallization it can no longer be defined as a folktale. Jacob Liver notes the absence of any \\"local coloring\\" in the story, and concludes that the story is \\"not an actual folk tale but a scholarly reworking of a folk tale (apparently from a non-Israelite source) which in some way reached the court circles of Jerusalem in the times of Solomon\\".Jacob Liver, \\"The Book of the Acts of Solomon\\", Biblica 48 (1967), p. 82 Similarly, Jeev Weisman characterizes it as \\"a wisdom anecdote which originated in the court circles\\".Translation from the Hebrew original: \\"◊ê◊†◊ß◊ì◊ï◊ò◊î ◊ó◊õ◊û◊™◊ô◊™ ◊©◊û◊ï◊¶◊ê◊î ◊û◊ó◊ï◊í◊ô ◊î◊ó◊¶◊®\\" (Jeev Weisman, Political Satire in the Bible [The Biblical Encyclopaedia Library 13], Jerusalem: Bialik Institute, 1996, p. 213). George W. Coats also characterizes it as an anecdote (\\"Parable, Fable, and Anecdote: Storytelling in the Succession Narrative\\", Interpretation 35 [1981], p. 379) Origin The story has a number of parallels in folktales from various cultures. All of the known parallels, among them several from India, have been recorded in later periods than the biblical story; nevertheless, it is unclear as to whether they reflect earlier or later traditions. Hermann Gunkel rules out the possibility that such a sophisticated motif had developed independently in different places.Hermann Gunkel, The Folktale in the Old Testament (Historic Texts and Interpreters in Biblical Scholarship), translated by Michael D. Rutter, Sheffield, UK: Almond, 1987, p. 156. Some scholars are of the opinion that the source of the story is untraceable.James A. Montgomery and Henry Snyder Gehman, Kings (International Critical Commentary), Edinburgh: T. & T. Clark, 1951, p. 109.Gwilym H. Jones, 1 and 2 Kings (New Century Bible), I, Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1984, p. 131. In the biblical version, the two women are identified as prostitutes, as opposed to some Indian versions in which they are widows of one husband. Some scholars have inferred from this difference as to the origin of the story. Following Gressmann,Hugo Gressmann, \\"Das salomonische Urteil\\", Deutsche Rundschau 130 (1907), pp. 218 Gunkel speculates a possible Indian origin, on the basis that \\"[s]uch stories of wise judgments are the real life stuff of the Indian people\\", and that, in his view, \\"a prostitute has no reason to value a child which was not born to her\\"; he acknowledges, however, that the Indian versions \\"belong to a later period\\". On the other hand, Lasine opines that the Hebrew story is better motivated than the Indian one, for it is the only one in which the motivation for the behavior of both women is rooted in typical motherly feelings: compassion for the true mother, and jealousy for the impostor.Stuart Lasine, \\"The Riddle of Solomon‚Äôs Judgment and the Riddle of Human Nature in the Hebrew Bible\\", Journal for the Study of the Old Testament 45 (1989), p. 70. Other scholars point out that such a travelling folktale might become, in its various forms, more or less coherent; the assertion that one version is more coherent than the other does not compel the conclusion that the first is more original. Consequently, the argument as to which version's women had more compelling reasons to fight over the child would be irrelevant. Composition and editorial framing The story is considered to be literarily unified, without significant editorial intervention.Martin J. Mulder, 1 Kings (Historical Commentary on the Old Testament), translated by John Vriend, Leuven: Peeters, 1998, p. 154.Burke O. Long, 1 Kings (Forms of the Old Testament Literature 9), Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1984, p. 68. The ending of the story, noting the wisdom of Solomon, is considered to be a Deuteronomistic addition to the text.Volkmar Fritz, 1 & 2 Kings (Continental Commentary), translated by Anselm Hagedorn, Minneapolis: Fortress, 2003, p. 43. Some scholars consider the story an originally independent unit, integrated into its present context by an editor.Mordechai Cogan, I Kings (Anchor Bible), New York: Doubleday, 2001, p. 193Simon J. DeVries, 1 Kings (Word Biblical Commentary 12), Waco, TX: Word Books, 1985, pp. 57‚Äì58. Solomon's name is not mentioned in the story, and he is simply called \\"the king\\". Considered out of context, the story leaves the king anonymous just like the other characters. Some scholars think that the original tale was not necessarily about Solomon, and perhaps dealt with a typical unnamed king. A different opinion is held by Eli Yassif, who thinks that the author of the Book of Kings did not attribute the story to Solomon on his own behalf, but the attribution to Solomon had already developed in preliterary tradition.Eli Yassif, The Hebrew Folktale: History, Genre, Meaning (Folklore Studies in Translation), Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1999, p. 30. Scholars point out that the story is linked to the preceding account of Solomon's dream in Gibeon, by the common pattern of prophetic dream and its subsequent fulfillment. Some think this proximity of the stories results from the work of a redactor. Others, such as Saul Zalewski, consider the two accounts to be inseparable and to form a literarily unified unit.Saul Zalewski, Solomon's Ascension to the Throne: Studies in the Books of Kings and Chronicles, Jerusalem: Y. Marcus, 1981, pp. 188‚Äì92 (Hebrew). In its broader context, the Judgment of Solomon forms part of the account of Solomon's reign, generally conceived as a distinct segment in the Book of Kings, compassing chapters 3‚Äì11 in 1 Kings; Some include in it also chapters 1‚Äì2, while others think that these chapters originally ended the account of David's reign in 2 Samuel. According to Liver, the source for the Judgment of Solomon story, as well as other parts of the account of Solomon's reign, is in the speculated book of the Acts of Solomon, which he proposes to be a wisdom work which originated in the court circles shortly after the split of the united monarchy.Jacob Liver, \\"The Book of the Acts of Solomon\\", Biblica 48 (1967), pp. 75‚Äì101. Analysis =General description= The story may be divided to two parts similar in length, matching the trial's sequence. In the first part (verses 16‚Äì22) the case is described: The two women introduce their arguments, and at this point, no response from the king is recorded. In the second part (23‚Äì28) the decision is described: the king is the major speaker and the one who directs the plot. Apart from this clear twofold division, suggestions have been raised as to the plot structure and the literary structure of the story and its internal relations.For the plot structure see the commentaries, and also Bezalel Porten, \\"The Structure and Theme of the Solomon Narrative (I Kings 3-11)\\", Hebrew Union College Annual 38 (1967), pp. 99‚Äì100. For the literary structure see Willem A. M. Beuken, \\"No Wise King without a Wise Woman (I Kings III 16‚Äì28)\\", in A. S. van der Woude (ed.), New Avenues in the Study of the Old Testament: A Collection of Old Testament Studies, Published on the Occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Oudtestamentisch Werkgezelschap and the Retirement of Prof. Dr. M. J. Mulder (Oudtestamentische Studi√´n 25), Leiden: Brill, 1989, pp. 2‚Äì4. As stated before, most of the story is reported by direct speech of the women and Solomon, with a few sentences and utterance verbs by the narrator. The dialogues move the plot forward. The women's contradictory testimonies create the initial conflict necessary to build up the dramatic tension. The king's request to bring him a sword enhances the tension, as the reader wonders why it is needed. The story comes to its climax with the shocking royal order to cut the boy, which for a moment casts doubt on the king's judgment. But what seems to be the verdict turns out to be a clever trick which achieves its goal, and results in the recognition of the true mother and the resolution. =Purpose= The Judgement of Solomon by Frans Floris, c. 1647 The major overt purpose of the account of Solomon's reign, to which the Judgment of Solomon belongs as stated above, is to glorify King Solomon, and his wisdom is one of the account's dominant themes. The exceptions are: The first two chapters (1 Kings 1‚Äì2), which according to many scholars portray a dubious image of Solomon, and as stated above, are sometimes ascribed to a separate work; And the last chapter in the account (11), which describes Solomon's sins in his old age. Nevertheless, many scholars point out to elements in the account that criticize Solomon, anticipating his downfall in chapter 11.See in detail: Daniel J. Hays, \\"Has the Narrator Come to Praise Solomon or to Bury Him? Narrative Subtlety in 1 Kings 1‚Äì11\\", Journal for the Study of the Old Testament 28/2 (2003), pp. 149‚Äì74; And the literature cited at pp. 151‚Äì53. In its immediate context, the story follows the account of Solomon's dream at Gibeon, in which he was promised by God to be given unprecedented wisdom. Most scholars read the story at face value, and conclude that its major purpose is to demonstrate the fulfillment of the divine promise and to illustrate Solomon's wisdom expressed in a juridical form. Yet some scholars recognize in this story too, as in other parts of the account of Solomon's reign, ironic elements which are not consistent with the story's overt purpose to glorify Solomon. Some scholars assume, as mentioned, that the story had existed independently before it was integrated into its current context. Willem Beuken think that the original tale was not about the king's wisdom ‚Äì the concluding note about Solomon's wisdom is considered secondary ‚Äì but about a woman who, by listening to her motherly instinct, helped the king to break through the legal impasse. Beuken notes additional biblical stories which share the motif of the woman who influenced the king: Bathsheba, the woman of Tekoa, and Solomon's foreign wives who seduced him into idolatry.Willem A. M. Beuken, \\"No Wise King without a Wise Woman (I Kings III 16‚Äì28)\\", in A. S. van der Woude (ed.), New Avenues in the Study of the Old Testament: A Collection of Old Testament Studies, Published on the Occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Oudtestamentisch Werkgezelschap and the Retirement of Prof. Dr. M. J. Mulder (Oudtestamentische Studi√´n 25), Leiden: Brill, 1989, pp. 9‚Äì10. Beuken concludes that the true mother exemplifies the biblical character type of the wise woman.Willem A. M. Beuken, \\"No Wise King without a Wise Woman (I Kings III 16‚Äì28)\\", in A. S. van der Woude (ed.), New Avenues in the Study of the Old Testament: A Collection of Old Testament Studies, Published on the Occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Oudtestamentisch Werkgezelschap and the Retirement of Prof. Dr. M. J. Mulder (Oudtestamentische Studi√´n 25), Leiden: Brill, 1989, p. 10. He proposes an analysis of the literary structure of the story, according to which the section that notes the compassion of the true mother (verse 26b) constitutes one of the two climaxes of the story, along with the section that announces Solomon's divine wisdom (verse 28b). According to this analysis, the story in its current context gives equal weight to the compassion of the true mother and to the godly wisdom that guided Solomon in the trial.Willem A. M. Beuken, \\"No Wise King without a Wise Woman (I Kings III 16‚Äì28)\\", in A. S. van der Woude (ed.), New Avenues in the Study of the Old Testament: A Collection of Old Testament Studies, Published on the Occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Oudtestamentisch Werkgezelschap and the Retirement of Prof. Dr. M. J. Mulder (Oudtestamentische Studi√´n 25), Leiden: Brill, 1989, pp. 2‚Äì4. According to Marvin Sweeney, in its original context, as part of the Deuteronomistic history, the story exalted Solomon as a wise ruler and presented him as a model to Hezekiah. Later, the narrative context of the story has undergone another Deuteronomistic redaction that has undermined Solomon's figure in comparison to Josiah.Marvin A. Sweeney, I & II Kings (Old Testament Library), Louisville, KY: Westminster John Knox, 2007, p. 82. In its current context, the story implicitly criticizes Solomon for violating the biblical law that sets the priests and Levites on top of the judicial hierarchy (Deuteronomy 17:8‚Äì13).Marvin A. Sweeney, I & II Kings (Old Testament Library), Louisville, KY: Westminster John Knox, 2007, pp. 73, 82. =Intra- biblical allusions= Several stories in the Hebrew Bible bear similarity to the Judgment of Solomon, and scholars think they allude to it. The most similar story is that of the two cannibal mothers in 2 Kings 6:24‚Äì33, which forms part of the Elisha cycle. The background is a famine in Samaria, caused by a siege on the city. As the king passes through the city, a woman calls him and asks him to decide in a quarrel between her and another woman: The two women had agreed to cook and eat the son of one woman, and on the other day to do the same with the son of the other woman; but after they ate the first woman's son, the other woman hid her own son. The king, shocked from the description of the case, tore up his royal cloth and revealed that he was wearing sackcloth beneath it. He blamed Elisha for the circumstances and went on to chase him. There are some striking similarities between this story and the Judgment of Solomon. Both deal with nameless women who gave birth to a son. One of the son dies, and a quarrel erupts as to the fate of the other one. The case is brought before the king to decide. According to Lasine, the comparison between the stories emphasize the absurdity of the situation in the story of the cannibal mothers: While in the Judgment of Solomon, the king depend on his knowledge of maternal nature to decide the case, the story of the cannibal women describe a \\"topsy-turvy\\" world in which maternal nature does not work as expected, thus leaving the king helpless.Stuart Lasine, \\"Jehoram and the Cannibal Mothers (2 Kings 6.24‚Äì33): Solomon‚Äôs Judgment in an Inverted World\\", Journal for the Study of the Old Testament 50 (1991), pp. 27‚Äì53. =The women's characters= Like many other women in the Hebrew Bible, the two women in this story are anonymous. It is speculated their names have not been mentioned so that they would not overshadow Solomon's wisdom, which is the main theme of the story. The women seem to be poor. They live alone in a shared residence, without servants. The women have been determined to be prostitutes. As prostitutes, they lack male patronage and have to take care of themselves in a patriarchal society.Athalya Brenner, The Israelite Woman: Social Role and Literary Type in Biblical Narrative (The Biblical Seminar 2), Sheffield, UK: JSOT Press, 1985, pp. 81‚Äì82. The women's designation as prostitutes is necessary as background to the plot: It clarifies why the women live alone, gave birth alone and were alone during the alleged switch of the babies;Simon J. DeVries, 1 Kings (Word Biblical Commentary), Waco, TX: Word Books, 1985, p. 61. The lack of witnesses seems to create a legal impasse that only the wise king can solve. It also clarifies why the women are not represented by their husbands, as is customary in biblical society.Phyllis Ann Bird, \\"The Harlot as Heroine: Narrative Art and Social Presupposition in Three Old Testament Texts\\", Semeia 46 (1989), p. 132. Solomon is depicted as a king accessible to all of his subjects, even those in the margins of society. The women's designation as prostitutes links the story to the common biblical theme of God as the protector of the weak, \\"A father to the fatherless, a defender of widows\\" (Psalms 68:5). Prostitutes in biblical society are considered functional widows, for they have no male patron to represent them in court, and their sons are considered fatherless. They also bear similarity to the proselyte, who is sometimes mentioned in the Hebrew Bible with the widow and the fatherless, in that they are socially marginalized and deprived of the right to advocacy. They can only seek justice from one place: God, embodied in the story as the source of Solomon's wisdom.Carole R. Fontaine, \\"The Bearing of Wisdom on the Shape of 2 Samuel 11-12 and 1 Kings 3\\", Journal for the Study of the Old Testament 34 (1986), pp. 67‚Äì68.Gina Hens-Piazza, Of Methods, Monarchs, and Meanings: A Sociorhetorical Approach to Exegesis (Studies in Old Testament Interpretation 3), Macon, GA: Mercer University Press, 1996, p. 143. The women are not explicitly condemned for their occupation,Mordechai Cogan, I Kings (Anchor Bible), New York: Doubleday, 2001, p. 193. and some think that the narrator does not intend to discredit them for being prostitutes, and their conduct should be judged against universal human standards.Volkmar Fritz, 1 & 2 Kings (Continental Commentary), translated by Anselm Hagedorn, Minneapolis: Fortress, 2003, p. 42. On the other hand, Phyllis Bird thinks that the story presupposes the stereotypical biblical image of the prostitute as a selfish liar. The true mother is revealed when her motherly essence ‚Äì which is also stereotypical ‚Äì surpasses her selfish essence.Phyllis Ann Bird, \\"The Harlot as Heroine: Narrative Art and Social Presupposition in Three Old Testament Texts\\", Semeia 46 (1989), pp. 132‚Äì33 Athalya Brenner notes that both women's maternal instinct is intact: For the true mother it is manifested, as mentioned, in the compassion and devotion that she shows for her son; And for the impostor it is manifested in her desire for a son, which makes her steal the other mother's son when her own son dies. According to Brenner, one of the lessons of the story is that \\"true maternal feelings ... may exist even in the bosom of the lowliest woman\\".Athalya Brenner, The Israelite Woman: Social Role and Literary Type in Biblical Narrative (The Biblical Seminar 2), Sheffield, UK: JSOT Press, 1985, p. 81. The women are designated in the Hebrew text as z≈çn≈ç·πØ (◊ñ◊ï÷π◊†◊ï÷π◊™), which is the plural form of the adjective z≈çn√¢ (◊ñ◊ï÷π◊†÷∏◊î), prostitute. However, some propose a different meaning for this word in the context of the story, such as \\"tavern owner\\" or \\"innkeeper\\". These proposals are usually dismissed as apologetic.See for example: Mordechai Cogan, I Kings (Anchor Bible), New York: Doubleday, 2001, p. 193 Jerome T. Walsh combines the two meanings, and suggests that in ancient Near East, some prostitutes also provided lodging services (cf. the story of Rahab).Jerome T. Walsh, 1 Kings (Berit Olam), Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, 1996, p. 80 n. 1. =Comparison to detective literature= As mentioned before, many scholars have compared the story to the modern genre of detective story. A striking feature in the biblical story, untypical to its parallels,William Hansen, Ariadne's Thread: A Guide to International Tales Found in Classical Literature, Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2002, p. 229. is that it does not begin with a credible report of the omniscient narrator about the events that took place before the trial; It immediately opens with the women's testimonies. Thus, the reader is unable to determine whether the account given by the plaintiff is true or false, and he confronts, along with Solomon, a juridical-detective riddle. According to Sternberg, the basic convention shared by the Judgment of Solomon and the detective story genre is the \\"fair-play rule\\", which states that both the reader and the detective figure are exposed to the same relevant data.Meir Sternberg, The Poetics of Biblical Narrative: Ideological Literature and the Drama of Reading (Indiana Studies in Biblical Literature), Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1985, pp. 167‚Äì69. Lasine, dealing with the story from a sociological perspective, points out that like the detective story, the Judgment of Solomon story deals with human \\"epistemological anxiety\\" deriving from the fact that man, as opposed to God, is generally unable to know what is in the mind of other men. The detective story, as well as this biblical story, provides a comfort to this anxiety with the figure of the detective, or Solomon in this case: A master of human nature, a man who can see into the depths of one's soul and extract the truth from within it. This capability is conceived as a superhuman quality, inasmuch as Solomon's wisdom in judgment is described as a gift from God. There is an ambiguity concerning the question whether such a capability may serve as a model for others, or it is unavailable to ordinary men.Stuart Lasine, \\"Solomon, Daniel, and the Detective Story: The Social Function of a Literary Genre\\", Hebrew Annual Review 11 (1987), pp. 247‚Äì66. By the end of the story, Solomon reveals the identity of the true mother. But according to the Hebrew text, while the king solves the riddle, the reader is not exposed to the solution; Literally translated from the Hebrew text, Solomon command reads: \\"Give her the living child...\\". One cannot infer from this wording whether the word \\"her\\" refers to the plaintiff or to the defendant, as the narrator remains silent on the matter. Jewish interpretation The Judgment of Solomon by William Blake in Tempera. Currently, the object is held at the Fitzwilliam Museum. According to the Midrash, the two women were mother- and daughter-in-law, both of whom had borne sons and whose husbands had died. The lying daughter-in-law was obligated by the laws of Yibbum to marry her brother-in-law unless released from the arrangement through a formal ceremony. As her brother-in-law was the living child, she was required to marry him when he came of age or wait the same amount of time to be released and remarry. When Solomon suggested splitting the infant in half, the lying woman, wishing to escape the constraints of Yibbum in the eyes of God, agreed. Thus was Solomon able to know who the real mother was. Representations in art If the above- mentioned Pompean fresco indeed depicts the Judgment of Solomon, it is the first known painting of a biblical story (presently moved to the Museo Nazionale in Naples). Sculpture given either to Pietro Lamberti or to . It stands at the corner of the Doge's Palace in Venice (Italy), next to Porta della Carta This theme has long been a popular subject for artists and is often chosen for the decoration of courthouses. In the Netherlands, many 17th century courthouses (Vierschaar rooms) contain a painting or relief of this scene. Elsewhere in Europe, celebrated examples include: * Fresco by Raphael * The Judgement of Solomon by William Blake * Etching by Gustave Dor√© * Woodcut by the school of Michael Wolgemut in the Nuremberg Chronicle * Paintings by Andrea Mantegna, Poussin and Franz Caucig * Relief sculpture on the Doge's Palace in Venice by an unknown artist (near the exit into St. Mark's Square) * Stained glass window by Jean Chastellain in St-Gervais-et-St-Protais church of Paris =Music= Marc-Antoine Charpentier : Judicium Salomonis H 422, Oratorio for soloists, chorus, woodwinds, strings, and bc. (1702) Giacomo Carissimi : Judicium Salomonis, Oratorio for 3 chorus, 2 violins and organ. =Other media= The scene has been the subject of television episodes of Dinosaurs, Recess, The Simpsons (where a pie was substituted for the baby), the Netflix animated series, All Hail King Julien, where a pineapple is cut in two to settle a dispute, the Seinfeld episode \\"The Seven\\", and Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. It has influenced other artistic disciplines, e.g. Bertolt Brecht's play The Caucasian Chalk Circle and Ronnie snatching Kat's baby in EastEnders. The HIM song \\"Shatter Me With Hope\\" includes the line \\"We'll tear this baby apart, wise like Solomon\\". The Tool song \\"Right in Two\\" slightly paraphrases the scene and includes the lyric \\"Cut and divide it all right in two\\". A surgical technique that involves dividing the placenta with a laser as a treatment for twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome is named Solomon technique. Idiomatic use =\\"Splitting the baby\\"= Solomon's Wisdom, 1860 woodcut by Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld The expressions \\"splitting the baby\\" or \\"cutting the baby in half\\" can be used to describe a split award (usually accompanied by a split costs award) in the most for a heavy-handed, costs- insensitive suit (such as entailing multiple hearings and disproportionate spending on both sides) for a relatively simple compromise. The analogy reminds litigants to keep their costs down in cases where judge may well divide fault, i.e. may \\"split the difference\\" in terms of damage awards or other remedies between the two parties (a very common example is in a comparative negligence case also known as contributory negligence scenario).Stephanie E. Keer and Richard W. Naimark, Arbitrators Do Not ‚ÄúSplit- the-Baby‚Äù: Empirical Evidence from International Business Arbitrations from the Energy Bar Association Alternative Dispute Resolution Committee In other instances, lawyers and legal commentators may use \\"split the baby\\" to refer to any compromise or ruling in which both sides can claim partial victory. Some commentators have noted, however, that this usage is inconsistent with the Biblical narrative, in which Solomon's solution did not involve actually splitting the baby or finding a compromise, but rather provided evidence that led to a total victory for one of the claimants. = \\"Solomonic Judgment\\" = The expression \\"Solomonic Judgment\\" exists in many cultures with a Judeo- Christian background, and is often used as a comment on remarkable verdicts. For example, in a dispute between two neighbors, a British judge gave one of them, pop-star Robbie Williams, permission to have a luxurious swimming pool and gym dug out, but machine-powered digging or excavation work was forbidden and his neighbor, rock-star Jimmy Page, had to be given real-time, complete electronic monitoring of the vibrations throughout the entire construction process. In short, the mega-basement would have to be dug by hand.

Background  Austin was a judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales who was challenging a Commonwealth law that imposed a superannuation contributions surcharge on judges. The Commonwealth law was part of a wider scheme imposing a superannuation charge on higher-income earners, equalising the tax burden on judges vis-a-vis other high-income earners. The surcharge was not imposed on states directly as employers because it could have infringed section 114 of the constitution, which outlaws taxation of state property. If a person was a judge since before 1987, the charge was not imposed as the liability to pay the charge could have run to hundreds of thousands of dollars. The New South Wales government, in response, amended the charge system to lower the burden that would have to be paid.  Decision  Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ rejected the separate discrimination limb found in the Melbourne Corporation principle.. In their view, if Melbourne Corporation is read carefully, it is more concerned with a state's ability to function i.e. the structural integrity limb of the principle was paramount. For a law to infringe the Melbourne Corporation principles it must ultimately infringe the state's structural integrity. While they reject the two-limbed principle, they do not offer an alternative, instead of conflating the principles into a single principle of structural integrity. In applying the facts, the majority stressed the importance of judicial remuneration in attracting suitable judges and securing their independence. They found this tax effectively forced the states to adjust their remuneration in order to safeguard judicial standards i.e. increase judges pay. For this reason, they found the law impaired the states' ability to exercise their essential functions. In a separate judgment for the majority, Gleeson CJ found the discrimination element of the Melbourne Corporation was part of a broader principle of structural integrity. Hence the two-limbed test in Melbourne Corporation is reduced to a one-limbed test. The Commonwealth's imposition of the charge forced states to alter their remuneration arrangements, which impaired their constitutional status and integrity. McHugh J was the only judge to endorse the two-limbed Melbourne Corporation principle. He thought the two-limbed test was well-settled and there was no need to alter it. On the application of the first limb (discrimination), he found the Commonwealth law in singling out (and thus discriminating against) state judges placed a burden upon the states and was thus invalid. His reasoning thus implicitly links the two limbs of the test. Kirby J agreed with the majority's assessment that the Melbourne Corporation principle is actually reducible to a one-limbed test. However, on the application of this one-limbed test, he found that the burden on states of having judges with higher tax liabilities (i.e. a high state remuneration burden) was not heavy enough to impair state functioning. The effect, he argued, was marginal at best. Kirby J noted that the other judges exaggerated the burden on states, and were sensitive to issues of judicial pay. He also pointed out that judge's salaries are subject to a wide variety of taxes and charges, asking how this single charge could affect a state's capacity to carry out its essential functions. Thus, while he dissented on the outcome, Kirby J agreed with the majority on the law. Overall, the court confirmed its interpretation of the Melbourne Corporation principle, that it is a one-limbed principle concerning the structural integrity of the states and their ability to exercise their functions.

In the tradition of scooter production now continues ƒåezeta Motors company, which owns the rights to the brand.  History  Forklift Desta Work started on the construction of the first workshops of the arms factory originally called Jihoƒçesk√° zbrojovka (\\"South Bohemian Armament Works\\"). The company merged with an arms manufacturing plant in Vejprty and with a factory in Prague in 1922. This gave rise to the formation of a stock company whose name translates as \\"Czech Armament Works in Prague of the Manufacturing Plant in Strakonice\\". It produced pistols, air guns, and automatic guns which all became successful products. In 1929 the growth of the Czech Armament Works reached a turning point. With the downturn in weapons sales after World War I, the company acquired a bicycle parts manufacturing plant in Kralupy nad Vltavou on the Vltava River. Bicycle exports destined for several countries in Europe, Asia, Africa and South America started to expand. Production of motor-driven bicycles started in 1932. Three years later the first motorcycles made in Strakonice entered the market. This marked the beginning of an era of great success for the ƒåZ brand. In a short time the company became the biggest manufacturer of motorcycles in Czechoslovakia. Consequently, business success resulted in a further extension of production activities by introducing chain and machine tool production. During the Second World War the factory came under German occupation and was converted to the manufacture of war materials. Like most large industrial enterprises this stock company was nationalized in 1946. Due to the post-war political situation, firearms production in the Strakonice plant was ended. The company changed after the motorcycle brand went out of production in the 1990s and started focusing on manufacturing car components, like turbochargers, besides its traditional production of chains, tools, moulds, castings and machine tools. Since 1999, Desta forklifts have been manufactured in ƒåZ Strakonice.  Motorcycle Development  ƒåZ 501 ƒåezeta (1957-1960) ƒåZ 250 model 455 (1961-1965) ƒåZ 350 model 472 (1976-1993) Motorcycle development and production as well as competition victories in 1950s and 1960s enabled the ƒåZ brand to be among the world‚Äôs most successful makers of competition and street motorcycles. After World War II, ƒåZ was the second largest motorcycle manufacturer in Europe. It was during this period that the company experienced its greatest racing successes. It began competing in the 250 cc and 350 cc classes of Grand Prix motorcycle road racing. These bikes, although technically refined, were rarely very competitive with bikes from the powerful Italian factories such as MV Agusta, Gilera and Mondial. The ƒåZ 501 ƒåezeta (1957) scooter design has become iconic throughout Eastern Europe, Russia, Vietnam and Cuba. ƒåezeta thus became Vespa of these Republics. In the 1969 ƒåZ produced the technically advanced \\"Type-860\\" GP model with a 350 cc V4 engine, developed by the engineer Frantisek Pudil. This advanced bike, with double overhead camshaft, 16 valves, 8-speed gearbox, Ceriani forks and Dell'Orto SSI carburetors, produced at 16,000 rpm with a maximum speed of 240 km/h. The V-4 achieved several good results: the best being in 1971, at the Czechoslovakian Grand Prix when Bohumil Stasa finished second behind Jarno Saarinen on his 350 cc Yamaha. In 1972, the bike almost won the Austrian Grand Prix. With just few laps to go in the race the ƒåZ was leading Giacomo Agostini's MV Agusta when it had to retire with mechanical problems. In 1972 ƒåZ abandoned Grand Prix road racing competitions in order to concentrate its efforts on motocross, a less expensive form of competition. ƒåZ proved to be much more successful with motocross and became well known for its powerful two-stroke off-road motorcycles. They were the first company to use expansion chambers in their exhaust pipes. During the 1960s, they would become the dominant force in off-road competition, winning seven Grand Prix Motocross World Championships and dominating the International Six Day Trial. By the 1970s, with the advent of inexpensive and technically advanced Japanese motorcycles, ƒåZ lost an increasing share of the motorcycle market. Ironically, many of the innovations successfully pioneered by ƒåZ, were copied by the Japanese factories. In 1993 the motorcycle branch of ƒåZ was bought by the Italian motorcycle manufacturer Cagiva, who intended to use the Czech factories to build their own brand of motorcycles as well as new ƒåZ and Jawa models. The venture failed in 1997 due to Cagiva's financial difficulties and the ƒåZ motorcycle brand went out of production. Since 2018, the company ƒåezeta Motors is producing electric scooters ƒåezeta 506.

It consisted of a simple wooden box with a hinged lid containing a block of cast TNT and a ZZ-42 type detonator. A slot in the lid pressed down on the striker retaining pin, sufficient pressure on the lid caused the pin to move, releasing the striker which triggered the detonator. The mine was cheap to produce and deployed in large numbers. As an early example of a minimum metal mine, it was difficult to detect with early metal detectors - the only metal present was a small amount in the mine's detonator. Experience has shown that the mine detector search coil must pass very close to the mine before any reaction is obtained.

The name gillaroo is derived from the Irish for \\"red fellow\\" (); this is due to the fish's distinctive colouring. It has a bright, buttery golden colour in its flanks with bright crimson and vermilion spots. The gillaroo is characterised by these deep red spots and a \\"gizzard\\", which is used to aid the digestion of hard food items such as water snails. Experiments carried out by Queen's University Belfast established that the Lough Melvin fish are different from brown trout found anywhere else in the world. They feed almost exclusively on bottom living animals (snails, sedge fly larva and freshwater prawns) except during late summer. It is at this time that they come to surface to feed and may be caught on the dry fly. Other lakes reputed to contain the gillaroo are Loughs Neagh, Conn, Mask and Corrib. However the unique gene found in the Lough Melvin trout has not been found in some 200 trout populations in Ireland and Britain. It is therefore now recognised using its own original scientific name, rather than continued inclusion in the widespread , with which it had been synonymised. In addition to the gillaroo, Lough Melvin is thought to harbour another two peculiar species of trout, apart from salmon and an endemic species of char. However, Irish authorities do not distinguish the gillaroo as a separate species from brown trout.Brown trout.

Background  The Industrial Relations Act 1988 (Cth) made it an offence to bring the Australian Industrial Relations Commission into disrepute. Nationwide News published an article attacking the integrity and independence of the Commission. Nationwide News argued that the Act infringed the implied freedom of political communications, while the Commonwealth argued that the Act was valid under section 51(xxxv) (conciliation and arbitration power), as well as section 51(xxxix) (express incidental power).  Decision  = Interstate intercourse = Although it was not a decisive factor, it was argued that freedom of communication falls under freedom of interstate intercourse. Per Brennan J, the protection in section 92 is given to such things as the movement of people, goods and communications. The essential ingredient is that there is movement across State boundaries, although the movement need not be perceivable. A test can be specified as follows: * Is there a burden on interstate intercourse? * What is the purpose of the law? If the purpose of the law is to hinder interstate intercourse, then the law is invalid. * If not, is there another purpose to the law? If so, is the burden on interstate trade and commerce appropriate and adapted to that purpose? = Implied freedom of political communication = Brennan, Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ thought that it was within the conciliation head of power, but that it infringed the implied freedom of political communication. Mason CJ, McHugh and Dawson JJ, however, held that it was outside the head of power. = Proportionality = Nationwide News is the key case where the concept of proportionality is discussed. Proportionality is the idea that there should be a reasonable relationship between an end and the means used to achieve that end. It has been used for: * Determining if a law has breached constitutional guarantees. * Purposive powers, if there is a reasonable relationship between the law and the purpose used to achieve it. * Non-purposive powers, if there is a sufficient connection to a head of power to fall within its implied incidental power. Dawson J rejects the proportionality test as suggested by Mason CJ, arguing that it should be a test of sufficient connection, and not proportionality.

Angerstein extended Woodlands in the late 18th century, adding a west wing, conservatory, out-buildings and a stable and riding school (most of these were demolished after the sale of the Westcombe estates in 1876). After Angerstein's death in 1823, the property became the family home of his son John Angerstein (who was elected Liberal MP for Greenwich in 1835 and devoted much of his time to development of the Angerstein estates). In the late 1890s, the property was purchased by the shipbuilder Sir Alfred Fernandez Yarrow. It became the Yarrow family home and later, during the First World War, served as a hostel for Belgian refugees. In the 1920s, it was sold to a Catholic religious order, the Little Sisters of the Assumption, for use as a convent.

Background  Coleman was a law and politics student from Townsville. He started handing out flyers in a shopping centre alleging police corruption in the Queensland police force. He was asked to stop by Power, a police officer, but refused. Coleman was subsequently arrested for insulting language, but violently resisted arrest. He was charged with using \\"insulting words\\" under the Vagrancy Act as well as assaulting and obstructing a police officer. Coleman argued he was not guilty of using insulting words because they were political communication and thus protected under the implied freedom of political communication. A magistrate found him guilty, but he then appealed. All subsequent appeals failed to some extent.. He then appealed to the High Court.  Decision  The court held that his conviction under s7(1)(d) of the Vagrancy Act should be set aside but that the conviction for assaulting/obstructing a police officer should stand. Gummow, Hayne JJ and Kirby J held the impugned section of the VA to be valid, concluded that it would infringe the second limb of the Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation test,. to the extent that it applied to political communication and read it down so that it did not. What Coleman said was not insulting as intended to be outlawed by the Act, they reasoned. They accepted that communications alleging corruption of police were protected by the implied right to freedom of political communication. They also accepted that political communication could include insults. Further, Kirby J noted that insulting words were a well-known tradition in Australian politics from \\"its earliest history\\".. McHugh J also held that the impugned section infringed the second limb of the Lange v ABC test to the extent that it applied to political communication. Rather than read the section down, he declared it invalid altogether. This meant that a 4-judge majority had ruled his conviction under the VA should be overturned. As the Act had been found valid by all except McHugh J, Coleman's convictions for assaulting/obstructing a police officer were not overturned.  Significance  The case is significant as an iterative step in the High Court's development of Australia's freedom of political communication doctrine. The case is also significant as having confirmed the applicability of the constitutional freedom doctrine to state legislation. (2006) 30(1) Melbourne University Law Review 191 ‚Äì via Austlii.

He was a member of the Oppenheim banking dynasty. Abandoning his career in diplomacy, he discovered the site of Tell Halaf in 1899 and conducted excavations there in 1911-13 and again in 1929. Bringing many of his finds to Berlin, he exhibited them in a private museum. This was destroyed by Allied bombing in World War II. However, most of the findings were recently restored and have been exhibited again at Berlin and Bonn. Oppenheim was a controversial figure before and during World War I because he was considered a spy by the French and British. He did in fact engage in anti- Allied propaganda, aimed at stirring up the Muslim populations of the Allied- controlled territories against their colonial masters. Early life Max Oppenheim was born on 15 July 1860 in Cologne as the son of and Pauline Engels. Albert Oppenheim, a member of the Jewish Oppenheim family of bankers had converted to Catholicism in 1858 to marry Catholic Pauline Engels, from an established Cologne merchant family. In 1867, Max' grandfather, Simon, was awarded the title of Freiherr (Baron) in Austria-Hungary. As the title was also valid in Prussia, the family now styled itself \\"von Oppenheim\\". Max grew up as one of five siblings and from an early age he was exposed to art, as his father was an avid collector and patron of the arts. Although his father wanted him to work in the banking house of Sal. Oppenheim, Max had other ideas. According to his unpublished memoirs, it was a Christmas gift of The Thousand and One Nights that first gave rise to his interest in the East. Max attended school at Cologne from 1866‚Äì79, finishing with the Abitur at the Apostel-Gymnasium. He then followed the wish of his father and began to study law at the University of Strasbourg. However, rather than study, he spent most of time at the Studentenverbindung \\"\\". He then transferred to Berlin University but his lack of academic progress caused his father to recall him to Cologne where he finished his 1. Staatsexamen and the doctoral exam in 1883. During his time as Referendar he learned Arabic and began to collect Oriental art. At that time, Max also did his military service in the 15th Uhlan Guards regiment. He finished his Referendariat in 1891 by passing the exam as Assessor. Travel in the East and diplomatic service Max von Oppenheim in Arab-style dress, c. 1896 In 1892, Oppenheim travelled to Spain, the Maghreb and on to Cairo where he stayed for seven months, studying Arabic and Islam. Unusually, he moved out of a European-style hotel to live in a quarter inhabited by locals. In 1893-94, Oppenheim then travelled from Cairo through the Syrian desert, Mesopotamia to Basra. He passed through areas not visited by any European explorer before him and developed a keen interest in the Bedouins. Returning by way of India and Deutsch Ostafrika to Germany, in 1895 Max von Oppenheim wrote his two volume travelogue Vom Mittelmeer zum Persischen Golf, which made him famous on publication in 1899/1900. T.E Lawrence, whom Oppenheim later met at Carchemish in 1912, called Oppenheim's work \\"the best book on the area I know\\". In 1895, Oppenheim visited Constantinople and was received for an audience by Sultan Abdul Hamid II, discussing Panislamism. Interested in politics and diplomacy, Oppenheim tried to join the diplomatic corps but the Ausw√§rtiges Amt (Foreign Office) rejected him due to the Jewish background of his father. Using well-connected friends ‚Äî including Paul Graf von Hatzfeldt ‚Äî Oppenheim succeeded in being accepted as an attach√© (which did not bestow diplomatic status) at the German General Consulate in Cairo. In June 1896, he arrived in Cairo which was to be his home for the next thirteen years. Not issued with any specific instructions, he made use of his freedom to engage in freelance activities, sending reports of his impressions to his superiors in Berlin (over the years totaling around 500). However, most of his messages were simply filed without comment, only rarely distributed more widely within the diplomatic service. Oppenheim was more successful in establishing a network of upper class acquaintances in Cairo, both European and local. This activity and his views in support of the German government's colonial ambitions caused considerable mistrust among the British in Egypt, worried about German designs on the country (which had become a de facto protectorate in 1882), the Suez canal and the lifeline to their possessions in India. The British press repeatedly agitated against him, even styling him a \\"master spy of the Kaiser\\". For example, when tensions were later heightened by the Aqaba border crisis, 1906, British and French papers accused Oppenheim of acting in ways to incite pan-Islamic jihadi massacres of Europeans and of plotting with anti-French Algerian, and anti-Italian Tripolitan, rebels. On one of several trips he made while stationed at Cairo, in 1899 Oppenheim travelled via Aleppo to Damascus and northern Mesopotamia on behalf of Deutsche Bank, working on establishing a route for the Bagdad Railway. On 19 November, he discovered the archaeological site of Tell Halaf, following up on tales told to him by local villagers of stone idols buried beneath the sand. Within three days, several significant pieces of statuary were uncovered, including the so-called \\"Sitting Goddess\\". A test pit uncovered the entrance to the \\"Western Palace\\". Since he had no legal permit to excavate, Oppenheim had the statues he found reburied and moved on. Deutsche Bank was not satisfied with his work on the railway and he was subsequently dismissed as an advisor. He continued to work in Cairo as a diplomat until 1910 when he was dismissed from the diplomatic service with the rank of Ministerresident on 1 November. Excavations at Tell-Halaf Reconstructed bird statue found at Tell Halaf (184 by 70 by 70 cm) Adana Museum, Turkey genius from the palace at Tell Halaf, confiscated by the US government in 1943, today at the Walters Art Museum, Baltimore Scorpion- birdman from the Scorpion Gate at the Western Palace of Tell Halaf, damaged by fire in 1943 and restored Replica of a gold clothing ornament found at Tell Halaf According to noted archaeologist Ernst Herzfeld, he had urged Oppenheim in 1907 to excavate Tell Halaf and they made some initial plans towards this goal at that time. In August 1910, Herzfeld wrote a letter calling on Oppenheim to explore the site and had it circulated to several leading archaeologists like Theodor Noldeke or Ignaz Goldziher to sign. Armed with this letter, Max von Oppenheim was now able to ask for his dismissal from the service (which he did on 24 October 1910) while being able to call on financing from his father for the excavation. With a team of five archaeologists, Oppenheim planned a digging campaign that began on 5 August 1911. Substantial equipment was imported, including a small steam train. The costs totaled around 750,000 Mark and were covered by von Oppenheim's father. On arrival, the archaeologists discovered that since 1899 locals had uncovered some of the findings and heavily damaged them - in part out of superstition, in part to gain valuable building material. During the excavations Oppenheim found the ruins of the Aramaean town of Guzana (or Gozan), which flourished at the turn of the 2nd/1st millennium BC. Significant finds included the large statues and reliefs of the so-called \\"Western Palace\\" built by King Kapara, as well as a cult room and tombs. After a revolt, the Aramaean palace had been destroyed and Guzana became an Assyrian province. Some of the statuary was found reused in buildings from the Hellenistic period. In addition, they discovered Neolithic pottery from around 6,000 to 5,000 BC of a type which became known as Halaf culture after the site where it was first found. At the time, this was the oldest painted pottery ever found (together with those discovered at Samarra by Herzfeld). In 1913, Oppenheim also discovered the reliefs at the Djebelet el-Beda before deciding to return temporarily to Germany. The finds of Tell Halaf were left at the building he and his team had inhabited during the dig. Most of them were securely packaged and stored. First World War The outbreak of World War I prevented him from returning, however. As an expert on the East, the Foreign Office asked him to summarise the many different strategic ideas floating around in the ministry. The result was his Denkschrift betreffend die Revolutionierung der islamischen Gebiete unserer Feinde (\\"Memorandum on revolutionizing the Islamic territories of our enemies\\") of October 1914. The memo argued for enlisting the Sultan to call on the world's Muslims to engage in a Holy War against the colonial powers, France and Great Britain. To develop the necessary propaganda, the Nachrichtenstelle f√ºr den Orient (Intelligence Bureau for the East) was established in Berlin. Oppenheim became its head. In November 1914, Sultan Mehmed V indeed called for a jihad against the enemies of the Ottoman Empire. In 1915, Oppenheim was sent to the German embassy at Constantinople to disseminate propaganda material in the Ottoman empire. On one of several trips he made at the time, he met Prince Faisal in early 1915, trying to win him for the German side, unaware that Faisal's father, Hussein was negotiating with the British almost simultaneously. Whilst their attempt to incite an Arab rebellion was eventually successful, Oppenheim failed. In late 1915, British High Commissioner in Cairo Henry McMahon claimed in a report that Oppenheim had been making speeches in mosques approving of the massacre of Armenians initiated by the Young Turk government earlier that year. Oppenheim was credited with being the one who came up with the dual approach to fighting the British and French: through regular troops and by encouraging uprisings by the masses. Some among the Arabs reportedly referred to Oppenheim as Abu Jihad (\\"Father of Holy War\\"). In 1917, Oppenheim returned to Berlin and began to work on the publication of his excavation results. Weimar Republic and second excavation at Tell Halaf With Germany initially not a member of the League of Nations, there was no way for Oppenheim to resume his excavations. He decided to become a private scholar. In 1922, Oppenheim founded the Orient- Forschungsinstitut in Berlin. At the institute young scholars from various disciplines worked together to advance the study of Middle Eastern culture and history. In the inflation of 1923 Oppenheim lost most of his financial wealth. From then on, he was forced to rely on loans and support from friends and relatives. In 1926, Germany joined the League of Nations. Preparing for new excavations, in 1927 Oppenheim again travelled to Tell Halaf. Artillery fire exchanged between Ottoman and French troops in the final days of the war had severely damaged the building and the archaeological findings had to be dug out of the rubble. Once again, it was found that the locals had damaged some of the stone workings. Since he had made plaster casts during the original excavation, Oppenheim was able to repair most of the damage done to the statues and orthostat reliefs. He managed to achieve a generous division of his previous finds with the authorities of the French Mandate. His share (about two-thirds of the total) was transported to Berlin, the rest was brought to Aleppo, where Oppenheim installed a museum that became the nucleus of today's National Museum. In 1929, he resumed excavations and the new findings were divided. That year, Oppenheim also founded the Max-von- Oppenheim-Stiftung to ensure work on his findings continued after his death. Foundation of the Tell Halaf Museum and later life Attempts to have his findings exhibited at the newly constructed Pergamon Museum failed, as the museum refused to agree to Oppenheim's financial demands. He thus opened his own private \\"Tell Halaf Museum\\" in an industrial complex in Berlin- Charlottenburg in July 1930. The museum's concept of presenting the exhibits is considered quite modern even by today's standards. It was subsequently visited and remarked upon by archaeologist Max Mallowan, his wife Agatha Christie and Samuel Beckett. The 1936 Baedeker guidebook on Berlin recommended a visit. Max von Oppenheim grave in Landshut, Landshuter Stadtkreis Bavaria (Bayern), Germany After the Nazis took power in 1933, Oppenheim's Jewish background became a potential threat. Probably protected by old acquaintances in the scientific community, he was able to continue with his scholarly work. Apparently, this involved some efforts to fit into the intellectual climate of the time. According to historian Sean McMeekin: \\"In a speech before Nazi dignitaries, he went so far as to flatly ascribe his statues to the 'Aryan' culture, and he even received support from the Nazi government.\\" Oppenheim once again wrote a memorandum on Middle Eastern strategic policies. In 1939, he once more travelled to Syria for excavations, coming within sight of Tell Halaf. However, the French authorities refused to award him a permit to dig and he had to depart. With debts of 2 million Reichsmark, Oppenheim was in dire financial trouble. He unsuccessfully tried to sell some of his finds in New York and again negotiated with the German government about the purchase of the Tell Halaf artefacts. While these negotiations continued, the Museum was hit by a British phosphorus bomb in November 1943. It burnt down completely, all wooden and limestone exhibits were destroyed. Those made from basalt were exposed to a thermal shock during attempts to fight the fire and severely damaged. Many statues and reliefs burst into dozens of pieces. Although the Vorderasiatisches Museum Berlin took care of the remains, months passed before all of the pieces had been recovered and they were further damaged by frost and summer heat. A bombing raid in 1943 also destroyed Oppenheim's apartment in Berlin and with it much of his library and art collection. He then moved to Dresden, where he lived through the firebombing of February 1945. Having lost virtually all his possessions, Oppenheim moved to in Bavaria, where he stayed with his sister. He died on 15 November 1946 in Landshut and is buried there. Legacy Stored in the cellars of the Pergamon Museum during the period of communist rule under the GDR, the remains were left untouched. After reunification, the Masterplan Museumsinsel of 1999 brought up the idea of having the Western Palace front from Tell Halaf restored. With financial support from Sal. Oppenheim and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft the Vorderasiatisches Museum engaged in its largest-scale restoration project since the reconstruction of the Ishtar Gate. From 2001 to 2010, more than 30 sculptures were reconstructed out of around 27,000 fragments. They were exhibited at the Pergamon Museum in Berlin in 2011 and at the Bundeskunsthalle Bonn in 2014. The latter exhibition focused not just on the archaeological finds but also on the person of Max von Oppenheim, who has been called \\"the last of the great amateur archaeological explorers of the Near East\\".Gary Beckman, reviewing Nadia Cholidis and Lutz Martin, Der Tell Halaf und sein Ausgr√§ber Max Freiherr von Guy Oppenheim: Kopf hoch!

The idea was first widely publicized in a book of the same name written by Kevin Roberts, CEO of the advertising agency Saatchi & Saatchi. In the book Roberts claims, \\"Brands are running out of juice\\".Lovemarks, p.35 He considers that love is what is needed to rescue brands. Roberts asks, \\"What builds Loyalty that goes Beyond Reason? What makes a truly great love stand out?\\"Lovemarks, p.76 Roberts suggests the following are the key ingredients to create lovemarks:Lovemarks, p.77 *Mystery: **Great stories: past, present and future; taps into dreams, myths and icons; and inspiration *Sensuality: **Sound, sight, smell, touch, and taste *Intimacy: **Commitment, empathy, and passion Roberts explains the relationship between lovemarks and other selling concepts through a simple schema based on respect and love. The full schema is as follows: mere products (commodities) command neither love nor respect. Fads attract love, but without respect this love is just a passing infatuation. Brands attract respect, even lasting respect, but without love. Lovemarks, explains Roberts, command both respect and love. This is achieved through the trinity of mystery, sensuality, and intimacy. Kevin Duncan describes the concept in more traditional marketing terms, noting that there are \\"two axes,\\" one of which runs from low to high respect, and the other which runs from low to high love.Duncan, K. Marketing Greatest Hits: A Masterclass in Modern Marketing Ideas. A&C; Black, 2010, p68 For a brand to transcend into \\"lovemark\\" category, it has to be high on both axes at once. Duncan sums up the concept in one sentence thus: \\"Creating loyalty beyond reason requires emotional connections that generate the highest levels of love and respect for your brand.\\" Duncan, K. Marketing Greatest Hits: A Masterclass in Modern Marketing Ideas. A&C; Black, 2010, p71 In September 2006, Saatchi & Saatchi won a US$430 million JC Penney contract because of the idea of lovemarks.How 'Advertising Age' was wrong about Kevin RobertsKevin and Penney  Examples  In the current world of marketing, there are a plethora of brands that use the concept of lovemarks behind their marketing strategies. One of the biggest examples is The Coca-Cola Company whose marketing campaigns are focused on transmitting emotions to the viewers of their TV advertisements. Another notable example is Cerveza Quilmes, an Argentine beer, who broadcast a commercial titled \\"#IGUALISMO\\", which translates as equality in English, and branded a medieval war between modern men and women, showing the differences between the two genders. At the end of the advertisement, they start begging for pardon from each other, and the Cerveza Quilmes' slogan is shown:- (translated from Spanish): \\"When machism and feminism encounter, equality borns. Quilmes, the flavour of encounter.\\" In this example, the product (a beer) is not shown in the whole advertisement and instead, it is focused on transmitting a certain emotion to their target market (young adults, both male and female).

First reported in the \\"Comprehensive Report of the Special Advisor to the DCI on Iraq's WMD\\", the group is alleged to have attempted to acquire chemical weapons for use in fighting against Coalition Forces (source). Membership The al-Abud network was primarily composed of members of Jaysh Muhammad (JM), an anti-Coalition group motivated by both political and religious elements.http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/jaysh-muhammad.htm The politically motivated faction of JM has strong ties to the Sufi region, which once was highly favored by Saddam during his rule. The Sufi region was home to many former Iraqi security forces, intelligence officers as well as police officers. It is believed through their former standing, political affiliations and business relationships, the group is able to acquire chemical precursors and weapons such as mortars through a \\"pre-OIF supply infrastructure.\\" It is believed by the Iraq Survey Group that Jaysh Muhammad and Fallujah based insurgents were able to acquire chemical munitions, however those munitions were not yet located. Actions The al-Abud Network recruited, in late 2003, an Iraqi chemist in attempts to develop tabun, and mustard agents. The group was able to acquire malathion pesticide and nitrogen mustard precursors, however it is believed they were unable to acquire further precursors for the final stages. From interrogation of key suspects in the 2004 raids against the network, the Iraq Survey Group (ISG) was able to ascertain the final goal of the group was to use the chemical agents within a mortar round, possibly for firing or detonation as an improvised chemical device. In December 2003, the recruited chemist failed to produce tabun, they did however create a poisonous compound due to the mixing of malathion with other precursors of tabun. In total nine mortar rounds were \\"weaponized\\" with the created compound. The mortars themselves are stated to have been an ineffective means of dispersal, due to the likelihood of the poison being consumed in the explosion. Following the failure to create tabun, the insurgent group focused on attempting to create nitrogen mustard in February 2004.https://www.npr.org/documents/2004/cia_wmd/vol3.pdf The al-Abud network recruited another chemist, one with more experience, who owned a small chemical lab in Baghdad. This chemist was unable however to produce the nitrogen mustard or binary mustard as the group had wanted. In mid-2004 this chemist was arrested and the contents of his lab seized. During the arrest it was noted the chemist had managed to produce small quantities of ricin, in the form of ricin cakes, a substance that can easily be turned into poisonous toxic ricin. This chemist also created napalm and sodium fluoride acetate for the Jaysh Muhammad insurgents. It is currently believed the al-Abud network has been neutralized, however the leaders of the group as well as financiers remain at large and, the chemical munitions created remain unaccounted for.https://www.npr.org/documents/2004/cia_wmd/vol3.pdf References External links *Comprehensive Report of the Special Advisor to the DCI on Iraq's WMD: Volume 3 - Hosted by NPR, September 10, 2004 See also *Jaysh Muhammad *Iraq War Category:Arab militant groups Category:Factions in the Iraq War Category:Iraqi insurgency (2003‚Äì2011) Category:Rebel groups in Iraq ","title":"Al-Abud Network"},{"id":"5666316","text":"Professional Photographers of America (PPA) is a worldwide trade association of professional photographers. As of 2018, PPA has more than 30,000 members in 60 countries. PPA is an association that seeks to help its members advance their careers by increasing the members' business acumen as well as broadening their creative range. In fact, their mission is as follows: > The Professional Photographers of America, Inc., a worldwide association, > exists to assist its members in achieving their professional, artistic, and > fraternal goals; to promote public awareness of the profession; and to > advance the making of images in all of its disciplines as an art, a science > and a visual recorder of history. ¬∞Alex the Photo Guy In its early years, the association established a tradition of continuing education for members by providing annual forums for noted photographers, including Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Weston, Dr. C.E. Kenneth Mees, and Edward Steichen. This tradition continues to this day with continuing education classes held nationwide and at the annual Imaging USA convention, taught by the leading names in the photography industry. PPA members can become certified, earning the title of Certified Professional Photographer (CPP). The following degrees are also offered through PPA: Photographic Craftsman (Cr.Photog.), Master of Photography (M.Photog.), Master Artist (M.Artist), and Master of Photography and Photographic Craftsman (M.Photog.Cr.).  History (pre-1900)  National Photographic Association logo circa 1869 The association began in December 1868, as the National Photographic Association, in an attempt to bring together photographers from around the world and \\"for the purpose of elevating and advancing the art of photography, and for the protection and furthering the interests of those who make their living by it.\\"Philadelphia Inquirer, May 12, 1870. The group's first goal was to unite against Ambrotype patent restrictions. Although succeeding in preventing the reissue of the patent, the Executive Committee of the N.P.A. became discouraged, and, the group disbanded in 1876 because of lack of interest.\\"Edward Livingston Wilson. The Photographic Times and American Photographer. July 6, 1888. PPA, as it is known today, was officially formed in April 1880 as the Photographers Association of America, Inc., by members of the Chicago Photographic Association and the former National Photographic Association. The new association's goal was to combine the best minds of the profession, promote an exchange of ideas and knowledge, and eliminate narrow and prejudiced opinions regarding photography as an art and science. In their first April 1880 meetingAppendix to the Congressional Globe. July 1, 1870; p.744.Philadelphia Inquirer, May 12, 1870., PAA elected John Ryder from Cleveland, Ohio, as its first president. A group of 237 photographers attended the first convention in Chicago on August 23‚Äì26. This is a huge feat considering the lack of technology and communication available to spread the word. At that 1880 convention, a special PAA committee gave demonstrations of the gelatin dry plate, a then-revolutionary imaging process. Their subsequent reports, based on member experiments, established the dry plate as standard professional material. Also present at early PAA conventions were many American daguerreotype pioneers, including John H. Fitzgibbon, who began making daguerreotypes as far back as 1841. The daguerreotype was the first practical and profitable photographic process, which had been introduced in 1839-40. The conventions run annually to this day and now go by the name, Imaging USA.  History (20th Century)  In 1909, the membership installed its first governing body, the Congress of Photography. The Congress was composed of delegates from around the country who transacted official association business. Previously, all association business had been conducted by those who happened to attend conventions, resulting in problems of organizational continuity. The Congress continued until 1929 when the National Council became the official governing body, representing 37 associations and clubs nationwide. By 1913, the photography association had grown to 725 members, expanding to 2,272 members in 1916. When World War I began, many PAA members contributed to the United States effort by joining the photography section of the Signal Corps. After the war, all photographers of the section were made honorary PAA members through the Liberty War Section of the association. PAA newsletter from 1922 In 1921, The Daguerre Club of Indiana donated to PAA a building in Winona Lake, Indiana, for the purpose of establishing a photography school. Thus was born the professional school which was to become the Winona International School of Professional Photography. Winona operated classes for professional photographers each summer until 1984 when the school relocated to its Mount Prospect, Illinois campus, where it operated until 1994 when it was relocated to Atlanta, Georgia. Thousands of photographers from all parts of the world have attended Winona classes to update their skills or develop abilities in other fields of photographic application under the guidance of some of the nation's outstanding professional image makers. The school changed its name to the PPA International School of Photography in 1999. Just as PAA celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1930, the Depression hit. Despite efforts to boost membership and provide new programs, the Depression took its toll. During these years (1931‚Äì34), the association suffered along with the country. Budgets were cut, memberships were canceled, and no conventions were held. By 1934, association leaders were spearheading a drive to build membership and combat rampant price-cutting under the National Recovery Act, which was signed into law that year. They developed the Code of Fair Competition for the Photographic and Photofinishing Industry, which would require every person or firm selling photographic products or services to comply with certain requirements as to wages, hours, prices, and trade practices. The tool now existed to revitalize the association and improve the profession so that it could do its part in returning the country to prosperity. These hopes were soon dashed when the National Recovery Act was declared unconstitutional, affecting all such codes under its jurisdiction. The association suffered a further setback when World War II erupted. In spite of this difficult period, PAA continued to offer new benefits to its members, including the Directory of Professional Photography, which made its first appearance in 1938, and the degree program, which awarded its first Master of Photography degree in 1939. The name was changed to Professional Photographers of America, Inc. (PPA), in 1958 to distinguish the association from emerging amateur photography organizations. That same year, PPA joined the Mississippi-Alabama Associated Photographers (later renamed the Professional Photographers of Mississippi-Alabama) and the University of Mississippi to hold the first conference on professional photography with joint participation from a local association, national association, and major university. In 1993 the Association moved its headquarters from Chicago to Atlanta.  PPA in the 21st Century  In 2001, PPA began taking a more active role in protecting photographers' rights with the creation of the Copyright and Government Affairs Department. PPA is actively lobbying on behalf of photographers on Capitol Hill. In 2013, PPA announced their newest benefit, PPAedu, a customized online educational platform. PPAedu started with 170 educational videos and now has over 300 HD videos available to stream 24/7. The videos are tailored to each member's needs based on their responses to a \\"self-assessment\\" quiz also available on the PPAedu website. \\"A common request from our members was more education,\\" said Scott Kurkian, PPA's CFO. \\"So we came up with the idea to bring them a personalized education platform that really targets their specific needs and helps them get grow their studios in particular and their craft in general. The PPAedu instructors are renowned photographers and they're sharing tips and secrets to benefit the industry. That's what PPAedu is for, and that's why PPA exists.\\" In 2015, PPA acquired PhotoVision, an online educational platform that offers photographers education and solutions through cinematic HD videos from some of the biggest names in the industry. PhotoVision and its library of 800+ educational videos are now offered as a member benefit. Professional Photographer Magazine PhotoVision and PPAedu combined offer PPA photographers more than 1,100 videos to browse through and continue to learn from. Imaging USA 2016  Professional Photographer Magazine  PPA publishes Professional Photographer magazine, which celebrated its 100th year in 2007. Born in 1907, Professional Photographer is now the largest paid circulation magazine in the professional photographic industry and the official publication for Professional Photographers of America. No other magazine offers a more influential presentation of the people, trends, products, and photographs changing and defining the portrait, wedding and commercial photography landscape.  Imaging USA  Also shown: A medal of the exposition in Minneapolis in 1888 Imaging USA began in 1880 as the annual convention and trade show for Professional Photographers of America and is the longest running national photographic convention, expo and image exhibition in the United States. It was at the 1888 convention that George Eastman introduced his Kodak camera and film processing service, winning a first prize medallion and special certificate of honor. The following year, 1889, Eastman Kodak Company demonstrated the new transparent celluloid roll film. In 1908, color photography was under development, causing quite a stir at the convention in Detroit. At the Golden Anniversary in 1930, the first artificial lighting, consisting of mercury tubes and electricity, was demonstrated. The concept of \\"photographic salons\\" was developed at the 1906 convention. The salons consisted of 25 photographs, selected by a jury as representing the best shown that year, paving the way for the present annual International Print Exhibition and its prestigious traveling Loan Collection, which each year is seen by thousands of viewers worldwide. Over 10,000 attendees at Imaging USA Imaging USA provides a forum for professionals to network with and to learn from the best photographers in the world. The accompanying trade show offers a look at the latest technologies and products available to the professional photographer. In 2006 Imaging USA became home to two new conferences: SEPCON (the Sport and Event Photographers Conference), the annual conference of the Society of Sport and Event Photographers, and the Commercial Photography Conference, the annual conference of Commercial Photographers International. In 2006, Imaging USA also welcomed Adobe as an official sponsor of the Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom for Photographers track. Usually falling in January, and with a 600+ booth industry expo, 65 educational sessions, and the International Photographic Competition exhibition, Imaging USA has established itself as the first major photographic event of the year. Advocacy In August of 2019 the National Press Photographers Association and the American Society of Media Photographers filed an amicus brief in support of Jim Olive in University of Houston System vs. Jim Olive Photography, D/B/A Photolive, Inc. The brief was joined by the North American Nature Photography Association, Graphic Artists Guild, American Photographic Artists, and Professional Photographers of America. \\"The case began when Texas photographer Jim Olive discovered that the University of Houston was using one of his aerial photographs for marketing purposes without permission. When Olive asked the University to pay for the use, they refused and told him they were shielded from suit because of sovereign immunity, which protects state government entities from many lawsuits.\\" After a negative ruling from a Texas appellate court Olive hopes to continue his fight. In 2019 the Supreme Court of the United States granted certiorari in Allen v. Cooper, raising the question of whether Congress validly abrogated state sovereign immunity via the Copyright Remedy Clarification Act in providing remedies for authors of original expression whose federal copyrights are infringed by states. Thirteen amici including; the United States Chamber of Commerce, the Recording Industry Association of America, the Copyright Alliance, the Software and Information Industry Association, Professional Photographers of America and the National Press Photographers Association, filed briefs in support of Allen. Those briefs proposed various doctrines under which the CRCA could validly abrogate sovereign immunity and variously re-asserted and supported the reasons why Congress examined and enacted CRCA, claiming that Congress was fair in finding that states had abused immunity and that an alternative remedy was needed. On November 5, 2019 the United States Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Allen v. Cooper. A decision in the case is expected in the late spring of 2020.

He was knighted at St James on 5 June 1631. He was also appointed attorney to Prince Charles. In September 1634 he became attorney-general to the king, holding this position during the litigation of John Hampden's famous cause of ship money; and his argument upon that question is still extant. He was also counsel for Cambridge University in 1634‚Äì35. Corfe Castle Bankes purchased Corfe Castle with all its manors, rights, and privileges in 1635 from Lady Elizabeth Coke (n√©e Hatton), widow of Sir Edward Coke, who had died in 1634. Bankes's ancestors had for many generations held property in and near Keswick in Cumberland. The Title deeds and grants from the Crown of the black lead mine at Borrowdale date back as far as Henry VI. and Edward IV and were again renewed under the seal of James I. Lord Chief Justice and death In January 1640 he was made Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and afterwards followed the king from Westminster to York; having left his wife, Mary Bankes, to defend Corfe Castle, which she did with great courage, until it was betrayed into the hands of the rebels. His name is signed to the engagement with the lords at York, in June 1642. In the same year he was sworn of the privy council, and the degree of LL.D. conferred upon him at Oxford, where he died on 28 December 1644, aged 55, and was buried in the Cathedral of Christ Church, where there is a monument to his memory. In 1644, he was at first mentioned in the list of those persons meant to be excepted out of the general pardon; his name was afterwards struck out of that list, but he was notwithstanding impeached of high treason. His estates and property however passed to his eldest son Sir Ralph Bankes, who became an MP and built the estate of Kingston Lacy. Notes References * * Christopher W.

It is a relatively new term, and has been created to better distinguish, and add nuance, between two long-standing descriptors: blue-water navy (deep water) and brown-water navy (littoral and river). It is a non- doctrinal naval term used in different ways. It originates with the United States Navy, who use it to refer to the portion of their fleet that specializes in offensive operations in coastal waters. Nowadays such ships rely on stealth or speed to avoid destruction by shore batteries or land-based aircraft. The US Navy has also used the term to refer to the first phase of the expansion of China's navy into a full blue-water navy. Subsequently, other authors have applied it to other national navies that can project power locally, but cannot sustain operations at range without the help of other countries. Such navies typically have amphibious ships and sometimes small aircraft carriers, which can be escorted by destroyers and frigates with some logistical support from tankers and other auxiliaries.  Definitions  The elements of maritime geography are loosely defined and their meanings have changed throughout history. The US's 2010 Naval Operations Concept defines blue water as \\"the open ocean\\", green water as \\"coastal waters, ports and harbors\\", and brown water as \\"navigable rivers and their estuaries\\". Robert Rubel of the US Naval War College includes bays in his definition of brown water, and in the past US military commentators have extended brown water out to from shore. During the Cold War, green water denoted those areas of ocean in which naval forces might encounter land-based aircraft. The development of long-range bombers with anti-ship missiles turned most of the oceans to \\"green\\" and the term all but disappeared. After the Cold War, US amphibious task forces were sometimes referred to as the green-water navy, in contrast to the blue-water carrier battle groups. This distinction disappeared as increasing threats in coastal waters forced the amphibious ships further offshore, delivering assaults by helicopter and tiltrotor from over the horizon. This prompted the development of ships designed to operate in such waters ‚Äì the and the littoral combat ships; modelling has suggested that current NATO frigates are vulnerable to swarms of 4-8 small boats in green water. Rubel has proposed redefining green water as those areas of ocean which are too dangerous for high-value units, requiring offensive power to be dispersed into smaller vessels such as submarines that can use stealth and other characteristics to survive. Under his scheme, brown water would be zones in which ocean-going units could not operate at all, including rivers, minefields, straits and other choke points. As the preeminent blue-water navy of the early 21st century, the US Navy is able to define maritime geography in terms of offensive action in the home waters of its enemies, without being constrained by logistics. This is not true for most other navies, whose supply chains and air cover typically limit them to power projection within a few hundred kilometres of home territory. A number of countries are working on overcoming these constraints. Other authors have started to apply the term \\"green-water navy\\" to any national navy that has ocean-going ships but lacks the logistical support needed for a blue-water navy. It is often not clear what they mean, as the term is used without consistency or precision. A green- water navy does not mean that the individual ships of the fleet are unable to function away from the coast or in open ocean: instead it suggests that due to logistical reasons they are unable to be deployed for lengthy periods, and must have aid from other countries to sustain long term deployments. Also the term \\"green-water navy\\" is subjective as numerous countries that do not have a true green-water navy maintain naval forces that are on par with countries that are recognized as having green-water navies. For example, the German Navy has near the same capability as the Canadian Navy but is not recognized as a true green-water navy. Another example is the Portuguese Navy that, despite being usually classified as a minor navy, has several times conducted sustained operations in faraway regions typical of the green-water navies. However, the differences between blue-water navies and brown or green-water navies is usually quite noticeable, for example the US Navy was able to quickly respond to the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 and continue operations in the region with relative ease even though the search area covered the Indian Ocean. In contrast, in 2005 the then green-water Russian Navy was unable to properly respond when its AS-28 rescue vehicle became tangled in undersea cables unable to surface, relying on the blue-water Royal Navy to respond and carry out the rescue in time. Just as nations build up naval capability, some lose it. For example, the Austro-Hungarian Navy was a modern green water navy of the time, but as the countries lost their coasts during World War I, their navies were confiscated and their ports became parts of Italy and Yugoslavia. The Axis powers lost naval capabilities after their defeat in World War II, with most of Japan's Imperial Navy and Germany's Navy being disarmed and their troop and ship numbers capped and monitored by the Allies. The collapse of the USSR also brought with it the collapse of the second largest naval force in the world, and the largest submarine force in the world. Although the Russian Federation made sure to inherit the most capable ships, passing most older models to successor states, as it had lost the logistical capabilities of the Soviet Navy, it was no longer able to operate away from Russian shores for extended periods of time. Moreover, budget cuts forced large cuts in the submarine force, such as the retirements of the . As the Soviet Navy was built largely around submarine warfare the losses in the submarine capability have adversely affected the capability of the newly formed Russian Navy as well.

History The 101s were by far the most numerous class of locomotive (diesel or steam) ever to run in Ireland with 111 being built between 1866 and 1903 with only minor modifications between batches. The great majority were built by the GS&WR; at Inchicore Works, though the construction of some examples was contracted out to Beyer, Peacock and Company (12) and Sharp, Stewart and Company (8), both famous Manchester based locomotive building firms. The 101s survived long after many more modern steam locomotives were scrapped with nearly half their number still in traffic when the C√≥ras Iompair √âireann completed dieselisation at the end of 1962.

To give a larger water capacity, No. 184 has been paired with the larger tender when used on the Irish railway network. As built the locomotives would have carried the lined dark olive green livery of the Great Southern & Western Railway until around the start of the 20th Century. After that, they were black with red lining until the late 1910s, when they were painted all over unlined grey. This dull but all-encompassing livery included motion, wheels, inside frames, cabs, smoke boxes and chimneys. The only relieving feature was the red buffer beam. Standard cast number plates were also painted over grey, with rim and numerals picked out in cream or very pale grey, or occasionally not at all. This livery persisted post-1925 into Great Southern Railways days, and was extended to locomotives of other constituent companies after the GSR amalgamation of that date. On the formation of CI√â in 1945, the only change was that the cast number plates were gradually removed and pale yellow numerals were painted on instead. In addition, most tenders received a lined pale green \\"flying snail\\" logo. Both locomotives are out of service awaiting overhauls, with No. 186 last operating in late 2013. While CI√â repainted a few locomotives in green or black, all of the J15 class remained grey until withdrawal. In film The preserved locomotives have appeared in various films. Most recently, No. 186 appears in the 2006 film, The Wind That Shakes the Barley. Both 184 and 186 appear in the 1979 film, The First Great Train Robbery.

The population was 576 in 2016. Hopewell Creek flows through the settlement. History As European immigrants moved to the area in the early 1800s, the settlement was first called Rotenburg. Between 1827 and 1840, of the 48 settlers who arrived in Rotenburn, 36 were from Alsace and 12 were from Baden. A particularly large number arrived from Soufflenheim, Alsace, between 1828 and 1860. By 1832, there were 69 families in Rotenburg, and a population of 307. The settlement was renamed New Germany, and German language newspapers sometimes referred to the settlement as Neu Deutschland. In 1916, a historian wrote of the pioneer settlement: > One of the disagreeable features among the New Germany settlers was that, > although composed of Germans almost exclusively, rivalry and uncharitable > raillery between the people from different principalities was very > prevalent. There was no German citizen because there was no Germany, each > one was an Alsatian, Bavarian, a Prussian, etc. Every one considered his > Principality the best and had a supreme contempt and ugly nicknames for all > the others. This, however, has all passed away. All are now Canadians. A school was erected in 1832, which served as a church on Sunday. It was the first Catholic church in the region. St. Boniface Roman Catholic Church was established near the school in 1834, named for Saint Boniface, the apostle of Germany. The current church was erected in 1877. In 1852, a two-room brick school was built. During the winter the school enrolled over 100 students. St. Boniface Hotel was erected in 1850, and for 70 years it was used as a stop for the stagecoach carrying mail and passengers between Waterloo and Guelph. The early settlement had a blacksmith shop, brewery, cobbler, cooper, tailor, and three hotels. Between 1860 and 1865, New Germany was afflicted by smallpox with \\"especial severity\\", and many residents had badly marked faces throughout their lives. A post office was established in 1879. In 1941, Canada Post requested that New Germany change its name because mail arriving from overseas was being misdirected to New Germany, Nova Scotia. Canadian Post suggested the name \\"Gort\\", after a British commander, or \\"Wavell\\", after a British General in Egypt.

Bibliography  = The Goblin Quest Series = * Goblin Quest (2006) DAW () Jig is a scrawny little nearsighted goblin-a runt even among his puny species. Captured by a party of adventurers searching for a magical artifact, and forced to guide them, Jig encounters every peril ever faced on a fantasy quest. * Goblin Hero (2007) DAW () After barely surviving an adventure he never wanted, the scrawny little nearsighted goblin called Jig is now known as Jig Dragonslayer, and has the power of healing, thanks to the forgotten god he worships. But being a hero isn't all it's cracked up to be. Not when the goblin leader wants him dead, and everyone else actually expects him to keep doing heroic-and incredibly dangerous-things. * Goblin War (2008) DAW () The goblin lair is once again under attack by the humans, and when they gain control of the lair they take out the strongest goblins, including the famous Jig the Dragonslayer. It seems that there is a war going on, pitting humans against an army of monsters - orcs, goblins and kobolds. However, Jig quickly discovers that he and his tribe have no friends on either side. Jig is going to have to use all of his brains and luck if he is going to keep himself alive...oh, and save his tribe as well, if at all possible. * Goblin Tales (2011) A vengeful ghost trapped in a goblin's ear ... a flaming spider who must help stop a goddess from conquering a science fiction convention ... a goblin nursery worker who finds herself trapped in the middle of a war. This self-published collection features five humorous short stories that explore the fantasy realm from the perspective of the lowest of the low, the unlikeliest of unheroes: the goblins. = Princess Series = * The Stepsister Scheme (2009) DAW () Danielle De Glas, aka Princess Whiteshore, aka Cinderella, is having a hard time adjusting to palace life. She loves her prince, Armand, but going from the life of a slave to that of princess is not easy. To complicate matters, three months after her wedding, Danielle is attacked by her stepsister, Charlotte. The assassination attempt fails, but Charlotte escapes - after telling Danielle she will never see her beloved Armand again. This is the set up. Danielle, along with two other princesses (Snow White and Talia, aka Sleeping Beauty), must rescue her prince. Along the way, the true histories of all three princesses are revealed, vs. the \\"tales\\" circulating about them. *The Mermaid's Madness (2009) DAW () Princess Danielle on a mission of diplomacy with Queen Beatrice, their yearly tithe and renewal of peace with the merfolk, who prefer to be called undine. Since the undine are usually a matriarchal culture, it makes sense for the Princess and Queen to take the lead. Unfortunately, things go very wrong, very quickly. For instead of the King they are expecting, they are greeted by his mad daughter, Lirea, wronged by her human lover and looking for vengeance against all humans. In the ensuing conflict, Queen Beatrice is grievously injured. This leaves Danielle and her friends Talia and Snow to find both a cure for her ailment, and to find a way to stop Lirea from making war against their kingdom - and all of humanity. * Red Hood's Revenge (2010) DAW () Roudette's story was a simple one. A red cape. A wolf. A hunter. Her mother told her she would be safe, so long as she kept to the path. But sometimes the path leads to dark places. Roudette is the hunter now, an assassin known throughout the world as the Lady of the Red Hood. Her mission will take her to the country of Arathea and an ancient fairy threat. At the heart of the conflict between humans and fairies stands the woman Roudette has been hired to kill, the only human ever to have fought the Lady of the Red Hood and survived-the princess known as Sleeping Beauty. * The Snow Queen's Shadow (2011) DAW () When a spell gone wrong shatters Snow White's enchanted mirror, a demon escapes into the world. The demon's magic distorts the vision of all it touches, showing them only ugliness and hate. It is a power that turns even friends and lovers into mortal foes, one that will threaten humans and fairies alike. = Magic ex Libris Series = * Libriomancer (2012) DAW () * Codex Born (2013) DAW () * Unbound (2015) DAW () * Revisionary (2016) DAW () * Imprinted: a Magic ex Libris Novelette (2018) = Janitors of the Post-Apocalypse Series = * Terminal Alliance (2017) DAW () * Terminal Uprising (2019) DAW () = Stand- alone works = * Tamora Carter: Goblin Queen (2020) () * Fable: Blood of Heroes (2015) Del Rey () * Goldfish Dreams (2003) Regal Crest Enterprises () = Collections = * The Goblin Master's Grimoire (2013) ISFiC () = Edited works = * Heroes in Training (with Martin H.

He led the Labour Party administration on Birmingham City Council from 1984 to 1993. Knowles was brought up in Kent and worked in the building industry from the age of 14. After brief service in the Royal Engineers during World War II, he became a builder and shipbuilder in 1941. In 1950 he became a trade union organiser in the building trade, working in Sevenoaks, Dover, Leeds and eventually ending up in Birmingham. From 1971 he became national organiser of the Co-operative Party and began to consider a career in local government. He was elected to Birmingham City Council in 1972 and was swiftly made Chairman of the Planning Committee. In 1974 he was elected as an Alderman and moved on to the Policy Committee, of which he was a member for three years until the Labour Party lost power. He also served on West Midlands County Council from 1973 to 1977. In 1980 Knowles returned as Planning Committee chairman for two years. He was promoted to be Labour group leader and became Leader of the Council in 1984 when Labour won control. Knowles played a key role in the transformation of Birmingham city centre during the late 1980s and early 1990s. He was influential in bringing about the International Convention Centre and Symphony Hall on Broad Street, which were to prove hugely important in the regeneration and reinvention of the city. He was Knighted in 1989. Knowles was sued in 1990 by John Hemming over a leaflet which Hemming considered libellous; although Knowles had not written the leaflet, he had helped distribute it door-to-door. Lacking the resources to defend the case, Knowles agreed to pay damages of ¬£1,000 to charity plus Hemming's legal costs. Knowles stood down from the leadership in 1993, being succeeded by Theresa Stewart and was made Lord Mayor of Birmingham in 1994. He was defeated for re- election to the council in 2000. On 2 May 2007, the then British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, paid tribute to Dick Knowles's contribution to the regeneration of Birmingham, during Prime Minister's Questions at Westminster. Mr Blair said: \\"He is somebody who did an immense amount for Birmingham. One of the reasons Birmingham is such a vibrant and thriving European city is because of the work Dick Knowles did.\\". He was still politically active as a governor of University Hospital Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust well into his eighties. Knowles died of bladder cancer, aged 90. His son, Bill Knowles, added that his father had lived \\"a very full and complete life\\". The Knowles stand, one of four stands for spectators at Alexander Stadium is named after him.

Background  A contemporary map of the reservation assigned to the Seminole Indians in the Treaty of Moultrie Creek By the Treaty of Moultrie Creek in 1823, the Seminoles had relinquished all claims to land in the Florida Territory in return for a reservation in the center of the Florida peninsula and certain payments, supplies and services to be provided by the U.S. government, guaranteed for twenty years. After the election of Andrew Jackson as President of the United States in 1828, the movement to transfer all Indians in the United States to west of the Mississippi River grew, and in 1830 the United States Congress passed the Indian Removal Act.Missall. pp. 6364, 7980. Determined to move the Seminoles west, the United States Department of War appointed James Gadsden to negotiate a new treaty with them. In the spring of 1832 the Seminoles on the reservation were called to a meeting at Payne's Landing on the Oklawaha River. The negotiations were conducted in obscurity, if not secrecy. No minutes were taken, nor were any detailed accounts of the negotiations ever published. This was to lead to trouble later.Missall. p. 83. The U.S. government wanted the Seminoles to move to the Creek Reservation in what was then part of the Arkansas Territory (which later became part of the Indian Territory), to become part of the Creek Nation, and to return all runaway slaves to their lawful owners. None of these demands were agreeable to the Seminoles. They had heard that the climate at the Creek Reservation was harsher than in Florida. The Seminoles of Florida did not consider themselves part of the Creeks. Although many of the groups in Florida had come from what whites called Creek tribes, they did not feel any connection. Some of the groups in Florida, such as the Choctaw, Yamasees and the Yuchis had never been grouped with the Creeks. Finally, runaway slaves, while often held as slaves by the Seminoles (under much milder conditions than with whites), were fairly well integrated into the bands, often inter- marrying, and rising to positions of influence and leadership.James W. Covington. 1993. The Seminoles of Florida. Gainesville, Florida: University Press of Florida. pp. 110127. Treaty contents The treaty negotiated at Payne's Landing called for the Seminoles to move west if the land were found to be suitable. The delegation of seven chiefs who were to inspect the new reservation did not leave Florida until October 1832. After touring the area for several months and conferring with the Creeks who had already been settled there, the seven chiefs signed on March 28, 1833 at Fort Gibson, Arkansas Territory a statement that the new land was acceptable. Upon their return to Florida, however, most of the chiefs renounced the statement, claiming that they had not signed it, or that they had been forced to sign it, and in any case, that they did not have the power to decide for all the tribes and bands that resided on the reservation.Missall. pp. 83-85. Even some U.S. Army officers observed that the chiefs \\"had been wheedled and bullied into signing.\\" Furthermore, \\"there is evidence of trickery by the whites in the way the treaty is phrased.\\"Milton Meltzer. \\"Hunted Like A Wolf\\". p. 76. Several villages had been allowed to stay in the area of the Apalachicola River after 1823 when the rest of the Seminoles had been forced into the new reservation. Gadsden was able to persuade the chiefs of these villages to move, however, and they went west in 1834.Missall. p. 84. The United States Senate finally ratified the Treaty of Payne's Landing in April 1834.Missall. pp. 8690. Refusal to move The treaty had given the Seminoles three years to move west of the Mississippi. The government interpreted the three years as starting in 1832, and expected the Seminoles to move in 1835. Fort King, in what is now Ocala was reopened in 1834. A new Seminole agent, Wiley Thompson, was appointed in 1834, and the task of persuading the Seminoles to move fell to him. He called the chiefs together at Fort King in October 1834 to talk to them about the removal to the west. The Seminoles informed Thompson that they had no intention of moving, and that they did not feel bound by the Treaty of Payne's Landing. Thompson then requested reinforcements for Fort King and Fort Brooke, reporting that, \\"the Indians after they had received the Annuity, purchased an unusually large quantity of Powder & Lead.\\" Brigadier General Duncan L. Clinch, United States Army commander for Florida, also warned Washington that the Seminoles did not intend to move, and that more troops would be needed to force them to move. In March 1835 Thompson called the chiefs together to read a letter from Andrew Jackson to them. In his letter, Jackson said, \\"Should you ... refuse to move, I have then directed the Commanding officer to remove you by force.\\" The chiefs asked for thirty days to respond. A month later the Seminole chiefs told Thompson that they would not move west. Thompson and the chiefs began arguing, and General Clinch had to intervene to prevent bloodshed. Eventually, eight of the chiefs agreed to move west, but asked to delay the move until the end of the year, and Thompson and Clinch agreed. Five of the most important of the Seminole chiefs, including Micanopy of the Alachua Seminoles, had not agreed to the move. In retaliation, Thompson declared that those chiefs were removed from their positions. As relations with the Seminoles deteriorated, Thompson forbid the sale of guns and ammunition to the Seminoles. Osceola, a young warrior beginning to be noticed by the whites, was particularly upset by the ban, feeling that it equated Seminoles with slaves and said, \\"The white man shall not make me black. I will make the white man red with blood; and then blacken him in the sun and rain ... and the buzzard live upon his flesh.\\" In spite of this, Thompson considered Osceola to be a friend, and gave him a rifle. Later, though, when Osceola was causing trouble, Thompson had him locked up at Fort King for a night. The next day, in order to secure his release, Osceola agreed to abide by the Treaty of Payne's Landing and to bring his followers in.Missall. pp. 9091. The situation grew worse. In August 1835 Private Kinsley Dalton (for whom Dalton, Georgia is named) was killed by Seminoles as he was carrying the mail from Fort Brooke to Fort King. In November Chief Charley Emathla, wanting no part of a war, led his people towards Fort Brooke where they were to board ships to go west. This was considered a betrayal by other Seminoles. Osceola met Emathla on the trail and killed him.Missall. pp. 9192. The Second Seminole War was beginning.

He is most notable for being the builder of Kingston Lacy, the restored seat of the Bankes family. Bankes was born at Corfe Castle, Dorset, the second son and one of nine children of Sir John Bankes and Mary Hawtrey. Sir Ralph, like his father, trained in the law at Gray's Inn and became close friends with Peter Lely, the painter, and Roger Pratt, the gentleman architect. In 1661 he married Mary Brune, niece of Charles Brune of Athelhampton, by whom he had two children, John and Mary. Bankes sat in Richard Cromwell's parliament in 1659 for the family seat of Corfe Castle and remained an MP until his death in 1677, actively safeguarding Dorset interests. History of Parliament Online - Bankes Ralph With the restoration of Charles II in 1660, he went to Canterbury and was knighted. He was also made a gentleman of the Privy Chamber for services rendered to the crown. He was a reasonably active Parliamentarian, and a supporter of the Crown party. Until his death, he was engaged with Roger Pratt in the design of Kingston Lacy, a new house to replace the destroyed Corfe Castle, which his mother had defended heroically during the English Civil War. It was based on Clarendon House, built for the Lord Chancellor, which Bankes visited several times. The project led to severe financial difficulties, and at the time of his death he was endeavouring to raise further funds.

Terracotta pottery, as earthenware is called when not used for vessels, is an ancient building material that translates from Latin as \\"baked earth\\". Some architectural terracotta is actually the stronger stoneware. It can be unglazed, painted, slip glazed, or glazed. A piece of terracotta is composed of a hollow clay web enclosing a void space or cell. The cell can be installed in compression with mortar or hung with metal anchors. All cells are partially backfilled with mortar. By the late 19th century the version with a ceramic glaze, namely glazed architectural terracotta became more popular.  Chemistry  Terracotta is made of a clay or silt matrix, a fluxing agent, and grog or bits of previously fired clay. Clays are the remnants of weathered rocks that are smaller than 2 microns. They are composed of silica and alumina. Kaolinite, halloysite, montmorillonite, illite and mica are all good types of clays for ceramic production. When mixed with water they create hydrous aluminum silica that is plastic and moldable. During the firing process the clays lose their water and become a hardened ceramic body. Fluxes add oxygen when they burn to create more uniform melting of the silica particles throughout the body of the ceramic. This increases the strength of the material. Common fluxing materials are calcium carbonate, alkaline feldspars, manganese, and iron oxides. Grog is used to prevent shrinking and provide structure for the fine clay matrix.  History  Terracotta was made by the ancient Greeks, Babylonians, ancient Egyptians, Romans, Chinese, and the Indus River Valley and Native American cultures. It was used for roof tiles, medallions, statues, capitals and other small architectural details. = Ancient Eastern terracotta = Brick temple in Bhitargaon, Kanpur Indian terracotta manufacturers hand pressed, poured, and double-molded the clay mix. Plaster casts have been found in several ancient sites in Afghanistan, Bangladesh,http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Terracotta_Art India and Pakistan. Similarities in motifs and manufacturing processes have caused scholars to note cross cultural pollination between the Hellenic and Indus River Valley sculptural terracotta traditions. Famous early examples include the Bhitargaon temple and the Jain temple in the Mahbubnagar district. Chinese, Korean, and Japanese terracotta making traditions were focused on non-architectural uses such as statuary or cookware but various forms of terracotta tiles were popular roofing materials. = Western terracotta =  Antiquity‚Äì1700s  Greeks used terracotta for capitals, friezes, and other elements of their temples like at Olympia or Selenius. Domestically they used it for statuary and roof tiles. The Etruscans used terracotta for roof tiles, encased beams, and enclosed brick walls with it. The Roman terracotta innovation was the underfloor or hypocaust heating system that they used for their bath houses. Medieval European architecture did not expand terracotta use beyond the ancients. The manufacture of tile roofs diminished with low cost thatch roofing widely available. Southern German, Italian and Spanish city states kept the tradition alive. Natural History Museum in London has an ornate terracotta facade typical of high Victorian architecture ‚Äì the carvings represent the contents of the museum  1700s‚Äì1880s  ;England Englishmen Richard Holt and Thomas Ripley patented an artificial stone recipe in 1722. The business was fairly successful at making small architectural ornaments. Their company was taken over by George and Eleanor Coade in 1769. George died a year later, leaving the company to his wife and daughter, both named Eleanor Coade. The Coade ladies popularized the grey mix of terracotta as an alternative to stone with the help of architects like Horace Walpole and Sir John Soane. Georgian architectural style was in vogue and demand for repetitive, classically inspired d√©cor was very fashionable. The Victoria and Albert Museum (1867‚Äì1880) and the Natural History Museum of London (1879‚Äì1880) buildings ushered in an era of mass-produced architectural terracotta. Trinity Church in New York City, from Robert N. Dennis collection of stereoscopic views 7alt=Trinity Church, from Robert N. Dennis collection of stereoscopic views 7.jpg ;United States Most early terracotta was shipped from Europe or made by small local ceramicists. The first manufacturer of architectural terracotta was opened by Henry Tolman Jr. in Worcester, MA around 1849. The capitals in the Massachusetts State Capitol in Worcester are early examples of locally produced terracotta. In the 1850s, New York architects like Richard Upjohn and James Renwick began to use it as an economical replacement for stone. Railway Exchange Building in Chicago is faced entirely with light cream enamel terracotta (drawing by Hugh Ferriss, 1920)  1880s‚Äì1930s  Reactions to the Chicago fire in 1871 spurred interest in terracotta as a fireproof building material. In the age of skyscraper construction, the cast iron frame needed to be protected. Terracotta was a lightweight, moldable, fire and pollution resistant material that could be mass-produced. Architects such as Burnham and Root, H.H. Richardson, Louis Sullivan, and McKim, Mead & White became interested in using terracotta as a building material rather than just as imitation stone. Issues with installation, water penetration, and corroding interior metal caused the industry to organize the National Terracotta Society. They published two widely used standards, in 1914 and 1924, that detailed construction methods, anchoring systems, waterproofing, and maintenance standards.  1930s‚Äìpresent  Economic interest in terracotta plummeted in the 1930s but the industry did not die out. Terracotta could not compete with newer mass-produced materials such as plate glass, new metal alloys, and cement block construction. Changing fashions towards more minimalist, modern styles such as the Bauhaus School and International Style did not help the waning industry. Post-World War II the industry had to face the decline of buildings built during the heyday of the material, 1910‚Äì1940. Structural problems resulting from incomplete waterproofing, improper installation, poor maintenance, and interior corroding mild steel made the material unpopular in newer constructions. To combat this accusation against quality, several other industry publications were produced between 1945 and the 1960s. They did not succeed in reviving the artistic architectural terracotta but they were able to turn their attention to public buildings. Advances in machine extruded terracotta made it competitive with other hollow clay tile alternatives at the time. In tiles form, terracotta had a renewal as a hallmark of mid-century public buildings. It lost steam in the 1960s with the introduction of more synthetic materials on the mass market. The industry was sustained by the need for replacement blocks for old buildings, hollow clay tile, and now rainscreen.  Manufacturing process  Terracotta can be made by pouring or pressing the mix into a plaster or sandstone mold, clay can be hand carved, or mix can be extruded into a mold using specialized machines. Clay shrinks as it dries from water loss therefore all molds are made slightly larger than the required dimensions. After the desired green-ware, or air dried, shape is created it is fired in a kiln for several days where it shrinks even further. The hot clay is slowly cooled then hand finished. The ceramics are shipped to the project site where they are installed by local contractors. The hollow pieces are partially backfilled with mortar then placed into the wall, suspended from metal anchors, or hung on metal shelf angles. = Design = Academically trained artists were often the designers of the terracotta forms. Their drawings would be interpreted by the manufacturer who would plan out the joint locations and anchoring system. Once finalized, the drawings were turned into a plaster reality by sculptors who would create the mold for the craftsmen. Vertical thumb = Clay preparation = Clay selection was very important to manufacture of terracotta. Homogenous, finer grain sizes were preferred. The color of the clay body was determined by the types of deposits that were locally available to the manufacture. Sand was added to temper the process. Crushed ceramic scraps called grog were also added to stiffen the product and help reduce shrinkage. Weathering the clay allowed pyrites to chemically change to hydrated ferric oxide and reduced alkali content. This aging minimizes the potential chemical changes during the rest of the manufacturing process. The weathered raw clay was dried, ground, and screened. Later, it would have been pugged in a mill that would mix the clay with water using rotating blades and force the blend through a sieve. = Hand pressing terracotta = An artist makes a negative plaster mold based on a clay positive prototype. 1‚Äì1¬º\\" of the clay/water mixture is pressed into the mold. Wire mesh or other stiffeners are added to create the web, or clay body that surrounds the hollow cell. The product is air dried to allow the plaster to suck the moisture out of the green clay product. It is fired then slowly cooled. = Extrusion = Mechanized extrusion was used for the mass-production of terracotta blocks, popular in the 1920s. Prepared clay was fed into a machine that would then push the mix through a mold. The technique required the blocks to be made with simple shapes, so this process was often used for flooring, roofing, cladding, and later hollow clay tiles. A downdraft kiln designed for the Pomona Terra Cotta Manufacturing Company in Guilford County, North Carolina = Glazing = The last step before firing the greenware was glazing. True glazes are made from various salts but prior to the 1890s most blocks were slip glazed or coated with a watered-down version of the clay mix. Liquefying the clay increased the amount of small silica particles that would be deposited on the surface of the block. These would melt during firing and harden. By 1900 almost all colors could be achieved with the addition of salt glazes. Black or brown were made by adding manganese oxide. Philadelphia Art Museum's terracotta pediment using polychrome glazing = Firing = The kiln firing process could take days, up to two weeks. The clay is heated slowly to around 500¬∞C to sweat off the loose or macroscopic water between the molecules. Then the temperature is increased to close to 900¬∞C to release the chemically bonded water in gaseous form and the clay particles will begin to melt together or sinter. If the kiln reaches 1000¬∞C then the clay particles will vitrtify and become glass like. After the maximum temperature was reached then the clay was slowly cooled over a few days. During firing a fireskin is created. A fireskin is the glass like \\"bread crust\\" that covers the biscuit or interior body. Various kilns were used as technology developed and capital was available for investment. Muffle kilns were the most common kiln. They were used as early as 1870. The kilns burned gas, coal, or oil that heated an interior chamber from an exterior chamber. The walls \\"muffled\\" the heat so the greenware was not directly exposed to the flames. Down-draught kilns were also widely used. The interior chamber radiated heat around the terracotta by pulling in hot air from behind an exterior cavity wall. Like the muffle wall, the cavity wall protected the greenware from burning. = Installation = The earliest terracotta elements were laid directly into the masonry but as structural metal became more popular terracotta was suspended by metal anchors. The development of cast and later wrought iron as a structural material was closely linked to the rise of terracotta. Cast iron was first used as columns in the 1820s by William Strickland. Over the course of the 19th century metal became more incorporated into construction but it was not widely used structurally until the late 1890s. A series of disastrous fires (Chicago, 1871; Boston, 1872; and San Francisco, 1906) earned terracotta a reputation for being a fireproof, lightweight cladding material that could protect metal from melting. Holes were bored in the hollow blocks in choice locations to allow for metal 'J' or 'Z' hooks to connect the blocks to the load bearing steel frame and/or masonry walls. The metal could be hung vertically or anchored horizontally. Pins, clamps, clips, plates, and a variety of other devices were used to help secure the blocks. The joints would then be mortared and the block would be partially backfilled. First Congregational Church of Long Beach, California  Degradation  The most common reasons for terracotta to fail are: poor manufacturing, improper installation, weathering, freeze/thaw cycling, and salt formation from atmospheric pollution. The porosity of terracotta greatly impacts its performance. The ability or inability for water and pollutants to enter into the material is directly correlated to its structural capacity. Terracotta is very strong in compression but weak in tension and shear strength. Any anomalous material expanding (ice, salts, incompatible fill material, or corroding metal anchors) inside the clay body will cause it to crack and eventually spall. Inherent faults can severely impact the performance of the material. Improper molding can cause air pockets to form that increase the rate of deterioration. If the block is not fired or cooled properly than the fireskin will not be uniformly adhered to the substrate and can flake off. Likewise, if a glaze is not fired properly it will crack, flake, and fall off. Discolorations can result from mineral impurities such as pyrites or barium carbonates. A fair amount of damage comes from clumsy transportation, storage, or installation of the material. If the mortar used around and inside the blocks is too strong then the stress will be translated to the terracotta block which will fail over time. Corroding interior metal anchors expand at a faster rate than the surrounding ceramic body causing it to fail from the inside out. Improper loading of the hollow terracotta blocks can create stress cracks. Imperfect repair work often exacerbates the underlying problems, speeding up the decay of surrounding elements as well. Installing selant rather than mortar, or applying impervious coating, will trap moisture within the terracotta. The environment also plays a large role in the survival of terracotta. Different types of air pollution can cause different types of surface problems. When it rains, water and salts get sucked into the voids in and around the terracotta through capillary action. If it freezes then ice forms, putting internal stress on the material, causing it to crack from inside. A similar problem happens with atmospheric pollutants that are carried into the gaps by rains water. The pollution creates a mildly acidic solution that eats at the clay body or a salt crust forms, causing similar issues as ice.

The slot presses down against a retaining pin, which holds back the striker. When sufficient pressure is applied to the lid of the box the retaining pin moves, allowing the striker to hit the detonator. The mines typically have an operating pressure of 1 to 10 kg. All the mines in the series use MOV series fuzes. As with other wooden box mines, the mine has a relatively short lifetime since the box is vulnerable to rotting and splitting, disabling the mine. It is, however, more dangerous than conventional metal mines, as it cannot be found with a metal detector. The mines are sometimes used with mortar bombs in place of the normal explosive blocks. Variants * PMD-6 - original version of the mine, first used in the 1939 Winter War between the Soviet Union and Finland. * PMD-6M - slightly larger version of the mine, with a leaf spring installed inside the box to increase operating pressure, which allows safer handling during minelaying. * PMD-6F - a version used extensively during the Siege of Leningrad, with an ammonium nitrate/fuel oil (ANFO) main charge. * PMD-7 - smaller version of the mine, using a cylindrical main charge. * PMD-7ts - consists of a solid wooden block hollowed out to accept the main charge and fuse. * PMD-57 - A later, larger box mine, using a larger warhead.

The native range is from Maryland and extreme southern New Jersey and southeast Pennsylvania south to central Florida, west to eastern Texas, and north to southern Missouri and Kentucky. The plant's habitat is dry sandy and rocky uplands and ridges mixed with oak and hickory to 1000 m elevation. It grows best on well-drained soils in full sun or partial shade. Description It is a spreading shrub or small tree, reaching in height at maturity. The bark is red- or gray-brown and slightly furrowed into scaly plates. The leaves are simple, narrowly elliptical or lanceolate, yellow-green above and paler and finely hairy on the underside. Each leaf is long by wide with parallel side veins ending in short pointed teeth. The flowers are monoecious and appear in early summer. Male flowers are small and pale yellow to white, borne on erect catkins long attached to the base of each leaf. Female flowers are long and are located at the base of some catkins. The fruit is a golden-colored cupule in diameter with many sharp spines, maturing in autumn. Each cupule contains one ovoid shiny dark brown nut that is edible. A natural hybrid of Castanea pumila and Castanea dentata has been named Castanea √ó neglecta. Habitat Leaves and immature nuts of Allegheny chinquapin. The Allegheny chinquapin is closely related to the American chestnut, Castanea dentata, and both trees can be found in the same habitat. Allegheny chinquapin can be distinguished by its smaller nut (half the size of a chestnut) that is not flattened (chestnuts are flattened on one side). The leaves of the Allegheny chinquapin are smaller than the American chestnut and have less distinct teeth. Allegheny chinquapin, however, is less susceptible to the chestnut blight fungus that devastated the American chestnut. While the chinquapin does blight to some degree, it continues to send out suckers that will produce fruit. Chinquapins are quite vulnerable nevertheless, and there are many reports of heavily diseased and cankered trees. Uses John Smith of Jamestown made the first record of the tree and its nuts in 1612, observing its use by the Native Americans. Native Americans made an infusion of chinquapin leaves to relieve headaches and fevers. The bark, leaves, wood, and seed husks of the plant contain tannin. The wood is hard and durable and is sometimes used in fences and fuel, but the plant is too small for the wood to be of commercial importance. Chinquapins are used in landscapes for the purpose of attracting wildlife. When the base of plant is cut or wounded at ground level the plant will grow multiple stalks producing a thick cover used by turkeys. The nuts are consumed by squirrels and rabbits while white tail deer graze upon the foliage.

In this case, the Commonwealth imposed a tax on flour millers, but reimbursed the States based on their production of wheat in order to reimburse the flour millers by 90% of their taxes. The problem is that Tasmania, while milling flour, does not produce wheat. The majority held that the taxation was valid since the tax applied equally to all States, and there was no constitutional impediment to granting money discriminately. Per Latham CJ, section 96 is a means by which the Commonwealth, \\"when it thinks proper\\", can adjust inequalities between States. Thus, because there was no discrimination in taxation, yet grants are not subject to prohibitions based on discrimination, the majority held the laws to be valid. Evatt J, conversely, examined the scheme as a whole, and ruled it invalid.  See also  * Australian constitutional law  References  * Winterton, G. et al.

They owned large portions of land throughout Dorset and made significant contributions to the political history and development of the country. thumb thumb thumb Buildings The first family seat was in Corfe Castle which was destroyed during the civil war when the Bankeses, who were cavaliers (royalist followers), were besieged by parliament forces. After the return of King Charles II the Bankeses again rose to political power. Their new home, built at Kingston Lacy has survived until the present day, under the guide of the National Trust. The family vault is located in the Church of Wimborne Minster, not far from their Kingston Lacy estate. In the late 19th century the Bankeses built a summer beach house at Studland in Dorset. The manor house as it is named is now a hotel. A large pub in the village, frequented by beach visitors, is known as the Bankes Arms Inn. The family church, St Stephen's is on the far edge of the Kingston Lacy estate at Pamphill. The road up to the church is lined with a row of trees planted in 1846. The 19th century rebuild of the church replaced a decaying ruin of a church that had existed since 1229. The church has several monuments dedicated to the Bankes family, as well as a window and five pews decorated with the family coat of arms. Family members Records go back to John Bankes, born 1569, who fathered Sir John Bankes. The most notable members of the Bankes family are as follows: * Sir John Bankes (1589 - 1644) was Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas to Charles I and a member of the Privy Council was married to \\"Brave Dame\\" Mary Bankes. They lived in Corfe Castle, until its destruction during the civil war. * Sir Ralph Bankes (1631 - 1677) was the second son of Sir John and brother of Jerome and John. Upon his father and younger brother's deaths, the estate passed to him. He was responsible for the building of the new family seat at Kingston Lacy. He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Corfe. * John Bankes the Elder (1665-1714), son of Sir Ralph, married Lady Margaret Parker and was also MP for Corfe. * Henry Bankes the Elder, son of John Bankes, who married Margaret Wynne, daughter of John Wynne the Bishop of Bath and Wells and owner of Soughton Hall, Flintshire. After the death of her brother, it brought the Hall into ownership of the Bankes family. * Henry Bankes the Younger (1757 - 1834) was the grandson of John Bankes the second. He became an MP for Corfe, an influential Tory bencher and a chief trustee of the British Museum. He was close friends with both Pitt the Younger and the Duke of Wellington. He purchased new land for the family including Whitemill in 1773. * William John Bankes (1786 - 1855), son of Henry Bankes the Younger, who after meeting architect Charles Barry on his Grand Tour in Rome (later Sir Charles Barry, renowned for his rebuild of the Palace of Westminster), enlarged Soughton Hall and encased Kingston Lacy as it is today. A notable explorer and adventurer, he travelled extensively to the Orient and Egypt, and collected the largest private individual collection of Egyptian artefacts in the world. He was good friends with Lord Byron. He also served as MP for Corfe. A scandal forced his retirement from all public affairs until his death. * Walter Ralph Bankes (1853 - 1904) was head of the family in the late nineteenth century. He was the father of Ralph Bankes the second and left a financial bequest to pay for the family church of St Stephen's Church, Pamphill. The church was eventually constructed under the leadership of his wife Henrietta Bankes and his son (see below). * Henrietta Bankes (1867 - 1953), was the lady of the house during the First World War. She helped turn the majority of the servants' quarters and the out buildings into a hospital for returning injured soldiers. She also allowed the building of a small war hospital, less than a mile away on the estate. She died in 1953. * Henry John Ralph Bankes (1902 - 1981) was the seven times great grand son of Sir John Bankes. He became owner of the Kingston Lacy estate on becoming 21 in 1923. He had two sisters, Daphne (1898 - 1967, unmarried), and Viola Florence Geraldine (1900 - 1989), who married Norman Bruce Hall, and was known as author Viola Bankes. Henry married in 1935 Hilary Margaret Strickland-Constable (1908 - 1966) and had two children, one son (John, 1937 - 1996) and one daughter (Mary, 1940 -). Upon his death, he bequeathed Kingston Lacy and Corfe Castle to the National Trust, the largest donation the trust has ever received. Heraldry The arms of the Bankes family of Kingston Lacy are: Sable, a cross engrailed ermine between four fleur-de-lys or.As is visible for example on a relief sculpture on a stone chimney-piece at Kingston Lacy showing the arms of William Bankes quartering Wynne and Brune This is a differenced version of the arms of the 14th century family of Bank of Bank Newton, Craven, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, namely: Sable, a cross or between four fleurs-de-lys argent.

The seventh tropical cyclone, fourth named storm, and second hurricane of the annual season, Debby developed from a tropical wave east of the Lesser Antilles on August 19\\\\. Favorable conditions allowed the depression to become Tropical Storm Debby early on August 20, and further strengthening into a hurricane occurred 24 hours later. Sustained winds peaked at 85 mph (140 km/h) on August 21\\\\. Debby made three landfalls on August 22, in Barbuda, Saint Barth√©lemy, and Virgin Gorda, before re-entering the Atlantic north of Puerto Rico. As Debby moved parallel to the north coast of Hispaniola late on August 23, it weakened back to a tropical storm. The storm tracked westward and weakened further, instead of approaching Florida and strengthening into a major hurricane. While south of eastern Cuba on August 24, Debby was downgraded to a tropical depression, six hours before completely dissipating. Light rainfall and gusty winds caused minor damage in Barbuda, Saint Martin, and Trinidad and Tobago. In the United States Virgin Islands, brief blackouts and damage reaching $200,000 (2000 USD) was reported. Effects were most severe in Puerto Rico, where isolated locations experienced more than 12 inches (300 mm) of rainfall. The heavy precipitation resulted in mudslides and flooding, which in turn damaged roads, bridges, and houses. At least 406 homes on the island were flooded, five of which suffered moderate to severe damage. Additionally, there were many car accidents in San Juan due to slick roads. One indirectly fatality was reported after a man fell off his roof while attempting to remove a satellite dish. Damage on the island of Puerto Rico reached $501,000. In Dominican Republic, the Civil Defense Force reported that severe flooding in the northern portions of that country caused the evacuation of more than 700 people. Overall, the storm caused roughly $35,000 in damage across the island. Impact was lesser in Haiti, where squalls tore tin roofs off of numerous shanty homes and subsequently flooded a few. Additionally, rainfall in Cuba brought relief to an 8 month long drought impacting the region. Meteorological history A strong tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on August 16\\\\. By the following day, an area of low pressure was noted near 10¬∞N 30¬∞W. However, Dvorak classifications were not be initiated due to insignificant convective banding. At 0000 UTC on August 18, the National Hurricane Center's Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch (TAFB) indicated a low-level circulation, though the system was still considered \\"too weak to classify\\". The TAFB released an initial classification later that day at 1145 UTC. Convective banding had increased, though the system as a whole was poorly organized. It then began to gradually organize while moving westward at approximately . By late on August 19, convection had consolidated around a well-defined center of circulation. As a result, it is estimated that Tropical Depression Seven developed at 1800 UTC, while located about 1,035 miles (1,665 km) east of the Windward Islands. In the initial advisory by the National Hurricane Center, the agency noted a large area of convection, weak vertical wind shear, warm sea surface temperatures (SSTs), all of which produced a favorable environment for intensification. The depression strengthened and became Tropical Storm Debby at 0000 UTC on August 20. Operationally, it was not upgraded to a tropical storm until 15 hours later. After classification, the center of circulation was difficult to locate due to the re-organization of convection. Although the circulation remained relatively disorganized, the central dense overcast (CDO) associated with Debby was large, symmetrical, and had cold cloud tops. By 0600 UTC on August 21, Debby had strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane. Despite reconnaissance aircraft flight reports of sustained winds ranging from , Debby was not upgraded to a hurricane. Six hours later, the storm reached its maximum sustained wind speed of 85 mph (140 km/h). Additionally, Debby attained its minimum barometric pressure of early on August 22. It was operationally not upgraded to a hurricane until 0900 UTC on August 22, due to a poorly defined circulation. Hurricane-force winds were very concentrated, extending only 25 miles (40 km) from the storm's center of circulation. Hurricane Debby over the Leeward Islands on August 22 At 0600 UTC on August 22, Debby made landfall in Barbuda with winds of 75 mph (120 km/h). A few hours later, the storm also struck Saint Barth√©lemy at the same intensity. It made a third landfall in Virgin Gorda with winds of 75 mph (120 km/h), at 1500 UTC on August 22. In an advisory issued later that day, the National Hurricane Center noted that although the agency anticipated further strengthening, it would not be \\"significant\\" in the short-term, due to Debby's rapid movement west-northwestward and potential land interaction with Hispaniola. Late on August 22, the storm passed about north of Puerto Rico. Early on August 23, computer models varied extensively with the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GDFL) model, regarded by the National Hurricane Center as an \\"extreme outlier\\", depicting a low pressure area over the Florida Keys on August 26. Due to increasing southwesterly wind shear, Debby began to weaken and was downgraded to a tropical storm at 1200 UTC on August 23, while situated north of Dominican Republic. Beginning late on August 23, it was predicted that Debby would re-strengthen, as SSTs were between and the storm was anticipated to resume the original west-northwest movement, reducing land interaction. However, Debby curved westward and continued to become increasingly disorganized, with the low-level circulation being displaced well west of the main, deep convective area. Early on August 24, the storm entered the Windward Passage and began passing south of Cuba. The National Hurricane Center continued to predict re-intensification, but noted the potential for degeneration into a tropical wave during the next few days in its advisory at 0900 UTC on August 24, due to persistent wind shear. Three hours later, Debby was downgraded to a tropical depression. The storm degenerated into a tropical wave at 1800 UTC on August 24, while located south of Cuba. Preparations A forecast map of Hurricane Debby, projecting its landfall in Florida Several storm warnings were issued for the Greater and Lesser Antilles to warn residents of the approaching storm. In Philipsburg, Sint Maarten, several shops in the downtown area were boarded up to prepare for Debby's approach. Elsewhere along the range of the cyclone's predicted path, homes and businesses were boarded up, and families buried emergency supplies in the ground. Ten United States Navy ships and two submarines off the Coast of Vieques Island temporarily abandoned training exercises and moved over to the south of Puerto Rico, out of the storm predicted path. On Antigua, electricity was shutoff to prevent storm damage to the island's infrastructure. When the hurricane moved into the coastal waters of the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Hovensa oil refinery in St. Croix was shut down, and as a result gas prices rose. Around 7,000 people in Cuba were evacuated to avoid the oncoming hurricane. Several shelters were opened by the Montserrat Red Cross on Montserrat, but few people sought refuge in them. Over 40 shelters were ready for use in Nassau, Bahamas, even though Debby never affected the island. A total of 889 people in the northern coastal plains were evacuated and placed in shelters out of Debby path. Three shelters were opened for the coming of Debby in Saint Thomas, and another two in Saint John. The total number of people in all five shelters only reached 64\\\\. An additional 17 people took refuge in an unknown number of shelters on St. Croix. In addition, many tropical cyclone warnings and watches were posted in the Greater and Lesser Antilles. At 2100 UTC on August 20, a hurricane watch was issued for Sint Maarten, Saba, and Sint Eustatius, while there was a tropical storm watch for Antigua, Barbuda, and Anguilla. Early on August 21, the hurricane watch was expanded to include the United States Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. Additionally, the tropical storm watch was extended out to the British Virgin Islands, Guadeloupe, Montserrat, Saint Barth√©lemy, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Saint Martin. A hurricane warning was issued for Guadeloupe, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands late on August 21\\\\. In Dominica, both a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch were reported, while a tropical storm watch was put into effect in Dominican Republic. At 0300 UTC on August 22, a hurricane watch was issued for Haiti north of Port-au-Prince as was a tropical storm warning in Dominican Republic from Palenque to Cabrera. An hour later, a tropical storm watch was put into effect for the southeastern Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands. By 0900 UTC on August 22, Dominican Republic's entire north coast was under a hurricane warning. Additionally, the tropical storm watch for the southeastern Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands was upgraded to a hurricane watch. The hurricane warning for Antigua, Barbuda, Guadeloupe, Montserrat, and St. Kitts and Nevis was discontinued at 1200 UTC on August 22, as was the tropical storm warning for Dominica. Three hours later, a hurricane warning was issued for the southeastern Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands, and another hurricane watch was posted for the central Bahamas. Additionally, the hurricane warning for Saba, Sint Eustatius, Sint Maarten, was discontinued. At 2100 UTC on August 22, a hurricane watch was issued in Cuba for the provinces of Holgu√≠n and Las Tunas, while a tropical storm warning was issued for Haiti north of Port-au-Prince. The hurricane warning for the United States Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico was lowered to a tropical storm warning, before being canceled early on August 23\\\\. Additionally, all watches and warning east of the United States Virgin Islands were discontinued. On August 23, a hurricane warning was issued for the central Bahamas and Cuba in the provinces of Guantanamo, Holgu√≠n, and Las Tunas. A hurricane watch was put into effect for the northwestern Bahamas and Cuba in Camag√ºey and Ciego de √Åvila on the north coast and Santiago de Cuba and Granma on the south coast. By 1500 UTC on August 25, all of the remaining tropical cyclone watches and warnings were cancelled. Although the hurricane was still situated far from Florida, a state of emergency was declared for the Florida Keys. Non-residents in Monroe County were forced to leave, causing a significant reduction in the tourism for the year 2000. For a period of time, forecasters predicted Debby to approach the Florida Keys as a Category 2 hurricane, while the GDFL predicted a much more intense Debby near the Florida Keys as a Category 4 hurricane with a minimum central pressure of . Impact Because of the relatively weak and disorganized nature of the storm, impact throughout its path was widespread, but not particularly severe. Puerto Rico bore the brunt of the storm, followed by the United States Virgin Islands, then the Dominican Republic. Debby was attributed to about $735,000 in damage and 1 indirect fatality, which occurred in Puerto Rico when a man fell off a roof while attempting to remove a satellite dish. =Lesser Antilles= Tropical Storm Debby interacting with the high and rugged mountains of Hispaniola on August 23 Throughout the Leeward Islands, gusty winds damaged fruit trees and downed power lines. Wind gusts estimated to have reached 65 mph (100 km/h) lashed Anguilla. Some trees were destroyed, and electrical poles and power lines were downed. In Antigua, downed utility poles and trees were spotted. Precipitation totals in Antigua peaked at 0.91 inches (23 mm). Rainfall on the island of Barbuda reached 1.5 inches (38 mm). Debby caused moderate roof damage to several structures and destroyed a few sheds and fruit trees. Sint Maarten reported little rainfall as the storm almost uneventfully passed over the island, causing mostly minor flooding and vegetation damage. Losses reached $750,000, though it was entirely from cruise ship cancellations and closed businesses. With damage nearly nonexistent, the Sint Maarten Tourism Bureau remarked that Debby \\"was the weakest hurricane St. Maarten experienced in several years.\\" On Saint Barth√©lemy, wind gusts as strong as at Gustavia were reported. Wind damage was minor, limited to some downed trees and power poles. Rainfall totals were very light, ranging from . Tides on the island reached about above normal. Similar wave heights were reported on Saint Martin, while precipitation was slightly higher, ranging from . Impact was minimal on Guadeloupe. Wave heights reached approximately . Rainfall was also light on Guadeloupe, with in Le Moule, in Sainte-Rose, in La D√©sirade, in Sainte-Anne, and in Pointe-√†-Pitre. Feeder bands from Debby affected countries as far south as Trinidad and Tobago, where heavy rainfall resulted in flooding in the Barrackpore region. =United States territories= Rainfall from Hurricane Debby in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands In the United States Virgin Islands, losses reached approximately $200,000. On Saint Thomas, of rain was recorded. At the Cyril E. King Airport, sustained winds reached , while gusts up to were reported. Elsewhere on Saint Thomas, one sailboat was washed ashore on Vessup Beach. Sustained winds of and gusts of on Saint Croix caused brief power outages. Additionally, 0.46 inches (11.7 mm) of rain fell in St. Croix. Minor landscape damage occurred on Saint John. Debby also dropped up to 12 inches (30.5 mm) of rainfall across Puerto Rico in less than 48 hours, causing mudslides and damage to bridges and roads; however, most of the island territory only received 3 inches (7.62 mm) of precipitation. The maximum rainfall on the island was 12.63 inches (32 mm) in R√≠o Piedras, Puerto Rico. Additionally, 12.16 inches (31 mm) of precipitation was recorded near Cayey, though there were unofficial reports of 17 inches (43 mm) in the interior mountains of the region. The hurricane dropped around 5 inches (127 mm) of rain in San Juan, producing slick roads that resulted in several minor car accidents. There were 406 homes affected from the flooding, 5 of which were moderately to severely damaged. Losses in Puerto Rico reached $501,000, primarily in the Caguas municipality. The storm was also indirectly responsible for the death of a 78-year-old man who fell while trying to remove a satellite dish from the roof of his home. =Dominican Republic= On the northern coast of the Dominican Republic, waves and rainfall caused light to moderate damage. Storm surge damaged about 20 homes and dozens of families were evacuated from Cabrera, Nagua, R√≠o San Juan, and Saman√°. In Nagua, several districts were left without drinking water and electricity after gusts blew down power cables and large trees. At San Jos√© de Matanzas, several coconut trees were uprooted from the ground. Also, two houses were slightly damaged from wind gusts. In the nearby town of La Vega, bridges over the Piedra River and Jumunucu River collapsed due to the heavy rainfall and flooding. In southern Puerto Plata, flooding in Aguas Negras, Playa Oeste and Dubeau districts forced dozens of families to leave their houses. In Monte Cristi, heavy rainfall caused flooding in various low-lying districts, with over 200 people affected in the coastal portion of the province. Another town, Salcedo, lost approximately of bananas, with the damage estimated to have reached approximately $35,000 (RD$500,000 DOP). The country's Civil Defense Force stated that over 700 people on the northern coast were forced out of their homes after severe flooding. A wedding was also delayed at the bavaro beach resort after flooding left the altar area suitable only for ducks. =Haiti= Residents living in shanties in northern Haiti fled their homes during the storm. In Port-de-Paix, strong winds tore off many tin roofs and flooded some homes. A small coastal village, Carenage, experienced high winds that sunk at least five boats. Storm surge also swept away one home, but without any reports of injury or death. In Cuba, the remnants of Debby brought rainfall to the eastern portion of the country, particularly Guant√°namo Province, with 24‚Äëhour precipitation totals of in San Antonio del Sur, in Mais√≠, and and at separate locations in Guant√°namo. Due to a severe eight- month drought in Guantanamo Province, the accumulated rainfall was largely beneficial. However, as a precaution against potential flooding, more than 32,000 people and thousands of cattle residing in low-lying areas were evacuated to higher ground. A few locations reported gusty winds. At Mais√≠, sustained winds between were reported, along with gusts up to . Additionally, tides caused coastal flooding in Baracoa.

It covers a large surface that extends into Dongnae-gu in the south, Buk-gu in the west, Geumjeong-gu in the east, and the city of Yangsan in the north. Its highest peak, Godang-bong, the highest peak in the region, stands at 801.5 meters on the city limit between Busan and Yangsan. Geumjeongsan is the city's most popular hiking destination, and thousands of people climb it during the week-ends. The top can easily be reached using the cable-car in Geumgang Park near Oncheonjang station or by taking the bus from Oncheonjang station to Saseongmaeul on the mountain top. Sanseongmaeul (ÏÇ∞ÏÑ±ÎßàÏùÑ) is a small rural community built in the mountain valley, isolated from the surrounding city. It includes a few agricultural fields and livestock pastures on the valley sides. The place is well known for its speciality meal: \\"barbecued goat meat\\". Geumjeongsan is renowned for the Geumjeongsanseong built on top of the mountain and Beomeo Temple on its north-east side. Godangbong Godangbong () is the highest peak on the mountain. It stands at an altitude of 801.5 meters on the city limit between Busan and Yangsan. Its summit gives a great view of the surroundings, including Gimhae International Airport in Gangseo-gu. On very clear days it is possible to see the cities of Gimhae and Jinhae further to the south-west and the mountain relief of Tsushima Island half-way in the Korea Strait. It is home to a Gomodang, while Yonghoam Rock and Yongam Cave are located below the south. It takes about an hour and 20 minutes from Beomeosa Temple to GODANGbong Peak via the northern gate. Geumsaem Geumseam (; literally Golden fountain) is a naturally formed cavity on top of a granite boulder standing off a cliff about 500 meters east of Godang-bong. According to the legend a golden fish (Geumeo, Í∑∏Î®∏) came down from the world of Brahma on a 5-coloured cloud and took residence in the golden fountain. The fountain is said to never dry and the colour of its water is always gold. The names of the mountain and Beomeo temple originated from that legend. Today the legend is still represented in the symbols of Geumjeong-gu. The gu's logo represent the fountain and the gu's character is a cartoon representation of Geumeo.

Background The Commonwealth passed the Payroll Tax Act, which imposed a 2.5% tax on all wages paid by an employer. It also applied to all state employers. The Act was challenged on the grounds that it breached the Melbourne Corporation principles limiting the extent to which the Commonwealth can burden states. Decision The court held that the Act was a valid one under the 'Melbourne Corporation' two-limbed principle. The majority spoke about the implications that could be drawn from the constitution. This came from the fact that the constitution contemplates the existence of the states. A law that fundamentally restricts their exercise of essential functions would go against the implication of the continued existence of the states. Windeyer J notes that the increased entry of the Commonwealth in areas of concurrent federal and state power was foreseen early on, and the progressive increased fiscal power of the Commonwealth was indicative of this notion. The states in the process of Federation agreed willingly to become a single federal entity giving up some of their powers without gaining any new ones. The gradual centralisation of power in the Commonwealth grew from this process. This view is particularly persuasive in the environment after Engineers which swept away reserved State powers and the doctrine of intergovernmental immunity.

He now lives in Morrilton, Arkansas. Inside the small Conway County. Professional career Crawford was drafted in 1995 by the Boston Red Sox and worked as a reliever and spot starter for the team in the 2000 and 2001 seasons. After the 2002 season, which he spent in the minors, he became a free agent and signed briefly with the Oakland Athletics in 2003 and the Cincinnati Reds in 2004, but never made another appearance in the major leagues. Crawford is most remembered in Boston for suffering an unusual injury in July 2000 just prior to an expected recall to the Red Sox from their Pawtucket Red Sox AAA affiliate. A day after pitching a seven-inning no-hitter, he allegedly rolled off a hotel bed in Ottawa and landed on a glass that he had left on the floor. The injury required eight stitches. Steroid use admission On June 21, 2006, in an ESPN The Magazine article by Amy K. Nelson, Crawford, who by then was out of baseball, admitted to using the steroids Deca-Durabolin and Winstrol, human growth hormone and amphetamines from 1999‚Äì2001. In the article, Paxton claims that other Red Sox players used and \\"openly encouraged him to use\\" drugs and even laughed \\"when he spilled needles in front of his locker\\". Current members of the Red Sox who played with Crawford and many former Red Sox players have criticized Crawford and denied that there was an open drug culture in the locker room. However, during the 2000 season, police investigated Red Sox infielder Manny Alexander after they discovered steroids and syringes during a search of his car during a traffic stop. Crawford's name appeared in the Mitchell Report, released on December 13, , as a result of his admitted use of performance enhancing drugs. The committee requested Crawford appear for an interview but he declined stating \\"that he did not 'do that stuff anymore,' that he was sorry he had used those substances in the past and that he just wanted to be left alone.\\" Crawford made 15 appearances with Boston between 2000 and 2001, going 5‚Äì1 with a 4.15 ERA. His major-league career ended shortly after he suffered a stress fracture in his lower back in June 2001 and had shoulder surgery in February 2002. The Red Sox released him in October 2002. Crawford also said, continuous pain was also a cause of his steroid use. In August 2004, Crawford was suspended for 15 days for violating the league's alcohol and drug abuse policy while playing for the Chattanooga Lookouts, the Double A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds.

Handbook of School Manners for Teens (2004) * The How Rude! Handbook of Family Manners for Teens (2004) * The How Rude! Handbook of Friendship and Dating Manners for Teens (2004) Contents In 465 pages, How Rude!: The Teenagers' Guide to Good Manners, Proper Behavior and Not Grossing People Out covers most aspects of life that teens are likely to encounter. The text is broken up into short chunks for easy reading. According to Packer, \\"Good manners are good for you. They impress people. They build self-esteem. They can help you get what you want from life: friends, fun, success and respect. And they don't cost anything.\\" Seeking to avoid the stereotype of etiquette books as preachy and dull, How Rude! keeps teenage readers amused as they learn the basics of polite behavior in all kinds of situations: at home, at school, in public, with friends, with strangers, at the mall, at the movies, on the phone, online, in conversations, at job interviews, in restaurants, on elevators, in cars, on skateboards, at parties, at formal dinners, on the bus and anywhere they go. Young readers find out how to cope with cliques, handle friendship problems, be a host with the most (and a guest with the best), offer someone their seat, fight fair, answer invitations, deal with rude adults, respond to bigoted remarks, write a letter, dress properly for any occasion, master the proper techniques for civilized spitting, scratching, sneezing, yawning, coughing, hiccuping, nose- picking and much more. Hundreds of \\"Dear Alex\\" questions and answers cover everything from dating to breaking up, thank-you notes to table manners, ethnic jokes to obscene phone calls, skiing to driving. \\"True Stories from the Manners Frontier\\" divulge the shocking consequences of not having good manners. Survey results reveal what teens, parents and teachers think about manners and why they are important.

The show followed a format of light entertainment, special guests, music, and information about Dutch life. Later, the show pioneered international call-in shows, in both the English and Spanish versions, during the 1970s. Happy Sation was PCJJ and then Radio Netherlands Worldwide's most popular programme, claiming an audience of as high as 100 million in the 1930s\\"On the Air\\", The Hollywood Reporter (Archive: 1930-2015); Hollywood Vol. 44, Iss. 38, (Mar 25, 1938): 4. and 25 million in the 1970s.\\"Waves may be short, but news travels a long way\\", Windsor Star (1959-2010); Windsor, Ontario [Windsor, Ontario]09 Feb 1971: 38. Happy Station's run has been interrupted twice ‚Äî from 1940 until 1946 due to World War II and again from 1995 when it was cancelled until its revival in 2009. The revived programme is not affiliated with Radio Netherlands Worldwide or RNW Media. History =Eddy Startz= The program premiered on November 19, 1928 and was broadcast first by the private Philips Radio station PCJJ (later PCJ), and from 1947 by Radio Netherlands. Separate English and Spanish versions were broadcast around the world on shortwave. Popular music from Europe and various other countries was mixed with vintage recordings and multilingual light patter, switching back and forth in up to seven languages each Sunday.\\"Radio-Reviews: EDWARD STARTZ\\", Jaco. Variety (Archive: 1905-2000); Los Angeles Vol. 130, Iss. 2, (Mar 23, 1938): 31. According to presenter Eddy Startz: \\"I was playing sambas and rhumbas before anyone here had ever heard of them.\\" Startz would begin every episode with the Dutch national anthem followed by a John Philip Sousa march. At some point during each programme, he would tap a teacup with a spoon and play his signature tune, ‚ÄúA Nice Cup of Tea‚Äù by Henry Hall to introduce the show's mail call segments. The programme became popular since it gave listeners a chance to travel in their armchair during a period when international travel was difficult for most people. In particular, the Startz-era of the show featured special formats such as a voyage by sound where Startz narrated tours to distant locations assisted by sound effects. Under Startz, Happy Station was 90 minutes long and was for many years broadcast not only on Sunday but several other days of the week; in 1964 it was reduced to 80 minutes. A typical show would be composed of musical entertainment and announcements in several languages, \\"Spotlight on Holland\\" featuring light news items about the Netherlands, the Mailbag during which Startz would read and answer listener mail from around the world, and a musical signoff. Happy Station was intended as a respite from the news of crisis and conflict that dominated short wave radio, saying: \\"We believe in amusing, our listeners abroad. They are fed up with the nationalist propaganda ladled out over the air from the dictatorship countries\\",\\"Radio gags make the world laugh\\", Detroit Free Press (1923-1999), General edition; Detroit [Detroit]26 Mar 1938: 9. and \\"you will hear no war news from us.\\"\\"SHORT-WAVE PICK-UPS\\", New York Times (1923-Current file); New York, N.Y.

The guilt is German's alone,' and the Reich Radio from Lord Haw Haw's wave again sinks the British navy, 'Eddie' may be playing 'I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles' or remarking on the fresh supply of tulips now poking through the sod.\\" Broadcasts from the Netherlands were interrupted by the German invasion in May 1940. Startz and PCJ broadcast the events of the invasion for four days until he was arrested. Startz and the staff of PCJ blew up the powerful PCJ transmitters in hopes of preventing them from being used by the Nazis.\\"50 Years Shortwave In Holland : klankbeeld 1977-04-15 / 1977-03-30\\" , RNW While the Germans used forced labour to rebuild the transmitter and use it for radio propaganda, Startz dropped out of broadcasting for the remainder of the war. PCJ resumed broadcasting in 1946, including Startz and Happy Station which, in 1947, transferred to the new Radio Netherlands Worldwide when PCJ was nationalized.Radio Nederland Wereldomroep International Program Service Summer Schedule, 1948 Edward \\"Eddie\\" Startz presented the program from its inception until his retirement in December 1969. Startz was born Eduard Franz Conradin Startz in Neutral Moresnet in 1899. Morsenet was on the border of Belgium, Germany, and Holland and under the joint sovereignty of Belgian and Prussia (in practice, Belgium and Germany),https://wiki.beeldengeluid.nl/index.php/Edward_Startz and Startz grew up in the Dutch town of Vaals near the point where all four borders met. After finishing school, Startz moved to the United States where he lived for five years while attending university, and worked his way through school working as a dishwasher, waiter, and travelling salesman. Startz set off for America, where he lived for five years, working as a dishwasher, waiter, and travelling salesman while attending university. In 1925, he began working as a sailor, and travelled to South America, where he picked up Spanish and Portuguese. He returned to Holland in 1928 where he found work as a translator but soon was hired as an announcer at PCJJ, which had just begun broadcasting and where his multilingualism was an asset. A German national by birth, he became a Dutch citizen in 1936 and general manager of PCJ in 1938. Although the retirement age in Holland is 65, Startz continued broadcasting Happy Station until his 70s and reluctantly retired from Happy Station at the end of 1969; he died in 1976.https://www.gooieneemlander.nl/cnt/dmf20180926_47279206/zoekplaatje- radiomaker-edward-startz?utm_source=google&utm;_medium=organic =Tom Meijer= Tom Meijer took over and hosted the English and Spanish versions from January 1970 until his own retirement in 1993. Born Thomas Hendrik Meijer on November 16, 1938, he was known as \\"Tom Meyer\\" by international audiences. Meijer was born in Amsterdam to a Swiss mother and Dutch father. In 1941, the family escaped Nazi-occupied Holland by fleeing through France, Spain and Cuba before settling on Trinidad and then Cura√ßao. After World War II, the family returned to Holland before moving to Singapore, and then returning again to Holland. Meijer studied to be a pharmacist. before switching to law, but found he preferred music and theatre. He became a semi-professional touring performer for two years, appearing occasionally on television and radio while holding down a job in international marketing. In 1965, he was hired by Radio Nederland as a Dutch-language announcer. Fluent in English, German, and French, he was appointed the host of Happy Station after the show's founder, Edward Startz, retired after 41 years. Meijer hosted English and Spanish versions of the show for 15 hours on Sundays as it was broadcast to different areas around the globe. Under his tutelage, the show pioneered live international phone-in shows. However, its format remained largely musically based, Meijer's musical tastes were more contemporary than Startz's and tended to be in the easy listening genre, with Meijer himself sometimes performing songs. World music would also be played. Meijer also encouraged listener interaction with the show, with a mailbag segment and a listener birthday feature, the Birthday Book, where he would wish read out the names of listeners whose birthdays coincided with that week's airdate and wish them a happy birthday. There were \\"No more ‚Äúcuppa‚Äôs‚Äù, no more animal farm or Sousa marches, but live shows from outside locations; travel stories with sound effects, recorded on the spot by Meyer; the famous ‚Äúbirthday-book‚Äù; dramatized Easter Egg Hunts; and to top it all: live inter-continental telephone call-in shows\\" The show also ran a pen pal club encouraging listeners across the world to write each other. The show was cut down from 80 minutes to 50 minutes in 1977, along with other RNW programming. In the 1990s, Happy Station was again shortened in order to accommodate a Radio Netherlands news bulletin at the start of the hour. Previously, Sundays were the only days on which RNW didn't broadcast news bulletins. =Later years= Tom Meijer was followed as host of the English version of the show by long-time BBC and Radio Netherlands broadcaster Pete Myers from 1992 to 1993 Myers was assigned with updating the show and bringing it into the 1990s. He played rock and roll music on the programme for the first time, upsetting some traditional listeners who wrote in with complaints. \\"I played Ray Charles and got dozens of complaints!\\" Myers said. \\"They said \\"Who IS this Ray Charles?\\"\\"World radio show wants to be hip as well as happy\\", By Sara Henley, Reuters News, 9 January 1994 \\"The old listeners want clogs, windmills, that kind of Dutch stuff. But right from my first programme I said \\"It's sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll from now on'. The young ones all want that from Holland...You choose your cliches really,\\" he added. Meyers also brought a camp style to the programme. Myers also travelled with the show, broadcasting its 65th anniversary from a hot tub in Aruba. He retired from the show after hosting over 100 episodes, ostensibly due to his need to take several months off in order to undergo and then recuperate from surgery, but also because he felt a younger host was needed in order to bring in the younger audience Radio Netherlands wanted. \\"I feel too old for it all,\\" said Myers in an interview, \\"I can't relate to the music.\\" Jonathan Groubert, who had often acted as Myers's sidekick, took over the show in 1993 and presented it for two years until 1995 when Radio Netherlands ended the series. Jaime B√°guena, hosted the Spanish version, La Estaci√≥n de la Alegr√≠a, from Tom Meijer's retirement in 1992 until 1999 when it was canceled by Radio Netherlands' management. The show was popular in Latin America, and had an active following in Cuba. La Estaci√≥n de la Alegr√≠a was replaced by a similar program, Cartas @ RN, which was hosted by Baguena but had a running time of 25 minutes instead of 55 minutes. Buguena was succeeded as the show's presenter by Sergio Acosta from 2010 until the show ended in June 2012 due to the closure of Radio Netherlands as a shortwave service. Revival On March 12, 2009, the program was resurrected as an independent broadcast produced by Taiwan-based PCJ Media via Radio Miami International (WRMI), which was also transmitted globally through podcasting and Internet streaming audio. The producer and presenter of this version is Canadian expatriate Keith Perron, who in the past had been employed or worked freelance for Radio Canada International, Radio Havana Cuba, China Radio International, Radio Netherlands, the BBC World Service and other shortwave broadcasters. The new programme is not produced in the Netherlands and has no involvement from Radio Netherlands Worldwide save that Perron had been given permission by RNW to use the Happy Station name. Tom Meijer, who hosted RNW's Happy Station in the 1970s and 1980s was involved as a consultant, and made occasional on-air contributions. Meijer's successor at RNW, Jonathan Groubert, also appeared as a guest on the revived show. The new production is produced in Taipei, Taiwan, Republic Of China, and an over-air version is been broadcast on shortwave from WRMI's transmitters in Okeechobee, Florida in the United States and intermittently on various other shortwave relays. The show continues as a weekly podcast and internet radio show as well as being syndicated to various FM and medium wave partner stations in 37 countries around the world.https://web.archive.org/web/20161104120259/http://pcjmedia.com/hs References External links *Happy Station - highlights of the Eddy Startz era *Happy Station Show - hosted by Tom Meijer - 16 November 1980 *Happy Station - final Pete Myers programme - 24 July 1994 *Happy Station - last show on Radio Netherlands - 17 September 1995 * Programme archives * Program of 31 December 2011: Keith Perron interviews Tom Meyer (mp3) * Eddy Startz & The Happy Station -DJ to the World‚Äôs Largest Happy Family * film clip of Startz's Happy Station in 1955.

Origins The term seems originally to have been a name which was given to any day or season of rejoicing. The hilaria were, therefore, according to Maximus the ConfessorMaximus the Confessor, Schol. ad Dionys. Areopag. Epist. 8 either private or public. Among the former, he thinks it the day on which a person married, and on which a son was born; among the latter, those days of public rejoicings appointed by a new emperor. Such days were devoted to general rejoicings and public sacrifices, and no one was allowed to show any symptoms of grief or sorrow. The Romans also celebrated hilaria as a feria stativa, on March 25, the seventh day before the Calends of April, in honor of Cybele, the mother of the gods; and it is probably to distinguish these hilaria from those mentioned above, that the Augustan HistoryAugustan History, \\"The Life of Severus Alexander\\", c37.6 calls them Hilaria Matris De√ªm. The day of its celebration was the first after the vernal equinox, or the first day of the year which was longer than the night. The winter with its gloom had died, and the first day of a better season was spent in rejoicings. The manner of its celebration during the time of the republic is unknown, except that Valerius MaximusValerius Maximus, Factorum et Dictorum Memorabilium ii.4 ¬ß3 mentions games in honour of the mother of the gods. Respecting its celebration at the time of the empire, Herodian writes that, among other things, there was a solemn procession, in which the statue of the goddess was carried, and before this statue were carried the most costly specimens of plate and works of art belonging either to wealthy Romans or to the emperors themselves. All kinds of games and amusements were allowed on this day; masquerades were the most prominent among them, and everyone might, in his disguise, imitate whomsoever he liked, even magistrates. The Romans took this feast originally from the Greeks, who called it ·ºàŒΩŒ¨Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπœÇ, Latin Ascensus: the eve of that day they spent in tears and lamentations, calling it ŒöŒ±œÑŒ¨Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπœÇ (Latin Dƒìscensus). Greek writers later borrowed the Latin name as ·ºπŒªŒ¨œÅŒπŒ±, as appears from Photios I of Constantinople's Bibliotheca in his codex of the life of the philosopher Isidore of Alexandria. Festival structure Sallustius, writing in the 4th century AD, described the basic multi-day structure of the festival as it related to the myth of Cybele and Attis: \\"And at first we ourselves, having fallen from heaven and living with the nymph, are in despondency, and abstain from corn and all rich and unclean food, for both are hostile to the soul. Then comes the cutting of the tree and the fast, as though we also were cutting off the further process of generation. After that the feeding on milk, as though we were being born again; after which come rejoicings and garlands and, as it were, a return up to the Gods.\\"Sallustius, ‚ÄúOn the Gods and the Cosmos‚Äù, 4th Century AD, accessed July 19, 2017,http://www.platonic- philosophy.org/files/Sallustius%20-%20On%20the%20Gods%20(Taylor).pdf According to the calendar in the Chronography of 354, ten days before the calends of April was the Arbor Intrat, or \\"entering of the tree\\". According to Arnobius, in his Against the Pagans (book V),Arnobius, Against the Pagans, Book V. this involved cutting down a pine tree and setting it up in a place of honor inside a temple of Cybele. Fleeces of wool would be tied around the tree trunk, representing the goddess wrapping the dying Attis against the cold. The branches would be decked in wreathes of violets, as \\"the Mother adorned with early flowers the pine which indicates and bears witness to the sad mishap.\\" The priests would ritually mourn for the dead Attis, beating their chests and wailing. Following this, according to Arnobius, worshipers would fast and, in particular, abstain from bread, \\"in imitation of the time when the goddess abstained from Ceres' fruit in her vehement sorrow\\", and they would enter a state of mourning, wounding their arms and breasts. The full festival can be tentatively reconstructed (with the days of the festival literally translated) as follows:R Turcan. 1996. The Cults of the Roman Empire. p44-47 * 15 March. \\"The Reed Entered\\". Its exact significance is uncertain (the reeds may refer to the river bank where Attis was exposed as a child and rescued by Cybele). A nine-day period of abstinence from bread, pomegranates, quinces, pork, fish, and probably wine began. Only milk was permitted as a drink.R Turcan. 1996. The Cults of the Roman Empire. p44. * 22 March. \\"The Tree Entered\\" (Arbor intrat). A pine tree is felled. The tree is set up at the Temple of Cybele, its trunk wrapped in wool, and its branches decked with wreathes of violets. * 23 March. A day of mourning. * 24 March. \\"The Day of Blood\\" (Sanguis).

On Roman Time: The Codex-Calendar of 354 and the Rhythms of Urban Life in Late Antiquity. pp. 170‚Äì172 On this day Herodian details an assassination plot by Maternus against Emperor Commodus that was to occur on the hilaria.Herodian, Roman History i.10.5-7 Maternus planned to disguise himself and his followers as members of the Praetorian Guard, and proceed among the true members of the Guard, until they were close enough to kill Commodus. However, one of Maternus's followers revealed the plot ahead of time, betraying him because, according to Herodian, his men \\"preferred a legitimate emperor to a robber tyrant\\". On the day of hilaria, he was beheaded and his followers punished. The public celebrated the emperor's safety, and Commodus sacrificed to Cybele for protecting him from harm.

It is bordered by the parishes of St Winnow to the north-west, Boconnoc to the north, Lanreath to the east Lansallos to the south-east and Lanteglos to the south. The River Fowey forms its western boundary. The parish is named after Saint Veep of whom little is known (not even whether the saint was male or female). Part of the village of Lerryn is in St Veep parish. The hamlets of Cliff (), Higher Penpol (), Middle Penpol and Lower Penpol () are all within the parish. History The parish church was originally dedicated to Saint Veep, but when it was rebuilt in 1336 it was rededicated to Saint Quiricus and Saint Julietta. Following the Prayer Book Rebellion of 1549, a number of well-known Cornish figures and priests were murdered or hanged in Cornwall. These included Richard Bennet, vicar of St Veep, under the direct orders of Anthony Kingston, Provost Marshal serving under King Edward VI.Philip Payton - (1996) \\"Cornwall\\", Fowey: Alexander Associates Valuable church silverware, which had been deposited with Lloyds Bank of St Austell and subsequently lost, was rediscovered in 2015 at a storage facility near Glasgow. Items included a communion cup (dated 1579), silver flagon tankard (1737) and a silver plate (1738). =St Cadix's Priory= A small cell or priory was built by the side of Penpol Creek, today the site is referred to as \\"St Cadix's Priory\\" but it has also appeared as St Ciric, St Carroc, St Cadokys, St Carrett and St Karroc. There is some uncertainty as to which saint the priory was dedicated to; either 6th-century Celtic Saint Cadoc or Cyricus son of Saint Julietta, who the parish church is dedicated to. Little remains of the priory today and a farmhouse was built on the site in 1710, but there are some remains of a crucifix and ecclesiastical stones dated at 1150 onwards. In 1100 the priory was granted to the Benedictine Cluniac Montacute Priory in Somerset by William, Count of Mortain. Before that a small cell or holy well had existed. It remained the priory's until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1536. For most of its time just one monk and prior lived there. Three priors are known: Robertus (1339), Wilhelmus Smythe (1385) and Laurence Castleton (1536). The cells' residents included Walter de Exeter who supposedly wrote a biography of Guy of Warwick in 1301. After dissolution the freehold of the site was granted to Laurence and Dorothy Courtenay on 3 September 1545. They leased it to the Cavells who leased it to Burchard Kranich a German silver smelter and adventurer. Kranich borrowed ¬£500 from Mary Tudor, ¬£150 from William Godolphin and more from several others to build a \\"melting house\\" in Lerryn which cost about ¬£300 to build. Later he was lent ¬£300 by Queen Elizabeth I, who ordered the repair of the bridge in Lerryn. Between 1556 and 1583 at least 2,000 ounces of silver were smelted with ore coming from mines in Tregardoke, Padstow, St Delion, Portysyke, Peran and St Columb.

The school was created in 1956 and serves approximately 2000 students in grades 9-12 in the Effingham County School District. The school mascot is the Rebel, and the school colors are red, navy, and white.  History  Effingham County High School was created in 1956 with the consolidation of Effingham County's smaller high schools. The campus was built just west of Springfield on Georgia Highway 119. A larger, more modern facility was opened in the fall of 1989 just west of the original campus. The old campus became Effingham County Middle School. In 2003, a new football stadium was built behind the current campus and the old Rebel Field (1961‚Äì2003) was dismantled. In August 2009, a new Effingham County Middle School opened just west of the current ECHS. The old ECMS/ECHS was closed and demolition of the oldest sections began in 2010. No decision has been made about the future of the academic areas of the building. The gymnasium is currently being occupied by the ECHS Competition Cheerleading Squad and the Effingham County Wrestling Team. The school has seen much growth over the years as Savannah and southeast Georgia continue to boom. The school grew to approximately 2000 students. A decision was made to split into two high schools, one that would serve the rapidly growing southern part of the county and the other (ECHS) that would continue serving the central and northern parts of the county. In 1996, South Effingham High School opened on Georgia Highway 30, just west of Rincon. To further serve the two campuses, a new Effingham Career Academy was built next to Savannah Technical College's Effingham Campus on Georgia Highway 21 at Ebenezer Road. On August 5, 2010, the Effingham Career Academy had their dedication ceremony. The Career Academy was built for both high schools' advanced level CTAE/vocational classes. The Career Academy had its first day of classes on August 9, 2010. A STEM Academy was added onto the Career Academy, offering qualifying students more rigorous courses. The first day of class was August 4, 2016.Effingham County School, 8/19/2010. http://www.effinghamschools.com/effinghamschools/cwp/view.asp?A=3&Q;=368336 In August 2007 Effingham County School District implemented a county-wide dress code. Every school in the district requires black, khaki, or navy pants. Girls are also allowed to wear skirts or shorts that reach up to four inches above the back of the knees. The color of shirt changes between schools; at Effingham County High, students may wear navy, white, or black polos with three buttons and no logo. Students may also wear school-sponsored navy and white T-shirts. If a student is in a club or plays a sport, he may wear those T-shirts on Fridays or game days.Effingham County School District Website, Student Handbook, 8/19/2010. http://www.effinghamschools.com/10651012199055223/lib/10651012199055223/Student_Handbook.pdf Campus The school is located in a rural area of central Effingham County, between Springfield and Guyton. The campus consists of a single school building and several portable classrooms. The approximate number of red bricks in the school is roughly 560,000. The number of white bricks in the school is about 36,000. Faculty and students have separate parking lots. The track encircles the large marching band practice field. Outdoor athletic facilities include softball, soccer, baseball, and football fields, and tennis courts. Faculty Approximately 180 faculty and staff members are employed at Effingham County High School. Principals: * Amie Dickerson (2018-Present) * Billy Hughes (2016‚Äì2018) * Yancy Ford (2006‚Äì2016) * John Arnold (2005‚Äì2006) * Randy Shearouse (2003‚Äì2005) * Dr. Paul M.

They compete in baseball, basketball, cheerleading (game and competition), cross country, fast-pitch softball, football, golf, soccer, tennis, track and field, volleyball, lacrosse, and wrestling. Effingham County High School's biggest rival since its opening is the cross-county South Effingham High School. Others have included Statesboro High School and Benedictine Military School. ECHS football was state runner-up in 1987. ECHS won the Traditional State Wrestling Title for AAAA in 2008-2009. The girls' golf team won back-to-back region championships in 2009 and 2010 under Coach Curtis Stevens. The cross country boys' team won the region title in fall 2009 and the girls were runners-up in fall 2009, all under Coach Mick Danielson. =Music= The Effingham County High Band consists of marching, wind ensemble, symphonic, and jazz bands which perform regularly throughout the year. The Rebel Regiment Marching Band has performed at various regional and national competitions, winning awards in several categories. The ECHS Bands are under the direction of Will Alford and Anthony Jones. Effingham County High's Choral Department consists of several choirs, including show choir, women's, and mixed ensembles. They consistently score superior ratings in state and nationally adjudicated events and have performed at Disney World. The director of Choral Activities is Wes Perkins.

This space is usually at the evolutionary center of the community and occupies an important place in its spatial hierarchy. These squares originated in the sixteenth century AD with the Portuguese conquest of Goa, which brought new planning concepts and substantially changed the meaning of the existing space. These squares have evolved over the years into a type of their own.  Principal public squares  Square in Curtorim Wherever churches exist in a Goan community‚Äîwhether urban or rural‚Äîthat has a predominantly Roman Catholic population, the commercial, residential, and administrative functions revolve around the church square, making the space around the church the principal public square. These squares have evolved as a fusion of the traditional systems of pre- Portuguese Goa and the design of squares developed in post‚Äìmedieval Europe prior to the colonization of Goa. =Public spaces in pre-Portuguese Goa and post-medieval Portugal= Until the advent of the Portuguese in AD 1510, public spaces in Goa consisted of market squares and sometimes temple squares. The Portuguese brought the well-defined concept of urban spaces. They did not alter the basic structure of Goan public spaces, but instead brought new planning concepts and substantially changed the meaning of the existing space. In pre-Portuguese Goa, the temple was often somewhat separated from the village, and since Hinduism requires private prayer, there was usually no open space in front or near the temple. The governing body for the village (the gavkari), of which temple priests were members, met at the temple, or next to it, often under a tree. The only public space in a village was the market, usually located away from the temple, as there fish and other \\"unholy\\" things were sold. In Portugal, however, a church was always an enclosed structure that opened frontally into an open church square surrounded by residences (one motivation for this was that no one could be arrested on church grounds), and governmental buildings, because of the church's connection to the politics of the day. Commercial activity also took place in the church square. In both places the public square was a place of education. In Portugal most teaching was carried out by the clergy. In Goa the Brahmin priests were the educated class, and they schooled children in the temple premises. = Public squares in Goa after the Portuguese conquest= Goan public squares are centrally located, at the intersection of roads coming from various parts of the village. The development of a public square typically progressed according to the following order: # The first element to appear was the church with its square, which the Portuguese tried to reproduce according to the European model. This was the main activity generator around which all the other subsequent functions appeared. # The Communidade (administrative building) was the next to appear. # The most prominent families started building their residences around the church square. # With the church also came the school, which was run by the clergy. # These functions, especially the religious, generated a lot of activity, resulting in the appearance of commercial activity (mainly the market). These spaces have evolved over the past 400 years into a unique style of their own, slowly becoming the most important public space for a community. It is the space that belongs to and is used by the entire community. Communities increased in scale and size, and, in the twentieth century, the administrative functions were displaced (as in the case of Marg√£o).  Scale  In the region of Salcette, the ratio of length to breadth of the church square varies from 2:3 in villages, to 2:5 in cities. The height to width ratio of 1:4 is a very pleasing scale, giving a sense of spatial enclosure. When the ratio gets larger, as in Curtorim (1:7), this sense of spatial enclosure is felt only at the edges of the square. Somewhat narrower squares, with length to breadth ratio of around 1:4, encourage public activity more readily than do than the wider squares. Linear spaces become circulation spaces: the closer the visual contact the greater the social contact.  Other architectural details Various types of openings and projections give a square character and variety. Doors, windows, and balconies opening into the square give it character while making it more accessible, thus encouraging its use for recreation. The squares therefore are vibrant places with a wide variety of colours. The church squares consist of compound walls, roads, piazza crosses, crosses, bandstands, and landscapes which all combine to define the space. The majority of church squares in Goa have not undergone a significant change in social meaning since the end of Portuguese rule. The principal commercial area is continuing to expand. Due to the increase in vehicle traffic, elements such as compound walls have appeared, segregating the church square from the remaining functions.

It was an online multiplayer spin-off of the Metal Gear video game series. The starter pack of Online was available worldwide bundled with Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, with a standalone release for Japan. The name Metal Gear Online is common with earlier online components for Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence and Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops. Metal Gear Onlines North American and European servers were shut down on June 12, 2012. Gameplay Metal Gear Online allowed up to 16 players to engage in online tactical warfare. Players create a character by choosing their name, gender (with the GENE Expansion), race and voice. Creating a new character requires the old to be deleted or an additional character slot to be purchased. Characters receive different performance indicators between official tournaments (grade) and regular matches (level). Both ranking systems encourage playing against higher ranked players and disfavor playing against players of equal or lower rank. Grades range from Rookie to SS+, and are influenced by performance in Survival and Tournament rounds. Levels range from 0 to 22 and fluctuate based on results in Statistics enabled battles. Statistics are recorded for each character, as well as a title, awards and match history. Based on these weekly and long term statistics, characters receive Animal Titles that denote their in-game behavior. For instance, frequently injecting enemies with the Scanning Plug will lead to the Bee rank, while using ENVG (Enhanced Night Vision Goggles) for a specific share of weekly play time grants the Night Owl rank. An inner rank hierarchy determines which of the acquired ranks will be active. Skills can be equipped, both manually and by registering a skill set, to enhance character abilities. They range from the straightforward, like Assault Rifle+ that decreases reload time and recoil, to more complex, like MŒønomania which effectively turns bullets into short-term tracking devices. Equipped skills level up when the character is involved in an action pertinent to the skill. Depending on their level, skills occupy from 1 to the maximum of 4 available skill slots. Clans, mutually exclusive groups of up to 64 characters, were also supported, uniting members under the clan name, emblem and reputation. The clan's leader chooses its emblem, decides over the inclusion of clan applicants, and needs to be at least level 3, with over 20 hours online play. As of May 27, 2009, 12 players per region are randomly assigned the Patriot rank for a week. Patriots can select the namesake hand rifle, with infinite ammo and no reloading, in all game rules except Stealth Deathmatch and Team Sneaking. =Rules of play= MGO provides several gameplay rules, fitting to both team based and solitary fighting styles. Every time you enter you must agree to the terms of the game. Deathmatch pits players against each other, competing for the highest score until the ever-decreasing kill counter or time reach zero. The player with the highest score is visible to others through SOP, and more when you kill. Stealth Deathmatch also pits players against each other, geared with stealth camo. A three level alarm informs players of enemy proximity. Eventually, the game area begins to constrict, leaving all outside it to suffer damage. There is no respawning, so the battle continues until one player is left alive, or until time runs out. Players receive extra points for surviving another's death. Team Deathmatch groups players into two teams, with each death decreasing the team's remaining tickets. The team to first deplete the other's tickets, or with more tickets when time runs out is the winner. Capture Mission has teams racing to capture and hold within their goal area assigned targets, KEROTAN and GA-KO, for a cumulative period of 30 seconds. With both items in one team's goal area, the timer runs twice as fast, whereas if they are divided among goal areas, the timer is reset for both teams. An extra time option can be enabled, which disables winning by time. Solo Capture Mission leaves each character to fend for themselves, while also trying to keep KEROTAN in their possession for a cumulative period of 60 seconds. The character who has hold of KEROTAN is visible to others through SOP. Rescue Mission premises the attacking team acquire GA-KO and place it in their goal area or at least hold onto it when time reaches zero, while the other team defends. As there is no respawning in this mode, a team also wins by killing all the enemy team's members. Base Mission is structured around capturing and defending small areas scattered across the map. A team wins by seizing all bases, or by having captured more bases than the enemy team when time runs out. Bases are captured by remaining within them for a period of time, and become spawn points for the capturing team. Contested bases can not be used as spawn points. Bomb mission asks of the attacking team to plant a time bomb on a designated area and ensure it detonates within a time limit. A limited cache of time bombs are scattered across the map, and only one can be held at a time. The defending team wins by averting detonation, or by nullifying all bombs. A planted bomb is removed when sprayed with coolant, while a dropped bomb is destroyed if it doesn't get picked up again in a set amount of time. Race Mission has each of two teams competing to deliver its target to a series of checkpoints. The Red Team's target is GA-KO, while the Blue Team's is KEROTAN. The target's position is reset, and the team's checkpoint changes if a target is dropped and not picked up within the allowed time limit. Team Sneaking demands from the attacking team, equipped with stealth camo, to bring either KEROTAN or GA-KO to their goal area, while the other team defends the items. Another win condition is to kill, stun, and (only for the attacking team) hold up all enemy team members. Whenever a stealth soldier is discovered, all stealth camo is temporarily rendered non operational. Drebin Points do not apply to this type of mission. Sneaking Mission features two opposing teams, Snake, and with at least 12 participants, Metal Gear Mk II. Snake wins by collecting, through body searches, three dogtags, with each life lost resetting the count to zero. Teams claim victory by killing Snake a set number of times, or by having scored more opposing team kills when time runs out. Drebin Points do not apply to this type of mission. Interval allows players to engage in battle with no repercussion to their statistics or skill leveling. A time bomb can be collected and passed around players to liven up the pace. Weapons and attachments do not cost Drebin Points. Non standard settings, that influence the battle's dynamic, are optional within some gameplay rules. Under the eponymous setting, players gain \\"Drebin Points\\" for actions such as kills and headshots, and can redeem them for advanced weapons, attachments and ammunition at their base or at respawn. Biding by \\"Headshots only\\", kills that aren't achieved through headshots cost the player their life and a time penalty before respawn, while in \\"Headshots Disabled\\" lobbies, a headshot's damage is reduced to that of other body parts. =SOP system= The SOP system, as within MGS4, is a fictional, nanomachine based network which ensures linked members share vital information. This data consists of speech, character's location, even behind walls, traps and aiming lines, changes in battle capacity (stun, sleep, death, distracted) and Snake's location when he's discovered. Characters gather information through combat, Scanning Plug injections, which hack into an enemy's SOP data pool, and SOP augmenting skills and weapons. A temporary SOP cease fire is optionally enforced upon injuring a teammate. =Stealth= A character's presence and movement in the battlefield are accompanied by visual and aural signs. The body and equipment's visual presence, shadows, gunfire, footsteps, frozen breath and upset dust or snow from movement are the sum of these indicators. Suppressing these signs while attacking and diagnosing them while defending are equally contributing factors to success. As such, any surface that obscures the field of vision, be it a wall, car or even cardboard box, can serve as a hiding spot and set up to an ambush. Playing dead suppresses breathing and can trick careless foes, with the downside of vulnerability. As a countermeasure, wary combatants approach corners carefully, inspect unconvincing cardboard boxes and check suspicious bodies. Stealth camouflage, available in Team Sneaking missions and Stealth Deathmatch, renders only the user's body transparent, leaving equipped gear visible. Snake's Octocamo and Facecamo, on the other hand, render him and his equipment invisible even to ENVG users, when fully capitalized. Neither technology prevents shadows, while both produce a distinct sound upon activation and deactivation. The knife is always visible even when not equipped. =Close Quarters Combat= CQC in-game action Close Quarters Combat is a military technique that consists of throws and holds, used to incapacitate an enemy while bare-handed, or to gain a tactical, rather than lethal, advantage when armed. All characters can wield basic forms of CQC, such as the three-hit combo, the take-down throw, or the CQC push, with a two-handed gun. Weapons that support CQC are marked as such in their item box. As CQC is a close proximity, one versus one technique, lone soldiers tend to avoid it when outnumbered. CQC enhancing skills increase stamina damage (from bare hand fighting and takedowns) and the speed of CQC actions. They also enable the choke-hold, which opens tactical options. With the target immobilized, the assailant can deplete the target's stamina, resulting in a knock out, force the enemy to the ground, or even release the enemy when fleeing is advised. Further actions become available by equipping weapons or skills, like planting C4 or a Sleeping Gas Satchel on the victim, throwing a grenade, using the foe as a human shield and firing at an impending threat (when armed with a handgun), slitting the enemy's throat (with Blades+3 CQC lvl 1 in use) or injecting a Scanning plug (only with it equipped). At CQC+ Lvl 3 a character can disarm the opponent through the choke-hold or the CQC push, while with the CQC EX skill players automatically counter CQC grabs (unless grabbed during a hold-up, from behind or from a player also with CQC EX). =Non-lethal weapons= Typical effects of non-lethal weaponry include stamina depletion, target immobilization and information manipulation. Support items are the most diverse in realizing these goals. Stun grenades, for instance, deplete the stamina of nearby opponents, but also cause temporary blindness and deafness to targets up to medium distance. Other examples include proximity and trigger activated sleepgas mines, e-locators that disclose the position of close by targets, chaff grenades to both limit visibility and temporarily obscure the SOP radar, and magazines that occupy a target, rendering them immobile. Non lethal fire-arms consist of the Mosin- Nagant sniper rifle, the Ruger Mk. 2 tranquilizer pistol, the VSS sniper rifle equipped with anesthetic rounds, and any shotgun equipped with Vortex Ring ammo. Headshots from the Mosin-Nagant, VSS, and Ruger Mk. 2 tranquilize instantly, irrespective of target distance. Stunned characters can be body searched for their primary weapon and support items, killed by the enemy to grant even more Drebin Points, or woken up to return to battle. Stunning offers many advantages to simply killing the enemy. A stunned enemy will typically take significantly longer to awake then he would to respawn after being killed, and he does not gain the advantage of having his health and ammo supply regenerated as would happen upon respawning. In addition, his teammates will often divert manpower to attempt to rescue the knocked out player, giving the other team an advantage. The most formidable non lethal weapon is the SOP destabilizer, only available in Base missions. By temporarily suppressing the nanomachines regulating enemies' behavior, the SOP destabilizer renders all alive enemy team members immobile. The attacking team can then overtake bases without competition while stunning or killing helpless foes. Its main drawbacks are that it leaves the bearer without a primary weapon, and requires a trip from his team's base to the enemy's. Reward points and customization Players are free to edit their character's appearance. Gaining an Animal Title grants the character its corresponding T-shirt. Additional clothing, camouflage and color customizations are available in the Reward shop via Reward points, a form of in-game currency. Armor and other clothing bought in the Reward Shop will have no effect on how your character takes damage in the game. Survival matches grant combatants Reward points based on their win streak of matches, not individual rounds. These matches are open to all players, and players who have installed an expansion are granted entrance to the corresponding Survival lobbies. Tournament matches, only open to players with the DW expansion,SCENE expansion, MEME expansion and GENE expansion, and allot reward points based on each team's final standing, while also granting the ultimate winners gear not available in the Reward shop. Both Survival and Tournament matches are held at times predefined by Konami, and follow specific rules. Logging a character in grants 50 reward points per day (100 on Wednesdays). For the Japanese version logging in is 100 reward points per day and 200 on Wednesday. Completing a round (win or lose), in an Automatching lobby grants the player 20 reward points. During prize matches (Random Automatching events) the winners of the match will receive an extra 200 points (In addition to the 40 reward points gained from playing two rounds) while the losers will receive the regular 40 points. Development Metal Gear Online was region locked, meaning that players must be in the same video game publication territory to play together. Region restriction reduces lag, yet can be disadvantageous for the Region 1 and Region 3, designated for American and Asian players, respectively. Konami required the bearer of the PSN account linked to Metal Gear Online be at least 18 years old. Sony Customer Services could be contacted to lift this restriction in regions where MGS4 has lower age requirements. An online beta test was available in Japan, Europe and North America. 3,000 players were allowed into the Japanese beta test from August 20 to September 3, 2007. The beta test for North America (serial key only) and Europe (no restrictions) lasted from April 25 to May 11, 2008. On March 14, 2011 Konami shut down Metal Gear Onlines Japanese servers indefinitely in order to conserve power after the Japanese 2011 earthquake. =Expansion packs= Beyond the initial content available with the Startup pack, new features, such as characters and maps, are added through expansion packs. These could be purchased via PSN. Some of the maps are remakes of areas of other Metal Gear games. MGS3 featured Groznyj Grad while MGS3: Subsistence's MGO featured City Under Siege and Brown Town, reinterpreted as Urban Ultimatum and Coppertown Conflict, respectively. MGS: Portable Ops included Silo entrance, which became Silo Sunset, and locations in MGS4 spurred Midtown Maelstrom, Virtuous Vista and Icebound Inferno. Forest Firefight and Ravaged Riverfront are also loosely based on the forest area in MGS3 and the Eastern Europe area in MGS4. Startup pack The Startup Pack includes 5 maps, namely Ambush Alley, Blood Bath, Groznyj Grad, Midtown Maelstrom, and Urban Ultimatum. It also allows players to assume the role of characters from MGS4's plotline, bearing fixed skill-sets beyond the numerical limitations of ordinary soldiers'. The Startup pack offers two playable special characters, available in Sneaking missions: Solid Snake, the Legendary Hero, is equipped with CQC EX (Which Knocks out the enemy Instantly) and a diverse armament of lethal and non-lethal weapons. Apart from his FaceCamo and OctoCamo, the Threat Ring indicates the location of nearby characters. Also when you start as Snake he is equipped with the drum can which normally needs to be found on the map. The Solid Eye provides a visualization of the same data through the Baseline Map, identifies items and can switch to Night Vision or Binocular mode. He shouts out Liquids' name when he engages in combat with him. He is the only character in MGO with pro skills. When you have not bought any of the expansion packs, you can only use Snake in sneaking missions. Metal Gear Mk. II, the Invisible Buddy, can back up Snake on the field. The Mark II is equipped with stealth camo and can display a magazine on its viewscreen to captivate the interest of nearby characters. It communicates with Snake using the character voice of Otacon from MGS4. It can also use its manipulator to electroshock enemies, collect and deliver dogtags to Snake, disarm mechanical traps, and knock on walls. If the Mark II's life gauge is depleted by enemy fire, it will self-repair over time. GENE expansion The GENE expansion pack was released on July 17, 2008. The Plus version, with an additional character slot was discontinued in Japan on November 18, 2008. Players who install the expansion can create female characters and enter the GENE specific Survival lobby. They can also compete in three new maps, Virtuous Vista, Coppertown Conflict, and Tomb of Tubes and enter battle as two special characters: * Johnny (Akiba), a Trap Otaku, can see all traps on the field, and disarm mechanical traps into items. Three consecutive kills stir up his chronic incontinence, resulting in a comical cloud of foul smell that can preoccupy foes and allies. When injuring a teammate, he leaves himself vulnerable while making excuses. Johnny can't use any form of CQC but the 3 hit combo, and he has no SOP enabling nanomachines, which restricts him from the advantages of information garnered through his teams SOP network but has the positive effect of making him immune to the negative effects of SOP such as Ocelots Guns of the Patriots weapon or SOP Destabs. His unique weapons include the XM8 Compact and the M82A2 Sniper Rifle, which kills with 1 shot from any range. * Meryl, the Fiery Leader, allows nearby allies to recuperate stamina faster when saluting near them. She has CQC+ Level 2, accompanied by a slew of level 3 skills, including Monomania, Narc, Scanner, Quick Recovery, and Handgun+. Her special weapon is a scope-equipped Desert Eagle Long Barrel. With the Desert Eagle handgun, the ammo from the scope and non-scope desert eagle is pooled together. Meryl can fire both guns without reloading. Both Meryl and Johnny cry out when their other half is killed in combat. MEME expansion The MEME expansion pack was released on November 25, 2008. The GENE expansion is a prerequisite to installing MEME, and a combo pack is also available. Players who install the expansion can compete in MEME Survival lobbies and purchase MEME specific camouflage gear. They can also experience three more maps, namely Silo Sunset, Forest Firefight, and Winter Warehouse and engage in combat as two special characters: * Mei Ling, the Remote Captain, can command the USS Missouri to cannon strike any location within visible range. Her true skills are as a recon soldier, since her Soliton Sonar radar reveals the position of close by enemies (through SOP). Mei Ling can't use CQC, other than the 3 hit combo, but is equipped with the Scanner EX skill. Her salute entrances all soldiers in a small area. * Liquid Ocelot, Guns of the Patriots, can use the namesake weapon to temporarily effect upon enemies an SOP safety lock, or a seizure, by disabling the nanomachines controlling their behavior. Much like Snake, he is equipped with CQC EX, while his three-hit combo can end in either a strong punch or a headbutt. He can shock his opponent with the Stun Knife during a choke hold, instantly knocking out the opponent. The Thor .45-70 handgun, his unique weapon, requires reload after every bullet fired but deals lethal damage within medium range. He shouts out his nemesis' name when he spots Snake and exclaims the phrase 'You're pretty good!' when shot in the head. If Liquid is killed and does not respawn when the time runs out in any mode that allows respawns, he resets the match's timer, which can change the outcome of the game, but can be done only once in a game. SCENE expansion The SCENE expansion pack was released on March 17, 2009. The MEME expansion is a prerequisite to installing SCENE, and bundle packs with older expansions are available. After purchasing the expansion, players can compete in Tournaments, wear SCENE specific camo gear, fight in Outer Outlet, Hazard House, Ravaged Riverfront and Icebound Inferno. Old Snake can now be used in any game type that has Special Characters enabled, or the player can select from two new special characters: * Raiden, the White-blooded Scout, can fall from any height without damage and jump on ledges that would normally require a boost, and has no nanomachines. He handles a High Frequency Blade, operable in lethal and non-lethal mode, which allows him to deflect frontal attacks. His other unique weapons are the Mk.23 pistol and the Throwing Knife. When his Visor is closed, he can see all traps in the map. Instead of the usual CQC three-hit combo, he will instead start a spin kick which will continue as long as the user keeps tapping R1. When pressing the jump back button, Raiden, will do backwards handstands instead of jumping backwards (Raiden can get shot during these back handstands). He is also equipped with CQC 2 and a throat-slitting ability, along with a running ability higher than runner 3. (Equal to Runner 3 as of version 1.36) * Vamp, the Undead Blade, can fall from any height without damage and jump on ledges that would normally require a boost. He is an expert at using the Combat Knife and Throwing Knives. On his normal R1 CQC Combo, his third attack is replaced with an axe kick. Pressing the side roll button will make Vamp move swiftly to the right/left (depending on which way you are making him move) which avoids all bullets. Pressing the jump back button, will make Vamp swiftly move backwards, however, this move does not avoid bullets. Upon dying, he is resurrected on the spot after a few seconds. His Throwing Knives home in on an enemies chest if locked on with Auto Aim. He is also equipped with CQC 2 and a throat-slitting ability, along with a running ability higher than runner 3. (Equal to Runner 3 as of version 1.36) =Cheating and distributed denial of service attacks= Metal Gear Online has been plagued by several methods of cheating, including lag-switching and exploiting glitches. It has also been the target of frequent DDoS attacks, starting from 2011 and lasting until service termination. When the attacks first started, the targets were primarily the players of the opposing team in a competitive match. Attackers disconnected these players either to win the match by default or to gain an advantage. Konami silently addressed this by masking IPs of players in official modes. However, attackers instead targeted the servers themselves. These attacks typically resulted in higher-than-average lag while navigating the in-game menus, and/or the disconnection of players who were online. Because of the nature of these attacks, it is difficult to effectively report the perpetrators. On August 31, Konami issued a statement assuring players that any persons violating the codes of conduct will be banned from service. Although banning perpetrators kept them off the game, the server attacks could still be carried out. Up until its shutdown, these attacks had not ceased. =Termination of service= On February 14, 2012, Konami announced via their website and in-game client that all Metal Gear Online services will be, and has been terminated on June 12, 2012. The announcement detailed cancellations of various services up to June 12 including the closure of the online store and that all expansion packs will be free of charge from April 24, 2012 onward. The game servers originally had a contract for three years, however the service was extended an additional year before termination, for a total of four years of service. As of the 2.00 patch issued on June 8, 2012, the Metal Gear Online game data and menu option was permanently removed from the game. Competitions Konami organized regional and worldwide competitions periodically. Notable examples include the MGO World Championship 2008. and the MGO Anniversary Tournament. =2010 European championship = Entrants were selected on a first come, first served basis. In the first round of the tournament finals, eight preliminary groups of eight teams competed in a knock-out style tournament in which only one team could proceed to the next round. These eight winning teams advanced to a final knock-out stage, held on the March 7, 2010, where a best-of-three format was adopted. To The Max defeated PBO in the grand finals, and Peace Of Mind defeated PotentiaL in the third place play-off. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd placed teams received an MGS4 Edition Astro Audio System, Astro Gamer-Backpack \\"Scout\\", and Astro Gamer- Tasche \\"Mission\\", respectively. There was controversy when one of the event players by the name of \\"REDWINGS\\" took part in the tournament but cheated in order to win the prize. Many EU players have said he is the reason there hasn't been any tournaments since EC 2010 as he wasn't the only person to play unfairly.

The bread is oval or rectangular and baked in a tandoor, a cylindrical oven that is the primary cooking equipment of the sub-continental region. The Afghan version of the tandoor sits above ground and is made of bricks, which are heated to cook the bread. The bread, also known as naan, is shaped and then stuck to the interior wall of the oven to bake. It is similar to the Naan in KPK, Pakistan. Black cumin or caraway seeds are often sprinkled on the bread, as much for decoration as for taste, and lengthwise lines are scored in the dough to add texture to the bread. Afghan bread is commonly stocked at Middle Eastern grocery stores in Western countries. In Afghanistan the baker still cooks the bread the traditional way by spreading the dough around the tandoor, so that it quickly puffs up and starts to colour and emit a fresh bread smell that draws the early morning throngs of people. The baker then uses two long iron tongs to pull the bread from the tandoor wall. Afghans carry the bread in cloth bags. Similar to the practice in Arab countries, bread is served with most meals and is generally torn into shreds and used by those eating to envelope foods, so that they can be picked up and conveyed to the mouth, in a manner similar to a sandwich, and also to soak up liquids on the plate. Since people in Afghanistan normally use their hands to eat, the bread thus acts as a utensil; as compared to Western culinary standards, something akin to both a fork and a spoon. The bread tastes similar to the Armenian lavash bread, as well as to Iranian barbari bread. It has a dense and rich taste.

Interpretation  The number that is typically measured is called the peak gain at zero degrees viewing axis, and represents the gain value for a viewer seated along a line perpendicular to the screen's viewing surface. The gain value represents the ratio of brightness of the screen relative to a set standard (in this case, a sheet of magnesium carbonate). Screens with a higher brightness than this standard are rated with a gain higher than 1.0, while screens with lower brightness are rated from 0.0 to 1.0. Since a projection screen is designed to scatter the impinging light back to the viewers, the scattering can either be highly diffuse or highly concentrated. Highly concentrated scatter results in a higher screen gain (a brighter image) at the cost of a more limited viewing angle (as measured by the half-gain viewing angle), whereas highly diffuse scattering results in lower screen gain (a dimmer image) with the benefit of a wider viewing angle.

The Bank of United States, founded by Joseph S. Marcus in 1913 at 77 Delancey Street in New York City, was a New York City bank that failed in 1931. The bank run on its Bronx branch is said to have started the collapse of banking during the Great Depression. Formation The Bank of United States was chartered on June 23, 1913 with a capital of $100,000 and a surplus of $50,000. The bank was founded by Joseph S. Marcus, a former president of the Public Bank, also of Delancey Street. Marcus, who was responsible for the building up of Public Bank, started the new bank, with the backing of several well-known financiers, because of a disagreement with other members of the management. Though the directors of Public Bank objected to the choice of name, arguing that \\"ignorant foreigners would believe that the United States government was interested in this bank and that it was a branch of the United States Treasury in Washington\\", the name was approved and the bank came into being. The use of such an appellation was outlawed in 1926 but did not apply retroactively. The founder, Joseph S. Marcus, was a Jewish immigrant to the United States. Born in the town of Telz in Germany in 1862, he went to school in Essen and immigrated to the United States at the age of 17 and worked his way up from being a tailor, to a garment industry business, to a banker. He founded the Public Bank in 1906 and the Bank of United States in 1913. He died on July 3, 1927. He was also a philanthropist known for his donations to the Beth Israel Hospital and for the Hebrew Association for the Blind. His son, Bernard K. Marcus, a graduate of Worcester Academy and Columbia University, joined the bank as cashier in 1913 and became vice president in 1918. Growth The bank grew slowly, with only five branches by 1925. However, after the death of the founder, his son, Bernard Marcus who had been running the bank since 1919 grew the bank rapidly through a series of mergers until it had 62 branches by 1930. In April 1928, it merged with the Central Mercantile Bank and Trust Company with Bernard Marcus as the President. In August 1928, it absorbed the Cosmopolitan Bank. In April 1929, it absorbed the Colonial Bank and the Bank of the Rockaways. In May 1929, it merged with the Municipal Bank and Trust Company making the combined Bank of United States the third largest bank in New York City, and twenty-eighth in the United States. With a book value of $60 and a dividend payment of $2 for 1929, the president of the bank declared the bank to be on a sound footing in a letter to shareholders following the stock market failure on Black Tuesday. In mid-1930, four leading New York banks-Manufacturers Trust Company, Public National Bank and Trust Company, International Bank and Trust Company, and the Bank of United States-began talks to merge and, on November 24, 1930, announced that they had agreed to form a mega-bank headed by J. Herbert Case, the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. On 8 December 1930, unable to agree on merger terms, the plan was dropped, because, it later emerged, of difficulties in guaranteeing the deposits of Bank of United States, because of complications arising from the legal difficulties of the bank, and because of real estate mortgages and loans held by subsidiaries of the bank. Two days later, there was a run on a Bronx branch of the bank. Failure Bid price for the Bank of United States. Quarter ends 1928‚Äì1930 + Dec. 11th and 12th 1930 On December 10, 1930, a large crowd gathered at the Southern Boulevard branch in the Bronx seeking to withdraw their money, and started what is usually considered the bank run that started the Great Depression (though there had already been a wave of bank runs in the southeastern part of the U.S., at least as early as November 1930). The New York Times reported that the run was based on a false rumor spread by a small local merchant, a holder of stock in the bank, who claimed that the bank had refused to sell his stock. By the midday, a crowd of 20,000 to 25,000 people had gathered and had to be controlled by the police, and by the end of the day 2,500 to 3,000 depositors had withdrawn $2,000,000 from the branch. However, most of the 7,000 depositors who came to withdraw their money left their assets in the bank. One person stood in line for two hours to claim his $2 account balance. As the news spread, there were smaller runs at several other branches in the Bronx as well as in the East New York section of Brooklyn. The next day, fearing a run on the bank, the directors decided to close the bank and asked the Superintendent of Banks to take over the bank's assets. The stock market reacted negatively with the stock price of the bank, which had traded as high as $91.50 during the year (and a lifetime high of $231.25 in 1928) dropping from $11.50 to $3.00 (with a low of $2.00). Most other bank stocks also sold off. The directors of the bank as well as of other New York banks were optimistic that the bank would reopen in a few weeks and members of the New York Clearing House Association offered to lend Bank of United States depositors 50% of their deposits. At the same time, the office of the New York State Bureau of Securities announced that they had been investigating charges that the Bank of United States had sold stock to depositors under a one-year guarantee against loss that they had not been honoring. The District Attorney's office undertook to examine the bank for possible crimes. Depositors thronged the bank branches but were turned away by mounted police. The Mayor of New York, Jimmy Walker, began legal action to recover $1.5 million which the city had in the bank. The New York Times reported that gross deposits in the bank had dropped from $212 million to $160 million between 17 October 1930 and 11 December 1930. The closing of Bank of United States came as a shock to the banking industry, which had not seen a failure of a large New York bank since the stock market crash of 1929, and the first failure of such magnitude since the failure of the Knickerbocker Trust Company in 1907. Worried city and state officials tried to reassure the public by rushing through the program by which Bank of United States depositors could borrow money against their deposits. Some depositors started to receive their loans on 23 December 1930 and The New York Times reported that throngs of depositors lined up to receive their loans, many arriving hours before the branches opened and many were turned away because they could not be served by the end of the day. Aftermath Soon after the closing of the Bank of United States, another bank, the Chelsea Bank, was taken over by the state banking superintendent, Joseph A. Broderick, amidst allegations attributed to \\"reliable sources\\" that the Communist Party of America was actively trying to create a run on the bank (the Soviet Union was also accused of financing short sellers). Meanwhile, a $50 million stockholder suit was launched against the directors of the bank on the grounds of negligence and incompetence, a woman with deposits of $20,000 in the bank hanged herself, and the Equity Casualty and Surety Company, which had invested more than $1 million in Bank of United States stock, declared bankruptcy. Among the 608 banks that closed in November and December 1930, the Bank of United States accounted for a third of the total $550 million deposits lost and, it is thought, that with its closure, bank failures reached a critical mass. People flocked to withdraw their money from other banks. In turn, the banks called in loans and sold assets in order to stay liquid. In that month alone, over 300 banks around the country failed.

The order to show cause is a rule nisi, and if prohibition is granted, the rule is made absolute. is a High Court of Australia constitutional law case that involves the scope of the intergovernmental immunity doctrine in Australian constitutional law. In the case, the High Court struck down a Commonwealth law on the grounds that it impaired the capacity of a state to function as an independent government, the first time that the Court has taken such action. Background Under a Commonwealth law, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission can refrain from hearing a dispute if it thought it could be handled in a state body. However, Victoria argued that the law was discriminatory because Victoria had abolished its state-based system, the only state to have done so. Furthermore, there was the question of whether Commonwealth orders that applied to state employees would prevent the state from exercising their essential functions. Judgment In a joint judgment, the Court accepted the tests of discrimination and structural integrity as laid down in Melbourne Corporation v Commonwealth. In this case, no discrimination was found, but the court found that the law affected the structural integrity of the state. As for discrimination, there were two issues to consider. Firstly, even though the purpose of the law was to discriminate against Victoria, that is not a factor to consider. Secondly, in its practical effect, it could apply to any state, as well as to any industrial employees. As for the structural integrity argument, it is required that the law directs attention to aspects of a state's functions that are \\"critical to its capacity to function\\". Being able to determine minimum wages and working conditions of its employees, especially those in the higher levels of government, is critical to a state's capacity to function.

VOX files are most commonly found in telephony applications, as well as an occasional arcade redemption game. It uses a lossy compression algorithm, optimized for voice, not high fidelity. Similar to other ADPCM (Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation) formats, Dialogic ADPCM compresses audio data into a series of 4-bit samples. The original Dialogic ADPCM paper (linked to below) does not specify or mention a recording or playback frequency; it may be at the implementer discretion. However, traditionally, files commonly have a sampling rate of 6000 or 8000 samples per second, but 8000 samples per second (8000 Hz) is more common. 8000 Hz matches the sampling rate used in G.711 voice systems such as DS1. Unlike a WAV file, a VOX file does not contain a header to specify the encoding format or the sampling rate, so this information must be known in order to play the file. If not known, it is normally assumed that a VOX file is encoded with Dialogic ADPCM at a sampling rate of 8000 Hz. It is possible that a VOX file may be encoded in a format other than Dialogic ADPCM, but this is not common. Dialogic ADPCM is an open file format. It matches ITU-T standard G.721, later superseded by G.726. The algorithm for Dialogic ADPCM was developed by Oki Electric, which also produced ICs such as the Oki Semiconductor MSM7580 to implement the algorithm in hardware. These ICs were used on popular telephony interface cards manufactured by Dialogic Corporation for use in voicemail and similar systems. As this was the most common use for the file format, it became known as \\"Dialogic ADPCM.\\" Some early BlackBerry phones that don't support MP3 format (e.g. 7100) used that codec for sound files which had ADP filetype extension. These must be of max filesize of 128 Kbytes or less. ADP filetype extension were being just renamed VOX filetype extension. The AD4 extension is also used for files compressed using \\"Dialogic ADPCM\\" with a sample rate of 36000Hz. This means that .ad4 files can be decoded if imported as VOX ADPCM with a sample rate set to 36kHz on software that allows such settings, like eg. Audacity.

Background Queensland passed legislation regarding sex offenders, allowing the Supreme Court of Queensland to continually detain a particular class of prisoner to protect the community. In the event that a prisoner was about to be released, the Attorney-General could request continuing detention. The Act required that the prisoner be serving a sentence of serious sexual offence (involving violence or against children). Fardon was such a prisoner who was convicted in 1989 of offences of rape, sodomy and assault, and was due to be released in June 2003. The Attorney-General applied for an order on 17 June 2003, which was granted on 27 June, but not finalised until November of that year. Fardon was hence detained after his prison sentence had expired. Fardon argued the legislation conferred judicial power to the Legislature through amendments passed in \\"The Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act 2003\\" (per Kable). Decision A majority (Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ) of the High Court that heard this constitutional argument found the law valid. They held that a higher onus of proof on the Attorney-General was required in this case than the one in Kable i.e. high cogent evidence that the prisoner is a danger to the community. There was nothing in the Queensland Act, which might lead a reasonable person to believe that a resident of Queensland would perceive the court to be a non-partial tribunal. The Act was to protect the community rather than to punish an individual. The ordering of a detention order was valid within the exercise of judicial power. The court held that courts in general should be vigilant that the continual detention provisions were not extended for arbitrary periods. Gummow J noted that the detention orders were compatible with federal judicial power. In dissent, Kirby J thought the law was invalid. He looked to the substance of the law rather than intention. It was evidently a punitive law, offending the principles of double jeopardy and retrospective punishment.  Subsequent developments  The Supreme Court of Queensland indicated in September 2006 that Fardon should be released,Attorney-General for the State of Queensland v Fardon (2006) QSC 336 and later ordered his release, imposing strict conditions for ongoing supervision until 2016.Attorney-General for the State of Queensland v Fardon (2006) QSC 336 Fardon was due for release on 9 November 2006, but the Queensland Government immediately appealed the decision.

The second, but first surviving, son of Henry Bankes MP, he was a member of the Bankes family of Dorset and he had Sir Charles Barry recase Kingston Lacy in stone as it is today. He travelled extensively to the Near East and Egypt and made an extensive individual collection of Egyptian artefacts.Warren R. Dawson and Eric P. Uphill, Who Was Who in Egyptology, 1972, s.v. \\"Bankes, William John\\". His work on Egypt although not acknowledged until recently is vastly important. He was a good friend of Lord Byron, Samuel Rogers and Sir Charles Barry. He also served as Tory Member of Parliament (MP) for Truro in 1810, for Cambridge University from 1822 to 1826, for Marlborough (the UK parliamentary constituency that his maternal grandfather, William Woodley, for whom he was named, had held from 1780 to 1784) from 1829 to 1832 and finally for Dorset from 1832 to 1835. Education, adventures and friends Kingston Lacy House - the Bankes family seat William Bankes became interested with exploration and discovery and had an evident passion for ancient Egypt and fine art. His massive portfolio of notes, manuscripts and drawings produced and collected during his travels along the Nile with explorations in Egypt, Nubia, and the Near East with Giovanni Finati, whose memoirs he translated, Narrative of the life and adventures of Giovanni Finati, native of Ferrara: who, under the assumed name of Mahomet, made the campaigns against the Wahabees, for the Recovery of Mecca and Medina, 1830. have significant historical value and provide the only historical record of some inscriptions and monuments. He published his Travels in the East Bankes was an educated and affluent man, though at times somewhat mischievous and boisterous. He was born in 1786 to Frances Woodley (b. 1760 d. 1823) and Henry Bankes, MP, of Kingston Lacy and Corfe Castle in Dorset. Frances was the eldest daughter of William Woodley (MP for Great Bedwin and Marlborough), Governor and Captain-General of the Leeward Islands (1766‚Äì1771 and 1791‚Äì1793), and his wife Frances Payne of St Kitts. William's aunt was Maria Banks (Woodley) Riddell, a well-known poet, who was known to be the chief benefactor of the Scottish poet Robert Burns. William's sister, Anne Francis Bankes married Edward Boscawen, 1st Earl of Falmouth in 1810. In 1841, on the death of her husband, Lady Falmouth returned to reside at Kingston Lacey. It was Lady Falmouth, in the absence of her brother, who was responsible for the ongoing re-decoration of Kingston Lacy which had been commenced by her mother Francis (Woodley) Bankes. He was the second of five children and the eldest surviving son. Bankes was educated at Westminster School and continued his studies at Trinity College, Cambridge where he received his BA in 1808 and his MA in 1811. Lord Byron, a fellow student at Trinity College, became Bankes' lifelong friend. Bankes sometimes accompanied Byron in his European tours. Bankes inherited Soughton Hall in Flintshire, Wales from his great uncle, and in 1835 inherited his family's home, Kingston Lacy. The mansion was home to Bankes for many years and still houses his vast collections of art and artefacts. Sir Charles Barry, a renowned architect in his day, was also a long-term friend of Bankes. The two men met in 1819 at the temple of Rameses in Abu Simbel, where Bankes made drawings and arranged for the transport of the bilingual obelisk from Philae that may be seen in the gardens of Kingston Lacy today.Who Was Who in Egyptology. Bankes had great respect for Barry's talents and Barry accomplished much of the building work on the Bankes' family properties over the years. Barry is well known for his architectural talents which were applied to the Palace of Westminster, St. Peter's Church in Brighton, the Victoria Tower and the Westminster Bridge. His work was inspired by Italian Renaissance type architecture and indeed contributed to the improved design of Bankes' home, Kingston Lacy. While travelling in Spain and Portugal during the Peninsular War, Bankes served as aide-de-camp to the Duke of Wellington. The Duke later came to Bankes' rescue when he was on trial for his imprudent lifestyle. The Duke of Wellington also celebrated Bankes' successes; in fact, he performed the ceremony at Kingston Lacy when the foundation was laid for one of Bankes' most notable discoveries, the Philae obelisk. The obelisk is now viewable in the National Trust grounds of Kingston Lacy. Bankes was an adventurous man with many talents. He was an amateur architect, a careful epigrapher and he mastered the art of copying ancient inscriptions. He was very interested in Egypt and, though he was an opponent of Champollion, in deciphering ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs. Bankes dabbled in architecture and with the assistance of his friend Charles Barry, transformed Kingston Lacy encasing the brick structure with stone. He collected numerous Spanish paintings, by Murillo and others, as well as artefacts from Ancient Egypt which are still housed at the house. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in March 1822. Exile Bankes was eventually exiled from his home in England in 1841 due to homosexual indiscretions which led him to flee, thus becoming an outlaw, seeking refuge after being caught in compromising circumstances with a guardsman in Green Park in London. At the time, sodomy was a grave crime in England and carried with it the death penalty ‚Äì the last executions in England for sodomy had occurred only six years earlier, in 1835. To avoid seizure of his house by the crown, he signed Kingston Lacy over to his brother. Even though he was unable to return to Kingston Lacy, he continued to collect from abroad, sending his collections to be displayed in his beloved home. It is believed that he secretly visited Kingston Lacy to admire his home and collections before his death in Venice. He was buried in the family vault in Wimborne Minster.

As a corporation, the Council will remain intact until a variety of business items, including the sale of camp properties, is complete.  Organization  Central New Jersey Council had four active districts. The Joyce Kilmer District served the Milltown area. The Mattameechen District covered the areas of South River, Edison, Metuchen, East Brunswick, Old Bridge, Spotswood and the Raritan Bay area. Pahaquarra District covered Hunterdon and Warren Counties. Finally, the Mercer Area District covered all of Mercer County and part of Somerset County. These districts combined contained nearly two hundred units, including Boy Scout troops, Cub Scout packs and Venturing crews.  History  Central New Jersey Council was officially chartered on January 1, 1999 after the merger of the former George Washington and Thomas A. Edison Councils. After the chartering, the council adopted two main camps, the first being Yards Creek Scout Reservation from the George Washington Council and the second being Kittatinny Mountain Scout Reservation from the Thomas A. Edison Council. Kittatinny was and is being used for summer camping and year-round short-term camping, whereas Yards Creek is used for short-term camping. In 1999, the council sold the Edison, New Jersey office from the Thomas A. Edison Council and temporarily headquartered itself in Pennington, New Jersey until the renovation of a combined office on Route 1 in Monmouth Junction, New Jersey was completed on June 12, 1999. The council moved to new offices at 2245 US Highway 130, Suite 106, in Dayton, NJ in November 2008. The council initially started operations with six internal districts, each of the two former council-areas having three districts. The Hunterdon Arrowhead, Jenny Jump and Mercer Area Districts were moved from George Washington Council and were essentially kept the same, although the districts from the former Thomas A. Edison Council were re-organized into the Joyce Kilmer, Raritan Bay and SEMEOS Districts. In 2008, the Hunterdon Arrowhead and Jenny Jump Districts merged to form the Pahaquarra District, bringing the total number of districts to five. In 2010, the SEMEOS and Raritan Bay Districts merged to form the Mattameechen District, bringing the total number of districts to four. In November 2013, the council board, citing low corporate donations leading to a fiscal crisis for the council amongst other factors, voted to dissolve the Central New Jersey Council. As of January 1, 2014, all the units which are served by the Central New Jersey Council were moved into neighboring councils in order to continue serving the boys in their respective communities. Pahaquarra District was bifurcated along county lines. Units from Pahaquarra District located in Warren County were transferred to Minsi Trails Council's Forks of the Delaware District. Units of Pahaquarra District located in Hunterdon County were regrouped under the previous name of the Hunterdon Arrowhead District, assigned to Bucks County (PA) Council. On February 6, 2014, the Executive Board of the Central New Jersey Council met to discuss the issue of assigning to neighboring councils the remaining territory of CNJC not already transferred. They approved the proposal of remaining CNJC units in Middlesex County (Mattameechen and Joyce Kilmer Districts) to be transferred based on the following: Scouting units North of the Raritan River were transferred to Patriots' Path Council http://signs-up.ppbsa.org/2014/02/07/welcome-units-from-central-new-jersey- council/ while Scouting units South of the Raritan were transferred to Monmouth Council.  Camps  Central New Jersey Council used to operates two camps in New Jersey, Kittatinny Mountain Scout Reservation and Yards Creek Scout Reservation. First opened in 1972, Yards Creek was a camp located in the grounds of the Yards Creek Pumping Station in Blairstown, New Jersey near both the Appalachian Trail and the Delaware Water Gap. The camp was restricted to short-term use, specifically for units who take day trips to the Appalachian Trail and Delaware River and require the use of camp facilities for a short periods. Located in Sandyston Township, New Jersey within walking distance of the Appalachian Trail, Kittatinny Mountain Scout Reservation, also called KMSR, was used for short term periods. Central New Jersey Council has stated that the camp offers ways to help create \\"better units, qualified scouters, and skillful, self-reliant boys and young men\\". The camp comprises over in the Stokes State Forest. Issues with low attendance, the dam, the septic system and other needed improvements at Kittatinny Mountain Scout Reservation have led to discussions on sale of the camp.

Order of the Arrow  Central New Jersey Council's Order of the Arrow lodge was Sakuwit Lodge, and, including the former lodges merged into it, the lodge's history is the second oldest in the United States. The lodge was officially founded on September 2, 1999 after the mergers of Sanhican Lodge 2, of the George Washington Council, and Narraticong Lodge 9, of the Thomas A. Edison Council.

Anderson. Future outlaw Jesse James was among the guerrillas. In the ensuing Battle of Centralia, a large detachment of Union mounted infantry attempted to intercept Anderson, but nearly all of them were killed in combat. Background In the fall of 1864, the Confederates, faced with a rapidly deteriorating position, launched an invasion of northern Missouri. It was led by General Sterling Price and his Missouri State Guard. The object was to influence the 1864 presidential election by capturing St. Louis and the state capital at Jefferson City. As part of his strategy, Price encouraged guerrilla warfare, especially the disruption of the railroads. \\"Bloody Bill\\" Anderson and his guerrilla company were among those who took part.Guerrilla Tactics, American Experience, PBS On September 23, 1864, Anderson engaged in a skirmish in Boone County, Missouri, seven miles east of Rocheport. His men managed to kill eleven Federal soldiers and three black civilian teamsters. The Federals responded the next day by shooting six of Anderson's men who were captured at a home in Rocheport. That same day, September 24, Anderson attacked the pro- Union town of Fayette, but the attack was a failure. Thirteen of Anderson‚Äôs men were killed and more than thirty were wounded.

Rodemyre. History of Centralia, Missouri. Centralia, Mo.: Press of the Fireside Guard, 1936. The guerrillas looted the town and reportedly drank whiskey from stolen boots. Anderson blocked the rail line, and the engineer of an approaching train failed to realize it until too late since the men he saw were wearing blue uniforms. The guerrillas swarmed over the train. The 125 passengers were divided between civilians and soldiers. A total of 24 Union soldiers were aboard, all on leave after the Battle of Atlanta and heading to their homes in northwest Missouri or southwest Iowa. The Union soldiers were ordered at gunpoint to strip off their uniforms. Anderson called for an officer. Sergeant Thomas Goodman bravely stepped forward, expecting to be shot and the rest spared. Instead, Anderson's men ignored Goodman and began shooting the others. The bodies were then mutilated and scalped. The guerrillas then set fire to the train and sent it running down the tracks toward Sturgeon, Missouri. They torched the depot and rode away from the town.Centralia Massacre, By Claire Wolnisty, Angelo State University, Civil War on the Western Border: The Missouri-Kansas Conflict,1855-1865 Sergeant Goodman was taken prisoner on Anderson's orders, with the plan that he would be exchanged later for one of Anderson's own men held prisoner by Federal forces. Goodman spent ten days in the captivity of the guerrillas before escaping at night as they prepared to cross the Missouri River, near Rocheport.William Franklin Switzler.

Armed with muzzle loading Enfield rifles, the Federal recruits were no match for the guerrillas with their revolvers. Johnston's first volley killed several guerrillas, but then his men were overrun. Most were shot down as they attempted to flee. According to Frank James, his younger brother Jesse fired the shot that killed Major Johnston.

It was the centre of Tasciovanus' power and a major center of the Catuvellauni from about 20 BC until shortly after the Roman invasion of AD 43.Wacher, John. 1976, The Towns of Roman Britain, p. 202, both for Tasciovanus and the Catuvellauni. Its location was on Prae Hill, 2 km to the west of modern St Albans. Etymology The etymology is uncertain: perhaps the name means \\"settlement above the marsh\\", or \\"[settlement of] Uerulamos [Broad-Hand]\\" in Brittonic.Isaac, G. R., \\"Place-Names in Ptolemy's Geography: An electronic data base with etymological analysis of the Celtic name-elements (2004). The elements *wer- and *lamƒÅ- meant \\"high\\" and \\"hand\\" respectively in Common Brittonic (*-i- is adjectival, denoting a place, and *-on is the usual o-stem neuter suffix). An alternative etymology may be guessed via back construction from modern Welsh, as bank of the (River) Ver, where Ver could mean short, or be a contracted form of Veru, or Berw, meaning a foaming or bubbling river (cf Berwyn). Iron age It is believed that the tribal capital was moved to the site by Tasciovanus (around 25 to 5 BC). The location of the previous capital is not certain, but it is possible to speculate on the basis of evidence in Caesar's Commentarii de Bello Gallico and archaeological evidence for Iron Age sites in the area. One possible site is a few miles to the north near Wheathampstead, where a feature called the Devil's Dyke has been interpreted as part of the defences of a large oppidum near the River Lea. Tasciovanus was the first king to mint coins at Verlamion, beginning around 10 BC. There is evidence that the oppidum may have had a significant ritual function.Williamson, Tom. The Origins of Hertfordshire, Univ of Hertfordshire Press, 2010 The centre grew under Tasciovanus' son, Cunobelinus. Cunobelinus may have constructed Beech Bottom Dyke, a defensive earthwork near the settlement whose significance is uncertain. It has been suggested that it is part of an unusually large defensive scheme including Devil's Dyke mentioned above, running from the River Ver to the River Lea.

He was a right-handed batsman and right-arm fast-medium bowler who played 107 times for Worcestershire between 1909 and 1925, captaining the county in 1914, 1919 and 1922. He also made three first-class appearances for HK Foster's XI. Born in Sale, Cheshire, Taylor made his debut in Worcestershire's County Championship game against Kent on 14 June 1909, making 19 and 0. He did not bowl in that game; his first wicket was that of Harry Altham in Worcestershire's next game, against Oxford University. For the next few years, with the exception of 1910 when he made 11 appearances, Taylor played only a few times a season. He was made captain in 1914, replacing Henry Foster, and appeared in 21 matches. He scored what was to be his career best of 59 not out against Essex in August of that year, and took 26 wickets at 44.69. The First World War then intervened, but on the resumption of first- class cricket in 1919, Taylor continued as captain. Worcestershire did not participate in the County Championship that summer but instead played a series of friendly matches; it was in one of these, against HK Foster's XI, that he took his first five-wicket innings haul, claiming 5-56. For 1920, and Worcestershire's return to Championship cricket, Taylor was replaced as captain by his brother-in-law, Maurice Jewell, but Taylor continued to play a significant number of matches for the county. 1921 was the most productive season of his career, as he took 35 wickets at 28.28 including five in an innings three times; the best of these being his career-best of 7-64 against Glamorgan at Kidderminster. Taylor regained the captaincy for 1922, but had a wretched season: despite playing 17 games, he could manage a mere four wickets costing over 131 runs apiece, to go with 214 runs at 8.23. Maurice Foster took over the reins for 1923, and it was almost the end for Taylor as a first-class player: after 1922 he played only one more first-class match‚Äîthough he captained Worcestershire in that game too‚Äîagainst Oxford University in 1925. He made 1 and 0 and took 2-79 in the second innings. He died in Birlingham, Worcestershire at the age of 73.

It was called Piperno until 1927. It has a station of the Rome-Naples railway mainline. Nearby is the Monti Lepini chain. It was the birthplace of the canonist Reginald of Piperno.  History  Robinia pseudoacacia in Priverno summer city Privernum is described by Livy as a flourishing Volscian site, which was conquered and destroyed by the Romans in the late 4th century BC. The Appian Way passed nearby. The town recovered under the Roman rule, but disappeared after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, probably destroyed by Saracen attacks. It was later a minor center of the Papal States, to which it belonged until the capture of Rome in 1870.  Ecclesiastical History  In 760 was established the Diocese of Priverno alias Piperno. From 1217.01.17 it was held in personal union (aeque principaliter) with the Terracina until 1986.09.30, when it was suppressed and both (as well as Sezze) had their title and territory merged into the Diocese of Latina‚ÄìTerracina‚ÄìSezze‚ÄìPriverno. At least since 1180 (earlier incumbents not available), all bishops concurrently held the sees of Sezze and Roman Catholic Diocese of Terracina, since 1217 due to the personal union with Terracina. Its Marian former cathedral remains a Co-Cathedral: Concattedrale di S. Maria (Assunta), in Priverno.  Main sights  Nearby is the famous Abbey of Fossanova, which is where the town's patron saint, St. Thomas Aquinas died on 7 March 1274. Notable churches : *Santa Maria Assunta (former Cathedral), consecrated by Pope Lucius II in 1183. It houses a panel of the Madonna d'Agosto and St. Thomas's skull. *San Benedetto, built by the Benedictines from the 7th century AD; it includes 13th and 16th centuries frescoes *San Giovanni Evangelista (c. 9th century, rebuilt in the 13th century).

The book combines elements of epic fantasy and dark fantasy as it describes the dealings of an elite mercenary unit--the Black Company--with the Lady, ruler of the Northern Empire. __TOC__ Plot introduction The Dominator is an extremely powerful wizard who has the ability to turn his most bitter enemies into his loyal servants, even those nearly his equal in magic. The most potent of his victims are called the Ten Who Were Taken, or just Taken for short. With his wife, the Lady, whose magical skill is second only to that of the Dominator, he founded an empire unrivaled for evil. It was overthrown by a rebellion led by the White Rose, but neither she nor the rebel wizards were strong enough to kill the Dominator, the Lady or the Taken. The best they could do was to render them unconscious and imprison them. Their prison was a place called the Barrowland. After four centuries, the wizard Bomanz awakened the Lady during a spirit walk into the Barrowlands, in an attempt to learn from her. She manipulated him, won her freedom, and subsequently trapped Bomanz in a quasi-undead spirit state between dimensions. She then unleashed the Taken, but betrayed the Dominator, leaving him where he was, and proceeded to resurrect the empire. As with the old, so it was with the new ‚Äì a rebellion broke out, spearheaded this time by the Circle of Eighteen. The Circle is made up of magicians not individually as strong as the Taken, but usually united in their goals. The Taken, on the other hand, battle each other as much as they do the rebels. Plot summary The Black Company's current employer, the Syndic of Beryl, is losing control of his decadent city to rival factions. A dangerous monster known as a forvalaka runs amok through the city, killing numerous citizens and contributing to the city's growing instability; the Syndic requests that the Black Company track and kill the beast. Because the creature is virtually indestructible, it kills several of the Black Company's men, including Tom- Tom, one of the Company's wizards. When the Taken named Soulcatcher offers the Company new employment in the service of the Lady, its Captain readily accepts, though he is forced to accept the killing of the Syndic to break the contract. On the march north to the Lady's empire, the Company acquires two new members. Raven is an uncommonly deadly and (usually) remorseless recruit, even by Company standards. Uncharacteristically, he rescues Darling, a nine- year-old mute girl being abused by soldiers affiliated with the Limper, another of the Taken. The Limper and Soulcatcher are deadly rivals; since the Company was recruited by Soulcatcher, that makes the Limper an enemy to beware. After weeks of trying to link up with the Limper's forces, the Company (at Soulcatcher's suggestion) takes an important rebel fortress, embarrassing both the Limper and Raker, a leading member of the Circle of Eighteen. The Limper sends his top aide, Colonel Zouad, to stir up trouble for the Company, but Elmo, the Company's Sergeant, leaks his whereabouts to the rebels, allowing them to abduct him for information. Zouad manages to contact the Limper, but Soulcatcher has other plans. When the Limper cracks open the underground room where his minion is being held, Soulcatcher's Taken ally, Shapeshifter, is waiting disguised as a rebel and unexpectedly stuns him with magic. Shifter then rolls the incapacitated Limper into the cellar and causes it to collapse in on itself. Another victory for the Company, another humiliation for the Limper. While the Limper is not killed, this slows him down for a time. While the Limper is absent from his post, Raker's troops attack and part of the front collapses. The Company is caught up in the general retreat but shows itself to be the Lady's most effective unit in the ensuing battles. The Captain is given authority normally reserved for the Taken. Raker is targeted next. The Company's wizards, with Soulcatcher's backing, display a fortune in gold, silver and jewels (protected by magic) in a nearby, neutral city - a bounty for his head. Raker has no choice but to try to steal it before half the world tries to collect. Isolated when he ignores the Circle's order to withdraw, he is eventually killed by Raven and Croaker, but not before his disobedience saps the morale of the rebels in the region. Retreating once more, the Company stumbles upon and captures a rebel training camp. Papers are found that belong to Whisper, the strongest member of the Circle and a military genius as well. One details a future meeting with the Limper, who is ready to defect as a result of his string of disasters. Soulcatcher, Raven and Croaker ambush them. All the while Croaker has a nagging suspicion that someone is watching them who he later learns was Silent which was who he thought it was the whole time. They are captured alive and presented to the Lady, the Limper to face her wrath and Whisper to take her place among the Taken. Limper is sentenced to centuries of torture by the Lady. After the Lady uses magic she learned from the Dominator to gain Whisper's unswerving loyalty, the new Taken is sent to the eastern front. The war becomes a race: the rebel armies in the north, under the overall command of Circle wizard Harden, drive the Imperial forces back towards the Tower at Charm, the headquarters of the Lady, while Whisper runs amok in the east, laying waste to the heartland of the rebellion. Harden is killed, but takes the Taken The Hanged Man with him. The Circle suffers more casualties, but massive rebel forces besiege the Tower. A daring sortie by the Company captures the wizards Feather and Journey, weakening the Circle further; they are transported to the Tower to share Whisper's fate. The battle for the Tower begins. The Circle's forces number a quarter of a million while the Lady can muster a mere twenty-one thousand. Yet so dangerous are the Lady and the Taken that the Circle delays, hoping to find the prophesied reincarnation of the White Rose to lead them. A great comet hangs in the sky for most of the battle. This is a symbol of the prophecy which says: the Lady and the Dominator will be defeated under a comet's fiery tail. Finally, it is forced to attack without her before the empire's victorious eastern armies can arrive. All of the Taken gather to bolster the defenses, killing the remaining members of the Circle, when they're not busy assassinating each other. Except for Soulcatcher, all of the original Taken are slain, some by the rebels, but more from internal backstabbing. During the fighting, Croaker observes that Darling seems to be immune to magic. Finally, the rebels are utterly devastated. Then, with her plot to take over the empire discovered, Soulcatcher flees, but the Lady, with Croaker along as a witness, tracks her down. The physician shoots her with magical arrows supplied by the Lady and then beheads her. Croaker then learns that Soulcatcher is the Lady's own sister. Afterwards, he speculates that this was what the Lady had intended all along: not only to crush the revolt, but also to rid herself of all the treacherous Taken. During the confusion, Raven deserts because he knows something he does not want the Lady to learn, taking Darling with him. Raven, Croaker and Silent all seem to believe that Darling is the reincarnated White Rose, who will oppose the Lady and defeat the Empire.

Biography Mar√≠a Rosa Garc√≠a was born in 1978 in the town of San Fernando in Cadiz. The youngest of five siblings and only daughter of a military man (Jos√© Garc√≠a) and flamenco singer \\"La Pastori\\" Garc√≠a. Her stage name is \\"Ni√±a Pastori\\" because among her siblings of four older brothers, she was the only woman and she was referred to as \\"la ni√±a\\", she was also \\"la √∫nica hija de la Pastori\\" (the only daughter of la Pastori) and when she went on stage people remarked ‚Äúva a cantar la ni√±a de la Pastori‚Äù (la Pastori's girl is going to sing). Her initial name was \\"La ni√±a de la Pastori\\", but she later changed it to \\"Ni√±a Pastori\\". She went to junior school at the Vicente Tofi√±o school in San Fernando (C√°diz). She started her artistic career at a young age singing in Andalusia. At the age of six she accompanied her mother in the flamenco tablaos of \\"Barrio de la Pastora\\", and a year later won a singing contest at the \\"El Chato\\" club in San Fernando, where she sang buler√≠as (a flamenco style) and won first prize. In doing so, she showed that she had skills despite her early age. Among her first mentors was Camar√≥n de la Isla, also from San Fernando (C√°diz), whose purist flamenco style she followed in her early years. Later she added a more commercial, pop tone to her image and style without losing her flamenco roots. Artists Paco Ortega and Alejandro Sanz helped her produce her first album, Entre dos puertos, when she was seventeen and with whom sold more than 150,000 units, achieving commercial popularity. Part of this was due to the single T√∫ me camelas, which was a hit in Spain in summer 1996. Since then, she has recorded ten albums and has sold two million records. Her second album, Eres luz (1998) confirmed her success, with songs again by Paco Ortega and Alejandro Sanz, Parrita, Manuel Malou and her brother Paco. In 2000, she published her third album, Ca√±a√≠lla, produced by Alejandro Sanz and Josemi Carmona of the flamenco group Ketama; it is dedicated to her home town and more flamenco than the previous works. Her album Mar√≠a (2002) evolved to a more personal style, taking part in the lyrics and composition of some of her songs, a trend that she continued in No hay quinto malo, her fifth album (2004). In Joyas prestadas (2006), where Ni√±a Pastori makes personal versions of songs originally by artists from very different styles and genres, such as boleros, ballads, coplas and classics from Spain and Latin America. The original artists include Joan Manuel Serrat, Alejandro Sanz, Mexican rockers Man√°, Dominican artist Juan Luis Guerra, Antonio Mach√≠n, Manolo Garc√≠a of El √öltimo de la Fila, Luz Casal, Armando Manzanero, Los Jeros or Marif√© de Triana. This project had a second part ten years later, √Åmame como soy (nuevas joyas). She has received many awards. Some of the most important ones include four Latin Grammys (three as the best flamenco music album and one as the best folk album), as well as Gold and Platinum records in Spain and other countries such as Colombia and Argentina, as she has gone beyond Spanish borders and has toured Latin America and Europe with great success. She is the only flamenco artist nominated for the Grammy for Best Latin Pop Album and has won two Premios Dial awards and a few other Premios Amigo awards. In 2018 she was awarded the Medalla de Andaluc√≠a, a prestigious Andalusian award. At that event she also sang the Andalusian hymn. In addition, she was given the Honorary Award for her National and International Career at the Premios Flamenco En La Piel awards at the International Salon of Flamenco Fashion (SIMOF) 2018. She sang a version of Schubert's Ave Maria during Pope John Paul II's last visit to Madrid on May 2003 for 3 million people. Later this version was included in a new edition of her album Mar√≠a released in 2006. One of her hits, \\"Cai\\", was a song composed by Alejandro Sanz that is dedicated to the city of C√°diz. She participated as a special guest in the event in which Alejandro Sanz celebrated the 20th anniversary of his album \\"M√°s\\". She is married to Julio Jim√©nez Borja \\"Chaboli\\", co-producer, composer and percussionist on her albums. She is the great-granddaughter of flamenco singer In√©s \\"la del Pelao\\". On May 7, 2018, Ni√±a Pastori talked to the \`20 Minutes\` magazine about her new work \\"Bajo tus alas\\" and her current career. With testimonies as beautiful as: \\"at 40 years old I have more power than ever\\" or \\"we are not the weak ones, women have an innate ability to survive\\". Pastori talks about silence saying that \\"It is essential to have some silence. We need to listen a little bit more, stop and listen to the silence. For me it is vital, fundamental, to listen to silence. \\" In this interview, she assures that it is indifferent to her to talk about her private life and her family, since she has nothing to hide. She feels very loved by her fans, who assure that she is a very natural artist \\"I love when they tell me that they love me because I am very natural. I love when I'm stopped by women on the street and they say: \\"You seem so normal, you are just like us\\". I have a life like everyone else, through good times and bad times I have suffered.\\" In addition, she assures that being happy all the time is not good, if she has bad moments, she does not hide it to her fans, at times she'd a tear on stage. With this interview, Pastori showed her most personal and human side, ensuring that what makes her the happiest is singing, especially singing about what she loves. Discography -Entre dos puertos. 1996 Directed by Paco Ortega and Alejandro Sanz, it was her first studio album that she recorded aged just 17. The album became platinum, (150,000 copies were sold), and her single \\"T√∫ me camelas\\" managed to be among the top of the music charts for months. As for its content, the album offers a mix of pop along with rumbas, fandangos, buler√≠as and tanguillos. -Eres Luz. 1998 Eres luz is the second studio album by Ni√±a Pastori, produced by Paco Ortega and Alejandro Sanz, published by Sony BMG, and recorded and released in 1998. The album includes songs with Alejandro Sanz, Parrita, Paco Ortega and her brother, Paco. This album offers a fresh touch of flamenco. -Cana√≠lla. 2000 It is her record of consecration and was produced by Alejandro Sanz. It offers collaborations with various artists such as Jos√© Miguel and Antonio Carmona, Vicente Amigo, Moraito, etc. It is a disc of varied content, catering to all audiences. -Mar√≠a. 2002 This album was again designed and planned by Ni√±a Pastori and her partner Julio Jim√©nez Borja, alias Chaboli. Thus, the latter was the one that produced all the songs on the album except two, \\"Amor de San Juan\\" and \\"De boca en boca\\", which were produced by his author, Jos√© Manuel Ruiz, known as Queco. -No hay quinto malo. 2004 ‚ÄúNo hay quinto malo‚Äù is the fifth album of Ni√±a Pastori. It offers both CD and DVD versions, and was shot by director Juan Estelrich. Ni√±a Pastori participated in the composition of all the songs of this album along with her husband, Chaboli, and Jeros. It is her most risky album, but also the most pure and intimate. -Joyas prestadas. 2006 In this album, the artist covers her favorite songs for the first time, which are special for her and have helped her in her life. It includes songs by Joan Manuel Serrat, Alejandro Sanz, Man√°, Juan Luis Guerra, Antonio Mach√≠n, Manolo Garc√≠a, Luz Casal, Armando Manzanero and Marif√© de Triana. -Esperando verte. 2009 She recorded it together with her husband, Chaboli, whilst being pregnant with her first daughter, to which she refers in many of her songs. The album includes very varied styles from tangos to buler√≠as and fandangos. The title track of the album, \\"Esperando a verte\\", is a song dedicated entirely to her daughter. Thus, this album is considered for her as one of the most special due to her pregnancy. -La orilla de mi pelo. 2011 This album won the Latin Grammy for the Best Flamenco Album. In this album pop predominates over flamenco. Thus, there is a change in the accompaniment of her songs, leaving aside the flamenco guitar and replacing it with the acoustic and electric guitar. As Ni√±a Pastori said, \\"in this new album the songs are made of passion, romance, temptation, blood, sigh, purity, magic, flavor and joy\\". \\\\- Ra√≠z. 2014. In this album she works with the Mexican Lila Downs and the Argentinian Soledad Pastorutti. It is produced by Aneiro Ta√±o and J. Jim√©nez, also known as \\"Chaboli\\". The three women work together to showcase the best of their three nations. Through their songs they share with us the most particular features of their folklore and their nations. \\\\- √Åmame como soy. 2015 This repertory arose from the collaborations of Ni√±a Pastori with Ruben Blades, Juan Luis Guerra, Pancho C√©spedes and Sara Baras for the first time. -Bajo tus alas. 2018 This album was produced by Chaboli and mixed in Los Angeles by Rafa Sardina. In \`Bajo tus alas\`, Ni√±a Pastori offers songs accompanied by great musical artists such as Manuel Carrasco, Guaco, Vanesa Mart√≠n and Pablo Albor√°n. Undoubtedly, yet another step in her personal style, highlighting the depth of her voice and, above all, the flamenco that she carries in her blood. In addition, the artist has scheduled a new tour with this album that begins on May 4 in Malaga and which will be performed throughout Spain.

Sabaudia's center is characterized by several examples of Fascist architecture. History An hour and a half to the south of Rome, Sabaudia is a coastal town. It is one of several towns built on the reclaimed marshland of the Pontine Marshes Agro Pontino. This marsh was drained under orders from Benito Mussolini. Vast tracts of malaria-infested swamp were drained by workers transported from poor areas of northern Italy, leaving the coastal area south of Rome with rich farmland. These towns were built so that the fascist regime could demonstrate the draining of the marshland, as well as to provide housing communities for the increasing urban populations of Italy's large cities. Architects Gino Cancellotti, Eugenio Montuori, Luigi Piccinato, and Alfredo Scalpelli were responsible for the town plan and many of the buildings after winning a competition for the design of Sabaudia, sponsored by Mussolini. Work commenced on the town's construction on 5 August 1933 and was completed 253 days later. The city itself is based a Roman grid road layout and rationalist architecture. Sabaudia is well frequented by residents of Rome and Naples, as it is about half way between the two cities. Sabaudia has 15 kilometers of beach that boast the Bandiera Blu (Blue Flag) designation, which is awarded by the Foundation for Environmental Education (FEE). The FEE grades a beach based on the quality of water, recycling and waste management practices, the presence of lifeguards, and inclusion of pedestrian paths and green areas. Surrounded by the Circeo Forest, access is provided by a boardwalk along the entire coast.https://www.dolcevespa.com/post/beaches-of- rome  Twin towns / Sister cities  * Saint-M√©dard-en-Jalles, France * El Vendrell, Spain References Sources  The Beaches of Rome: Ultimate Guide dolcevespa.com.

Cam. (Peter Urseolus) (928‚Äì987) was the Doge of Venice from 976 until 978. He abdicated his office and left in the middle of the night to become a monk. He later entered the Camaldolese Order. He is venerated as a saint in the Catholic Church following his canonization in 1731. In 1733 the Venetian librarian Giuseppe Bettinelli published an edition of a biography written by the infamous heretical Friar Fulgenzio Manfredi in 1606. Early life Orseolo was born in 928 near Udine to one of the more powerful families in Venice: the Orseolo who were the descendants of Teodato Ipato and Orso Ipato. At the age of 20 he was named commander of the Venetian fleet, performing distinguished service as a soldier; he waged successful campaigns against the Dalmatian pirates. He was also devoted to the Catholic Church. Reign Coat of arms. In 976, the sitting doge, Pietro IV Candiano, was killed in a revolution that protested his attempts to create a monarchy. According to a statement by the Camaldolese monk and cardinal, Peter Damian, Orseolo himself had led a conspiracy against Candiano. This statement, however, cannot be verified. Nonetheless, Orseolo was elected as his successor. His wife and consort was Felicia Malipiero. As doge, Orseolo demonstrated a good deal of talent in restoring order to an unsettled Venice and showed remarkable generosity in the treatment of his predecessor's widow. He built hospitals and cared for widows, orphans and pilgrims. Out of his own resources he began the reconstruction of the ducal chapel, now St. Mark's Basilica, and the doge's palace, which had been destroyed during the revolution, along with a great part of the city. Two years later, on 1 September 978, seemingly without notifying anyone, not even his wife and children, he left Venice with Abbot Guarin and three other Venetians (one of whom was St. Romuald) to join the Benedictine (now Cistercian) abbey at Saint- Michel-de-Cuxa () in Prades (), southern France. Here Orseolo led a life of great asceticism, performing the most menial tasks. There is some evidence that he had been considering such an action for some time. His only contact with Venice was to instruct his son Otto (who had become doge in 1008) in the life of Christian virtue. After some years as a monk at the abbey, probably with the encouragement of Saint Romuald (who later went on to found the Camaldolese branch of the Benedictines), Orseolo left the monastery to become a hermit in the surrounding forest, a calling he followed for seven years until he died. His body is buried in the village church in Prades (), France. Veneration Forty years after his death, in 1027, Orseolo was officially recognized as a blessed by the local bishop. Orseolo is venerated as a saint by the Catholic Church, his cultus having been confirmed by his equivalent canonization in 1731 by Pope Clement XII, who set his feast day for January 14. The reform of the liturgical calendar in 1969 transferred the feast to January 10, the day of his death. The Camaldolese, however, celebrate his memory on January 19.

The series combines elements of epic fantasy and dark fantasy as it follows an elite mercenary unit, The Black Company, through roughly 40 years of its approximately 400-year history. Plot introduction In the earlier book the setting begins with the company employed by a Syndic, but the Captain slays him because he thinks he's fighting for a lost cause, for little pay, and he doesn't want to sentence the company to its doom. Soulcatcher, the Taken that recruited them, becomes their mentor. They do many missions for the Lady. They end up being pushed, along with the rest of the Lady's forces, back to her HQ, the tower at Charm. They have an immense battle where many of the Company are lost. The Taken backstab each other during the battle except for Soulcatcher, who flees only to be hunted down and destroyed by Croaker and the Lady who use a set of magical arrows to kill her. The old legend, that tells the tale of The Lady and The Dominator, her worse than evil husband, and The White Rose who imprisons them is centuries in the past. The Dominator and his wife, the Lady, (both supremely skilled in the art of magic), had founded an empire legendary for evil. They were overthrown by a rebellion led by the White Rose, but even in defeat, they remained too powerful to be killed; the best the rebels could do was to imprison them in the Barrowland. The Lady escaped to rebuild the empire, but betrayed her husband, leaving him there. The Black Company recounted how she crushed several deadly challenges to her power. But those were not the only threats to her reign... Plot summary The Black Company is ordered to march thousands of miles across the Lady's vast empire to the Barrowland. A small detachment, including the Company's doctor and historian, Croaker, is flown to Juniper, a run-down port outside the empire, at the request of the local prince, to investigate its magical connection to the Barrowland. By coincidence, Raven, a deserter from the Company, and his ward Darling are living at Marron Shed's dilapidated hotel in Juniper. Raven has been accumulating money any way he can, including selling dead (and almost dead) bodies to the non-human residents of a mysterious black castle that is steadily growing, fueling the unease of the city's residents. Shed also desperately needs money, to pay his loanshark Krage. Raven does him a favor by letting him participate in his body-selling venture. When Raven and Shed find out that Shed's acquaintance, Asa, has been robbing the dead in the Catacombs, they follow suit. A minor incident escalates into a life-and-death struggle between Krage and Raven, which the former loses; Krage and many of his henchmen are sold for a hefty sum to the castle. Two of the Lady's most powerful wizards, Whisper and Feather, arrive in Juniper to investigate the castle and determine that it is an attempt by the Dominator to escape. Raven, while trying to protect Darling, had been unwittingly aiding her worst enemy. If the castle gets sufficient bodies to grow large enough, the Dominator will be freed. Once he learns of Raven's presence, Croaker becomes worried, for he knows why Raven deserted: Darling is the reincarnation of the White Rose, the nemesis of both the Lady and the Dominator. If the Lady ever found out, Croaker and the rest of the Company would be done for. Fortunately, Raven and Darling sail away as soon as the winter ice melts, taking Asa with them, in the ship Raven had built with his ill-gotten loot. Shed continues to have money troubles, forcing him to sell his embezzling cousin and a treacherous lover to the castle, but is finally caught by the Company. Croaker realizes that he cannot risk handing him over to Whisper for questioning, as the Company's connection to Darling would be revealed, so he fakes Shed's death. Asa returns to the town shortly afterwards, bringing news that Raven has been killed. Meanwhile, fierce fighting breaks out between the castle's inhabitants and the Lady's forces, now including the Lady herself, the rehabilitated Limper, Feather and Journey, as well as the remainder of the Black Company. Feather is slain. In the confusion of the climactic battle, Croaker, Shed, Asa, the Lieutenant and many of the old-time Company members sail away, rightfully fearing that the Lady will learn the truth about Darling. The Company's Captain dies when he tries in a heroic attempt to save the company by making sure the Lady's carpet cannot be used to chase them down. He does this by flying it on a suicide run into a cliff. The Lieutenant takes command of the Company. At the next port, the fleeing band find Raven's ship. Croaker determines that their friend had only staged his death and the men begin searching for him and Darling. In the process, they discover that some of the Dominator's minions had slipped away from Juniper and planted the seed for another castle in a new, more secluded spot. Croaker informs the Lady when she contacts him magically. Back in Juniper, the Lady emerges victorious over her husband. Whisper and the Limper then take an unauthorized side trip to track down the remnants of the Company. The Lieutenant barely gets away in the ship with most of the men, but Croaker, Shed, Silent, Goblin, One-Eye and a few others are left behind. With no other choice, they ambush the Taken and succeed in hurting them badly enough to get away, though Shed is killed. When they link up with the Lieutenant in another port town, they learn that he had found Darling, and Raven had died in an accident immediately prior to his arrival. They become Rebels‚Äîthe very group they were fighting against‚Äîto protect Darling who is The White Rose. They then prepare to spend the next twenty-nine years on the run, waiting for the return of the Great Comet, which prophecies say will signal the downfall of the Lady.

In 2009 it had a population of about 60,000. History The town was built entirely new near the location of ancient Lavinium on land resulting from the final reclamation of the Pontine Marshes under Benito Mussolini, being inaugurated on 29 October 1939. Its new population was extracted from the poor peasants of Romagna, Veneto and Friuli. Peace did not last long. After being occupied by the forces of the Third Reich, Pomezia was heavily bombed during the Battle of Anzio in World War II. After the end of the war, Pomezia developed as a strong industrial center, especially in the medical and pharmaceutical sectors, as well as a recreational center. It is also home to the production plant of Italian food company Colavita. Pratica di Mare is the \\"frazione\\" of Pomezia where the ruins of the ancient port of Lavinium are located, now from the Tyrrhenian Sea. The ancient community was on some hilly ground at the mouth of a stream. Currently the flat alluvial sediment between the hill and the beach is occupied by Pratica di Mare Air Force Base, a facility of the Aeronautica Militare that also finds great utility as a secure airport and a location for air shows and races. The name of Pomezia comes from the Latin city of Suessa Pometia, although it is unknown where Pometia was located. Sport The most popular sport in Pomezia is football (soccer).

The series combines elements of epic fantasy and dark fantasy as it follows an elite mercenary unit, The Black Company, through roughly forty years of its approximately four hundred-year history. Plot introduction Centuries in the past, the Dominator and his wife, the Lady, (both supremely skilled in the art of magic), had founded an empire legendary for evil. They were overthrown by a rebellion led by the White Rose, but even in defeat, they remained too powerful to be killed; the best the rebels could do was to imprison them and their most powerful minions in the Barrowland. A wizard named Bomanz awakened the Lady in an attempt to learn from her, but she used him to gain her freedom and rebuilt the empire. However, she betrayed her husband by leaving him where he was. A rebellion broke out against the Lady's new empire; the Black Company played a key role in putting it down (as detailed in The Black Company). Later, the Company also assisted the Lady in preventing her husband from escaping his prison (as recounted in Shadows Linger), but it was forced to flee her wrath when she discovered that it had unknowingly sheltered the reborn White Rose. Plot summary The Black Company has taken refuge from the Lady in the Plain of Fear. Its magical, non- human denizens are powerful enough to daunt even her. Among them is Old Father Tree, a god manifesting itself as a tree planted in the exact center of the plain. From this sanctuary, the White Rose rebuilds and directs the rebellion. No wizard in the world can rival the Lady's magical skill and power, but the White Rose is immune to magic and as she matures, the magic-free zone around her expands. (This explains how her former incarnation was able to defeat the Lady and the Dominator.) After several years of relative peace, the pace picks up. The Taken and their armies gather on the borders of the plain, threatening to swamp the vastly outnumbered rebels. Also, couriers begin arriving from the far eastern reaches of the empire, among them Tracker and Toadkiller Dog, a man and his mutt. Each messenger bears a letter for Croaker, describing what some unnamed rebel spy has found out about Bomanz. The last letter claims that the wizard knew the Lady's true name. With the situation becoming increasingly desperate, the White Rose sends Croaker and wizards Goblin and One-Eye to retrieve that vital bit of information. Tracker volunteers to go with them as a guide. When they reach the end of their journey, they soon discover that the letter-writer was Raven, a former Company stalwart (who had staged his death at the end of Shadows Linger). He had made his way to the Barrowland and started doing odd jobs for the soldiers garrisoned there. Once he gained their trust, he received permission to live in Bomanz's old house, where he covertly searched for the old wizard's papers. What he found made him attempt something beyond his abilities; he used a spell to send his spirit to check on the Dominator. His worst fears were confirmed; the bloodthirsty tyrant was awake and actively working to free himself. Fleeing in panic, Raven made a mistake, allowing two of the lesser imprisoned creatures to free themselves and leaving him trapped. Croaker's men search Raven's house, but they arouse the Barrowland guardians' suspicions and are brought in for questioning. With their cover blown, they flee into the surrounding forest, taking Raven's vacant body and the papers he found. When they have trouble shaking their pursuers, Croaker deliberately allows himself to be captured as a distraction. He is taken to the Lady, who has unexpectedly grown fond of him. With the imminent threat of the Dominator looming, she goes with Croaker to see the White Rose, to form an alliance against their common foe. Goblin, One-Eye, Tracker and Toadkiller Dog return shortly afterwards. They all gather in front of Old Father Tree, who recognizes them, especially the latter two. Unmasked as the escaped servants of the Dominator, they try to kill the White Rose and the Lady, but Toadkiller Dog is driven off and Tracker converted into Old Father Tree's slave. Scorn and Blister, two of the new Taken, try to assassinate their mistress but fail and pay the ultimate price for their treachery. Soon, both the Black Company and the Lady and her minions travel back to the Barrowland to confront the Dominator, taking along a sapling, the offspring of Old Father Tree. There, both Bomanz and Raven are revived. Meanwhile, Toadkiller Dog lurks uncaptured, awaiting his chance to help his master. While preparations are being made, the Lady, emotionally vulnerable due to her growing fear of the outcome, and Croaker grow closer. The final battle begins. The White Rose carefully approaches the burial mounds of each of the lesser minions, one by one, nullifying the spells that bind them. When they emerge, they are powerless within her zone of influence and relatively easy to kill. Finally, it is the turn of the Dominator. Even without his magic, he is practically immortal and immensely powerful, but eventually he is overcome, though at the cost of the Lieutenant and Elmo. His body is burned, his malevolent spirit infused into a silver spike which is driven into the trunk of the scion of Old Father Tree. In the aftermath, the Limper tries to utter the Lady's true name, but guesses the wrong one. His head is chopped off by Croaker while he is helpless in the White Rose's vicinity. Then the Lady speaks the name of the White Rose, depriving her of her unique ability. Finally, Silent, of all people, speaking for the first time in Croaker's memory, truly names the Lady, rendering her powerless. Because the Lady had tied the Taken to her fate, the Taken are destroyed. The remnants of the Company, now led by Croaker as the highest ranked surviving officer, sneak away, taking the not-unwilling Lady with them.

Active from 1986 to 1998. The team was equipped with four Fouga CM170 Magister jet trainers, and was drawn from the Light Strike Squadron of the Irish Air Corps based at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel near Dublin. The name Silver Swallows was derived from the colour of the aircraft, and the 'V'-shaped tail of the Magister aircraft the team flew. Throughout its history the team was operated on a part-time basis, with the display duties of the team being secondary to the primary roles of the Light Strike Squadron. Display history This four ship team first performed for the 60th anniversary of the formation of the Air Corps in 1982 with silver Fouga Magister trainers with a display designed to keep the team as close as possible to the crowd, and incorporated the concept of breaking up and reforming while flying aerobatic manoeuvres. The team performed its first formation loop at the Air Spectacular at Fairyhouse in 1983. Formation aerobatics was continued in 1985 and 1986. The Silver Swallows were named during the Air Spectacular held at Baldonnel in August 1987. This same event saw the team again use a fourth Magister. The team made few appearances outside their own country during its existence, their first overseas display being carried out at the RAF Brawdy Open Day on 26 July 1990. Their next overseas displays didn't take place until 1997, when the team visited a number of airshows in the UK and Belgium to commemorate the Irish Air Corps' 75th anniversary. They appeared at the Royal International Air Tattoo at RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire, in 1997, where the team was awarded the prestigious Lockheed Martin Cannestra Trophy for the Best Display by an Overseas Performer. In 1998 the team was disbanded owing to the retirement of the Fouga Magister from Irish Air Corps service.

It is located north-east of Rome and has a population of about 23,000.  History  Mentana's name in ancient times was Nomentum, to which the Via Nomentana led from Rome. According to Livy, the town was part of the Latin League, which went to war with Rome during the reign of Rome's king Lucius Tarquinius Priscus. Nomentum was one of a number of towns captured by Tarquinius.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 1:38 It was a Latin town, but was considered by some to be Sabine, and, like Fidenae and Ficulea, was excluded from the first region by Augustus, who made the Anio river its northern boundary. The city was part of the League defeated by Rome in the Battle of Lake Regillus, and was captured definitively in 338 BC. Subsequently, Nomentum received the civitas sine suffragio; in its municipal constitution the chief magistrate even in imperial times bore the title of dictator. Pliny and Martial often praise the fertility of its neighbourhood. Seneca the Younger affirmed in multiple occasions having property and retreating to Nomentum .Seneca, Epistles, Seneca, Epistles, In 741 it was briefly occupied by the Lombards and the inhabitants moved to a new centre on the Via Nomentana which was more easily defendable. On 23 November 799, it was the site of the meeting of Pope Leo III and Charlemagne. The Castle of Nomentum was a possession of the Roman family of the Crescenzi in the 10th and 11th century. In 1058 it was destroyed by the Normans and the population was drastically reduced. The castle was acquired by the Capocci family and, later, the Holy See entrusted it to the Benedictine monks of San Paolo fuori le Mura. In the 15th century it was under control of the Orsini family. In 1484 it was damaged by an earthquake. In 1594 it became a fief of the Perett family, first under Michele Perett of Venafro, and then in 1655 it came under the control of Marcantonio Borghese and the House of Borghese.

In the 1970s, JJMA extended its capabilities to technical and program support of US Navy ship construction programs for the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) through an office in Arlington, Virginia. Success in naval programs support led to them as l further expansion with JJMA operations supporting NAVSEA in Pascagoula, MS, Bath, ME, Port Hueneme, CA, Newport News, VA and several other U.S. shipbuilding centers. JJMA also added a Houston, Texas operation to support the offshore oil industry, as well as specialty consulting services in New York for port planning, and support for naval modernization by allied nations. By 1982, JJMA had approximately 300 employees. By the mid-1980s, JJMA was active in naval combat systems installation integration and was a key member of the NAVSEA Battleship Modernization Program. In this period, a corporate headquarters building was acquired in Alexandria, VA. In 1988, JJMA was acquired by Talley Industries of Phoenix, AZ, who continued to operate it as a separate unit managed by the executive team that had successfully grown JJMA to almost seven hundred employees; mostly engineers and skilled designers. In 1998, when parent Talley Industries was acquired by Carpenter Steel, JJMA employees made an offer to purchase the company and JJMA became 100% employee-owned firm organized as an employee stock ownership plan.

The ensemble cast includes Ian Bannen, Ronald Fraser, Christian Marquand, Dan Duryea and George Kennedy as other passengers on the aircraft. Though the film was a failure at the box office, it has since gained a large cult following. Plot Frank Towns (James Stewart) is the pilot of a twin-engine Fairchild C-82 Packet cargo plane flying from Jaghbub to Benghazi in Libya; Lew Moran (Richard Attenborough) is the navigator. Passengers include Capt. Harris (Peter Finch) and Sgt. Watson (Ronald Fraser) of the British Army; Dr. Renaud (Christian Marquand), a physician; Heinrich Dorfmann (Hardy Kr√ºger), a German aeronautical engineer; and an oil company accountant named Standish (Dan Duryea). There are also several oil workers, including Trucker Cobb (Ernest Borgnine), a foreman suffering from mental fatigue; Ratbags Crow (Ian Bannen), a cocky Scot; Carlos (Alex Montoya) and his pet monkey; and Gabriel (Gabriele Tinti). A sudden sandstorm disables the engines, forcing Towns to crash-land in the desert. As the aircraft careens to a stop, two workers are killed and Gabriel's leg is severely injured. The radio is unusable, and the survivors are too far off course to be found by searchers. Aboard the plane is a large quantity of pitted dates but only enough water for ten to fifteen days if rationed. Captain Harris sets out to try and find an oasis. When Sgt. Watson feigns an injury to stay behind, Carlos volunteers, leaving his pet monkey with Crow. Harris and Towns refuse to allow the mentally unstable Cobb go along, but Cobb defiantly follows anyway and later dies of exposure in the desert. Days later, Harris returns to the crash site alone and barely alive. Sgt. Watson discovers and then ignores him, though others later find him. Meanwhile, Dorfmann proposes a radical idea: building a new aircraft from the wreckage. The C-82 has twin booms extending rearwards from each engine and connected by the horizontal stabilizer. Dorfmann wants to attach the outer sections of both wings to the left engine and left boom, discarding the center fuselage and both inner wing sections of the aircraft. The men will ride atop the wings. Harris and Moran believe he is either joking or delusional. The argument is complicated by a personality clash between Towns, a proud traditionalist aviator, and Dorfmann, a young arrogant engineer. Moran struggles to maintain the peace. Towns initially resists Dorfman's plan, though Renaud sways his opinion, saying activity and hope will help sustain the men's morale. Dorfmann supervises the reconstruction, while Towns remains skeptical. During the work, the fatally injured Gabriele commits suicide, depressing the men to where they consider abandoning the new plane's construction. Dorfmann, caught exceeding his water ration, justifies it, saying he has been the only one working continuously. He promises to not do it again but demands everyone work equally hard from here on. Standish christens the nearly-completed aircraft, \\"Phoenix\\", after the mythical bird that is reborn from its own ashes. When a band of Arabs camp nearby, Harris and Renaud leave to make contact while the others (and the aircraft) remain hidden. The two men are found murdered the next day. Additionally, Towns and Moran are stunned to learn that Dorfmann designs model airplanes rather than full-sized aircraft. Dorfmann defends himself, claiming the aerodynamic principles are the same, and many model planes require more exacting designs than full-size aircraft. With no other choice, Towne and Moran forge ahead with the plan without telling the others about Dorfmann. The Phoenix is completed but untested. Only seven starter cartridges are available to ignite the engine. The first four startup attempts are unsuccessful. Over Dorfman's vehement objections, Towns fires the fifth cartridge with the ignition off to clear the engine's cylinders. The next startup is successful. The men pull the Phoenix to a nearby hilltop, then climb onto the wings. When Towns guns the engine, the Phoenix slides down the hill and over a lake bed before taking off. After a successful landing at an oasis with a manned oil rig, the men celebrate and Towns and Dorfmann are reconciled. Cast * James Stewart as Capt.

Other filming locations, simulating the desert, were Buttercup Valley, Arizona and Pilot Knob Mesa, California. The flying sequences were all filmed at Pilot Knob Mesa near Winterhaven, located in California's Imperial Valley, on the western fringes of Yuma, Arizona. =Aircraft used= In 2005, Hollywood aviation historian Simon Beck identified the aircraft used in the film: * Fairchild C-82A Packet, N6887C ‚Äì flying shots. * Fairchild C-82A Packet, N4833V ‚Äì outdoor location wreck. * Fairchild C-82A Packet, N53228 ‚Äì indoor studio wreck. * Fairchild R4Q-1 Flying Boxcar (the USMC C-119C variant), BuNo. 126580 ‚Äì non-flying Phoenix prop. * Tallmantz Phoenix P-1, N93082 ‚Äì flying Phoenix aircraft. * North American O-47A, N4725V ‚Äì second flying Phoenix. The C-82As were from Steward-Davies Inc. at Long Beach, California, while the O-47A came from the Planes of Fame air museum in California. The R4Q-1 was purchased from Allied Aircraft of Phoenix, Arizona. The aerial camera platform was a B-25J Mitchell, N1042B, which was also used in the 1970 film Catch-22. The flying sequences were flown by Paul Mantz, co-owner of Tallmantz Aviation, filling in for his partner Frank Tallman, who had injured his leg. Famous racing/stunt/movie pilot and collector of warplanes Paul Mantz was flying the Tallmantz Phoenix P-1, the machine that was \\"made of the wreckage\\", in front of the cameras on the morning of July 8, 1965. He was performing touch-and-go landings, and on one touchdown the fuselage buckled. The movie model broke apart and cartwheeled, killing Mantz and seriously injuring stuntman Bobby Rose on board. Although principal photography was completed on August 13, 1965, in order to complete filming, a North American O-47A (N4725V) from the Planes of Fame Air Museum in Chino, California was modified and used as a flying Phoenix stand-in. With the canopy removed, a set of skids attached to the main landing gear as well as ventral fin added to the tail, it sufficed as more-or-less a visual lookalike. Filming using the O-47A was completed in October/November 1965. It appears in the last flying scenes, painted to look like the earlier Phoenix P-1. The final production used a mix of footage that included the O-47A, the \\"cobbled- together\\" Phoenix and Phoenix P-1. The final credit on the screen was, \\"It should be remembered... that Paul Mantz, a fine man and a brilliant flyer, gave his life in the making of this film...\\" Reception The film opened in selected theaters on December 15, 1965, with a full release in 1966. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times dismissed it as \\"grim and implausible\\", while Variety praised the film as an \\"often-fascinating and superlative piece of filmmaking highlighted by standout performances and touches that show producer-director at his best.\\"Variety staff (1964). Flight of the Phoenix, film review, Variety, December 31, 1964. Retrieved 2018-01-19. =Box Office= Aldrich says the film previewed well and everyone thought it was going to be a big hit but \\"it never took off\\" commercially. According to Fox records, the film needed to earn $10,800,000 in rentals to break even and made $4,855,000, meaning it made a loss.

Geography The municipality of Guidonia Montecelio, formed by the main towns of Guidonia and Montecelio, lies to the north-east of Rome, some kilometres from the Grande Raccordo Anulare - a ring-shaped motorway which forms a circle around the capital. The terrain of Guidonia Montecelio is mainly flat, and the community lies in between the Via Nomentana and the Via Tiburtina. It borders with Fonte Nuova, Marcellina, Palombara Sabina, Rome, San Polo dei Cavalieri, Sant'Angelo Romano and Tivoli. The hamlets (frazioni) are Albuccione, Bivio di Guidonia, Colle Fiorito, Colleverde, La Botte, Marco Simone, Montecelio, Pichini, Setteville, Setteville Nord, Villalba and Villanova. History Montecelio was founded in 998 as a fortified castrum (Castrum Monticellorum). In 1915 the Regio Esercito (Italian Royal Army) built a major military airport in the area for its Corpo Aeronautico Militare (Military Aviation Corps), the predecessor of the Italian Royal Air Force founded in 1923. Guidonia was erected as a comune in 1937 by Benito Mussolini, its name chosen to honour the Regia Aeronautica general Alessandro Guidoni (1880-1928), who had died on 27 April 1928 while testing a new parachute at the air force facilities. Economy Travertine caves in Guidonia. Today the town is part of the Rome metropolitan area, with a massive presence of industry (mainly travertine caves and cement industry) and the service sector. The number of residents commuting to Rome is high, with transport in a critical situation. Guidonia is also home to Marco Simone Golf and Country Club, which will host the Ryder Cup in 2022.

For example, the density of steel (a specific and intrinsic property) can be derived from measurements of the mass of a steel bar (an extrinsic property) divided by the volume of the bar (another extrinsic property). Similarly, the specific gravity of a liquid is derived from the density of the liquid divided by the density of water (two intrinsic properties). Uses of specific properties Reference tables: Specific properties are often used in reference tables as a means of recording material data in a manner that is independent of size or mass. This allows the data to be broadly applied while keeping the table compact. Ranking, Classifying, and Comparing: Specific properties are useful for making comparisons about one attribute while cancelling out the effect of variations in another attribute. For instance, steel alloys are typically stronger than aluminum alloys but are also much denser. Greater strength allows less metal to be used, which makes the choice between the two metals less than obvious. To simplify the comparison, one would compare the specific strength (strength to weight ratio) of the two metals. A more everyday example is grocery shopping. The two kilogram package sells for a higher price than the one kilogram package, but what matters is the \\"specific price\\", commonly called the unit cost (cost per kilogram). Mnemonics and Qualitative Reasoning: In many instances, specific properties are more intuitive or are easier to remember than the original properties in SI or English units. For instance, it is easier to conceptualize an acceleration of 2 g's than an acceleration of 19.6 meters per second squared. It is hard to remember that the specific gravity of water is 1.0 and that something with a higher specific gravity will sink in water. But if we understand it, it is very easy.

Notable residents Novelist, historian and Fellow of the Royal Historical Society, J. S. Fletcher (Joseph Smith Fletcher) was brought up in Darrington. Darrington today At the heart of the village is the village shop, the Spread Eagle pub, church and the school. Darrington Church of England Junior & Infant School has about 100 pupils. The Old School and Dovecote are now houses, and the mediaeval Tithe Barn is between the Old School and the church, now in a state of disrepair. Darrington is home to the Mid-Yorkshire Golf Club, the Kyte Hotel, the Darrington pub and hotel, the Spread Eagle public house, a branch of Ripon Farm Services and Darrington Quarries. The village has a community playing field which is home to the 'Feast and Fayre' once a year; this has a collection of stalls, a bouncy castle, dancing and many other types of entertainment. There is also a 5-mile run on the same day. The field is also the venue for an annual bonfire and firework display. These events bring in visitors from surrounding villages and raise money for the upkeep of the field and the purchase of new play equipment, etc. Although the Holly Cottage Post Office has closed, a post office is available on Monday and Thursday mornings on Phillips Lane. There have been many post office moves in the village. According to the Post Office Archives, the first post office in the village was opened in 1888; in 1889, it gained permission to deal with money orders. =St Luke and All Saints Church= Next to the school is the 13th century parish church of St Luke and All Saints, for the parish of Darrington with Wentbridge in the Benefice of the Went Valley.

He was, until recently, Evan Pugh Professor of Biology at Pennsylvania State University and Director of the Institute of Molecular Evolutionary Genetics; he was there from 1990 to 2015. Nei was born in 1931 in Miyazaki Prefecture, on Ky≈´sh≈´ Island, Japan. He was associate professor and professor of biology at Brown University from 1969 to 1972 and professor of population genetics at the Center for Demographic and Population Genetics, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth), from 1972 to 1990. Acting alone or working with his students, he has continuously developed statistical theories of molecular evolution taking into account discoveries in molecular biology. He has also developed concepts in evolutionary theory and advanced the theory of mutation-driven evolution. Together with Walter Fitch, Nei co-founded the journal Molecular Biology and Evolution in 1983 and the Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution in 1993. Work in population genetics =Theoretical studies= Nei was the first to show mathematically that, in the presence of gene interaction, natural selection always tends to enhance the linkage intensity between genetic loci or maintain the same linkage relationship. He then observed that the average recombination value per genome is generally lower in higher organisms than in lower organisms and attributed this observation to his theory of linkage modification. Recent molecular data indicate that many sets of interacting genes such as Hox genes, immunoglobulin genes, and histone genes have often existed as gene clusters for a long evolutionary time. This observation can also be explained by his theory of linkage modification. He also showed that, unlike R. A. Fisher's argument, deleterious mutations can accumulate rather quickly on the Y chromosome or duplicate genes in finite populations. In 1969, considering the rates of amino acid substitution, gene duplication, and gene inactivation, he predicted that higher organisms contain a large number of duplicate genes and nonfunctional genes (now called pseudogenes). This prediction was shown to be correct when many multigene families and pseudogenes were discovered in the 1980s and 1990s. His notable contribution in the early 1970s is the proposal of a new measure of genetic distance (Nei's distance) between populations and its use for studying evolutionary relationships of populations or closely related species. He later developed another distance measure called DA, which is appropriate for finding the topology of a phylogenetic tree of populations. He also developed statistics of measuring the extent of population differentiation for any types of mating system using the GST measure. In 1975, he and collaborators presented a mathematical formulation of population bottleneck effects and clarified the genetic meaning of bottleneck effects. In 1979, he proposed a statistical measure called nucleotide diversity, which is now widely used for measuring the extent of nucleotide polymorphism. He also developed several different models of speciation and concluded that the reproductive isolation between species occurs as a passive process of accumulation of interspecific incompatibility mutations =Protein polymorphism and neutral theory= In the early 1960s and 1970s, there was a great controversy over the mechanism of protein evolution and the maintenance of protein polymorphism. Nei and his collaborators developed various statistical methods for testing the neutral theory of molecular evolution using polymorphism data. Their analysis of the allele frequency distribution, the relationship between average heterozygosity and protein divergence between species, etc., showed that a large portion of protein polymorphism can be explained by neutral theory.Nei, M.

The only exception was the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) loci, which show an extraordinarily high degree of polymorphism. For these reasons, he accepted the neutral theory of evolution. Human evolution Using his genetic distance theory, he and A. K. Roychoudhury showed that the genetic variation between Europeans, Asians, and Africans is only about 11 percent of the total genetic variation of the human population. They then estimated that Europeans and Asians diverged about 55,000 years ago and these two populations diverged from Africans about 115,000 years ago. This conclusion was supported by many later studies using larger numbers of genes and populations, and the estimates appear to be still roughly correct. This finding represents the first indication of the out-of-Africa theory of human origins. Molecular phylogenetics Around 1980, Nei and his students initiated a study of inference of phylogenetic trees based on distance data. In 1985, they developed a statistical method for testing the accuracy of a phylogenetic tree by examining the statistical significance of interior branch lengths. They then developed the neighbor joining and minimum-evolution methods of tree inference. They also developed statistical methods for estimating evolutionary times from molecular phylogenies. In collaboration with Sudhir Kumar and Koichiro Tamura, he developed a widely used computer program package for phylogenetic analysis called MEGA.Kumar, S., K. Tamura, and M. Nei (1993) MEGA: Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis. Ver. 1.02, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA. MHC loci and positive Darwinian selection Nei's group invented a simple statistical method for detecting positive Darwinian selection by comparing the numbers of synonymous nucleotide substitutions and nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions. Applying this method, they showed that the exceptionally high degree of sequence polymorphism at MHC loci is caused by overdominant selection. Although various statistical methods for this test have been developed later, their original methods are still widely used.Nei, M. (2013) Mutation-Driven Evolution. Oxford University Press, Oxford. New evolutionary concepts Nei and his students studied the evolutionary patterns of a large number of multigene families and showed that they generally evolve following the model of a birth‚Äìdeath process.Nei, M. and A. P. Rooney (2005) Concerted and birth-and-death evolution of multigene families. In some gene families, this process is very fast, caused by random events of gene duplication and gene deletion and generates genomic drift of gene copy number. Nei has long maintained the view that the driving force of evolution is mutation, including any types of DNA changes (nucleotide changes, chromosomal changes, and genome duplication), and that natural selection is merely a force eliminating less fit genotypes (i.e., theory of mutation-driven evolution). He conducted statistical analyses of evolution of genes controlling phenotypic characters such as immunity and olfactory reception and obtained evidence supporting this theory.

It is available in some countries for oral administration. A transdermal preparation was approved for sale in Japan on January 2006. It was patented in 1977 and approved for medical use in 1986. Pharmacokinetics Loxoprofen is a prodrug. It is quickly converted to its active trans-alcohol metabolite following oral administration, and reaches its peak plasma concentration within 30 to 50 minutes. Mechanism of action As most NSAIDs, loxoprofen is a non-selective cyclooxygenase inhibitor, and works by reducing the synthesis of prostaglandins from arachidonic acid. Interactions Loxoprofen should not be administered at the same time as second-generation quinolone antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin, as it increases their inhibition of GABA and this may cause seizures. It may also increase the plasma concentration of warfarin, methotrexate, sulfonylurea derivatives and lithium salts, so care should be taken when loxoprofen is administered to patients taking any of these drugs. Brand names It is marketed in Brazil, Mexico and Japan by Sankyo as its sodium salt, loxoprofen sodium, under the trade name Loxonin; in Argentina as Oxeno; in India as Loxomac; in Thailand as Japrolox; and in Saudi Arabia as Roxonin.

The series combines elements of epic fantasy and dark fantasy as it follows an elite mercenary unit, The Black Company, through roughly forty years of its approximately four hundred-year history. Plot introduction Marching back after the defeat of the Dominator, the Black Company is down to just seven men. They go south, where the now powerless Lady briefly takes control of her Empire and where Croaker, the Annalist and Captain of the Company, is reunited with the Annals which hold the Company's history. Continuing their travels south in search of Khatovar, where Croaker is oathbound to return the annals, they are conscripted into service yet again by the crown prince of Taglios. Their commission is to defeat the advance of the conquering Shadowmasters from the south. Plot summary Following the defeat of the Dominator at the Barrowlands, the Black Company is down to just six men; Croaker, physician, annalist, and the newly elected captain; Goblin and One-Eye, company wizards; Otto and Hagop, company veterans; and Murgen, the company standard bearer. The Lady, formerly a powerful sorceress and ruler of the Empire of the North, follows along with the company, despondent as she deals with her newfound mortality. Having decided to journey to Khatovar, the long lost birthplace of the Black Company, the remaining members first travel with the Lady to the Tower at Charm, where the Lady returns the lost annals to Croaker. After relaxing at the Tower for several weeks while the Lady attends to business, Croaker eventually decides to leave without the Lady, arriving at Opal after a couple weeks. Before the Company sets sail across the Sea of Torments, however, the Lady surprises everyone by appearing to join Croaker for a romantic evening, joining them on their journey south. As the Company continues to travel south, they eventually reach the Temple of Traveler's Repose, where they are able to recover several volumes of annals that were lost long ago. Although the annals give insight into much of the Company's history, the annals containing the origin of the Company and the location of Khatovar are still missing. The Company's journey south continues through swamps and jungles, where they arrive at the city of Gea-Xle. Here, the company meets the offspring of previous Company members. The Nar, as they are called, are led by Mogaba, a powerful, athletic soldier who is as capable a leader as he is a soldier. The Nar join with the Company, who is recruited to help disperse pirates who have become a nuisance on the trade routes to the south. After outfitting a barge as a military vessel, the Company with their new recruits travels south along the river, where they encounter the pirates after a few days. The Company easily routs the pirates' first attack, but the pirates return a few days later with a vengeance, as well as with a powerful sorcerer on their side. Although the Company is able to defend the barge from the attacking pirates, the pirate sorcerer is too powerful for One-Eye and Goblin to deal with. When it looks like the battle will turn in favor of the pirates, Croaker confronts Lady about a friend she took on in Gea-Xle, who it turns out is the former Taken Shapeshifter. With Shifter's help, the enemy sorcerer is forced to flee, upon which the Company realizes they were dealing with another former Taken in The Howler. Continuing south, the Company meets two northerners by the names of Willow Swan and Cordy Mather, as well as their friend Blade, who are escorting the Radisha Drah, a noble from the city of Taglios. When the Company reaches Taglios, they are greeted as returning champions by the populace. Croaker, naturally suspicious, meets with the crown prince, the Prahbrindrah Drah, who is in cahoots with Swan and Mather. The Prahbrindrah Drah tries to convince the Company to help them defend Taglios from the invading Shadowmasters, a group of sorcerers from the south that threaten the city. After scouting the area for themselves, Croaker is convinced that the only way to Khatovar is through the Shadowlands, and the Black Company is forced to join forces with the Taglians to try to fight their way through the Shadowlands. After a monumental effort trying to train the Taglians into soldiers, the Black Company wins a couple of dramatic victories over the invading armies of the Shadowmasters, and so the Company presses the attack into the Shadowlands. After arriving at the city of Stormguard (previously Dejagore), the Company encounters another enemy army and the first of the Shadowmasters. While the Company prepares to attack, Croaker and Lady, who have been developing a tenuous relationship throughout the journey south, finally consummate their relationship the night before the attack. The following morning, the Company wins another battle against the enemy armies, and Croaker prepares a trick to enter the city that night. With the ruse working to perfection, the Company storms the castle at Stormguard, where they find Shifter and one of the enemy Shadowmasters tangled in battle. It turns out the Shadowmaster is in fact the Taken called Stormbringer, who was previously thought to have been dead. She and Shapeshifter fight to near- death, and when they are both weakened One-Eye knocks them both unconscious, and then disposes of them both. The following day, another Shadowmaster army approaches from the south, and the Black Company prepares for a final battle to break the last of the Shadowmaster forces. In the ensuing battle, it appears that the Company will eventually win, but the fighting becomes chaotic. During the melee, the Lady is swarmed by opponents, and Croaker, who is shot in the chest by an arrow, is abducted by the former Taken Soulcatcher.

It originated with and was written by the creator of Scrubs, Bill Lawrence, as well as Neil Goldman and Garrett Donovan, writers for Scrubs and Family Guy.  Program history  The pilot was developed for the WB Television Network, but network executives passed on the show for the 2005 schedule after test audiences seemed to be confused by its premise. However, in June 2006, the pilot was leaked onto YouTube and quickly attracted attention from viewers around the world. On July 3, a report in the New York Times suggested that the show could yet make it to a full series, thanks to the positive response from YouTube viewers. During the Friday, July 21, 2006, broadcast of Last Call with Carson Daly, guests Neil Goldman, Taran Killam and Paul Campbell called NBC president Kevin Reilly on air, who seemed to confirm an interest in the series. He later recanted, but a deal was struck to produce webisodes. Webisodes of varying length were released until January 12, 2007. In an interview with TV Squad,Joel Keller, \\"Bill Lawrence of Scrubs: The TV Squad Interview\\", TV Squad, January 17, 2007 Lawrence divulged that NBC would broadcast a live TV special in March 2007. However in February 2007, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that the executive producer Bill Lawrence had voiced concerns that the show would not be broadcast and this was eventually confirmed by an NBC spokesperson who said, \\"The project is not going forward.\\" Lawrence also said that the actors' contracts would expire at the end of February. There has been no live TV special as of December 2017. \\"Derrick\\" and \\"Will\\" have been extras on other NBC produced series such as Days of Our Lives and Scrubs.  Plot  The show is about two friends from Union, Ohio, named Derrick (Taran Killam) and Will (Paul Campbell), who send a home video to every network, claiming they can produce a better sitcom than the ones currently being broadcast. The WB takes them up on this offer. Derrick and Will are taken to The WB studios, where they meet the head of The WB, Jeff Tucker (Paul Adelstein), Creative VP Roy Ingold (Bob Clendenin), and Tucker's assistant, whom he introduces as Jill Something (Lauren Bittner). Tucker tells them to create their own sitcom, while working in various sitcom-related sets. In addition, a reality show will be made about their sitcom's birth. Thus, the pair has a camera crew following them around The WB studios, when they are not on the sets, and a live studio audience, when they are working on the sets. After setting the scene, the rest of the episode focuses on Derrick and Will's first day trying to come up with a sitcom. Over the course of the episode, they hire Jill Something as their assistant and make a pity-hire of Mandy (Mircea Monroe), who had just been fired from The WB gift shop. Meanwhile, Tucker and Ingold interfere by trying to introduce narrative conflicts into the show. Tucker tells Derrick he would rather continue the show without Will and demands that Mandy kiss Will, even though she prefers Derrick. The title of the show is explained in the last scene: the cast is hanging out in the sitcom set, with the live audience reacting as if it is an actual show, which Mandy thinks is weird but is told to just pretend that \\"nobody's watching\\". Will says that \\"nobody's watching\\" is a perfect name for the sitcom they are developing (thus, Nobody's Watching is the name of the fake sitcom in the fake reality television show, Nobody's Watching). Derrick protests that \\"nobody's watching\\" is a terrible name, because critics will constantly ridicule them with comments like \\"nobody's watching Nobody's Watching!\\" He declares that it would be insane to name a television show that. This is immediately followed by the announcer saying \\"Next week, on Nobody's Watching!...\\"  Characters  * Derrick: Derrick is twenty-five and plays straight man to Will's wacky naivet√©. Although the two were social opposites, they bonded through watching television (they can talk about an episode of Seinfeld for hours). He was accepted to the University of Notre Dame but went to community college instead because he was afraid to leave home. Though he was a nerd in school (described as \\"indoorsy\\" by Will so Derrick's feelings would not be hurt) and a self- confessed \\"25-year-old single loser who works in his dad's mini-mart\\", Derrick has a more tough guy persona than Will and refuses to share his feelings on camera or with Will, while Will frequently goes to a \\"weird, overly emotional place\\". Both he and Will worked at Derrick's father's convenience store after graduation, but Derrick seems more adverse to that fact than Will. He is also very ambitious, saying without hesitation that he would drop Will from the project if the network thought he was not working out. His reason for this betrayal is that if he loses the sitcom deal, he is not optimistic enough to recover from the loss and try again, while the more popular, more handsome, and more charismatic Will would recover quickly and go on to do better things. Derrick and Will also have a 15-year-old game of 'made ya' look!' that Derrick is currently winning by seven looks; they spread the game to include Jill and Mandy, who fall for it every time. * Will: Will is Derrick's best friend. The two became best friends when Will had to hang out at Derrick's house after school because his mother worked overtime at the Cracker Barrel. Will does not have a father, which Derrick tries not to mention because it seems a sensitive issue, but Will at first does not seem to have any qualms about it; he mentions his father's absence almost too casually, with phrases like, \\"I'd call my dad right now if I had one\\" and constructing his favorite game ('made ya' look!') around it: \\"Made you look! I don't have a dad!\\". Later, it is revealed that famous television fathers, such as Uncle Phil from Fresh Prince of Bel Air, were Will's father figures growing up; when he first meets Alan Thicke, who played the father on Growing Pains, he accidentally calls him 'Dad'. Will is described as a \\"typical jock\\" (while Derrick was \\"indoorsy\\"), but is anything but typical when it comes to the stereotype; he is not unintelligent but rather charmingly oblivious. Unlike Derrick, Will is also overly optimistic, overly emotional, and overly sympathetic; he is unafraid to tell Derrick how much he loves him and would rather have fun and fool around on set than concentrate on the sitcom. Jeff Tucker and Roy Ingold decide to secretly focus a portion of the sex appeal on the show on Will, because Will is so good looking (he is described as \\"boyishly handsome\\" and \\"playfully yummy\\" by the executives). Will is a huge fan of Growing Pains, much to Derrick's annoyance. Will's primary father figure was in fact Dr. Jason Seaver. * Jill Something: Jill was Jeff Tucker's assistant, but now works with Will and Derrick on the sitcom project. She is methodical, business-like and, like Derrick, very ambitious. Even though she is only 24, she has already been the personal assistant of two network executives in Hollywood. Even though Will and Derrick are technically her employers, she takes the dominating role on the project, much to Derrick's annoyance; Will, on the other hand, continually asks her permission to do things (such as walking around the office barefoot). Will also ignores Jill's professionalism and often urges her to fool around with him on set. Jill makes it known that she has had to work hard to be where she is because she refuses to climb the corporate ladder the easy way by exploiting her femininity, but Derrick is also quick to point out she's never formed an emotional connection with anyone while working either. He also knows that Jill secretly wants to have a boss that appreciates her, which she apparently thought Tucker did until he let her switch jobs so easily. Jill admits to Will, with whom she has made a connection, that she has never had a friend who was as close to her as Will is to Derrick but she always wished she did. It is unclear if Jill's last name really is 'Something' or if her boss just could not remember her name when introducing her. * Mandy: Derrick's love interest and former WB giftshop employee, Mandy was fired after she insisted that men would not buy underwear that said Smallville across the front (though Will immediately insists that he would buy ones that said Everwood). Mandy moved to Hollywood to live with her previous boyfriend, who turned out to be an abusive carjacker, and had been living there a month when she was hired by Will and Derrick. Will met her while she was soaking wet after being caught in the lawn sprinklers and sobbing; he dubs her 'wet girl' and immediately hires her out pity. She then goes to the WB wardrobe department to get dry clothes, where Jeff Tucker has the wardrobe director dress her in revealing clothing. This revealing clothing attracts Derrick's attention, and instead of being mad at Will for hiring her, he lets her stay and begins to harbor a crush on her. Jill dislikes Mandy because Mandy claims that she has had to work hard at life and Jill makes it clear later that Mandy's stunning face and body has made life a lot easier for her. It is revealed in the third act of the pilot episode that Mandy is actually an actress planted within the reality show to create more sex appeal, though her story about the abusive boyfriend is true. It is also implied that, over the last year, Mandy has had extensive makeovers and plastic surgery to improve her previous look (which was so ugly, it provoked a \\"yikes!\\" out of Ingold). Despite this, Mandy finds she really does have feelings for Derrick, but the network execs push her to kiss Will because he is better looking. It is revealed in the pilot's epilogue, that Mandy and Derrick kiss in the studio bathroom in what would have been the second episode. * Jeff Tucker: the WB's ruthless network head, he decides to film Will and Derrick's sitcom-within-a- sitcom. He also decides to film himself and his VP Roy Ingold so the audience at home can see how networks pull the strings on reality shows. He set up Derrick and Will's show to be sponsored by Snapple, and pulls out the drink for product placement when he can. At one point, he tries to create drama on the show by telling Derrick the plug on the project will be pulled if Will does not leave and encourages Mandy to kiss Will even though she has a crush on Derrick. He relishes the power of his high position and, at one point, Derrick's rhetorical \\"Oh, God, thank you\\" is met by Tucker with a \\"You're welcome\\". Tucker is revealed on camera to have a fondness for prostitutes by Ingold. In the pilot's epilogue, Tucker reveals he has been criticized for not having a minority character of the show and he has Will and Derrick interview dozens of black men to become their 'office manager' to help with their sitcom. The character is named after Jeff Zucker, president of NBC. * Roy Ingold: Ingold is creative VP at the WB and is Tucker's right-hand man. He secretly dislikes the callous and cold-hearted Tucker but constantly plays sidekick to him. He is uncomfortable around the television camera filming his boss and him, and Tucker is always quietly but sternly reminding him to stop staring at the camera. The character is named after Jeff Ingold, Senior Vice President of Comedy Development at NBC.  Format  The program is filmed in a mockumentary style, as if Will and Derrick are on a reality TV show. The program's plot actually relies on many instances of \\"breaking the fourth wall\\", with Derrick and Will frequently communicating with the studio audience. In addition, there are many references to other popular sitcoms such as Yes, Dear (Will and Derrick's euphemism for the word \\"shit\\"). In the pilot episode, Derrick and Will even find their way onto (a replica of) the Central Perk set and meet James Michael Tyler (Gunther from Friends), although Jill simply brushes him off. Later in the episode, Will runs into James L. Avery Sr. (Uncle Phil from The Fresh Prince of Bel Air), Tom Bosley (Howard Cunningham from Happy Days) and Alan Thicke (Dr. Jason Seaver from Growing Pains). Nobody's Watching uses its laugh track in a non-standard way. It is only used in the scenes featuring the studio audience and the recording of the sitcom within the sitcom. As the studio audience are, in effect, extra cast members, there are instances where their laughter - or otherwise - does not relate to the action the viewer is shown. Examples in the pilot episode include a scene where Alan Thicke performs to the studio audience in the background while the main scene of Will talking to Jill takes place in front of the camera. In another scene the main characters can react to the audience's reaction, which prompts Jill, after insulting Gunther, to apologize. When they see the tape of Derrick betraying Will, the audience moans disapprovingly, which prompts Derrick to call them \\"drama queens\\". In another scene, Will and Derrick enjoy naming random states and seeing how many people in the audience cheer to show state pride. A great deal of the humor stems from the many layers on which the fourth wall is broken. Will and Derrick think they are making a sitcom, and think that the live studio audience and the sets are part of a \\"making of\\" reality TV show, though Tucker has told his VP Roy that the reality TV show is the real show, and has no serious plans to make Will and Derrick's sitcom. Will and Derrick constantly overact, which during extended \\"sitcom mode\\" sequences seems odd. However, scenes in Tucker's office are also shot as part of the reality show, though he tries to downplay this by never acknowledging the cameras (a mistake Roy constantly makes). However, several times they break through a second fourth wall, talking not only to the viewers of the sitcom-style live studio audience, but straight to the actual viewers of the real series.

The idea behind Nanocomposite is to use building blocks with dimensions in nanometre range to design and create new materials with unprecedented flexibility and improvement in their physical properties. In the broadest sense this definition can include porous media, colloids, gels and copolymers, but is more usually taken to mean the solid combination of a bulk matrix and nano-dimensional phase(s) differing in properties due to dissimilarities in structure and chemistry. The mechanical, electrical, thermal, optical, electrochemical, catalytic properties of the nanocomposite will differ markedly from that of the component materials. Size limits for these effects have been proposed: in Kelly, A, Concise encyclopedia of composites materials, Elsevier Science Ltd, 1994 #<5 nm for catalytic activity #<20 nm for making a hard magnetic material soft #<50 nm for refractive index changes #<100 nm for achieving superparamagnetism, mechanical strengthening or restricting matrix dislocation movement Nanocomposites are found in nature, for example in the structure of the abalone shell and bone. The use of nanoparticle-rich materials long predates the understanding of the physical and chemical nature of these materials. Jose-Yacaman et al. investigated the origin of the depth of colour and the resistance to acids and bio-corrosion of Maya blue paint, attributing it to a nanoparticle mechanism. From the mid-1950s nanoscale organo-clays have been used to control flow of polymer solutions (e.g. as paint viscosifiers) or the constitution of gels (e.g. as a thickening substance in cosmetics, keeping the preparations in homogeneous form). By the 1970s polymer/clay composites were the topic of textbooks,B.K.G. Theng \\"Formation and Properties of Clay Polymer Complexes\\", Elsevier, NY 1979; Functional Polymer Composites with Nanoclays, Editors: Yuri Lvov, Baochun Guo, Rawil F Fakhrullin, Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge 2017, https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/ebook/978-1-78262-672-5 although the term \\"nanocomposites\\" was not in common use. In mechanical terms, nanocomposites differ from conventional composite materials due to the exceptionally high surface to volume ratio of the reinforcing phase and/or its exceptionally high aspect ratio. The reinforcing material can be made up of particles (e.g. minerals), sheets (e.g. exfoliated clay stacks) or fibres (e.g. carbon nanotubes or electrospun fibres). The area of the interface between the matrix and reinforcement phase(s) is typically an order of magnitude greater than for conventional composite materials. The matrix material properties are significantly affected in the vicinity of the reinforcement. Ajayan et al. note that with polymer nanocomposites, properties related to local chemistry, degree of thermoset cure, polymer chain mobility, polymer chain conformation, degree of polymer chain ordering or crystallinity can all vary significantly and continuously from the interface with the reinforcement into the bulk of the matrix. This large amount of reinforcement surface area means that a relatively small amount of nanoscale reinforcement can have an observable effect on the macroscale properties of the composite. For example, adding carbon nanotubes improves the electrical and thermal conductivity. Other kinds of nanoparticulates may result in enhanced optical properties, dielectric properties, heat resistance or mechanical properties such as stiffness, strength and resistance to wear and damage. In general, the nano reinforcement is dispersed into the matrix during processing. The percentage by weight (called mass fraction) of the nanoparticulates introduced can remain very low (on the order of 0.5% to 5%) due to the low filler percolation threshold, especially for the most commonly used non-spherical, high aspect ratio fillers (e.g. nanometer-thin platelets, such as clays, or nanometer-diameter cylinders, such as carbon nanotubes). The orientation and arrangement of asymmetric nanoparticles, thermal property mismatch at the interface, interface density per unit volume of nanocomposite, and polydispersity of nanoparticles significantly affect the effective thermal conductivity of nanocomposites. Ceramic-matrix nanocomposites Ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) consist of ceramic fibers embedded in a ceramic matrix. The matrix and fibers can consist of any ceramic material, including carbon and carbon fibers. The ceramic occupying most of the volume is often from the group of oxides, such as nitrides, borides, silicides, whereas the second component is often a metal. Ideally both components are finely dispersed in each other in order to elicit particular optical, electrical and magnetic properties as well as tribological, corrosion-resistance and other protective properties. The binary phase diagram of the mixture should be considered in designing ceramic- metal nanocomposites and measures have to be taken to avoid a chemical reaction between both components. The last point mainly is of importance for the metallic component that may easily react with the ceramic and thereby lose its metallic character. This is not an easily obeyed constraint because the preparation of the ceramic component generally requires high process temperatures. The safest measure thus is to carefully choose immiscible metal and ceramic phases. A good example of such a combination is represented by the ceramic-metal composite of TiO2 and Cu, the mixtures of which were found immiscible over large areas in the Gibbs‚Äô triangle of ' Cu-O-Ti. The concept of ceramic-matrix nanocomposites was also applied to thin films that are solid layers of a few nm to some tens of ¬µm thickness deposited upon an underlying substrate and that play an important role in the functionalization of technical surfaces. Gas flow sputtering by the hollow cathode technique turned out as a rather effective technique for the preparation of nanocomposite layers. The process operates as a vacuum-based deposition technique and is associated with high deposition rates up to some ¬µm/s and the growth of nanoparticles in the gas phase. Nanocomposite layers in the ceramics range of composition were prepared from TiO2 and Cu by the hollow cathode technique that showed a high mechanical hardness, small coefficients of friction and a high resistance to corrosion. Metal-matrix nanocomposites Metal matrix nanocomposites can also be defined as reinforced metal matrix composites. This type of composites can be classified as continuous and non-continuous reinforced materials. One of the more important nanocomposites is Carbon nanotube metal matrix composites, which is an emerging new material that is being developed to take advantage of the high tensile strength and electrical conductivity of carbon nanotube materials. Critical to the realization of CNT- MMC possessing optimal properties in these areas are the development of synthetic techniques that are (a) economically producible, (b) provide for a homogeneous dispersion of nanotubes in the metallic matrix, and (c) lead to strong interfacial adhesion between the metallic matrix and the carbon nanotubes. In addition to carbon nanotube metal matrix composites, boron nitride reinforced metal matrix composites and carbon nitride metal matrix composites are the new research areas on metal matrix nanocomposites.S. R. Bakshi, D. Lahiri, and A. Argawal, Carbon nanotube reinforced metal matrix composites - A Review, International Materials Reviews, vol. 55, (2010), http://web.eng.fiu.edu/agarwala/PDF/2010/12.pdf A recent study, comparing the mechanical properties (Young's modulus, compressive yield strength, flexural modulus and flexural yield strength) of single- and multi-walled reinforced polymeric (polypropylene fumarate‚ÄîPPF) nanocomposites to tungsten disulfide nanotubes reinforced PPF nanocomposites suggest that tungsten disulfide nanotubes reinforced PPF nanocomposites possess significantly higher mechanical properties and tungsten disulfide nanotubes are better reinforcing agents than carbon nanotubes. Increases in the mechanical properties can be attributed to a uniform dispersion of inorganic nanotubes in the polymer matrix (compared to carbon nanotubes that exist as micron sized aggregates) and increased crosslinking density of the polymer in the presence of tungsten disulfide nanotubes (increase in crosslinking density leads to an increase in the mechanical properties). These results suggest that inorganic nanomaterials, in general, may be better reinforcing agents compared to carbon nanotubes. Another kind of nanocomposite is the energetic nanocomposite, generally as a hybrid sol‚Äìgel with a silica base, which, when combined with metal oxides and nano-scale aluminum powder, can form superthermite materials. Polymer-matrix nanocomposites In the simplest case, appropriately adding nanoparticulates to a polymer matrix can enhance its performance, often dramatically, by simply capitalizing on the nature and properties of the nanoscale filler (these materials are better described by the term nanofilled polymer composites). This strategy is particularly effective in yielding high performance composites, when uniform dispersion of the filler is achieved and the properties of the nanoscale filler are substantially different or better than those of the matrix. The uniformity of the dispersion is in all nanocomposites is counteracted by thermodynamically driven phase separation. Clustering of nanoscale fillers produces aggregates that serve as structural defects and result in failure. Layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly when nanometer scale layers of nanoparticulates and a polymers are added one by one. LbL composites display performance parameters 10-1000 times better that the traditional nanocomposites made by extrusion or batch-mixing. Nanoparticles such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, molybdenum disulfide and tungsten disulfide are being used as reinforcing agents to fabricate mechanically strong biodegradable polymeric nanocomposites for bone tissue engineering applications. The addition of these nanoparticles in the polymer matrix at low concentrations (~0.2 weight %) cause significant improvements in the compressive and flexural mechanical properties of polymeric nanocomposites. Potentially, these nanocomposites may be used as a novel, mechanically strong, light weight composite as bone implants. The results suggest that mechanical reinforcement is dependent on the nanostructure morphology, defects, dispersion of nanomaterials in the polymer matrix, and the cross-linking density of the polymer. In general, two-dimensional nanostructures can reinforce the polymer better than one-dimensional nanostructures, and inorganic nanomaterials are better reinforcing agents than carbon based nanomaterials. In addition to mechanical properties, polymer nanocomposites based on carbon nanotubes or graphene have been used to enhance a wide range of properties, giving rise to functional materials for a wide range of high added value applications in fields such as energy conversion and storage, sensing and biomedical tissue engineering. For example, multi-walled carbon nanotubes based polymer nanocomposites have been used for the enhancement of the electrical conductivity. Nanoscale dispersion of filler or controlled nanostructures in the composite can introduce new physical properties and novel behaviors that are absent in the unfilled matrices. This effectively changes the nature of the original matrix (such composite materials can be better described by the term genuine nanocomposites or hybrids). Some examples of such new properties are fire resistance or flame retardancy,\\"Flame Retardant Polymer Nanocomposites\\" A. B. Morgan, C. A. Wilkie (eds.), Wiley, 2007; and accelerated biodegradability. A range of polymeric nanocomposites are used for biomedical applications such as tissue engineering, drug delivery, cellular therapies. Due to unique interactions between polymer and nanoparticles, a range of property combinations can be engineered to mimic native tissue structure and properties. A range of natural and synthetic polymers are used to design polymeric nanocomposites for biomedical applications including starch, cellulose, alginate, chitosan, collagen, gelatin, and fibrin, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), poly(caprolactone) (PCL), poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), and poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS). A range of nanoparticles including ceramic, polymeric, metal oxide and carbon-based nanomaterials are incorporated within polymeric network to obtain desired property combinations. Magnetic nanocomposites Nanocomposites that can respond to an external stimulus are of increased interest due to the fact that, because of the large amount of interaction between the phase interfaces, the stimulus response can have a larger effect on the composite as a whole. The external stimulus can take many forms, such as a magnetic, electrical, or mechanical field. Specifically, magnetic nanocomposites are useful for use in these applications due to the nature of magnetic material's ability to respond both to electrical and magnetic stimuli. The penetration depth of a magnetic field is also high, leading to an increased area that the nanocomposite is affected by and therefore an increased response. In order to respond to a magnetic field, a matrix can be easily loaded with nanoparticles or nanorods The different morphologies for magnetic nanocomposite materials are vast, including matrix dispersed nanoparticles, core-shell nanoparticles, colloidal crystals, macroscale spheres, or janus-type nanostructures. Magnetic nanocomposites can be utilized in a vast number of applications, including catalytic, medical, and technical. For example, palladium is a common transition metal used in catalysis reactions. Magnetic nanoparticle-supported palladium complexes can be used in catalysis to increase the efficiency of the palladium in the reaction. Magnetic nanocomposites can also be utilized in the medical field, with magnetic nanorods embedded in a polymer matrix can aid in more precise drug delivery and release. Finally, magnetic nanocomposites can be used in high frequency/high temperature applications. For example, multi-layer structures can be fabricated for use in electronic applications. An electrodeposited Fe/Fe oxide multi-layered sample can be an example of this application of magnetic nanocomposites. Heat resistant nanocomposites In the recent years nanocomposites have been designed to withstand high temperatures by the addition of Carbon Dots (CDs) in the polymer matrix. Such nanocomposites can be utilized in environments wherein high temperature resistance is a prime criterion.

The complex consists of a mosque, t√ºrbe, madrasah, kitchen and bath. The name Green Mosque comes from its green and blue interior tile decorations.  History  The Green Mosque is often seen as the culmination of the early Ottoman architectural style, mainly due to the level of aesthetic and technical mastery displayed within the mosque. The Green Mosque was commissioned in 1412 by Sultan Mehmed I √áelebi, who ruled from 1413 to 1421, after a fight against his brothers to reunite the Ottoman Empire. Mehmed I was buried in a mausoleum, called the Green Tomb, commissioned by his son and successor, Murad II, which resides in the complex. The Green Mosque's exact completion date is uncertain, but it was built between 1419 and 1424. Decorative work continued on the mosque after Mehmed I's death. The construction of the Green Mosque was supervised by architect and patron of the arts vizier Hacƒ± ƒ∞vaz Pasha, who had been a commander under Mehmed I. A calligraphic inscription identifies Nakkas (the Artist) Ali bin Ilyas Ali as the supervisor of the interior tile decorations. Ali bin Ilyas Ali is believed to have brought a diverse group of craftsmen called the ‚ÄúMasters of Tabriz‚Äù to assist him. The \\"Masters of Tabriz\\" are referenced in a Persian inscription above the mosque's mihrab. Tabriz, a prominent artistic and cultural center in western Iran, was a particularly important channel through which Timurid influence arrived at the Green Mosque, as it was invaded by the Timurids throughout the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Hacƒ± ƒ∞vaz Pasha was also reported to have ‚Äúbrought masters and men of skill from foreign lands‚Äù to help with the mosque's construction, according to 15th-century historian A≈üƒ±kpa≈üazade. A Persian inscription inside the royal loge identifies Mehmet el-Mecnun as the artist who decorated the ceramics of the mosque. The Green Mosque is now a popular tourist destination in Bursa, which was recently named a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  Architecture  Watch a Video: Green Mosque of Bursa, 2017. = Layout = The Green Mosque is based on an inverted T-plan and is a two-story, cube-shaped building with an extension on the south side. The mosque has a vestibule at the entrance leading up a short staircase to a central prayer hall. This stairway has four marble cubby-holes (Turkish: papu√ßluk) on each side for slippers. These architectural inclusions point to the court being paved previously, although it is now carpeted. The central hall, which runs from north to south, is flanked by iwans (Turkish: eyvans) on the east and west. Both are domed and two stories high. There are two doors, smaller iwans, connecting to corner rooms on the first floor that are similar to those on the north side of the building, each containing a fireplace. The central hallway running north‚Äìsouth is intersected by a longer hallway running east‚Äìwest. Within the central hallway, the main hall contains an octagonal, white marble fountain with a pool beneath the central dome‚Äîthe highest dome in the mosque‚Äîwhich is illuminated by a lantern overhead. On either side of the pool, two further iwans lead to rooms for traveling dervishes, while a higher raised iwan directly behind the water (when seen from the central hall's entrance) leads to the prayer hall itself. In this iwan, there is a mihrab niche on the south (qibla) side of the mosque, as well as two sets of four windows. Immediately past the entrance of the Green Mosque lies a foyer. From here, wide corridors, framed by Byzantine columns, extend in both directions, ending in staircases leading to the royal chambers. These corner rooms overlook the interior court, and connect to yet another small room leading to the royal box, which effectively functions as another iwan. These chambers contain the winding stairways leading up to the lofts. Between these corner rooms, a passage opens to the balconies on the northern fa√ßade where the minaret steps begin. The two minarets opposite from each other on the north facade were later additions. A porch was designed but never built. = Exterior = Marble panels, a majority of which were replaced in the nineteenth century, overlay the mosque's edifice of hewn sandstone. The door is crowned by a half-dome with a cascade of muqarnas, whose face is covered with arabesques and Rumi inscriptions. Above the niches on each side of the entrance door is an inscription dedicated to Hacƒ± ƒ∞vaz Pasha, the mosque's designer. Between the inscription and the muqarnas is a small window that illuminates the path to the sultan's box. The domes on top of the building were originally covered by blue and green tiles but are now clad in lead. There are windows pierced into drums in the domes and on the exterior walls. An oculus above the ablution basin in the central hall was enclosed with a lantern at the time of restoration. The two minarets were fitted with stone spires, carved in the baroque manner, at the time of renovation. They can only be accessed through the sultan's apartments and by climbing up the winding stairs to the attics.  Decorations  184x184px = Tiles =  Overview  mahfils that flank the opening to the prayer hall.203x203px The Green Mosque employs a distinctively diverse range of tile techniques (including black-line tiles (often mistaken for, yet technically separate from cuerda seca tiles), monochrome underglaze tiles, mosaic, and painted terra-cotta relief) and colors (including green, blue, turquoise, white, yellow, light purple, and dark purple). The black-line tiles, which compose the majority of the tiles within the mosque, reflect an extensive Timurid influence that emerged through the empire's frequent invasions of Ottoman territories. This influence can also be observed in Timurid ceramics and architecture in Central Asia, such as the mausolea within the Shah-i Zinda shrine complex. Moreover, an inscription above the mihrab designates the black-line tiles as ‚Äúamal-i ustƒÅdhƒÅn-i Tabrƒ´z‚Äù (work of the masters of Tabriz). Meanwhile, the blue- and turquoise-glazed tiles in the entrance hallway and iwans, as well as the gold- adorned green hexagonal tiles in the iwans, reveal a Seljuk influence (which can also be observed in the Karatay Madrasa in Konya). 187x187px  Interior tile decoration  In the hallway connecting the vestibule to the prayer hall, dark green hexagonal tiles cover the walls, punctuated by a large roundel in the center of each wall. These roundels feature an intricate floral arabesque in black-line tiles glazed in white, yellow, green, and blue. The recessed mahfils that flank the opening into the prayer hall are covered in similar dark green hexagonal wainscot tiles with gold decoration, with a large, intricate arabesque on each ceiling. More of these dark green hexagonal wainscot tiles, each decorated with a thick layer of gold overlay, cover the large iwans flanking the prayer hall. A narrow floral black-line band surrounds these tiles, topped by a larger black-line band featuring a white and gold inscription upon a blue background. In the prayer hall itself, dark green hexagonal and triangular tiles (including some nineteenth and thirteenth century replacements) cover the lower portions of the walls. The mihrab and its moulded tile frame feature a wide array of tile styles, shapes, and colors. Square black-line tiles, glazed in blue, purple, white, and yellow, cover the mihrab's interior with geometric motifs. Equally colorful vegetal arabesques, composed of square and rectangular black-line tiles, decorate the spandrels. The mihrab niche's twelve rows of muqarnas and two ribbed columns feature similarly intricate and colorful tilework. In the sultan's loge, the walls and ceiling are covered in gilded black-line tiles that depict motifs of stars and polygons. In contrast to these geometric motifs, the black-tile border around the opening into the mosque is decorated with vegetal motifs.193x193px 189x189px = Carvings = Carved decorations exist along all exterior elements of the mosque, from the entryway to the mihrabs to the window frames. The front portal of the mosque is made of carved marble and features a tall, recessed muqarnas niche, with unique marble tympana (decorated with arabesques) framing the flanking windows. This portal, framed with floral carvings and scripture, references similar portals found in Seljuk mosques, madrasas, and mausolea. The two tabhane rooms connected to the central hallway, designed to provide lodging for travelers, contain carved plaster niches and ocaks (fireplaces with a tall hood). A three-line calligraphic inscription is put in an arch over one of its doors.  Restorations  Due to the 7.5 magnitude Bursa earthquake of 1855, the complex underwent extensive renovations planned by French architect and artist L√©on Parvill√©e, beginning in 1863. The exact completion date is unknown. Ahmet Vefik Pa≈üa, the regional administrator of west Anatolia and a patron of the preservation of Ottoman cultural heritage, asked Parvill√©e to restore the major fourteenth and fifteenth century royal monuments of the city. During this period, Bursa was undergoing a transformation into a modern city. Parvill√©e first visited the Ottoman capital of Istanbul in 1851, later moving there in 1855. He worked in the empire as a decorator, contractor and architect. Parvill√©e was well-versed in the main aspects of early Ottoman style due to his experiences living and working in the region as well as his extensive research of the subject. The French consul of Bursa stated in 1906 that Parvill√©e remained in Bursa from 1862 to 1867, but this is disputed. It is unclear whether Parvill√©e merely planned the restoration and then left Bursa, or stayed to supervise the execution of his specifications. In any case, it is documented that Parvill√©e had returned to Paris by 1867 to design and build the Turkish pavilion displayed in the Exposition Universelle. Parvill√©e was involved in restoring the interior and the exterior of the mosque, including the tile work. Parvill√©e restored the black-line tiles on the portal of the mosque. The two minarets were rebuilt on an old base by Parvill√©e. Polychrome painted decorations, which had previously adorned the upper parts of the walls and ceilings, were not restored. During a second restoration project that took place from 1941 to 1943, the ceramic facing of the tiles was removed and reinstalled. The Green Mosque underwent another renovation, starting in 2010 and reopening on May 11, 2012, which cost 1.8 million Turkish Liras.

It is located by road southwest of the centre of Parma. A major food-producing area, it is home to multinational Italian dairy and food corporation Parmalat and Parma F.C.'s training complex, Centro Sportivo di Collecchio, and is connected by railway.\\"Comune di Collecchio\\", Emilia Romana in festa. Retrieved 12 July 2012. History The first signs of settlement in Collecchio date from the Paleolithic Age. Under the Romans it was called Sustrina and later, in Christian times, Colliculum, because of its location on a small hill. With growing numbers of inhabitants in the Neolithic, deforestation led to flooding in the plains. As a result, settlements were moved up into the hills. Collecchio's history is tied closely to that of nearby Parma under whose powerful bishops the city was ruled.\\"Comune di Collecchio\\", Gli Itinerari della Francigena. Retrieved 12 July 2012. The Roman road Clodia Segunda linking Parma and Luni (via Fornovo) and the Cisa Pass was a mainstay for the local economy and for the development of the ancient Roman city of Sustrina. The road can still be seen today, branching off to the left just before the bridge over the River Taro after leaving Parma on the Via Aemilia. The town is first mentioned in a document from 929 which refers to \\"ad castro Coliclo\\", although it is uncertain whether Collecchio ever actually had a real castle although it did have a fortified Lombard court. In 1000, the Lombard Countess Ferlinda gave a hospice to the canons of Parma in Madregolo. In 1173, there is a reference to the court of Collecchio as property owned by the monastery of San Paolo. After the year 1000, Collecchio was the centre of battles between the Visconti, Rossi, Pallavicino and Sforza families until in 1545 Parma became a duchy in the hands of the Farnese family. In 1777, further feuding brought Collecchio under the rule of the Dalla Rosa-Prati family. In 1796, under Napoleon, the Commune of Collecchio was born. At the end of the 19th century, Collecchio began to develop as an agricultural centre for canning and meat products in what has become known as Italy's food valley. In particular, the area became the driving force behind the Italian charcuterie industry with pioneers such as Archimede Rossi and Domenico Ferrari. Collecchio also began to produce dairy products including Parmesan cheese. On 27 April 1945, the town was liberated from German Nazi forces by the Brazilian Expeditionary Force in the Battle of Collecchio. Approximately 400 Germans were captured after two days of battle. In 2015, the town introduced legislation mandating the use of 'silent' fireworks in consideration of animals.url=http://travel.excite.co.uk/town-in-italy-starts-using-silent- fireworks-as-a-way-of-respecting-their-animals-N52632.html  accessdate=6 Jan 2016 Main sights Arco del Bargello. A major food-producing area, it is home to the multinational Italian dairy and food corporation Parmalat and Parma F.C.'s training complex, Centro Sportivo di Collecchio, and Il Collecchio Baseball Club, a baseball team established in 1974. Architecturally of note is the Pieve di San Prospero and Villa Paveri-Fontana, formerly Villa Dalla Rosa-Prati. Villa Paveri-Fontana was built in the late 17th century on a pre-existing 16th-century building. It still keeps rooms painted with mythological and architectural perspective. At the entrance stands on the right (if coming from Parma) is a monumental arched entrance, called the \\"L'Arco del Bargello\\" which marks the entrance to the park. Villa Meli-Lupi di Soragna, located in the Fortunato Nevicati park is an example of special architectural structures as it depicts a nut, with the front moved by small columns forming a portico, and a corner tower.

The series combines elements of epic fantasy and dark fantasy as it follows an elite mercenary unit, The Black Company, through roughly forty years of its approximately four hundred-year history. Plot summary The book follows the story line of both Lady and Croaker, who have been separated from the Black Company after the company's defeat at the end of Shadow Games. Lady was separated as she was overwhelmed by dying soldiers and her story begins with her digging herself out of the pile. She quickly hooks up with two strange men, Narayan Singh and his partner Ram. Lady, with those two, begins to re-assemble the army of Taglios. Lady is much different from Croaker's style of managing the people of Taglios, eliminating those that try to stand against her. Narayan Singh is a leader in a shadow religious group who are known as The Deceivers, and worship the goddess of Kina. Kina is a Goddess of Death, and the Deceivers are trying to bring her back to this world. Lady believes that she is using the Deceivers to further her agenda, while avoiding the seduction that Kina appears to be trying against her. While Lady builds up the Taglios army, Croaker is in the company of Soulcatcher - Lady's sister. Soulcatcher wants Croaker for two reasons. To heal her of the wounds that she received in the Books of the North, as well as to take revenge out on her sister. Soulcatcher's agenda is to spread chaos. She dresses as Lady and attacks the Shadowmaster's army to sow confusion of where anyone is. Her plan backfires as Longshadow, along with his new ally Howler, kidnap her instead of Lady. Longshadow wishes to use the knowledge that Lady has to further his own agenda. With Soulcatcher taken away, Croaker uses that freedom to escape and rejoin the army of Taglios. Lady and Croaker miss each other and end up on opposite sides of the river, when river rises and makes fording impossible. Lady discovers that she is pregnant with Croaker's child. At the end of the book, it is revealed that the Deceivers came for her baby and escaped. Kina was not after Lady, but Lady's child.

The Beresford has two very prominent street-front facades,As well as similarly treated frontage along West 82nd Street crowned by its three distinctive octagonal copper-capped corner towers,The southwest one masks the water tank; the other two corner tower contain multi-level apartments (The Upper West Side Book), the northeast one owned by John McEnroe ((New York Sun) \\"A Penthouse at the Beresford Is Listed at $28 Million\\", 2 August 2007 accessed 16 October 2009). the eastern facade overlooks Central Park; and the southern facade overlooks Theodore Roosevelt Park, the park that contains the American Museum of Natural History.Brockmann, Jorg et al.

Three elevators give separate access to small foyers, originally each accessing two apartments of a scale that was eliminated in New York, both by the stock market crash and the new Multiple Dwellings Law.Pluntz 1990:196 contrasts its amenities with the reduced apartment scale of The El Dorado, The Majestic and The Century, built or completed during the early years of the Great Depression.

Early life and education  Richard Spencer was born at Spencer Hall, the family plantation in Talbot County, Maryland, and attended the common schools.Spencer was descended from Robert Spencer, an English emigrant who arrived in Maryland in the seventeenth century by way of Virginia and Barbadoes. Robert Spencer's brother was Col. Nicholas Spencer, acting Governor of Virginia. He studied law in Baltimore and was admitted to the Talbot County bar in 1819. He moved to his farm, Solitude, near St. Michaels, Maryland in 1822 and engaged in agricultural pursuits. He also served in the Maryland House of Delegates from 1823 to 1825.  Writing  Spencer engaged in literary pursuits and, in 1828, he contributed to the establishment of the newspaper Eastern Shore Whig, which he controlled until 1834.  Political career  In 1828, he was elected as a Jacksonian to the 21st Congress and served one term from March 4, 1829 until March 3, 1831. He was unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1830 to the Twenty-second Congress. He served again in the Maryland House of Delegates in 1833 and 1834, but was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1835.  Post- congressional career and death  He moved to Georgia in 1837 and engaged in cotton planting, and later moved to Alabama in 1852 and settled at Cottage Hill, near Mobile. He died there on September 3, 1868, but it is unknown exactly where he was interred. He is most likely buried at his estate at Cottage Hill.

It is an example of German Expressionist film and has a surreal, dreamlike quality.. Plot The film is told in an extended flashback. Lorenz Lubota (Alfred Abel), is a clerk in a minor government office, an aspiring poet, and a member of a family headed by a worrisome mother who has a tense relationship with a daughter, Melanie, whom the mother believes works as a prostitute. One day, while Lorenz is walking to work, a woman (Lya De Putti) driving two white horses hits him in the road, knocking him to the ground. Physically, he is unharmed, but from that point forward, the woman in the carriage (named Veronika) consumes his every thought. His obsession with Veronika costs him his job when he fails to show up for work and threatens his boss for accusing him of stalking her. Believing that his poems are to be published, Lorenz asks his Aunt Schwabe (Grete Berger)‚Äîa cutthroat pawnbroker‚Äîfor money, which he then uses to buy a new suit. Schwabe's assistant, Wigottschinski (Anton Edthofer), encourages Lorenz to celebrate and they reunite with Lorenz's sister, who becomes Wigottschinski's girlfriend. Unable to contact Veronika, who is wealthy and engaged to someone of her own class, Lorenz instead begins courting a golddigger who looks like Veronika (also played by Lya De Putti), lavishing her with expensive things, all the while reliving the day he was run over in his mind again and again. In the meantime Lorenz's mother's health begins to deteriorate due to her worries over her son's and her daughter's actions, and Lorenz's friend Marie (Lil Dagover) and her father learn that Lorenz's poems will not be published after all. Wigottschinski swindles more money out of Schwabe and gives Lorenz a sizable amount. However, Aunt Schwabe becomes suspicious and discovers that Lorenz will not be a published poet, and she angrily demands that he pay back the money after three days or else she will notify the police. Desperate, Lorenz agrees to Wigottschinski's plan to break into her house after she has gone to sleep and to steal enough money to pay back the loan. She wakes up and discovers them, running to the window to call for the police. A struggle ensues, and Wigottschinski kills her, while Melanie runs off and eventually briefly reunites with her mother before disappearing. Lorenz is arrested and sent to prison. After his release, the film returns to the present, where Lorenz is finishing writing his life story down, in an attempt to purge his mind from the phantom woman who continually hits him in her carriage. Lorenz also now has a new life with Marie.

It stretches from the Apuan Alps to the east, to the plains and the coast of Versilia to the west. Geography Camaiore is the largest municipality in Versilia and its territory has many different environments. It extends from the beach in Lido di Camaiore, to the peaks of the Apuan Alps including the peaks of Monte Prana, Mount Matanna and Mount Gabberi and passes through both high and low hills. The plains of caezzanese are also important, as they are known for the cultivation of flowers and the general growth of foliage. In addition to the lido's promenade, there are also rolling hills with small crops of vitis and olives. Camaiore is rich in water, especially ground water, which is continuously extracted for private use including gardens and greenhouses as well as being used by some adjacent municipalities for the replenishment of local reservoirs. In the summer of 2007 strong earthquakes were felt that, according to some experts, were due to the excessive pumping of groundwater. Earlier, in the mid-nineties, chasms formed which caused extensive damage including the collapse of some houses. Small rivers can be found throughout the area, which are fed by drainage water from the mountains. One of the more important rivers is the Lombricese that runs at the foot of Mount Gabberi, touching the nearby towns of Lombrici and joining another river, the Lucese, which comes down from the pass of the same name, arriving in the valley through Nocchi Marignana (Camaiore) areas and the lower part of Pieve di Camaiore up to Camaiore. From here onwards, it joins with the Lombricese to form the Camaiore river down to its mouth which is called Fosso dell'Abate. Throughout the territory there are ponds and small lakes which are fed from various sources. The coast of Lido di Camaiore is bathed by the Ligurian sea, which extends from Liguria to the promontory of Piombino and not the Tyrrhenian Sea as many mistakenly believe. History Camaiore has Roman origins, as it was the site of one of the largest Roman encampments near the city of Lucca and an important station along the Via Cassia. From this we find the origins of the name \\"Campus Maior\\" (Campo Maggiore). In the Middle Ages, the town grew considerably thanks to the old Francigena, which follows northwest from Lucca, towards the Lunigiana and Passo della Cisa, and on to 'Campo Maggiore‚Äô. The city represented the Twenty- seventh stage during the journey of Sigerico Canterbury, and was called Campmaior by the Archbishop of Canterbury. In 1226, the Luccans destroyed the remote hill fortress of Montecastrese, situated above Camaiore on the slopes of Mount Prana, and the survivors of this battle migrated down to the valley in Camaiore as it offered more protection against future city-state attacks.Bonuccelli in the World Celebrations In Camaiore, one of the highlights of the year is the feast of Corpus Domini, locals come out to make and view brightly colored sawdustcarpets, and to participate in the religious procession whose route they are built to decorate. The carpets, which use new designs each year, are built on the Saturday night before the feast, often late into the night, and last only until the end of the Corpus Domini procession the following morning. Running the length of the old city, they serve as an adornment for Sunday morning's Eucharistic procession, a manifestation of civic pride, and a catechetical device. The feast of Corpus Domini, the Body of the Lord, also known as Corpus Christi in many parts of the world, is an occasion for devotion to the belief in the real presence of Christ in the consecrated host. The origins of the feast are in Li√®ge, Belgium, in the 13th century. It is held in the last days of May or the first days of June, depending on the date of Easter that year.Thomas M Landy, \\"Corpus Domini in Camaiore\\", Catholics & Cultures updated July 21, 2016 Main sights *Badia (abbey) di Camaiore, founded by Benedictine monks and mentioned as early as the time of the Lombard rule in Italy (761). The current building, in Romanesque style, dates from the 12th century. One century later it was conceded to the Florians; in that period it also had a line of walls, of which now only scanty features remain. The church has a simple fa√ßade following the elevation of the internal nave and apses, with a double mullioned window above the portal, with a polychrome fresco depicting Madonna Enthroned with Child and Two Saints. Internally, the basilica plan is divided by two rows of round arches supported by square piers. *Pieve di Santo Stefano, a rural church documented from the 9th century.

The series combines elements of epic fantasy and dark fantasy as it follows an elite mercenary unit, The Black Company, through roughly forty years of its approximately four hundred-year history. Plot summary Taking place in part during the events of Dreams of Steel, which was told from the point of view of Lady, this story examines the events surrounding Murgen, who is trapped within the siege of Dejagore where atrocities are being committed by both sides. The book also examines events later in Taglios under rule of the Liberator and the increasing tensions between the Black Company and the Radisha, as well as the ever-present threats from the Stranglers and of some new deception by Soulcatcher and the Howler. Bleak Seasons is unique among the Black Company series for the unusual narrative device of Murgen being totally unfixed in time and uncertain of when he will experience another seizure and move between distant past, recent past and a vaguely comprehended present. This narrative device is followed through three-quarters of the novel until we come to understand the traumas that have led Murgen to this point, while the enchantment that has made it possible remains unclear. The tone is introspective, haunted and mysterious. This novel introduces several key elements and characters to the series, including visions of the frozen caverns, Sahra, Uncle Doj, Mother Gota, One-Eye's black spear, and the manipulation of the comatose wizard Smoke. Characters in \\"Bleak Seasons\\" =The Company= *Murgen- Narrator and protagonist.

The Encyclopedia of Novels Into Film (2nd ed. 2005) pp 87‚Äì89. Plot In an unnamed Latin American republic under military rule, a democratization process results in an opposition candidate gaining a lead in pre-election polling. In a mountainous region of the country, a pickup truck is stopped at a police checkpoint overseen by the upwardly mobile Sgt. Agustin Rejas, a Quechua speaker and former corporate lawyer. Rejas grows suspicious of the truck‚Äôs occupants and interrogates their leader, who claims to be a laborer. While Rejas is momentarily distracted, a corrupt subordinate solicits a bribe and allows the party to escape. Months later, the opposition candidate has won the presidency. Rejas has been promoted to lieutenant and resides in the capital with his wife and daughter. Struggling to make ends meet on a police salary, Rejas visits his daughter‚Äôs ballet teacher, Yolanda, to pay a long-overdue bill. Rejas strikes up a friendship with Yolanda. Increasingly bored of his wife‚Äôs social ambitions and self-centeredness, Rejas develops romantic feelings for Yolanda, and the two begin a passionate but ultimately non-sexual affair. While working a security detail at a diplomatic reception, Rejas is recognized by lawyer Tristan Calderon, a shadowy figure with ties to narcotics traffickers and the new presidential administration. Meanwhile, Rejas and his subordinate Sucre discover a series of dead dogs hanging from lampposts, all affixed with placards referencing Maoist ideology and a ‚ÄúPresident Ezequiel.‚Äù Shortly thereafter, the name Ezequiel is invoked during a suicide bombing in the capital. Fearing that political instability will invite democratic backsliding, the chief of police promotes Rejas to captain and tasks him with investigating Ezequiel within the bounds of judicial process. Rejas and his team determine that Ezequiel is the nom de guerre of a Maoist terrorist leader responsible for a series of atrocities committed in the country's mountains, which were overlooked due to a breakdown in central authority toward the end of military rule. Rejas quickly identifies a prime suspect: Edgardo Rivas, a former academic who considers himself the ‚Äúfourth flame of Communism.‚Äù Rejas recognizes Rivas as the purported laborer he interrogated at the police checkpoint in the mountains. Ezequiel wages a terror campaign in the capital, and after two senior officials are assassinated, Calderon, now the president‚Äôs chief adviser, imposes martial law. The Ezequiel investigation is transferred to a military death squad. When Rejas protests, Calderon allows his investigation to continue, but with military oversight. Rejas and his investigators locate a videotape that confirms Ezequiel‚Äôs identity as Rivas and suggests that his hideout is located on one of two residential streets in the capital. Rejas conceals this discovery from Calderon, allowing the police to bring the investigation to a close without military interference. After an exhaustive investigation, his team locates Rivas‚Äô hideout in an upper level of the building housing Yolanda‚Äôs ballet studio. Rejas succeeds in apprehending Rivas and his associates without bloodshed, but learns, to his astonishment, that Yolanda is one of Rivas‚Äô operatives. Rejas ensures that the Ezequiel suspects receive due process, becoming a hero to the political opposition and a plausible contender for the presidency. Meanwhile, Rivas, Yolanda, and their associates are sentenced to life imprisonment under harsh conditions. Rejas meets with Calderon and offers to refrain from a presidential candidacy in exchange for the commutation of Yolanda‚Äôs sentence. Calderon agrees to the deal and informs Rejas that, to save face, the president will soon appoint him to a judgeship. Before departing, he marvels at Rejas‚Äô willingness to turn down the presidency, revealing a letter from Yolanda in which she permanently rejects Rejas. The film concludes as a nevertheless-contented Rejas arrives at his daughter‚Äôs ballet recital.

The original theatrical release included a quick scene (about 2‚Äì3 seconds) of a map of Lima, Peru. This scene is deleted from the DVD release. A lamppost sign reads: \\"When I hear the word culture, I reach for my pistol.\\" This is a quotation usually mis-attributed to Nazi leader Hermann G√∂ring. The seized videotape is labeled \\"Estado de sitio\\"; this happens to be the Spanish title for the film State of Siege by Costa Gavras. There turns out to be an execution on the tape. Later, portions of Gavras' film itself are also seen on the tape. The wisecrack joke about \\"pubes on a coke can\\" is a reference to the Judge Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings. =Historical basis= The story is inspired by the Peruvian Maoist guerrilla organization Shining Path. Its leader Abimael Guzm√°n, who was known by the nom de guerre President Gonzalo, was captured in an apartment above a ballet studio in the capital Lima in 1992. The ballet teacher Yolanda was based on Maritza Garrido Lecca, the woman in whose apartment Guzm√°n was found. Bardem's character was inspired by Benedicto Jim√©nez and General Antonio Ketin Vidal, the leading figures responsible for Guzm√°n's capture.

The ride was the first ever Zamperla \\"Volare\\" roller coaster when it opened in 2002 at Elitch Gardens in Denver, Colorado, as the Flying Coaster. The Elitch Gardens ride was constructed by Martin & Vleminckx. The Volare, the cheapest option for a flying roller coaster, contains a compact layout with a distinctive spiral lift hill. In late 2010 the ride got dismantled and relocated to Luna Park in Coney Island, where it opened in April 2011 as the Soarin' Eagle. The ride has an identical sister, Hero, which opened in April 2013 at Flamingo Land in North Yorkshire. Layout Riders begin their experience of the Soarin' Eagle by boarding the four-across trains as they pass slowly along a moving walkway. The trains are originally upright so riders can walk up from behind and enter from a standing position. Each rider must select their desired height on a five rung series of ladder-like steps which determine how a rider will be positioned when the train tilts to the horizontal position upon leaving the station. Before departure, a cage is latched down over the backs of the trains to secure the riders for the duration of the trip. The train then heads up the spiral lift hill, which slowly twirls the train upward. After the lift, the train then heads down a short, steep drop and then ascends slowly back up. A hairpin turn then occurs and takes riders through the first Barrel Roll inversion. The train then hits another hairpin turn into another short drop. Another hairpin turn then leads the train into the second Barrel Roll and turns again. The train is then slowed by the trim brakes and then twists through another set of hairpin turns and twists until the train slows by the final brake run.

He was one of the seven founding saints of Brittany. Malo was baptized as an adult by Brendan the Navigator and became his student. As a monk at Llancarfan Abbey in Wales, Malo was known for his participation in the Voyage of Saint Brendan the Abbot. As an immigrant to Brittany, he helped in the missionary work of Aaron of Brittany, was the first bishop of Aleth (modern Saint-Servan, France) and established churches in the area of Brittany now named Saint-Malo in his honor. Malo was later driven from the area to Saintes, France by opponents of his mission. Details of Malo's career have been preserved in three medieval 'Lives' that seem to include incidents associated with multiple people bearing a similar name. It appears that Malo was probably born in Wales in approximately 520. Malo's name may derive from the Old Breton machlou, a compound of mach \\"warrant, hostage\\" and lou (or loh) \\"brilliant, bright, beautiful\\".L√©on Fleuriot, Les Origines de la Bretagne, ed. Payot, 1982, p. 150 and 281. Voyages with Brendan After his baptism, he became Brendan's favourite disciple. He may have accompanied Brendan on his famous voyage. According to the Voyage of Saint Brendan the Abbot, Brendan and Malo left Llancarfan Abbey with several companions and discovered the \\"Island of the Blest\\". He then went to sea on a second voyage and visited the Island of C√©zembre, remaining there for some time. During their travels, they encountered Maclovius, a dead giant whom Brendan temporarily revived with his holiness. Brendan baptised him before the giant returned to his grave. It is thought that Brendan, on the occasion of his second voyage, evangelised the Orkney Islands and the northern isles of Scotland. St Malo and Hoel in a stained-glass window in R√©guiny in Brittany, northern France. Breton evangelist At Aleth, Malo served under a venerable hermit named Aaron. Upon Aaron's death in 544, Malo continued the spiritual rule of the district subsequently known as Saint-Malo and was consecrated as the first Bishop of Aleth. In old age, the disorder on the island compelled Malo to leave, but the people soon begged him to return. He obliged his people and returned to restore order. Feeling at the end of his life, Malo was determined to spend his last days in solitary penance. Accordingly, he went to Archambiac, a village in the diocese of Saintes, where he passed the remainder of his life in prayer and mortification. His death, reported in Archingeay (in the same diocese), came on November 15, 621 (although this may have been a different saint named Marcoult). Veneration The city of Saint-Malo is one of the seven stages in the Tro Breizh (\\"Tour of Brittany\\", in Breton), a pilgrimage celebrating the seven founding saints of Brittany. Indirectly, the Spanish name of the Falkland Islands, Islas Malvinas, can be traced to Malo, as it is derived from the French, √éles Malouines and named by Louis Antoine de Bougainville in 1764 after the first known settlers: mariners, and fishermen from the port of Saint-Malo. Pontoise Cathedral is dedicated to Saint Malo. Lesmahagow Priory in South Lanarkshire is also dedicated to him in the Latin form of his name, Machutus. The place-name Saint-Maclou also refers to him.

The Leech Womans 1960 US theatrical release from Universal was as a double feature with the British horror film The Brides of Dracula. Rank Film Distributors handled the film's UK release. The Leech Womans storyline is about a middle- aged American woman, desperate to be young again, who uses an ancient, secret African potion to regain her lost youth and beauty. The potion works, but only temporarily, requiring repeated usage. Plot A mysterious old woman named Malla (Estelle Hemsley) who claims to have been brought to America 140 years ago as a slave approaches endocrinologist Dr. Paul Talbot (Terry) and promises to reveal to him the secret of eternal youth if he will fund her final trip back to Africa, so that she can be beautiful and young for one last night before she dies. Paul is unhappily married to the alcoholic June (Gray), who is 10 years his elder. Paul prefers younger women. \\"Old women,\\" he says, \\"give me the creeps.\\" They follow Malla to Africa and witness a secret ceremony of the Nando tribe that utilizes orchid pollen and a sacrificial male's pineal gland secretions. The secretions, extracted from the back of the neck via a special ring and mixed with the pollen, temporarily transform Malla into a young, beautiful woman (Kim Hamilton). After discovering that her conniving husband only brought her along as \\"a guinea pig who could talk,\\" June takes revenge, choosing him to be sacrificed so that she can use his pineal gland extract to become young again herself, though Malla warns her that the transformation will not last long. She steals the ring and pollen, kills her jungle guide (John van Dreelen) and returns to the United States. Masquerading as her own niece, Terry Hart, she keeps herself young by picking up men and killing them for their pineal extract. But each time the potion wears off, she is older than she was before. As Terry, June quickly becomes enamored of her lawyer Neil Foster (Williams), a man half her actual age. She kills his jealous fianc√©e Sally Howards (Talbott), draining her pineal gland and eliminating Sally as competition. When the police come to investigate the murders that June has committed, she uses Sally's pineal gland extract but finds that it does not work because it is from a woman. Before the police can arrest her, she throws herself out her bedroom window, crashes to the ground and dies. When they see her body, it is much older and much more shriveled than ever.

Film critic and psychometrist Bryan Senn notes that much of the stock footage was \\"taken from the jungle adventure Tanganyika (1954)\\". Production of the film ended in March 1959. It had its official premiere in Los Angeles on 15 June 1960. The pairing of The Brides of Dracula and The Leech Woman was one of several examples of Universal-International releasing UK horror films with inexpensive, quickly-produced second films to fill double bills in the US. However, as science fiction film historian Bill Warren points out, The Brides of Dracula was a \\"lively, colorful Hammer film, one of their best\\", which made the black-and-white The Leech Woman \\"look drab and old-fashioned\\". The film has the \\"heavy, 'indoorsy' atmosphere of an early '60s TV show\\" and its \\"extended takes create the stagy feeling associated with live TV\\". In the UK, The Leech Woman was given an X-certificate by the British Board of Film Censors, following their viewing of the film on 14 March 1960. The X-certificate limited the exhibition of the film to persons over age 16. Quoting an unpublished interview with Gray given to film historian Tom Weaver, Senn writes that although the film was one of her most difficult, because of her character's rapid age changes, \\"That picture was 10 days of sheer joy (...) I got to 'camp' all over the place; it was kind of flamboyant and, really, excrutiatingly funny\\". For her part, Talbott told Weaver in a published interview her reason for taking a role in the film: \\"I made that picture because I wanted to buy a horse for my son\\", she said, \\"and The Leech Woman got him a really nice horse and saddle\\"! Talbott also discussed the scene where she held Gray at gunpoint and the script called for Gray to wrestle the gun away from her. Before the scene was filmed, Gray mentioned to Talbott that she was pretty strong and wouldn't have any problem taking the gun away. Talbott was taken aback by the comment and approached the scene with the intent of overpowering her blonde co-star even though the script called for Gray to win the fight. Talbott admitted in the interview that Gray was right, she was much stronger than Talbott and easily overpowered her. In a separate interview, screenwriter David Duncan told Weaver that the story did not originate with him, instead saying that \\"I think they gave me a screenplay that had been written by somebody named Bruce Pivar. It wasn't a very good screenplay - really, it was unshootable. In redoing it, I suppose I changed the story somewhat. I rewrote it on a two-week assignment (...). Duncan said that he never saw the film in a theater but called it \\"awful\\" after seeing it on TV years later.  Distribution  The Leech Woman was distributed in the US by Universal-International, with Rank Film Distributors handling its distribution in the UK. The film premiered in Los Angeles on Wednesday 15 June 1960 as the bottom half of a double bill, following The Brides of Dracula. Beginning that night, both films were billed as a \\"Double Chill and Thrill Show\\" in the Los Angeles Times and played at six indoor theaters and eight drive-ins in the LA area. When The Leech Woman reached Dayton, Ohio on Saturday 17 June 1960, just two days later, it was the second film on triple features shown simultaneously at three local drive-ins. According to an advertisement in the Dayton Daily News, the third film varied by drive-in, but all were 1950s westerns: Run for Cover (1955), Three Violent People (1956) and The Hangman (1959). The film was screened on 9 March 2019 at the Wayward Coffeehouse in Seattle as part of the \\"B-Movie Bingo\\" retrospective film series.  Reception  The Leech Woman got mixed reviews upon release. According to BoxOffice magazine's standing feature \\"Review Digest\\", which summarized the rankings of films by a standard set of publications, the film was called \\"very good\\" by Harrison's Reports; \\"good\\" by Film Daily and BoxOffice itself; \\"fair\\" by The Hollywood Reporter and Parents' Magazine, and \\"poor\\" by the New York Daily News and Variety. BoxOffice also compiled figures for its \\"Boxoffice Barometer', a percentage scale on which 100 equaled \\"normal\\" box office receipts. The Leech Woman had an average score of 101. Eight theaters in cities around the US reported their percentages: Minneapolis, 140; Buffalo, Detroit, Indianapolis and San Francisco, 100 each; New Haven, 95; Boston, 90; and Omaha, 85. The BoxOffice review says relatively little that is specific to the film itself, starting instead with the statement \\"Dracula's various femme relatives, 'The Wasp Woman' [1959] and all the other gory gals of the screen, must move over and make room in their hall of infamy for this newcomer to the rank of distaff side chill dispensers\\". But the anonymous review goes on favorably to call the film \\"a solidly produced, ably acted spine-tingler\\" and describes Dein as a \\"business-like\\" director and Gershenson a \\"budget-stretching\\" producer who \\"combine[d] to elevate the offering several cuts above the norm\\". Warren, however, quotes two contemporary reviews that thought little of The Leech Woman. The pseudonymous \\"Tube,\\" writing in Variety, called the film a \\"lower-berth item\\" with a \\"tendency to meander into lengthy, irrelevant passages\\", while The Monthly Film Bulletin used the phrase \\"dull horror film\\" to describe it. Warren himself finds the film to be not very well made, saying that it has a \\"perfunctory get-it-over-with air\\" and is saddled with a poor structure as \\"More than half the film is spent simply setting up the rejuvention gimmick; June's life as a leech woman occupies a very small part of the film\\". Nonetheless, he praises Gray's performance as \\"the film's greatest strength\\" and \\"one of the few really memorable performances of her career\\". But he writes that \\"Gloria Talbott can't work up much energy\\" in her role and that Williams was \\"a hapless contract player (...) who had no choice about appearing in certain films\\". Warren also says that \\"no characters are likable, so we spend our time with unpleasant bores\\". British horror and science fiction scholar Phil Hardy puts The Leech Woman into the category of \\"one of several low-budget rejuvenation films of the early sixties\\", but compliments \\"Bud Westmore's striking makeup\\" as \\"the most notable feature of this workmanlike offering, the last to be directed by Dein, a Poverty Row regular\\". Senn, on the other hand, says that Gray is \\"let down by Bud Westmore's makeup department in her early scenes where her face looks like it needs rejuvenation less than just a good scrubbing\\". But Senn, too, writes that Gray's \\"performance as the female Mr. Hyde stands out\\" in a film that is otherwise a \\"juvenile but well-acted chiller that came at the tail end of Universal's string of 1950s sci-fi/horror melodramas\\". In a synopsis, Eleanor Mannikka of AllMovie describes The Leech Woman as \\"An uninspired horror film\\" with a \\"ragged story [that] begins in darkest Africa and in the even darker psyche of a mentally deteriorating woman\\". In looking at race in the film, the anonymous reviewer at Blackhorrormovies calls it a \\"parade of clich√©s and stereotypes\\" and points out that its \\"portrayal of Africa is pretty typical of Hollywood in this era (and to some extent, up to the turn of the [21st] century)\\" with its \\"mystical rites with wildly gyrating natives\\", its \\"references to indigenous tribes as 'savages'\\" and its \\"'good' locals escorting the outsiders who either die or flee in terror (in this case, both)\\". But \\"the Malla character is an intelligent, well-spoken, classy lady - the type of black person not often seen in horror films of this era\\". The reviewer also points out that Malla 'has a heart of gold compared to the Caucasian characters in the film, who are all despicable human beings\\". Other critics, such as Bruce F. Kawin, bring up the roles that sexual identity and aging play in the film. Kawin writes that June's failed attempt to use Sally's pineal gland secretions is her undoing as the transformation ritual demands male secretions. \\"The Leech Woman rejects a lesbian solution to June's problem (there is no radical feminist movement yet), which in context is presented as unnatural - that is, as another unnatural solution when what is needed is submission to nature, letting oneself age and die\\". Aging is the specific focus of critic Dawn Keetley. To her, the film \\"gets not only at what aging feels like for everyone, but, specifically, at what it feels like for a woman in a society that continues to value youth and beauty\\" as June is forced to face the \\"sudden horrific onset on aging\\" over and again. Worse, when June \\"reverts\\" from being youthful to middle-aged, she experiences becoming \\"older and older each time\\". Likewise, aging (and sexism) is the topic of film scholar Vivian Sobchack. She writes, \\"It is now a commonplace to acknowledge the complexity of ageism and sexism in white heterosexual culture in the United States\\". Taking The Leech Woman as her text, and the relationship of June and Paul in particular, Sobchack notes that \\"in a sexist as well as ageist technoculture, the visibly aging body of a woman has been and still is especially terrifying - not only to the woman who experiences self-revulsion and anger, invisibility and abandonment, but also to the men who find her presence so unbearable they must - quite literally - disavow and divorce her\\". Sobchack further points out the additional complexity of the \\"double standard\\" of the aging man and woman, naming it as a \\"standard that elicits a complex of engendered emotions from both the women and the men who bear it: fear, humiliation, abjection, shame, power, rage, and guilt\\". Legacy On television, The Leech Woman was shown on Chicago's WGN- TV horror/science fiction film series Creature Features. It aired in February and November 1978, and again in April and October 1980. More recently, the film was featured on two movie-related syndicated TV programs. It was shown on Mystery Science Theater 3000 in February 1997 and on Svengoolie four times, in September 2013, February 2015, June 2016 and June 2018. Home media Universal Studios Home Entertainment released The Leech Woman on DVD in a boxed set titled The Classic Sci-Fi Ultimate Collection Volumes 1 and 2 on 13 May 2008 and followed up with a re-release of the second volume on 6 September 2011. The film appears in both sets on Volume 2. Universal also released The Leech Woman as a single-film DVD on 31 January 2017. Shout! Factory released the MST3K edition in the Mystery Science Theater 3000: 25th Anniversary Edition DVD set on 10 December 2013. And on 27 August 2019, Shout! Factory premiered a Blu-ray with audio commentary by Tom Weaver, film music historian David Schecter and film historian Alan K. Rode. It includes excerpts from Weaver's 2014 unpublished audio interview with Gray. When the DVD of The Leech Woman was released in the UK by Screenbound Pictures Ltd., it had been given a 12-rating by the British Board of Film Classification on 18 April 2016 because \\"Dated racial stereotying is seen in the portrayal of African tribes people as savages with spears and shields, practising voodoo magic,\\" as well as for \\"moderate violence and horror.\\" The rating means that the video is \\"suitable only for persons of twelve and over.\\" The UK video's running time is 73 minutes 54 seconds, some 3 minutes 7 seconds less than the film's theatrical running time of 77 minutes 1 second.

The Birth of a Race is a 1918 American silent drama film directed by John W. Noble. It was made as a response to the 1915 film The Birth of a Nation, and was meant to discredit the negative stereotypes perpetuated by the film. Initially, it was intended to be a short answer film that could be appended to The Birth of a Nation in 1915 but a combination of weak financial backing and growing ambitions delayed its completion for more than two years. When finally released in December 1918, following the end of World War I, The Birth of a Race was a two-hour feature-length film, portraying the achievements of black people through history. It premiered in Chicago in December, 1918, to great ballyhoo but was a commercial and critical failure.Watkins, Mel, On the Real Side: A History of African American Comedy, Lawrence Hill Books, 1999, pg. 340 This film is preserved at the Library of Congress. Synopsis Following the \\"Birth of the Human Race\\" section, the film had epic scenes of Ancient Egypt with Nubian soldiers and the rescue of infant Moses in the river. A later scene portrayed Simon of Cyrene helping Jesus carry his cross on the Via Dolorosa and the signing of the Declaration of Independence. The film then shifted to World War I, with two white brothers in a German-American family going to war on the Western Front, one (\\"George\\") fighting for the United States, and the other (\\"Oscar\\") fighting for Germany.

Several outdoor scenes were filmed in Tampa in January, 1918, including ancient Egypt and the rescue of the infant Moses from a river and Simon of Cyrene helping Jesus carry his cross on the Via Dolorosa. Reception Critics complained that the screenplay was muddled about two white brothers fighting on opposite sides in WWI. Birth of a Race also suffered at the box office due to its release just weeks after the end of World War I; audiences were no longer interested in seeing a war film.

The original celebrations were focused on the United Kingdom, such as the camp on Brownsea Island, the birthplace of Scouting, and the 21st World Scout Jamboree in Chelmsford, Essex. National Scout movements added extra celebrations in amongst the international ones, including the Australian Scout Jamboree held 1-13 January 2007 at Elmore, Victoria, Australia, and KanderJam at the Kandersteg International Scout Centre in Switzerland. Global activities Flags in Sincil Street, Lincoln, UK The Centenary celebrations began on 1 January 2007, and members of the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM) were encouraged to start their programme on that day, and continue right through the year. In London, there was a New Year's Day Parade of Scouts. In towns, flags were flown to celebrate Scouting. Europa postage stamps were issued monthly throughout 2007 for the celebration. = Scout and Guide Spirit Flame = On 22 February 2007, the 150th anniversary of Robert Baden-Powell's birth, a torch was lit at his grave in Nyeri, Kenya. Several thousand Scouts and Guides from around the world attended the ceremony that included a procession from Baden-Powell's old home nearby. The flame was carried by Scouts and Guides through Ethiopia, Sudan, Egypt, Greece, Italy, France, Belgium and finally the UK to arrive on Brownsea Island, UK on the eve of Scouting's Sunrise. The spirit flame was brought to Brownsea Island via Sea Scouts that rowed a small boat across Poole Harbour. After the Sunrise celebrations on 1 August 2007. the flame continued onwards to the 21st World Scout Jamboree. =Sunrise ceremony= Scouting's Sunrise Ceremony, Oeschinensee, Switzerland Actor reading Baden-Powell's final words to Scouts at a Sunrise Ceremony The first Scout Camp opened on 1 August 1907 by the Movement's founder General Baden-Powell. At 8am, he blew a kudu horn to gather round the 20 boys that were on the island for that camp. Exactly one hundred years later, around 400,000 Scouts in the UK took part in an event to commemorate this. On Brownsea Island, a Scout read out Baden-Powell's words of 100 years ago, calling for peace, comradeship and co-operation. Members of Scout associations worldwide renewed their promise at 8am local time; and Scout troops organised a \\"good turn\\" in aid of their local communities. Additionally, at 8am Western European Summer Time, Scouts internationally used the Internet to celebrate and communicate with Scouts on Brownsea Island as part of the World Scout Jamboree. Scout groups turned the event into a day- long celebration. A flame that traveled from Africa was used to light a campfire that burned through the night, marking the passing of the first 100 years of the Scout movement. The Chief Scout of the United Kingdom, Peter Duncan, blew the same kudu horn, and one Scout from each Scouting country passed over a \\"Bridge of Friendship\\", and shook the left hand of every other Scout as they passed. = World Jamboree 2007 = The 21st World Scout Jamboree was the main event of the year, with more than 40,000 young people from around the world taking part in a 12‚Äëday event in Chelmsford in the south of England. The event started on 27 July 2007, where the camping participants celebrated the Scouting Sunrise in one place. While this is not the largest encampment of Scouts ever held (over 50,000 young Scouts camped in Birkenhead at the Coming of Age Jamboree in 1929), it is expected that the large numbers of day visitors and the concurrent camps around the world made this jamboree the largest Scouting event since the movement started 100 years earlier. = Brownsea Island camps = There were several camps on the famous birthplace of Scouting, including a Sunrise Camp, a Replica Camp, and a New Centenary Camp. The replica camp was held twice, each 4.5 days camping running around the August celebrations. The activities included historical 1907 activities, several with a modern twist. The first of the replica camp's was for purely Boy Scouts and the second included a patrol of girls. As well as Scouts there were boys from the Boys Brigade, as in the original 1907 camp. The changes made to the modern Brownsea Camp did not always draw positive attention in the media, some reports suggesting that elements of the original spirit of Scouting had been lost.  Activities by national Scout organisations  = Scouts Australia = Chief Scout and Governor for NSW, Marie Bashir, leads assembled Scouts renewing their promise at the Sunrise ceremony, Sydney Opera House Scouts and Scouting supporters in Australia gathered at public venues to celebrate the Dawn of the New Scouting Centenary. In Canberra, Australia's capital, local Scouts joined the Chief Scout of Australia to renew their Scout Promise in a commitment of world peace and social betterment. Other events occurred in Sydney at the Opera House and in Melbourne. During 2005 and 2006, Australian Rovers developed the Centenary of Scouting Peace Boomerang which completed a journey of over 18,000 km around Australia spreading a message of peace and unity leading up to the Centenary. Australian Rovers developed the boomerang as a Gift for Peace project that would involve Rovers, Scouts and the general public, and raise awareness and generate discussions amongst young people about peace. The boomerang, an Australian Aboriginal wooden ceremonial tool, returns to the person who throws it, making it a fitting symbol as it traveled for 18 months around Australia. = Guidisme et Scoutisme en Belgique (Belgium)-JAMbe = On 28 and 29 April 2007, 95,000 members from the five Belgian Scout and Guide associations gathered in Brussels to celebrate. The final show was attended by the Belgian crown prince, Prince Filip, who was a Scouting member in his younger days. They had to play the show twice because King Baudouin Stadium has a capacity of only 50,000 people. This was the biggest gathering (in numbers at one day) of any of the festivities anywhere held by Scouting. = Scouts Canada-11th Canadian Scout Jamboree = The 11th Canadian Scout Jamboree (CJ'07) was held from 25 July 2007 to 1 August 2007 at Tamaracouta Scout Reserve just north of Montreal. On 1 August there was a sunrise ceremony commemorating the first 100 years of Scouting. = Asociaci√≥n Scouts de Colombia-National Centenary Gathering = About 5.000 Colombian Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts and Rovers gathered in the Sim√≥n Bol√≠var National Park, in the heart of Bogot√°, Capital City of Colombia, in the National Rally \\"Mapialsancla: A trip to the Fantastic dreams world\\", the National Jamboree \\"Sliders Live100Scout\\", and the National Rover Moot \\"Challenge Colombia\\". The participation of many young people who took Bogot√° for 7 days with fun and varied activities for celebrating the centenary of World Scouting. = Scouts et Guides de France-Sunrise Ceremony on Mont Blanc = A team of Scouts and Guides from the Savoie districts celebrated Scouting Sunrise from the peak of Mont Blanc. Eduardo Missoni, Secretary General of WOSM, visited the team's first preparatory weekend and presented them with a flag to take to the summit. Guillaume L√©gaut, president of Scouts et Guides de France is participating in the expedition. = Federa√ß√£o Escotista de Portugal-Acanac = In Portugal, a one-week Acanac ('acampamento nacional, meaning 'national camp') was held where Scout troops from Portugal got together to celebrate the 100 years of Scouting worldwide. They also celebrated the sunrise ceremony. = Swiss Guide and Scout Movement-Igloo village and KanderJam = 7th Donnybrook Scout Troop (Ireland) celebrating Scouting's Sunrise at Oeschinensee, high in the Swiss Alps above Kandersteg village, 1 August 2007 The sun rising above Oeschinensee bathing 2,500 Scouts in sunshine at 09:00 (CET) On 17 and 18 March 2007, Swiss Scouts planned to build an igloo village with each construction representing one of the member countries and territories of WOSM. The event was held on the glacier of the Plaine Morte near the resort of Crans-Montana, in Switzerland. A total of 130 igloos were built, short of the planned number, but this still beat the previous world record of 100 igloos. Additionally, every team composed a message of peace for the Scout organisation represented by their igloo. These letters will be sent including a photo of the igloo village taken at night-fall, when the igloos were illuminated by torches laid out in the snow spelling out the word peace. The public was encouraged to attend the event, in order to show how igloos are made and to involve them in the construction. A large gathering of Scouts from forty countries took place at Kandersteg International Scout Centre, the Scout centre run by the World Organization of Scouting Movement. Having taken place at the same time as the world jamboree, 1,800 guests stayed at the centre where on 1 August 2008 Scouts from around the world celebrated the Scouting's Sunrise and Swiss National Day at Oeschinensee, overlooking the town of Kandersteg, high in the Swiss Alps. Mosaic made from Scouting pictures by Luxemburg Scouts. =The Scout Association of the United Kingdom= Despite hosting a large number of international centenary events, including the World Jamboree, a large number of county and district level events were also organised by members of The Scout Association. Scottish Scouting ran a set of 12 camps open to members of the Explorer Section in the UK. These camps' themes ranged from activity camps to Young Leaders courses. Hampshire Scout County organised H007, held at New Park near Brockenhurst, with over 8,000 Scouts in attendance. Amongst the range of activities, the camp hosted members of the British Army and Royal Navy.BBC Report of Centenary of Scouting in Hampshire In May 2007, a team from Hampshire Scouts Expeditions reached the summit of Mount Everest to mark the centenary of Scouting. =Baden-Powell Scouts' Association (United Kingdom)= The Baden-Powell Scouts' Association celebrated the Centenary of Scouting by issuing commemorative badges and holding their own Centenary Camp in Southampton.B-PSA UK History Other activities fifty pence coin for the Scouting 2007 Centenary. = Gifts for Peace = During the 36th World Scout Conference, it was decided that each National Scout Organisation would present a Gift for Peace during 2007. This Gift is expected to be the culmination of work by young people in Scouting over the previous year. =Maize maze= British farmer Nick Lees and his family created a maze in a 10 acre maize field in the shape of Baden-Powell and a Scouting logo. The maze was open to the public until September 2007, when the maize was harvested. Due to mediocre weather, the maize did not fully reach the expected height of 4.5 m. The maze was at Bickleigh, near Tiverton, Devon.

With the rise of Imperial Russia, the Russians became a kind of protector of the Orthodox Christians in the Ottoman Empire.Peace Treaties and International Law in European History: from the late Middle Ages to World War One, Randall. Lesaffer, 2004, p.357 Conversion to Islam in the Ottoman Empire involved a combination of individual, family, communal and institutional initiatives and motives. The process was also influenced by the balance of power between the Ottomans and the neighboring Christian states. However, most Ottoman subjects in Eastern Europe remained Orthodox Christian, such as Serbs, Wallachia, Bulgaria and Greece while present-day Albania and Kosovo had larger Muslim populations as a result of Ottoman influence. Civil status Ottoman religious tolerance was notable for being a bit better than that which existed elsewhere in other great past or contemporary empires, such as Spain or England . By the Byzantine Empire, apart from during the time of Theodosius, generally did not condemn other religious groups either, there being a mosque built in Constantinople, a Latin Quarter filled with Roman Catholic Churches and even a synagogue. Of course, there were isolated instances of gaps between established policy and its actual practical application, but still, it was the mode of operation of the Empire.G. Georgiades Arnakis, \\"The Greek Church of Constantinople and the Ottoman Empire\\", The Journal of Modern History 24:3. (Sep., 1952), p. 235 JSTOR, archived here Lewis and Cohen point out that until relatively modern times, tolerance in the treatment of non-believers, at least as it is understood in the West after John Locke, was neither valued, nor its absence condemned by both Muslims and Christians.Lewis (1995) p. 211, Cohen (1995) p.xix Under Ottoman rule, dhimmis (non-Muslim subjects) were allowed to \\"practice their religion, subject to certain conditions, and to enjoy a measure of communal autonomy\\" (see: Millet) and guaranteed their personal safety and security of property.Lewis (1984) pp. 10, 20 While recognizing the inferior status of dhimmis under Islamic rule, Bernard Lewis, Professor Emeritus of Near Eastern Studies at Princeton University, states that, in most respects, their position was \\"very much easier than that of non-Christians or even of heretical Christians in medieval (Catholic) Europe.\\"Lewis (1984) p. 62, Cohen (1995) p. xvii For example, dhimmis rarely faced martyrdom or exile, or forced compulsion to change their religion, and with certain exceptions, they were free in their choice of residence and profession.Lewis (1999) p.131 However, it is understood that Ottoman Empire was an Islamic state where the non-Muslims were inferior. There were strict divisions between religions which prevented integration.Todorova Maria, \\"The Ottoman Legacy in the Balkans\\", in Carl L. Brown (ed.), Imperial Legacy: The Ottoman Imprint on the Balkans and the Middle East, New York, 1996, p. 47. Negative attitudes towards dhimmis harbored by the Ottoman governors were partly due to the \\"normal\\" feelings of a dominant group towards subject groups, to the contempt Muslims had for those whom they perceived to have willfully chosen to refuse to accept the truth and convert to Islam, and to certain specific prejudices and humiliations. The negative attitudes, however, rarely had any ethnic or racial components.Lewis (1984) p. 32‚Äì33 In the early years, the Ottoman Empire decreed that people of different millets should wear specific colors of, for instance, turbans and shoes ‚Äî a policy that was not, however, always followed by Ottoman citizens.Mansel, 20‚Äì21 Religion as an Ottoman institution Mehmed the Conqueror receives Gennadius II Scholarius (Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople from 1454 to 1464) The Ottoman Empire constantly formulated policies balancing its religious problems. The Ottomans recognized the concept of clergy and its associated extension of religion as an institution. They brought established policies (regulations) over religious institutions through the idea of \\"legally valid\\" organizations. The state's relationship with the Greek Orthodox Church was mixed, since the Orthodox were not killed, they were, in the beginning, the vast majority and taxpayers, they were encouraged through bribes and exemptions to convert to Islam. In turn, they could not proselytize Muslims. The church's structure was kept intact and largely left alone (but under close control and scrutiny) until the Greek War of Independence of 1821‚Äì1831 and, later in the 19th and early 20th centuries, during the rise of the Ottoman constitutional monarchy, which was driven to some extent by nationalistic currents. But the Church was greatly affected by the corruption brought in by the Ottoman system of choosing the Patriarch of Constantinople, and putting up the position of Patriarch for bribes. Other churches, like the Serbian Patriarchate of Peƒá (1766) and Archbishopric of Ohrid (1767), were dissolved and their dioceses placed under the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. Churches had to be placed in inconspicuous areas, where the everyday populace would not see them. Eventually, Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire (contracts with European powers) were negotiated, protecting the religious rights of Christians within the Empire. The Russians became formal protectors of the Eastern Orthodox groups in 1774, the French of the Catholics, and the British of the Jews and other groups. =Conversion= Ottoman official registering Christian boys for the dev≈üirme. Ottoman miniature painting from the S√ºleymanname, 1558 Conversion to Islam in the Ottoman Empire involved a combination of individual, family, communal and institutional initiatives and motives. The process was also influenced by the balance of power between the Ottomans and the neighboring Christian states. There is insufficient documentation of the process of conversion to Islam in Anatolia before the mid-15th century. By that time it was about 85% complete according to an Ottoman census, although it lagged in some regions such as Trabzon. In the Balkans, the general trend of conversion started slowly in the 14th century, reached its peak in the 17th century, and gradually petered out by the end of the 18th century, with significant regional variations. The earliest converts to Islam came from the ranks of the Balkan nobility and military elites, who helped the Ottomans administer their native provinces. Although conversion was not required to obtain these posts, over time these local ruling elites tended to adopt Islam. Some scholars view proselyting Sufi mystics and the Ottoman state itself as important agents of conversion among broader populations. Other scholars argue that intermarriage and professional patronage networks were the most important factors of the religious transformation of the broader society. According to Halil ƒ∞nalcƒ±k, the wish to avoid paying the jizya was an important incentive for conversion to Islam in the Balkans, while Anton Minkov has argued that it was only one among several motivating factors. From the late 14th to the mid-17th century, the Ottomans pursued a policy of imposing a levy of male children (dev≈üirme) on their Christian subjects in the Balkans with the goal of supplying the Ottoman state with capable soldiers and administrators. The compulsory conversion to Islam which these boys underwent as part of their education is the only documented form of forced conversion carried out by the Ottoman state. According to Islamic law, the religion of the children was automatically changed after their parents converted. Many families collectively converted and their petitions as per Islamic customs for monetary help to the Ottoman Imperial Council are known. As marriages between non- Muslim men and Muslim women were forbidden under Sharia law, the refusal of husband to convert to Islam resulted in a divorce and the wife gaining custody of the children. Seventeenth-century sources indicate that non-Muslim women throughout the empire used this method to obtain a divorce. The Ottomans tolerated Protestant missionaries within their realm, so long as they limited their proselytizing to the Orthodox Christians.The Crimean war: A holy war of an unusual kind: A war in which two Christian countries fighting a third claimed Islam as their ally, The Economist, September 30, 2010. With the increasing influence of Western powers and Russia in the 18th century, the process of conversion slowed down, and the Ottomans were pressured to turn a blind eye to re-conversion of many of their subjects to Christianity, although apostasy was prohibited under penalty of death according to Islamic law and the Ottomans had punished it strictly in earlier centuries. Religion and the legal system The main idea behind the Ottoman legal system was the \\"confessional community\\". The Ottomans tried to leave the choice of religion to the individual rather than imposing forced classifications. However, there were grey areas. Ottoman Greeks in Constantinople, painted by Luigi Mayer Ottoman practice assumed that law would be applied based on the religious beliefs of its citizens. However, the Ottoman Empire was organized around a system of local jurisprudence. Legal administration fit into a larger schema balancing central and local authority.Lauren A. Benton ‚ÄúLaw and Colonial Cultures: Legal Regimes in World History, 1400-1900‚Äù pp.109-110 The jurisdictional complexity of the Ottoman Empire aimed to facilitate the integration of culturally and religiously different groups. There were three court systems: one for Muslims, another for non-Muslims (dhimmis), involving appointed Jews and Christians ruling over their respective religious communities, and the \\"trade court\\". Dhimmis were allowed to operate their own courts following their own legal systems in cases that did not involve other religious groups, capital offences, or threats to public order. Christians were liable in a non-Christian court in specific, clearly defined instances, for example the assassination of a Muslim or to resolve a trade dispute. The Ottoman judicial system institutionalized a number of biases against non- Muslims, such as barring non-Muslims from testifying as witnesses against Muslims. At the same time, non-Muslims \\"did relatively well in adjudicated interfaith disputes\\", because anticipation of judicial biases prompted them to settle most conflicts out of court. In the Ottoman Empire of the 18th and 19th centuries, dhimmis frequently used the Muslim courts not only when their attendance was compulsory (for example in cases brought against them by Muslims), but also in order to record property and business transactions within their own communities. Cases were brought against Muslims, against other dhimmis and even against members of the dhimmi‚Äôs own family. Dhimmis often took cases relating to marriage, divorce and inheritance to Muslim courts so that they would be decided under shari'a law. Oaths sworn by dhimmis in the Muslim courts were sometimes the same as the oaths taken by Muslims, sometimes tailored to the dhimmis‚Äô beliefs.al-Qattan (1999) Some Christian sources points that although Christians were not Muslims, there were instances which they were subjected to shari'a law.A Concise History of Bulgaria, Richard J. Crampton, 2005, p.31 According to some western sources, \\"the testimony of a Christian was not considered as valid in the Muslim court as much as the testimony of a Muslim\\". In a Muslim court, a Christian witness had a problem of building trust; a Christian who took a \\"Muslim oath\\" over the Koran (\\"God is Allah and there is no other God\\"), committed perjury. Persecution A photograph taken of the Hamidian Massacres, 1895. It is estimated that between 200,000 - 300,000 Christians lost their lives The Ottoman Empire's treatment of its Christian subjects varied during its history. During the golden age of the empire, the millet system promised its Christian subjects better treatment than non-Christian populations experienced in Christian Europe, while during the decline and fall of the empire, the Christian minorities suffered a number of atrocities. Notable cases of persecution include the Constantinople massacre of 1821, the Chios massacre, the Destruction of Psara, the Batak massacre, the Hamidian massacres, the Adana massacre, the ethnic cleansing of Thracian Bulgarians in 1913, the Great Famine of Mount Lebanon and the Armenian Genocide, Greek Genocide and Assyrian Genocide, all of which occurred during the Greek War of Independence or during the last few decades of the empire under the influence of Pan-Turkism. Dev≈üirme Beginning with Murad I in the 14th century and extending through the 17th century, the Ottoman Empire employed dev≈üirme (ÿØŸàÿ¥Ÿäÿ±ŸÖ), a kind of tribute or conscription system where young Christian boys were taken from communities in the Balkans, enslaved and converted to Islam and later employed either in the Janissary military corps or the Ottoman administrative system. The most promising students were enrolled in the Enderun School, whose graduates would fill the higher positions. Most of the children collected were from the Empire's Balkan territories, where the dev≈üirme system was referred to as the \\"blood tax\\". When the children ended up becoming Islamic due to the milieu in which they were raised, any children that they had were considered to be free Muslims.Kjeilen, Tore. \\"Devsirme,\\" Encyclopaedia of the Orient Taxation Taxation from the perspective of dhimmis was \\"a concrete continuation of the taxes paid to earlier regimes\\"Cl. Cahen in Encyclopedia of Islam, Jizya article (but now lower under the Muslim rule \\\\- First Edition 1991; Expanded Edition : 1992.Lewis (1984) p.18Lewis (2002) p.57) and from the point of view of the Muslim conqueror was a material proof of the dhimmis' subjection. Religious architecture The Ottoman Empire regulated how its cities would be built (quality assurances) and how the architecture (structural integrity, social needs, etc.) would be shaped. Prior to the Tanzimat (a period of reformation beginning in 1839), special restrictions were imposed concerning the construction, renovation, size and the bells in Orthodox churches. For example, an Orthodox church's bell tower had to be slightly shorter than the minaret of the largest mosque in the same city. Hagia Photini in ƒ∞zmir was a notable exception, as its bell tower was the tallest landmark of the city by far. They also must not exceed in grandeur or elegance. Only some churches were allowed to be built, but this was considered suspect, and some churches even fell into disrepair. The majority of churches were destroyed or converted over time by the Ottoman Empire. Some others - notably the Hagia Sophia, Chora Church, Rotonda, and Hagios Demetrios - were converted into mosques (this was the majority). Indeed, Chora Church is the only church left with most of its mosaics still intact. Most of the churches in Turkey date now from the 19th century or 18th, like the small Patriarchate of Constantinople. Only Mary of the Mongols has continued to be a church. Many of the relics, icons, bells, etc., from the Byzantine Empire have been lost forever.

NIS is the only company in the world with an exclusive license to manufacture inorganic fullerene-like tungsten disulfide (IF-WS2) submicron (nanosized) spherical particles on a commercial scale with the patent from the Weizmann Institute. These inorganic fullerene-like tungsten disulfide-based nanomaterials opened up new possibilities for developing extreme performance industrial lubricants, coatings, and polymer composites. History Dr. Menachem Genut and Mr. Aharon Feuerstein founded the company in 2002. Dr. Genut served as President and CEO until 2010, and Mr. Feuerstein served as Chairman of the Board and CFO until 2010.[2] In 2013 AP Nano became a wholly owned subsidiary of the leading American company ‚ÄúNanotech Industrial Solutions, Inc.‚Äù Today, the CEO of NIS is Dr. George Diloyan, Ph.D. and CFO is Mr. Steven Wegbreit. ApNano's COO is Dr. Alexander Margolin, Ph.D. Mr. Itsik Havakuk serves as Vice President of Global Sales and Marketing. Technology NIS is specializing in commercial manufacturing of nanoparticles of Inorganic Fullerene-like Tungsten Disulfide (IF-WS2). The particles are called Inorganic Fullerene-like (IF), because of the near spherical geometry and a hollow core ‚Äì similar to carbon fullerenes. The name ‚Äúfullerenes‚Äù or ‚Äúbuckyballs‚Äù came from the architectural modeler Richard Buckminster Fuller, who popularized the geodesic dome. Professor Reshef Tenne discovered Inorganic Fullerene-like nanoparticles (IF-MXy where M- is transition metal and X - is chalcogen group) at the Weizmann Institute of Science in 1992. The diameter of the primary particle can range between 20 ‚Äì 280 nm. IF-WS2 nanoparticles with a hollow sphere (Fullerene-like) morphology, provide extreme lubricity, anti-friction, and high impact resistance (up to 35 GPa). TEM Image of IF-WS2, courtesy of The Weizmann Institute of Science Unlike standard solids that have platelet- like structures with moderate tribological properties, IF-WS2 particles have tens of caged concentric layers, making these particles excel under extreme pressure or load, thus significantly reducing friction and wear.http://viewer.zmags.com/publication/33a7b8ec#/33a7b8ec/12 (also see tribology). Products =IF-WS2 Formulated= In late 2018 APNano and NIS have undergone substantial structural changes, updating the product line and changing the name from ‚ÄúNanoLub‚Äù to ‚ÄúIF-WS2 Formulated.‚Äù IF-WS2 formulations are designed to lower friction and operating temperature, thereby reducing mechanical wear. At the same time, contact pressure causes submicron spheres of IF-WS2 to release tribofilms that attach to surface, reduce wear and filling asperities and smooth them, improving overall efficiency while extending machinery life. The company offers industrial lubricant additives and tribological packages based on IF-WS2 particles. The additives are available as a dispersion in oil, water, and solvent. Possible applications include, but not limited to, lubricants, grease, metalworking fluids, coatings, paints, and polymers used in mining, marine, heavy machinery, power station, space, and military industrial sectors.

The White Paper which preceded the Act was published by the Home Office on the 17 July 2002 and called \\"Justice for All\\". The Act has nine parts: * Maintenance of the court system * Justices of the Peace * Magistrates' courts * Court security * Inspectors of court administration * Judges * Procedure rules and practice directions * Miscellaneous * Final provisions (technical provisions) The Act deals predominantly with criminal courts' administration, though certain sections deal with civil matters (notably creating a post of \\"Head of Civil Justice\\", enabling provisions for family procedure rules, and amendments to its civil procedure equivalent). The Act also abolished magistrates' courts committees, combining the magistrates' courts' administration with the Court Service, which was then renamed Her Majesty's Courts Service. \\"Fines Officers\\" are instituted in order to strengthen the system for collecting fines after the existing system was criticised for relative ineffectiveness. Schedule 1 of the Act provided for the establishment of courts boards. Sections 50 to 57 of this act also provide court security officers the power of search, seizure/retention of items, restraint and removal from court when performing their duties. The act also transfers the authority and obligation of high sheriffs, in relation to civil writs, to sheriff's officers; previously, high sheriffs had delegated these to the sheriff's officers, in any case, but the Blair Ministry preferred to make this explicit, and remove the theoretical power of the high sheriff. It also renames this more-than-1000-year-old role - the sheriff's officer - to High court enforcement officers, for reasons that have not been explained, except perhaps to give it a modern-sounding name.

It was hosted on Webcomics Nation. Trotman describes Templar, Arizona as \\"a story about a town, and the people who live there\\", specifically referring to the city of Templar as a character rather than a setting. The neologism \\"culture fiction\\" was coined to describe it. The fictional city of Templar exists in a subtly different alternate universe. Trotman describes it as \\"a slightly irregular Arizona that fell off the back of a truck somewhere, and now all the power outlets are a weird shape and a couple of wars never happened\\". This city is most strongly marked by its fictional subcultures (many of which are veiled commentary on real ones), as well as its unusual architecture and fashion. However, it lacks any fantasy or science fiction elements, which suggests that the comic is closer to the alternate history genre. The webcomic has received various awards since its start in 2005. Development Spike Trotman started created Templar, Arizona on June 5, 2005, and she ended the series on September 29, 2014. Before Kickstarter came into popularity, Trotman implemented PayPal and similar online banking services to set up an independent pre-ordering system for Templar, Arizona. Characters * Templar is a large city in northeastern Arizona, on the banks of a dried-up river. * Benjamin Kowalski is a recent transplant to Templar, previously hailing from Yakima. He is short, highly intelligent, and quiet. He recently started a new job writing for the city newspaper, the Templar Crusade. An adoptee from South Korea, Ben came to Arizona to escape yet-undefined conflicts in his home life. * Reagan Mancuso lives in the same apartment building as Ben. She is large, highly intelligent, and pushy, and seemingly takes pride in her obnoxiousness. Ray works for a highly suspect retail store named Kingdom Come, and dresses like a drag queen. * Eugene Carmichael lives in the apartment above Ben's. He is tattooed, possibly slightly mentally retarded due to near-suffocation during birth, and mercifully free from the pressures of grace. Gene is also the only member of his considerably large family with hair - the rest shave their heads as part of their Jakeskin (as in \\"Jake's kin\\") philosophy and speak in a cryptic philosophical manner, especially Gene's mother, who waxes poetic about Gene's youth and her choices in raising him. He was named for the French romantic painter Eug√®ne Delacroix (in keeping with the Jake idea of \\"keeping names alive\\") and plays in the popular local band Borndown. * Zoradysis Carmichael is Gene's daughter. She is six years old, smarter than her dad, and uncontrolled. She just went to school for the first time. Zora has recently shaved her head in keeping with her family's Jake traditions. * Scipio Spencer (pronounced \\"Skippy-o\\") is a friend of Reagan. He is unusually tall, well-read, and easily frustrated. Scip is heavily influenced by eastern philosophy, especially Buddhism. He works as a \\"close-protection officer\\" (read: bodyguard), wears a kilt, and has a pet chicken named Flora. * Thutmose Shen, who goes simply by \\"Moze\\", is a musician in the band Borndown with Gene. He's overweight, hirsute, perpetually smiling, and extremely libidinous. He owns an ugly pug dog named Goblin. He is a Nile Revivalist, but as with all things he seems not to take it too seriously. * Ra Shen, who violently enforces his preferred moniker of \\"Sunny\\", is the drummer and manager of Borndown. A former Diesel (illegal underground hockey) player, he entered the music business after sustaining a severe injury. Profane, opinionated, and intense, he is an interesting counterpoint to Gene and Moze. Like his cousin Moze, he, too, is a Nile Revivalist, albeit nonpracticing. * Epiphany de la Cruz, a.k.a. \\"Pippi\\", is a troubled, standoffish high-school student and Scip's roommate. She has an impressive rap sheet and closely follows Templar's TV personalities. *Doctor Eli Bash lives in a basement apartment in Ben's building. He is an extremely eccentric man with an unspecified doctorate. He is new to the building, and his room is full of unpacked boxes which contain antique medical sculptures which he has collected over the years. Doctor Bash is in the process of separating from his wife, an affluent woman from The Sorrows, a rich area of town. The pair have at least two children together, a son named Ransom and a daughter named Cascade, who Bash calls \\"Cassie.\\" It was Cassie who sent the antiques to Doctor Bash, possibly in an attempt to keep her mother from selling them. * Heather Anne Morgan, a.k.a. \\"Morgan\\", is a freckled, red-haired woman from Nebraska. Works for the magazine Pandorea, and has a fascination with space. * The Elliots: Elliot \\"Biggs\\" Bigelow and Elliot James \\"EJ\\" Adair. An addict and his dependent, angry companion. Have recently run into trouble with Eugene's family, the Jakeskin. * Tuesday Pryor: One of the television personalities in the city of Templar. Lives on King Street, an upper-crust section of Templar. Has a frienemy relationship with Curio, another girl on King Street. Her mother works at Pandorea. * Curio Pepper: Real name: Prabhjot Kaur. Another girl who lives on King Street, and a \\"friend\\" of Tuesday's. * Jakeskin: A survivalist religious group, and Eugene's family. Most are shaved bald, and tend to wield butcher knives. Recognition MOCCA festival in June, 2008 Templar has been praised for its natural and humorous dialogue, the strength of its character design (both visually and in personality), the depth of its setting, and for the quality of its art. The writing has distinct speech patterns for each of the cast members. Templar, Arizona was named as one of the best webcomics of 2005 by The Webcomics Examiner. Nominated for the 2006 Web Cartoonists' Choice Awards in the categories \\"Outstanding New Character Design\\", \\"Outstanding Environment Design\\", \\"Outstanding Character Writing\\", \\"Outstanding Long Form Comic\\", and \\"Outstanding Story Concept\\", it won in the \\"Character Design\\" and \\"Character Writing\\" categories.

Early history This music hall was built in 1893 by J. C. Rogers, a Wamego banker. He had been amazed by the scope and beauty of the exhibits at 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, which celebrated the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus‚Äô discovery of America, The New World. The Exposition, more commonly known today as the Chicago World's Fair, was a ‚ÄúWhite City,‚Äù covering with 200 buildings. It was open for six months and had attendance which ranked as high as nearly one half for the entire population of the United States at that time. This same fantasy land was Frank Baum‚Äôs inspiration a few years later when he described his Emerald City. So it is easy to understand Rogers‚Äô fascination with the vision and his desire to recreate a music hall in that image in his own town. He purchased actual art and decor from the World‚Äôs Fair once it had closed and this was used to create the plans for the Columbian Theatre. =As a music hall= In the late 1890s and early 1900s, the events at music halls consisted of a combination of community events, concerts, plays, masque balls and vaudeville. The Columbian Theatre was no exception to this and the hall became a center of entertainment activity for the local community. Original 1893 artwork As part of Rogers purchases from the 1893 World‚Äôs Columbian Exposition owners, he obtained a significant collection of artwork. Some of the paintings were done in oil, while more significantly, many of the paintings were created using distempera (which is a typically Northern European form of tempera which is oil or animal-glue-based paint). There are a total of twenty original Columbian Exposition paintings still in the collection. The original six paintings that hung in the theatre were of a set of eight that was commissioned by the Federal Government. They are by in size. An article in Scientific American, Spring, 1894, listed J.C. Rogers as buying the eight paintings from the rotunda of the Government building. (The whereabouts of the remaining two are unknown.) They were likely painted by Ernest Theodore Behr (1861‚Äì1922).

History The current name comes from the medieval Nubilaria, when the surrounding terrain was mostly covered by marshes, which favoured the formation of recurring fogs. The town was the seat of the Gonzaga family from the 13th century: here Guido Gonzaga, in the early 14th century, created an effectively independent lordship, which later evolved into the County of Novellara and Bagnolo, including grossly what is now the communal territory of Novellara and the nearby Bagnolo in Piano. Chiesa collegiata di Santo Stefano. After the Gonzaga's end, in 1728, the town passed to the Este of the Duchy of Modena, whose history Novellara followed until 1859, when it was annexed to the newly unified Italy.

It leads to the formation of by- product, so that the yield of main product is reduced: :{A} + B ->[{k_1}] P1 :{A} + C ->[{k_2}] P2 P1 is the main product if k1> k2. The by-product P2 is generally undesirable and must be separated from the actual main product (usually in a costly process).  In organic synthesis  B and C from the above equations usually represent different compounds. However, they could also just be different positions in the same molecule. A side reaction is also referred to as competing reaction when different compounds (B, C) compete for another reactant (A). If the side reaction occurs about as often as the main reaction, it is spoken of parallel reactions (especially in the kinetics, see below). Also there may be more complicated relationships: Compound A could reversibly but quickly react to substance B (with speed k1) or irreversible but slow (k1> k‚àí1 >> k2) to substance C: :B <=> A ->[{k_2}] C Thermodynamic and kinetic product. Assuming that the reaction to substance C is irreversible, as it is thermodynamically very stable. In this case, B is the kinetic and C is the thermodynamic product of the reaction (see also here). If the reaction is carried out at low temperatures and stopped after a short time, it is spoken of kinetic control, primarily the kinetic product B would be formed. When the reaction is carried out at high temperatures and for long time (in which case the necessary activation energy for the reaction to C is available, which is progressively formed over time), it is spoken of thermodynamic control; the thermodynamic product C is primarily formed. =Conditions for side reactions= In organic synthesis, elevated temperatures usually lead to more side products. Side products are usually undesirable, therefore low temperatures are preferred (\\"mild conditions\\"). The ratio between competing reactions may be influenced by a change in temperature because their activation energies are different in most cases. Reactions with high activation energy can be stronger accelerated by an increase in temperature than those with low activation energy. Also the state of equilibrium depends on temperature. Detection reactions can be distorted by side reactions.  Kinetics Side reactions are also described in the reaction kinetics, a branch of physical chemistry. Side reactions are understood as complex reaction, since the overall reaction (main reaction + side reaction) is composed of several (at least two) elementary reactions. Other complex reactions are competing reactions, parallel reactions, consecutive reactions, chain reactions, reversible reactions, etc. [10] If one reaction occurs much faster than the other one (k1 > k2), it (k1) will be called the main reaction, the other one (k2) side reaction. If both reactions roughly of same speed (k1 ‚âÖ k2) is spoken of parallel reactions. If the reactions {A} + B ->[{k_1}] P1 and {A} + C ->[{k_2}] P2 are irreversibly (without reverse reaction), then the ratio of P1 and P2 corresponds to the relative reactivity of B and C compared with A: :\\\\frac\\\\ce{[P1]}\\\\ce{[P2]} = \\\\frac{k_1 [\\\\ce B]}{k_2 [\\\\ce C]}  See also  * Rate equation#Parallel or competitive reactions  References  Category:Chemical reactions ","title":"Side reaction"},{"id":"5667974","text":"Diadiaphorus is an extinct genus of litoptern mammal from the Miocene of Argentina (Ituzaing√≥, Pinturas, Chiquimil and Santa Cruz Formations) and Bolivia (Nazareno Formation), South America.

Bluma Zeigarnik: a memoir. Gestalt theory. 29, 256-68. ‚Äì 24 February 1988) was a Soviet psychologist and psychiatrist, a member of the Berlin School of experimental psychology and Vygotsky Circle. She discovered the Zeigarnik effect and contributed to the establishment of experimental psychopathology as a separate discipline in the Soviet Union in the post-World War II period. In the 1920s she conducted a study on memory, in which she compared memory in relation to incomplete and complete tasks. She had found that incomplete tasks are easier to remember than successful ones. This is now known as the Zeigarnik effect. She later began working at the Institute of Higher Nervous Activity which is where she would meet her next big influence Vygowski, and become a part of his circle of scientists. It was also there that Zeigarnik founded the Department of Psychology. During that time, Zeigarnik received the Lewin Memorial Award in 1983 for her psychological research. Early life and education Bluma Zeigarnik Zeigarnik was born and raised as Bluma Gerstein into a Lithuanian Jewish family in Prienai, Suwa≈Çki Governorate (now in Lithuania) to Wolf and Ronya Gerstein, as their only child. Although her parents spoke some Yiddish, their primary language was Russian, as was hers. From a very young age, Zeigarnik had a high regard for education. This showed in Zeigarnik's interest in wanting to continue her education. Zeigarnik was one of the first Russian women to go to a university. She spent many hours studying in the library. It was there that she met her husband, Albert Zeigarnik, and later married in 1919. In 1922, her husband Albert and she left for Berlin, where he studied at the Polytechnic Institute and she at the University of Berlin. She met Kurt Lewin and assisted him during her time at the university. She graduated in 1925 and received a Doctoral degree from the same university in 1927. Zeigarnik matriculated from the Berlin University in 1927. She described the Zeigarnik effect in a diploma prepared under the supervision of Kurt Lewin. In the 1930s, she worked with Lev Vygotsky at the All-Union Institute of Experimental Medicine (AUIEM, aka VIEM). During World War II, she assisted Alexander Luria in treating head injuries. She was a co- founder of Moscow State University Department of Psychology and the All- Russian Seminars in Psychopathology. She died in Moscow at the age of 87. Later life In 1931, Zeigarnik and her husband moved to Moscow, where she began a career at the All-Union Institute of Experimental Medicine (AUIEM). In 1940, a major event happened in Zeigarnik's life; her husband Albert was arrested on suspicion of spying for Germany. By this time, they had two children together, one six years old born in 1934 and the other less than a year old born the previous year in 1939; she was left to take care of the two by herself. Throughout the year, she continued to visit her husband where he was being held in the Lubyanka prison and waited to learn what his punishment and fate were to be. In 1943, Zeigarnik returned to Moscow and began her work again at AUIEM and continued working there until 1950. In 1983, Zeigarnik was awarded the Lewin Memorial Award for her psychological research. Although she was awarded, due to the Russian government's strict rules, the award was reviewed and approved but she was unable to retrieve it. In February 1988, Zeigarnik died before ever gaining her award. Influences One of Zeigarnik's first influences was Kurt Lewin. Zeigarnik met Lewin during her first year at Humboldt University of Berlin. During this time, Lewin was a teacher and a researcher, and one of the first to let females into his lab. Zeigarnik liked his progressive views and started her scientific career within his research group. It was with Lewin that she developed her well-known theory: the Zeigarnik effect. Not only was Lewin the main influence in Zeigarnik life, but he was also a good friend. Another Influence of Zeigarnik was L.S. Vygotsky. Zeigarnik met and started working with Vygotsky, as well as A.R Luria and A.N Leontyev in the 1930s. Together they studied topics involving mental structures and general psychology. Their research also allowed Zeigarnik to create and name her own field of psychology. Research and contributions In the 1920s, Zeigarnik continued her study under Vygotsky's supervision and was able to conduct a study on memory in which she compared memory in relation to incomplete and complete tasks and found that it is easier for people to remember incomplete tasks than those that are complete. The findings became known as \\"The Zeigarnik Effect\\". Shortly after her finding of the Zeigarnik Effect, she began work at the Institute of Higher Nervous Activity, where she was also influenced by the psychologist Vygotsky, becoming a part of his science research activities. Zeigarnik work provided great service to her country and as a pathophysiology, she established the use of her work in medical care, specifically in clinical work. Zeigarnik's copious experience helped her present the stages of development of Russian Psychology. Her work had a clinical focus which helped psychiatric health professionals focus their attention on mental health issues. In addition, she continued to teach and concentrated on the importance of mental health and clinical practice. Later, Zeigarnik concluded that the importance of taking personality assessment of the patient's psychological state and general understanding of their defect structure was key. Zeigarnik stated that, \\"Any problem suggested by psychiatric practice, whether it concerns the examination of disability, or the study of the structure of remission, or the effectiveness of treatment - the data of psychological study comes useful only at once, when and where they suggest a qualification of the whole personality rather than a certain mental process\\". Zeigarnik effect In psychology, the Zeigarnik effect states that people remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed tasks (this effect should not be confused with the Ovsiankina effectMaria Ovsiankina was a colleague of Bluma Zeigarnik who investigated the effect of task interruption on the tendency to resume the task at the next opportunity; cf. Ovsiankina 1928: Die Wiederaufnahme unterbrochener Handlungen. In: Psychologische Forschung 11(3/4), 302-379.). In Gestalt psychology, the Zeigarnik effect has been used to demonstrate the general presence of Gestalt phenomena: not just appearing as perceptual effects, but also present in cognition.cf. Kurt Koffka, Principles of Gestalt Psychology, 1935, pp 334ff. Awards and honors Zeigarnik was nominated for the Lewin Memorial Award in 1983 for her work regarding neuropsychology. This award was named after her former professor Kurt Lewin, and is commonly rewarded to those who help to expand and develop psychological research. Being that Zeigarnik herself had made many contributions in this area of research: creating her own theory, developing Pathophysiology, and working with mental structures, she was granted the Lewin award in Leipzig at the International Congress of Psychology. Although officially acknowledged at the congress, Zeigarnik did not ever physically receive the award. This was due to the strict policies Russia had at the time; especially regarding political bans between East and West. Although eventually the award had been reviewed and approved, Zeigarnik was not allowed to travel outside of the country to retrieve the award. In 1988, 5 years after being nominated, she died before ever receiving it. Selected publications *1927: Das Behalten erledigter und unerledigter Handlungen.

It is generally kept in its own genus, Erythromachus, but has sometimes been assigned to the genus Aphanapteryx along with its close relative the red rail (A. bonasia) of Mauritius; their relationship with other rails is unclear. The Rodrigues rail was about long and weighed at least . It was described as having grey plumage, a red beak, red legs, and a naked red patch around the eye. The beak was long and curved downwards. It was flightless and fed on tortoise eggs. It was described as being attracted to red objects, which humans exploited while hunting it. The Rodrigues rail is believed to have become extinct in the mid-18th century because of predation by introduced cats and destruction of its habitat by tortoise hunters. The bird was first documented from life by two contemporaneous accounts; first by Fran√ßois Leguat, a French Huguenot refugee marooned on Rodrigues in 1691, and then by Julien Tafforet, marooned on the island in 1726. Subfossil remains were later discovered and connected with the old accounts in 1874, and the species was named E. leguati in Leguat's honour.  Taxonomy  Milne-Edwards in 1874; a tarsometatarsus (1.‚Äì1e.), a fragmentary skull (3.‚Äì3b., and a sternum (4.‚Äì4c.)alt=An illustration of bird bones laid out in rows In 1848, the English zoologist Hugh Edwin Strickland called attention to a bird mentioned in the French traveller Fran√ßois Leguat's 1708 memoir about his stay on the Mascarene island of Rodrigues. Leguat referred to the birds as \\"gelinottes\\" (translated as \\"wood-hens\\"), a name Strickland thought implied the grouse of Europe, though this was not consistent with the form of the beak described by Leguat. Strickland was unable to classify the bird further, but noted similarities with the dodo (Raphus cucullatus) and kiwi (Apteryx), based on unidentified birds from Mauritius illustrated by the travellers Pieter van den Broecke and Sir Thomas Herbert, which he thought related. Strickland also noted similarities with a bird from Mauritius, which would later be identified as the red rail (Aphanapteryx bonasia). In 1874, the French zoologist Alphonse Milne-Edwards connected Leguat's account with three subfossil bones (a sternum, a tarsometatarsus, and a fragmentary skull) found in caves of the Plaine Corail region, Rodrigues. He recognised their similarity to those of the red rail, while noting it supposedly had a straighter beak (as described by Leguat). Milne-Edwards coined the generic name Erythromachus from the Greek words for \\"red\\" and \\"battle\\" (also translated as \\"hostile to red\\"), in reference to its attraction to red objects, and the specific name is in honour of Leguat. The name Erythromachus was incorrectly explained as referring to the Erythraean sea by the American ornithologist Charles Wallace Richmond in 1908. The name Miserythrus, from \\"red\\" and \\"hatred\\", was used by the English ornithologist Alfred Newton in 1874 (originally only in a manuscript), and also refers to the rail's behaviour towards red, but as a newer name, it is a junior synonym. Milne-Edwards did not select a holotype specimen for the species from the bones he had loaned from Cambridge University Museum of Zoology for his study, but a syntype series was later listed from specimens there, presumably by A. Newton. In 1875, A. Newton also identified a reference to the bird in the 1726 account of the French traveller Julien Tafforet, which had recently been rediscovered. In 1879, more fossils, including skulls, were described by the zoologists Albert G√ºnther and Edward Newton (brother of Alfred), who confirmed that the bird was a rail, and also noted that some specimens had beaks as curved as that of the red rail. In 1921, the American linguist Geoffroy Atkinson questioned the bird's existence, in an article that doubted the veracity of Leguat's memoir. The American ornithologist James Greenway suggested in 1967 that Leguat's description referred to wind-blown purple swamphens (Porphyrio), since the word grey is sometimes used synonymously with blue in old descriptions. This idea has not been accepted by other commentators. Today, it is widely accepted that Leguat's memoirs represent credible observations of local birds in life. In 1999, the French palaeontologist C√©cile Mourer-Chauvir√© and colleagues pointed out that a carpometacarpus bone assigned to the Rodrigues rail and illustrated by G√ºnther and E. Newton in 1879 does not belong to a rail, and therefore not this bird. More subfossils have since been discovered, including an associated but incomplete skeleton with a complete skull and jaws found in Caverne Poule Rouge in 2005. = Evolution = alt=painting of red rail Apart from being a close relative to the red rail, the relationships of the Rodrigues rail are uncertain and the two are commonly listed as separate genera, Aphanapteryx and Erythromachus, but have sometimes been united as species of Aphanapteryx. G√ºnther and E. Newton first generically synonymised the two in 1879 because of their skeletal similarities. In 1945, the French palaeontologist Jean Piveteau found skull features of the two species different enough for generic separation, and in 1977, the American ornithologist Storrs L. Olson stated that though the two species were similar and derived from the same stock, they had also diverged considerably, and should possibly be kept separate. Based on geographic location and the morphology of the nasal bones, Olson suggested that they were related to the genera Gallirallus, Dryolimnas, Atlantisia, and Rallus. The American ornithologist Bradley C. Livezey was unable to determine the affinities of the Rodrigues and red rail in 1998, stating that some of the features uniting them and some other rails were associated with the loss of flight rather than common descent. He also suggested that the grouping of the Rodrigues and red rail into the same genus may have been influenced by their geographical distribution. Mourer-Chauvir√© and colleagues also considered the two as belonging to separate genera. Rails have reached many oceanic archipelagos, which has frequently led to speciation and evolution of flightlessness. According to the British researchers Anthony S. Cheke and Julian P. Hume in 2008, the fact that the red rail lost much of its feather structure indicates it was isolated for a long time. These rails may be of Asian origin, like many other Mascarene birds. In 2019, Hume supported the distinction of the two genera, and cited the relation between the extinct Mauritius owl (Otus sauzieri) and the Rodrigues owl (Otus murivorus) as another example of the diverging evolutionary paths on these islands. He stated that the relationships of the Rodrigues and red rails was more unclear than that of other extinct Mascarene rails, with many of their distinct features being related to flightlessness and modifications to their jaws due to their diet, suggesting a long period of isolation. The speed with which these features evolved may also have been affected by gene flow, resource availability, and climate events. Flightlessness can evolve rapidly in rails, sometimes repeatedly within the same groups, as in Dryolimnas, so the distinctness of the Rodrigues and red rails may not have taken long to evolve; some other specialised rails evolved in less than 1‚Äì3 million years. Hume suggested that the two rails were probably related to Dryolimnas, but their considerably different morphology made it difficult to establish how. In general, rails are adept at colonising islands, and can become flightless within a few generations in environments without predators, yet this also makes them vulnerable to human activities.  Description  Frohawk's 1907 restoration, based on an old outline illustration and a description. Olson considered the image \\"rather fanciful\\" The Rodrigues rail was about long, smaller than the red rail, but with proportionally longer wings. It may have weighed at least . Subfossil remains exhibit a large variation in size, which may reflect sexual dimorphism. It had bright grey plumage, perhaps flecked with white. Its beak and legs were red, and it had a red, naked area (or wattle) around its eyes. The cranium of the Rodrigues rail was slightly elongate, convex in every direction, and was long and wide. The cranium had a narrow, long frontal region, at its least width. The beak was long and curved downwards as in the red rail, but the narial openings were longer. The culmen of the beak was almost straight above the nostril, and the nasal bone was slightly longer than the cranium. The beak was up to long, the lower jaw up to long, and at its greatest depth. Beak length varied considerably between specimens. G√ºnther and Newton stated that the examined beaks varied greatly in size and shape; some specimens had short and almost straight beaks, while others had much longer beaks (up to one third longer) that were prominently curved. These writers were unsure whether this was related to the overall size of an individual bird or to sexual dimorphism. Livezy was unable to confirm the idea that the differences in the beaks reflected dimorphism in 2003, but thought it probable. Hume examined all available upper beaks in 2019, but found no differences in curvature. The scapula (shoulder blade) was long, the humerus ranged from , and the ulna from . The bones associated with the forelimbs were generally small in proportion to the bird. The pelvis was large and strongly built in proportion to the size of the bird, was long, wide at the front, and wide at the back. The femur ranged from in length, the tibia from , and the metatarsus was long. The hindlimb elements were generally very robust. The proportions of the legs, pelvis and sacrum of the Rodrigues and red rail were generally similar. The Rodrigues rail differed from the red rail by having a broader and shorter skull, longer and lower nostrils, a proportionately longer humerus, a shorter, stouter femur, as well as a considerably different plumage, based on early descriptions. The Dutch ornithologist Marc Herremans suggested in 1989 that the Rodrigues and red rails were neotenic, with juvenile features such as weak pectoral apparatuses and downy plumage. = Contemporary accounts = alt=1708 map of Rodrigues, decorated with solitaire birds The Rodrigues rail was first recorded by Leguat in his 1708 memoir A New Voyage to the East Indies. He was the leader of a group of nine French Huguenot refugees which were the first to colonise Rodrigues from 1691 to 1693, after they were marooned there by their captain. Leguat's observations are considered some of the first cohesive accounts of animal behaviour in the wild, and his full account of the bird reads as follows: Schlegel's 1854 outlines of \\"dodo\\" species (the second supposedly from Rodrigues), which were actually red rails seen by travellers on Mauritiusalt=A line drawing of two flightless birds, each with an ovoid body, long neck and pointed beak Another description of appearance and behaviour is found in a document called Relation de l'Ile Rodrigue attributed to Tafforet, who was marooned on Rodrigues in 1726: Unlike the red rail and other extinct Mascarene birds, the Rodrigues rail was not illustrated by contemporaneous artists. Olson described reconstructions made for the British zoologist Walter Rothschild's 1907 book Extinct Birds and the Japanese ornithologist Masauji Hachisuka's 1953 book The Dodo and Kindred Birds as \\"rather fanciful\\". The English artist Frederick William Frohawk based his restoration in the former book on an outline illustration, which was in turn based on a sketch drawn by Herbert, which is now known to depict the red rail. The German zoologist Hermann Schlegel thought it depicted a species of dodo (which he called Didus herbertii) from Rodrigues when he drew the outline in 1854, and that it was the species mentioned by Leguat.  Behaviour and ecology  Frontispiece to Leguat's 1708 memoir, showing his settlement on Rodrigues, with tortoises and rats belowalt=Drawing of houses on Rodrigues According to Tafforet's account, the Rodrigues rail fed on the eggs of the now extinct Cylindraspis tortoises, three species of which lived on Rodrigues. As it took advantage of their breeding season, Hume considered it an opportunistic predator, which perhaps also fed on hatchling tortoises. A former tortoise breeding area in the Plaine Corail shows that such sites were concentrated into a small area containing large numbers of eggs; the phalanx bone of a Rodrigues rail has been found among the egg remains. The rails would have fattened themselves seasonally, but at other times of the year, they probably fed on snails and other invertebrates, as well as scavenging sea bird colonies. The Rodrigues rail probably fed on worms, such as Kontikia whartoni and the now extinct Geonemertes rodericana, by probing leaf-litter or rotting wood. Sexual dimorphism may have reflected differences in diet between the sexes. Since Leguat was unable to locate its nests, the Rodrigues rail may have nested outside the easily accessible open forest as was typical in coastal and lowland areas, and rather nested deep in forested valleys or mountainous hills of the interior, according to Hume. Its nests may have been well concealed in vegetation on the ground, as is the case of other flightless rails. Like the red rail, it was said to be attracted to the colour red, but the significance of this is unknown. This behaviour led Hume to call it an \\"aggressive species\\". According to Milne-Edwards, the bird had legs \\"made for running\\". Many other species endemic to Rodrigues became extinct after humans arrived, and the island's ecosystem was heavily damaged. Before humans arrived, forests covered the island entirely, but very little of those remain today. The Rodrigues rail lived alongside other recently extinct birds, such as the Rodrigues solitaire (Pezophaps solitaria), the Rodrigues parrot (Necropsittacus rodricanus), Newton's parakeet (Psittacula exsul), the Rodrigues starling (Necropsar rodericanus), the Rodrigues owl, the Rodrigues night heron (Nycticorax megacephalus), and the Rodrigues pigeon (Nesoenas rodericanus). Extinct reptiles include the domed Rodrigues giant tortoise (Cylindraspis peltastes), the saddle-backed Rodrigues giant tortoise (Cylindraspis vosmaeri), and the Rodrigues day gecko (Phelsuma edwardnewtoni).  Extinction  Many terrestrial rails are flightless, and island populations are particularly vulnerable to man-made changes; as a result, rails have suffered more extinctions than any other family of birds. All six endemic species of Mascarene rails are extinct, caused by human activities. For at least a century the Rodrigues rail may have coexisted with rats, which were perhaps introduced by a group of sailors from a Dutch ship marooned there in 1644. Though rats were well established and numerous by the time Leguat and Tafforet stayed on the island, the rails also remained common, perhaps due to their aggressive nature. The French began settling Rodrigues in 1735 (to supply Mauritius with tortoise meat), which must have taken a toll on the rails through hunting and deforestation, but their rapid disappearance was probably caused by cats introduced to control the rats around 1750, and the species may have gone extinct within a decade. In 1763, the French astronomer Alexandre Guy Pingr√© noted the absence of this and other birds on Rodrigues by the time of his visit to observe the 1761 transit of Venus:  References   External links  * * Rodrigues rail Category:Extinct flightless birds Category:Fauna of Rodrigues Category:Extinct birds of Indian Ocean islands Category:Bird extinctions since 1500 Rodrigues rail Category:Taxa named by Alphonse Milne-Edwards ","title":"Rodrigues rail"},{"id":"5668051","text":"Phyla is a genus of eustarid plants in the verbena family, Verbenaceae.

Along with Saint Alban, they are the only named Christian martyrs from Roman Britain. Most historians place the martyrdom in Caerleon, although other suggestions have placed it in Chester or Leicester. Their feast day was traditionally celebrated on 1 July, but it is now observed together with Alban on 20 June by the Roman Catholic and Anglican Churches. The earliest surviving account of Aaron and Julius comes from Gildas, a monk writing in Western Britain during the sixth century. How accurate his account of events that occurred three centuries before is remains unknown. Gildas' account was later repeated by the eighth-century Anglo-Saxon monk Bede. References to Aaron and Julius were included in the work of later medieval authors like Geoffrey of Monmouth and Giraldus Cambrensis. Gildas implied that a martyrium dedicated to Aaron and Julius was present by the sixth century, and a chapel dedicated to the saints certainly in existence near Caerleon by the ninth century, when it was recorded in a land charter. In the early twelfth century, the church passed into the property of the new Goldcliff Priory, and by 1142 had been renamed in dedication to St Alban as well as Julius and Aaron, reflecting the growing popularity of the former's cult. In later centuries, the chapel's associations with Julius and Aaron were forgotten. By the time of the sixteenth-century English Reformation, when the chapel was abandoned and perhaps converted into a barn, it was solely referred to as a Church of Saint Alban. The building fell into dilapidation and no longer survives. Martyrdom The Romano- British amphitheatre in Caerlaeon, the settlement where Aaron and Julius were reportedly martyred Julius and Aaron are two of the three Christian martyrs recorded as having lived in Roman Britain, the other being St Alban. Nothing is known of them except for their martyrdom. The name \\"Aaron\\" is Hebrew and might suggest an individual of Jewish heritage. The name was exceptionally rare in both Jewish and Christian contexts at that time. The name \\"Julius\\" was extremely common among the soldiers at Caerleon, reflecting either descent from one of the Julio-Claudian Coloniae or a name taken on enlistment in the army. Although Caerleon was a major military base in western Britain, there was a civilian settlement association with the fort, and thus Julius and Aaron could have been civilians rather than soldiers. =Date of martyrdom= The Roman military fort at Caerleon held the Legio II Augusta, and witnessed much usage under the Roman Emperors Septimius Severus and Caracalla although saw a reduction in its occupation during the third century, when much of the legion was stationed elsewhere. The fort fell out of use between circa 287 and 296, when many of its buildings were demolished. The core of the legion were reassigned to the Richborough Fort in modern Kent. Given the abandonment of the fort at the end of the third century, it is unlikely that Julius and Aaron would have been killed as part of the anti-Christian persecutions which took place in the early fourth century. It is more probable that they might have been executed during one of the phases of anti-Christian agitation which broke out in the empire during the mid-third century, particularly between 249 and 251 under Emperor Decius and then between 257 and 259 under Valerian. More broadly, Jeremy K. Knight noted that it probably took place at some point between Septimius Severus' prohibition on anyone converting to Christianity and Aurelian's death in 275, for his successor Constantius Chlorus did not reportedly execute Christians but restricted himself to the demolition of their churches. =Gildas and Bede= The primary evidence for Julius and Aaron comes from the writings of Gildas, who was writing somewhere in western Britain during the early to mid sixth century. There remains a question as to how the events that likely took place in third-century Caerleon were transmitted to Gildas, writing three centuries later. There is also the question as to how accurate his information about the events of the Romano- British past was; some of his claims, such as that Hadrian's Wall was built by Septimius Severus, were incorrect. Jeremy K. Knight believed that Gildas' information on Julius and Aaron should be taken seriously, for he was \\"a muddled, but honest, witness\\" to the information he received. Gildas' De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae is the first surviving source to mention them, and he writes that during the Diocletian persecution, \\"God... kindled up among us bright luminaries of holy martyrs.... Such were St. Alban of Verulam, Aaron and Julius, citizens of the city of legions and the rest, of both sexes, who in different places stood their ground in the Christian contest.\\" Bede, drawing on Gildas, says in the Ecclesiastical History of the English People that in the same persecution during which Alban was martyred, so \\"suffered Aaron and Julius, citizens of Caerleon, and many others of both sexes throughout the land. After they had endured many horrible physical tortures, death brought an end to their struggles.\\" Bede repeats what Gildas has said but adds no additional information about the two martyrs. =Alternative suggested locations= Historians have generally identified Caerleon as the location of the pair's martyrdom. There is some evidence to suggest that the martyrdom may have occurred not in Caerleon but in Chester. When Gildas first mentions Julius and Aaron, he says that they were martyred in the \\"City of Legions\\", or legionum urbis. That could have referred to a number of legionary fortresses, including Chester and York, both of which carry the name in a number of sources. Archaeological excavations at an amphitheatre in Chester have uncovered a structure that may have been used for public executions in the Diocletian period and the possible remains of an early medieval church, which might be related to a Roman martyrdom site. In 2016, Andrew Breeze argued that Leicester may have been the location of Aaron and Julius' martyrdom. Martyrium Gildas' account implies that a martyrium of Julius and Aaron existed at Caerleon. Bolstering this is the fact that the twelfth- century Book of Llandaff contained a late ninth-century charter that mentions the existence of such a martyrium. This charter described a grant of land to the Bishop of Llandaff Nudd which encompassed the Territorium Sanctorum Martirum Julii et Aaron or the Merthir I√∫n et Aaron.Baring-Gould, Sabine & al. The Lives of the British Saints: The Saints of Wales and Cornwall and Such Irish Saints as Have Dedications in Britain, Vol. I, pp. 102 ff. Chas. Clark (London), 1908. Hosted at Archive.org. Accessed 18 Nov 2014. Possible archaeological evidence for the existence of the early medieval martyrium comes in the form of a ninth-century sculptured cross slab which was found at Bulmore Farm, near the site of the later medieval martyrium, shortly before 1862. Stylistically part of the Gwent Group cross-slabs, most other examples come from major early churches such as St Cadoc's Church, Caerleon, St Arvans Church near Chepstow, and St Tatheus's Church in Caerwent. View toward the Bristol Channel at Goldcliff, with the site of Goldcliff Priory (Hill Farm house and outbuildings) in the distance The next surviving textual reference to the martyrium dates from two centuries later. The \\"ecclesiam Iulii et Aron\\" is one of two churches mentioned in a record dating from circa 1113 recording how the local Norman landowner Robert of Chandos donated land in the area, including both churches, to the Le Bec monastery in Normandy so that they might establish a priory on it. Both the church of Saints Julius and Aaron and the Church of St Trinity again are mentioned in confirmations of the endowment of Goldcliff Priory, one produced in c.1154‚Äì58, and the other in 1204 by Hubert Walter, the Archbishop of Canterbury. A dedication to St Alban was later added to the chapel of St Julius and St Aaron. In 1142, the monks of Goldcliff had a confirmation of their property produced which referred to the martyrium as the ecclesiam sanctorum Iulii et Aaron atque Albani. Saint Alban's popularity was growing in the twelfth century, with various ecclesiastical sites housing relics associated with him. The monks at Goldcliff may have wanted to connect their chapel to this growing cult in particular because Aaron and Julius were mentioned alongside Alban as Romano- British martyrs in the work of Gildas and Bede. Between 1113 and 1143 they likely obtained what were regarded as bones of Alban to use as relics in the chapel, thus giving substance to its renaming. In the fifteenth century, Goldcliff Priory was passed from the ownership of Bec Abbey to Tewkesbury Abbey and then on to Eton College. Over time, the martyrium lost its associations with Julius and Aaron and came to be associated solely with Alban. This chapel of St Alban remained in existence until the English Reformation. In 1495, its three procurators leased a Caerleon tenement to a man named John Matthews. By 1624, the area, known as Mount St Albans, was the seat of the Powell family. A lease document produced in 1728 lists the associated lands, which included \\"Cae'r Fynwent\\" (\\"The Field of the Graveyard\\") and \\"Cae'r Scubor\\" (The Field of the Barn\\"). The barn mentioned in this document may have been the former martyrium, for several lesser churches in Monmouthshire were converted into barns at this time. In 1798 the historian William Coxe described the site as being marked by a yew tree; he added that in 1785 \\"several stone coffins were discovered in digging for the foundations of a new house\\". The site of the martyrium is now a sloping field adjacent to houses known as Mount St Alban. In 1941, the historian Wilhelm Levinson expressed his hope that archaeologists would excavate the site to learn more about the original creation of the martyrium.  Medieval literature  Geoffrey of Monmouth introduced Julius and Aaron into his discussion of King Arthur's crown wearing at Caerleon. According to Geoffrey of Monmouth's account, Arthur's Caerleon contained two great churches, one a nunnery dedicated to Julius and the other a house of regular canons devoted to Aaron which contained a university. These two churches were fictitious, although in later centuries antiquarians assumed that they were real and made attempts to locate them. Geoffrey's account influenced that of later writers like Gerald of Wales. In turn, Gerald's portrayal of Aaron and Julius influenced the account produced by the antiquarian John Leland.  Modern  SS Julius and Aaron Church, Newport In the sixteenth century, knowledge of Aaron and Julius was spread through the publication of printed editions of Gildas' De Excidio (1525) and Bede's Ecclesiastical History (1565). In doing so, the saints became familiar to both Roman Catholic and Protestant communities. The 2004 edition of the Roman Martyrology recognizes the martyrs as being martyred after Alban during the persecution of Diocletian by the legionaries of Brittania Minor (Brittany), during which many 'arrived at the glorious city [of heaven] after enduring painful tortures and severe flogging'.Martyrologium Romanum, 2004, Vatican Press (Typis Vaticanis), page 349. The Roman Martyrology indexes Aaron and Julius under 22 June, but since it is also the date when Saints John Fisher and Thomas More are celebrated, the current Roman Catholic liturgical calendar for WalesNational Calendar for Wales, accessed 6 February 2012 commemorates them together with St Alban, on 20 June. =Dedications= *Church of St Julius and St Aaron, Llanharan (1856‚Äì1857, Anglican) *Church of Saints Aaron, Julius and David, Caerleon (late 19th century, Roman Catholic) *Church of St Julius and St Aaron, St Julians, Newport (1924, Anglican).St Julius and St Aaron Church, Newport, Wales *Church of St Julius the Martyr, Beaufort Road, Newport (20th century, Roman Catholic) References =Footnotes= =Sources= : : : : : : : : : : : Category:304 deaths Category:4th-century Christian martyrs Category:4th- century Romans Category:Caerleon Category:Characters in works by Geoffrey of Monmouth Category:History of Monmouthshire Category:People from Newport, Wales Category:Romano-British saints Category:Welsh saints Category:Saints duos Category:Groups of Christian martyrs of the Roman era Category:Year of birth unknown ","title":"Julius and Aaron"},{"id":"5668057","text":"Charles Laverne Singleton (March 29, 1959 - January 6, 2004) was a convicted murderer who lived on death row in Arkansas longer than any other state inmate. He was executed by the State in 2004 for the June 1, 1979 murder of Hamburg store owner Mary Lou York. The murder Mary Lou York was attacked in York‚Äôs Grocery Store, of which she was the owner. She died in the hospital from loss of blood as a result of two stab wounds in her neck. The evidence of Charles Singleton's guilt in the case was overwhelming. Patti Franklin (a relative of Singleton) and Lenora Howard, who both were witnesses at the scene, identified him as having attacked York. Prior to her death, en route to the hospital, York also identified Singleton as her attacker. She told both Police Officer Strother, first to arrive at the scene, and her personal physician, Dr. J.D. Rankin, that she was dying and that Singleton did it. He was 20 years old. Appeals After his conviction and imprisonment, Singleton was diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia. In 1986 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Ford v. Wainwright that execution of the mentally insane was unconstitutional, as they could not understand the reality of, or reason for, their punishment. It thus constituted \\"cruel and unusual punishment.\\" The death sentence for Singleton drew global attention because he was considered legally sane only when treated with medication. His attorney argued that the State could not alter Singleton's mental state with medication in order to make him sane enough to be executed. Singleton's execution was scheduled five times. In Singleton's final appeal, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that he was taking his medication voluntarily and refused to overturn his sentence. In the end, Singleton asked his attorney not to do anything further to block his execution. Execution After Singleton had spent 24 years in the appeal process due to his diagnosis of schizophrenia, Arkansas Attorney General Mike Beebe told Governor Mike Huckabee that Singleton has been taking anti- psychotic drugs that made him sane enough to be executed. Beebe told Huckabee that Singleton has no appeals pending and that nothing should prevent Singleton from being executed. Singleton's final words were written, not spoken, and included many religious references. A part of his final statement read, \\"I am Charles Singleton, anointed by God, Victor Ra Hakim\\". He also wrote, \\"The blind think I‚Äôm playing a game. They deny me, refusing me existence. But everybody takes the place of another. You have taught me what you want done ‚Äî and I will not let you down. God bless.\\" After much public debate on the issue of clemency, the state executed Singleton by lethal injection at 8:02 p.m. at the Cummins Unit of the Arkansas Department of Correction on Tuesday, January 6, 2004. Singleton was the 26th person executed by the state of Arkansas since Furman v. Georgia, , after new capital punishment laws in Arkansas came into force on March 23, 1973.

Saving energy was an important consideration as the deprivations of World War I fuel shortages were still fresh in mind. The main clerestory- lit living area is at the core, with the other rooms around it. Only the work niche of the living room has a wall that directly faces the outside. There is a basement level for utility use such as washing and drying clothes. The walls have three layers: an external concrete wall; an inner insulating layer made of a peat-based material called 'Torfoleum'; and the interior wall lining. The windows were larger on the south and west sides; the northern side was almost without windows. The house had four bedrooms, described as the lady's room, the gentleman's room, the children's room and the guest room. It also had a kitchen, pantry and a separate dining room, a living room with a work space off it, and a separate toilet and bathroom. It had coal-fired central heating and a gas-fueled Junkers boiler in the bathroom, and a gas kitchen stove.

For this reason the house is sometimes called the \\"Musterhaus\\" in German, i.e. a show home. Gropius had planned to design it himself, but in a democratic ballot students chose a design Muche had originally planned as a house for himself and his wife.Bauhaus100.

Thoatherium even lacked splint bones, which are remnants of the second and fourth toe found in modern horses. Judging from its generalised, brachydont teeth, Thoatherium fed on soft leaves rather than on tough grasses.Darin A.

Sideshow career  Green was the actual \\"first\\" performer to be billed as Koo-Koo the Bird Girl and toured with Ringling Brothers Circus. Hers was mainly a comedy act, and it involved her dancing around in a feathered body suit with large bird feet and a long feather on her head. Some claim Green was used at the entrance of the circus, being one of the \\"less weird-looking\\" freaks, to catch the attention of passers by. She has also been referred to as Molina the Pinhead; however, this was probably only to differentiate between her and Minnie Woolsley who was also billed as Koo-Koo the Bird Girl. Some claim she appeared in Freaks because she was a movie buff and wanted to obtain an autograph of Ronald Colman.  Film  She is most prominent for her appearance in Tod Browning's 1932 film Freaks where she is billed as the \\"stork-woman\\". She appears in several scenes throughout the movie and has one scene of dialogue alongside Frances O'Connor (the armless girl) while they are seated at a table eating dinner. In the film, Minnie Woolsey received the billing of Koo-Koo the Bird Girl, and is most commonly associated with the billing because she, rather than Elizabeth Green, was featured in the table dance scene.

Rollkur or hyperflexion of the horse's neck is an illegal practice in equestrianism defined as \\"flexion of the horse's neck achieved through aggressive force\\" and is banned by the world governing body, the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI). The FEI recognises a distinction between rollkur and the riding of the horse in a deep outline not achieved by force. Rollkur has been used by dressage and show jumping riders. The technique has been controversial for some time; petitions and boycotts (including a threatened boycott of the London 2012 Olympics) have been created to ban the practice. The FEI moved to ban the practice following the release of video of Swedish dressage rider Patrik Kittel using rollkur during a competition warm-up, where the horse's tongue appeared to turn blue as a result of the manoeuvre. Usage Despite the official FEI rules of dressage, which state that \\"the head should remain in a steady position, as a rule slightly in front of the vertical, with a supple poll as the highest point of the neck\\", horses in FEI competition routinely work with their heads behind the vertical (BTV), in hyperflexion. Judges appear to penalize competitors for heavy use of BTV posture at lower levels of competition, but not at the higher levels of competition. Most usage of the technique in recent times has been by dressage riders but rollkur was, and is still, used in other equestrian disciplines, most notably show jumping, before being adopted by some well- known dressage riders. However, it is not an old theory in dressage, either: Francois Baucher trained a similar method, although he did all his severe flexing at the halt, and in addition he connected the posture of the hind legs to the mix. In dressage training, a rider who chooses to make the horse work for periods with its neck lowered and its head behind the vertical, is misunderstanding the physiology of the horse. Relaxing a horse does not include forcing the horse to bring his head behind the vertical, which forces flexion of the neck at the 3-4th vertebrae, causing a ripple effect of the ligaments, muscles, and spine into dangerous positions, not to mention interfering with the large salivary glands that lay behind the horse's jowls. The proper head position for a horse is slightly above the vertical, with the poll at the highest point, which is most natural for the horse and allows him to fully engage the hindquarters necessary for collection. It is a misunderstanding of basic equine anatomy to suggest that forcing a horse to tuck his chin and bringing his head behind the vertical is beneficial or improves supplemenss. The most extreme form of this hypertension of the neck is rollkur, where the horse is forced to lower his head and bend the neck at the 3rd,4th,or 5th vertebrae, forcing chin as close to the horse's head as possible, and using the outside rein to shape the horse along with the rider adjusting his position in the saddle to gain the maximum effect. In short, the horse's breathing and ability to salivate is negatively impacted, weight load is shifted to the neck, which it can not sustain, so the horse hollows out its back and this causes the dreaded \\"spine-kissing\\". In such a position, the horse can not see what is ahead of him and in addition to causeing great discomfort, the horse is no longer balanced, so he must work harder when he moves. Because he can not fully engage the hindquarters, his actions build mucle in the neck and change its shape over time, while building up the forearms that results in exaggerated motion when the hypertenion is released. In the extreme, the horse's mouth touches the middle of his chest. Rollkur is not a quick movement lasting a few seconds, but is held for a length of time, through work at the walk, trot, and canter, including shortening and extension of the gaits. Rollkur is not just longitudinal flexion (nose to chest or forelegs), but accompanied with repeated bending to the rider's leg. Some riders who use rollkur accomplish the head position by lowering and fixing the hands until the horse yields its jaw backwards in response to the pressure on the bit. This technique (pulling in) goes against all classical riding. In classical dressage, the horse accepts the bit and the horse decides to come down with its head because it trusts the hands of the rider. In good companionship, it is possible to ask the horse to go a little deeper than the animal would do itself, but to obtain the extreme posture of rollkur does require physical coercion. In western pleasure and related events, the same practice has been used for decades, though not called rollkur. Usually draw reins are used to achieve hyperflexion and a very low \\"headset\\" that is desired in competition. However, it differs from rollkur in significant ways, the primary being that pleasure horses are not typically asked for the high degree of collection and complex maneuvers, such as the passage and piaff, required of dressage horses. http://www.horseandman.com/tack-thoughts/rollkur- or-more-gently-put-riding-deep/09/07/2011/ Hyperflexion has become more common in international dressage over time. By the 2008 FEI Dressage World Cup, the 15 highest-scoring equine competitors spent the majority of performance time with their heads in hyperflexion (behind the vertical) in all of the primary gaits. Rationale Riders who practice rollkur advocate it as a valuable training method to improve the suppleness of the horse, and point out that rules (prior to the introduction of the FEI ban) did not allow prolonged or extensive use of rollkur. The definition of 'prolonged' remains rather ambiguous, as the posture is only achievable through regular rollkur training outside the regulated competitive ring. More importantly, proponents point to leading riders and trainers who apply this technique and have consistent winning scores in the arena. Studies have supported this, with results indicating that horses in hyperflexion were awarded higher scores by judges in competition. The scoring advantage is attributed to greater exaggeration of the horses' leg and back movements, which thereby appear more expressive, as well as more extreme forward protraction of the front legs.  Health and welfare  Hyperflexion of the neck has been linked to airway obstruction, musculoskeletal pathology, stress, fear, and pain in horses. Horses ridden in hyperflexion show more conflict behaviors (resistance to the rider's commands) and signs of discomfort, even at the highest level of competition, indicating that the posture is aversive even after prolonged training and experience. It also impacts forward vision, as horses have a relatively limited vertical field of vision and cannot see in front of them well with their noses pointing vertically downwards or backwards. This may itself lead to further stress while in the hyperflexed position, as the horse cannot adequately watch out for obstacles while moving forward. Arguments for banning Those who disagree with rollkur say it goes against the principles of classical dressage and the written rules of the FEI. This includes the fact that the horse is physically behind the vertical. This makes it difficult to check if the horse is correctly accepting the bit. During hyperflexion of the neck the cervical vertebrae are compressed, where classical dressage promotes lengthening and relaxation of the neck. With rollkur, impulsion and throughness may be lost due to a stiff, improperly stretched back. This can easily occur when the hand of the rider is not gently asking the horse to come low (but pulling in) - and/ or the horse is not accepting the hand, but bending in an attempt to evade the hand. A pure disadvantage is that the horse is encouraged to bring its point of gravity towards the forehand. The public and private debates remain as to whether rollkur constitutes animal abuse, both physically, due to the held over-flexed position which can include airway obstruction, tongue nerve damage (e.g. tongue hanging), over-foaming, nuchal ligament damage, etc., and mentally due to forced submission. Given that a similar practice is longstanding and routinely seen with the use of draw reins in schooling horses for events such as western pleasure, the debate has major ramifications across different disciplines.

Description  The Cuban fossil primate, Paralouatta varonai was described from a nearly complete cranium from the late Quaternary in 1991. This cranium and a number of isolated teeth and postcranial bones were found in the Cueva del Mono, a cave site in Pinar del R√≠o Province. The initial description of the cranium included a proposal that Paralouatta varonai was a close Caribbean relative of the extant Alouatta (howler monkeys) of Central and South America, but this taxonomic placement has been called into question with the analysis of the dental remains. Based on shared similarities with the three other Caribbean primates Xenothrix mcgregori, Insulacebus toussaintiana, and Antillothrix bernensis, MacPhee and Horovitz have proposed that the Caribbean primates are part of a monophyletic radiation which entered the Caribbean at the Oligocene- Miocene boundary. More recent research confirms this assessment and places these three species in the tribe Xenotrichini. The postcranial morphology of Paralouatta suggests that it was partly terrestrial, and a likely example of island gigantism. A second species of Paralouatta (P. marianae) has also been described from the Burdigalian (~18 million years old) Lagunitas Formation and is the largest Neotropic primate known of that epoch.

History of commune planning  While a possession of the Habsburg empire, a plan of development was enacted in 1763. The plan was based on square blocks, and streets 40 meters wide. In the center of the village a park and a church ground was established. In addition, proper space was affected for the Parochial House, the school and the bodega. Like most other villages, a space was also dedicated to a weekly market place. The house code prescribed that the dwelling was in the front while the barn was in the rear. This would prevent the fire (most likely in the barn) from spreading to the street. For building material, compacted dirt was used with a roof of various wooden materials. The planning of the streets took in the consideration the ethnic composition of their inhabitants. The planning went at great lengths to group together people of the same nationality and religion. The four main groups were: Romanians, Germans, Hungarians, and Serbs, but a small number of Slovaks were also settled.

Under various names, they were members of the Rugby Football League 1989‚Äì93 and 1995‚Äì2004. History =Formation as Chorley Borough= Springfield Borough had moved to Chorley in 1988 and changed their name to Chorley Borough. At the end of the 1988‚Äì89 season, the club decided to move again, to Altrincham as Trafford Borough, and this caused a boardroom split, leading to five Blackpool-based directors resigning to form a new club that would remain based in Chorley and using the Chorley Borough name. The newly formed Chorley side were based at Chorley F.C.'s ground Victory Park. Ironically their first game was against Trafford Borough in the Lancashire Cup in front of 628 spectators on 30 August 1989, which they won 12‚Äì6. The record attendance at Victory Park was 2,851 for the visit of Oldham in January 1990. Chorley's club colours were an all-black jersey with a red and amber band around the waist. Shorts and socks were black as well. Chorley Borough moved to Horwich in June 1992. Rugby Football League chief executive Maurice Lindsay wanted to reduce the number of clubs in the lower division of the league in 1993. The three clubs finishing bottom of the second division would be demoted to the National Conference League. It went to the wire with Blackpool Gladiators and Nottingham City already relegated, the crucial last match at Nottingham on 12 April 1993, between Nottingham City and Highfield saw Highfield win 39‚Äì6 and Highfield survived at the expense of Chorley. The three expelled clubs pursued legal action against the RFL decision, but to no avail. =Chorley Chieftains (1995‚Äì96)= Chorley regained their status in the professional ranks in 1995‚Äì96 when they became Chorley Chieftains. They were the only club elected to the league from the National Conference League. The club were taken over by the owners of Chorley FC, as part of Victory Park Holdings, and became known as Chorley Magpies after the nickname of the football club. The club also started an alliance and academy side. In February 1996, the coach, Bob Eccles was dismissed and former New Zealand international player and Salford Reds coach, Kevin Tamati was appointed as part-time manager. =Lancashire Lynx (1997‚Äì2000)= In 1996 they were bought by Preston North End football club and they moved to Deepdale stadium. They became Lancashire Lynx at the start of 1997 after a short non-playing spell as Central Lancashire. The club colours were originally royal blue shirts with yellow flashings on the shoulders and sleeves, and red trim. Later when the club relocated back to Victory Park, Chorley the shirts became red with black flashings, and white trim. Tamati gave up his post as Rugby League development officer with Warrington Borough Council to become full-time coach with the Lynx on 31 October 1997. Lancashire Lynx reached the final of the Anglo-French Treize Tournoi in 1998 and finished top of the Second Division. Tamati was released by Lynx at end of the 1998 season, after failing to agree a new contract. Former Wigan player, Steve Hampson took over as coach in 1999. Unfortunately, even though Lynx won the Second Division, the RL decided to merge the First and Second divisions for 1999, so there were only 2 Professional Leagues, Super League and the Northern Ford Premiership. Lynx momentum seemed to falter as the whole division 'had been promoted!' In 2000, Lynx won just one of their 19 league games, conceding over 900 points. The club had lost their last two games by a record 98‚Äì4 to Keighley Cougars and 72‚Äì13 to Dewsbury Rams. Hampson left by \\"mutual consent\\" in May 2000. And at the end of the season, the Preston North End backers withdrew from running Lancashire Lynx, and only the last-minute intervention of Trevor Hemmings saved the club from folding. Rumour had it that the club were happier if the team lost than if they won! The majority of players were receiving about ¬£50 per match, with ¬£100 win bonuses. So as long as the team lost, the club didn't have to pay out as much. Obviously there is no proof of this, and in no way cast any doubt on the players themselves, or the coach, who were all trying their best. =Chorley Lynx (2000‚Äì2004)= The club was sold on 6 October 2000 to Chorley Sporting Club Ltd which also included Chorley FC. The club's name was changed again, this time to Chorley Lynx and they returned to Victory Park. Former Wigan player and coach, Graeme West was appointed as coach. In January 2001, Chorley were eliminated in the third round of the Rugby League Challenge Cup following a shock 22‚Äì8 defeat to National Conference League amateur club Woolston Rovers. It was the club's 30th straight defeat. Darren Abram took over as coach after the resignation of Graeme West in November 2002. In 2003 they finished second in National League Two. However, Abram left to join Leigh Centurions. At the end of the 2004 season Chorley Lynx folded due to poor attendances and the withdrawal of funding by backer Trevor Hemmings. They were losing ¬£1,000 a week with an average crowd of just 434 with only London Skolars and Gateshead Thunder having lower average crowds. Their last match was at home to York City Knights. Coach Mark Lee and 16 of the Chorley players then joined new club Blackpool Panthers.

It was released by Guidon Games as part of the Wargaming in Miniatures series. Unlike other booklets in the series, it does not have the Guidon Games imprint on the cover or the title page. The only evidence the rulebook is a Guidon product is on the final page, which lists the booklets available from Guidon, including Grosstaktik. The rules in Grosstaktik govern weapon fire and melee. The results of weapon fire are decided by casting a six-sided die and adding modifiers to account for factors such as distance. The types of weapon fire, in increasing order of deadliness, are carbines, solid shot batteries, muskets, rifles, and grape shot batteries. When enemy troops encounter each other, they cannot fire and must engage in melee. Each side rolls a six-sided die, multiplies the result by the number of units in action, and then adds modifiers to account for the quality and morale of the troops. The ratio of the higher and the lower number is then computed, and this ratio determines whether the side with the lower number stands fast, retires, is routed, or surrenders. Surrendering is the best result from the point of view of the victor, and occurs when the ratio is 2.5 to 1 or higher. Grosstaktik is appropriate for re-enacting battles from the War of the League of Augsburg, the War of Spanish Succession, the War of Austrian Succession, the Seven Years' War, and the War of American Independence.

Originally within Alachua County, in 1832 it became part of the newly formed Columbia County, but in 1839 it was restored as the county seat of Alachua. When it was realized that the Florida Railroad would bypass Newnansville, the county voted in 1854 to move the county seat to Gainesville, a newly founded railroad town. Bypassed again by another railroad in the late 1880s, Newnansville could not survive the competition. It was abandoned in the 20th century. The site is approximately 1.5 miles northeast of Alachua, Florida, on S.R. 235 off of US 441. Containing partial walls of two cemeteries, the town site was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 4, 1974. History =Bellamy Road= In 1824, only five years after Florida became a United States territory (and the same year that Alachua County itself was created), Congress authorized the construction of the first federal highway. It would connect Pensacola to St. Augustine. The Territorial Council commissioned John Bellamy, a Monticello planter, to build it. The project took two years to complete, at a cost of $20,000. The route would become known as Bellamy Avenue. It was a major highway until the Civil War, when other roads became preferred routes. A few of the places it passed were: the town of Traxler, the Santa Fe Taloca Spanish Mission, and what would become Newnansville. =Newnansville= The Dell brothers, who had earlier (during the \\"Patriot War\\") visited the Alachua County area, came back to settle there in 1814. They constructed a post office on the Bellamy Avenue in 1826, called Dell's, which became the nucleus of the new settlement. In 1828, the Council named the small community Newnansville (in honor of a Patriot War hero, Daniel Newnan), and made it the county seat. \\"This was one of the richest land belts in north-central Florida.\\" In 1832 Newnansville was included as part of the newly formed Columbia County, Florida, which extended north of Alachua. With the outbreak of the Second Seminole War in 1835, many residents from around the area abandoned their farms and moved to the town or nearby Fort Gilliland for refuge. Women and men both worked to fortify the town's defenses, and families doubled up in crowded spaces. Some 300 people lived in tents outside the fort. In 1839, the legislature returned Newnansville to its role as county seat of Alachua County. A land office was established here in 1842, to make it easier for settlers to file claims, rather than having to go all the way to St. Augustine. Following the end of the Seminole wars, the town flourished, becoming the center for trade and plantation life in the area. The county produced mainly corn and cotton in the antebellum years. It built a new courthouse in 1850. The Florida Railroad Company announced its plan to build a line from Ferdinanda to Cedar Key, passing several miles south of Newnansville. In consequence, the county residents voted to move the county seat to a location along the planned route of the railroad, naming the new town Gainesville. Losing the county seat marked the beginning of the end for Newnansville, as settlement moved south in the county. The town was directed to sell the courthouse in 1857, and it was used as a Masonic temple. After the Civil War farmers developed the citrus industry in the area. Two major factors contributed to the town's continuing decline. The Live Oak, Tampa and Charlotte Harbor Railroad, said to be connecting Newnansville to Gainesville, bypassed the town in 1883, building its line to the south. In 1884 the town was bypassed again, when the Savannah, Florida, and Western Railroad constructed its line a mile and a half to the southwest. A new town, Alachua, grew up at a station stop there. In the winter of 1886, a major freeze ruined the area citrus crop. This major setback, plus the lack of railway connections, led businesses and residents to move to the growing communities of Alachua and Gainesville, and most went to the latter. In 1896 Harry Jordan, an African-American man suspected of the murder of Dr. J.N. Cloud, was lynched and burned to death in Newnansville. He had taken shelter in a house, defending himself in a shootout with a white mob outside. They set the house on fire and he died. By the middle of the twentieth century, all the remaining buildings were razed. All that was left of Newnansville were two cemeteries and the remains of Bellamy Road, closed to traffic.Susan Yelton, \\"Newnansville: A Lost Florida Settlement\\", The Florida Historical Quarterly, Vol. 53, No. 3 (Jan., 1975), pp. 319-331, via JSTOR; accessed 21 March 2018 References External links * Florida's Office of Cultural and Historical Programs - Alachua County * Historic Markers in Alachua County\\" * Natural and Historic Sites in Alachua County * Tour Guide of Historic Alachua County * History of Alachua * Alachua County Library District Heritage Collection - Map of Newnansville * Alachua County Scenic Roads - Old Bellamy Road Category:National Register of Historic Places in Alachua County, Florida Category:Ghost towns in Florida Category:Former municipalities in Florida Category:Former populated places in Alachua County, Florida Category:Former county seats in Florida Category:Populated places on the National Register of Historic Places ","title":"Newnansville, Florida"},{"id":"5668286","text":"Trevor James Hemmings (born 11 June 1935)Researcha.co.uk - UK Company and Company Director Reports is a British billionaire businessman.

On September 9, 1942, a Japanese Yokosuka E14Y Glen floatplane, launched from a Japanese submarine, dropped two incendiary bombs with the intention of starting a forest fire. However, with the efforts of a patrol of fire lookouts and weather conditions not amenable to a fire, the damage done by the attack was minor.The Journal of military history, Volume 53, p. 172.

Although Razz did not see the bombing, he saw the smoke plume and reported the fire to the dispatch office. He was instructed to hike to the fire to see what suppression he could do. Dispatch also sent USFS Fire Lookout Keith V. Johnson from the nearby Bear Wallow Lookout Tower. The two men proceeded to the location and were able to keep the fire under control. Only a few small scattered fires were started because the bombs were not dropped from the correct height. The men stayed on scene and worked through the night keeping the fires contained. In the morning, a fire crew arrived to help. A recent rain storm had kept the area wet, which helped the fire lookouts contain the blaze. Aftermath A full investigation was launched by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which resulted in locating several bomb fragments. The story was reported in several newspapers on September 10, 1942. Lieut. Gen. John L.

DeWitt's Announcement Hints > Raider May Have Been Launched From Submarine Off Coast, Later Attacked by > Patrol Planes The floatplane carried two bombs. Both were dropped, according to the Japanese records, but no trace has yet been found of the second bomb. One of the bombs left a foot-deep crater. Fujita and his observer made a second attack on September 29, again causing only negligible damage. Postwar Twenty years later, the floatplane's pilot, Nobuo Fujita, was invited back to Brookings. Before he made the trip the Japanese government was assured he would not be tried as a war criminal. In Brookings, Fujita served as Grand Marshal for the local Azalea Festival. At the festival, Fujita presented his family's 400-year-old samurai sword to the city as a symbol of regret. Fujita made a number of additional visits to Brookings, serving as an \\"informal ambassador of peace and friendship\\". Impressed by his welcome in the United States, in 1985 Fujita invited three students from Brookings to Japan. During the visit of the Brookings-Harbor High School students to Japan, Fujita received a dedicatory letter from an aide of President Ronald Reagan \\"with admiration for your kindness and generosity\\". Fujita returned to Brookings in 1990, 1992, and 1995. In 1992 he planted a tree at the bomb site as a gesture of peace. In 1995, he moved the samurai sword from the Brookings City Hall into the new library's display case.

Set in World War II, it is one of a number of films based on Lajos B√≠r√≥'s 1917 play Hotel Imperial: Sz√≠nm≈± n√©gy felvon√°sban, including the 1927 film Hotel Imperial. Erich von Stroheim portrays Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in a supporting performance. Plot Corporal John Bramble is the sole survivor of a British tank crew after Erwin Rommel and his Afrika Korps capture Tobruk in June 1942 and pursue the British into Egypt. He stumbles across the North African desert into the town of Sidi Halfaya, where he finds the Empress of Britain, a small, isolated hotel owned by Farid. The only other eployee is the French chambermaid Mouche, as the cook fled with the British and the waiter Davos was killed the night before by German bombing. Farid hides the unconscious Bramble when the swiftly advancing Germans take over the hotel to use as headquarters for Field Marshal Rommel and his staff. Bramble assumes the identity of Davos to save himself. When Rommel summons him to a private chat, Bramble is stunned to discover that Davos was a valued German spy, but manages to play along. He learns that he is to be sent to Cairo next. Later, he steals a pistol from genial, music-loving Italian General Sebastiano, planning to serve the field marshal a bullet rather than coffee the next morning. Not wanting trouble, Mouche steals the pistol and waits on Rommel herself. When some captured British officers are brought to the hotel for a luncheon with Rommel, one of them (a past guest) realizes that Davos has been replaced. Bramble privately explains who he is and what he plans to do. The officer orders him to use his position of trust to instead gather military intelligence. At the luncheon, Rommel teases his guests, allowing them to ask him twenty questions about his future plans. Bramble listens with interest. From the conversation and later remarks by Rommel, he eventually deduces that the field marshal, disguised as an archeologist before the war, had secretly prepared five hidden supply dumps, the \\"Five Graves to Cairo\\", for the conquest of Egypt. The final piece of the puzzle (their locations) falls into place when Bramble realizes that Rommel's cryptic references to points Y, P, and T refer to the precise locations of the letters of the word \\"Egypt\\" printed on his map. Meanwhile, Bramble and Mouche clash. She despises the British, believing they abandoned the French, including her two brothers, at Dunkirk. He in turn becomes disgusted at how she plays up to the Germans. As it turns out, Mouche's motives are not mercenary; she pleads with Rommel to release her wounded soldier brother from a concentration camp. He is unmoved, but his aide, Lieutenant Schwegler, is more appreciative of her charms. He pretends to help her, showing her fake telegrams to and from Germany. That night however, when everyone takes shelter in the cellar during an Allied air raid, Schwegler discovers the body of the real Davos (easily identifiable by his clubfoot), uncovered by the bombing. In the noise and confusion of the raid, Schwegler chases Bramble through the darkened hotel, before Bramble kills the German and hides the body in Mouche's part of the servants' room. When Mouche finds out, she threatens to unmask him. However, she has a change of heart. Schwegler's body is soon found, and Rommel accuses her of killing his aide when she discovered he was lying about being able to release her brother. To protect Bramble, Mouche confirms this. Bramble leaves for Cairo, but arranges for Farid to present evidence the next day at Mouche's trial that \\"Davos\\" committed the crime. Bramble's information allows the British to blow up the dumps and thus thwart Rommel's plans, culminating in the Second Battle of El Alamein. When Bramble returns to Sidi Halfaya in triumph with his unit, he is devastated to learn the Germans executed Mouche, even after she was exonerated of Schwegler's murder, because she would not stop saying that the British would be back. Bramble takes the parasol he bought her in Cairo, something she always wanted, and uses it to provide shade for her grave.

He admired one performance, writing, \\"... von Stroheim has all other movie Huns backed completely off the screen\\" and \\" ... whenever he appears in this picture, ... , he gives you the creeps and the shivers. Boy, what a nasty Hun!\\" However, he was less than impressed with the rest, complaining, \\"As though this fanciful story weren't sufficiently hard to take, Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder, a couple of old-hand Paramount wags, have dressed it up with shenanigans which have the flavor of fun in a haunted house.\\" \\"It has a little something for all tastes, provided you don't give a darn.\\" The Variety magazine response was more generous, calling it \\"a dynamic, moving vehicle\\" and praising Wilder's handling of \\"the varied story elements, countless suspenseful moments and vivid portrayals in excellent fashion.\\" Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader agreed, characterizing the film as a \\"crisp spy thriller\\" and, as Wilder's second stint at directing, \\"Excellent apprentice work, with many Wilder themes seething beneath the surface.\\" Production Production lasted from January 4 to February 20, 1943. It was filmed at Paramount Studios, Hollywood, California, with some exteriors of Sidi Halfaya (a fictionalized version of Sidi Barrani) shot on location at the Salton Sea and other exteriors filmed at Camp Young at the Army Desert Training Center, Indio, California, where, with the cooperation of the Army Ground Forces, a battle sequence was staged, and in Yuma, Arizona. Wilder wanted Cary Grant to play the role of Bramble. Grant was repeatedly asked by Wilder to star in several of his films, but though the two were friends, Grant consistently refused. A Hollywood Reporter news item reported that in November 1942, David O. Selznick had agreed to lend Ingrid Bergman for this film. However, Paramount instead borrowed Anne Baxter from Twentieth Century-Fox. The Germans are played by German actors and thus speak with the right accent, except for von Stroheim, who had emigrated from Austria to the US at the age of 24 and whose accent occasionally slips. The British hero is played by an American actor who speaks with an American accent. The German tanks in the film are American M2 light tanks, which were used for training, while the British forces have the American M3 Medium tank which they were using at the time. Academy Award nominations Hans Dreier, Ernst Fegt√© and Bertram C. Granger were nominated for Best Art Direction, John F. Seitz for Best Cinematography, and Doane Harrison for Best Film Editing. Home media The film is available on VHS, DVD and Blu-ray. Legacy Quentin Tarantino has listed the film as one of his 10 favourites of all time. Real life connection Brigadier Dudley Clarke, the commander of the British deception department based in Cairo, saw Five Graves to Cairo in January 1944 and was inspired to create Operation Copperhead. General Bernard Montgomery had recently been transferred from North Africa to England to take command of the ground forces intended for the Normandy invasion. Clarke located a look-alike, pre-war actor Lieutenant M. E. Clifton James, and had him study Montgomery's appearance and mannerisms. The actor then made public visits to several Mediterranean bases in the guise of Montgomery just a few days before D-Day in an attempt to convince German intelligence that an Allied attack on Northern Europe was not imminent. Though the ruse did not appear to have any significant impact on German plans, the events of Operation Copperhead were in turn dramatized in a book and a movie, both entitled I Was Monty's Double.

In recent years, however, they have been successful in finding good players with late round and rookie list selections. Phil Smart was the recruiting manager at Fremantle from when they were formed in 1994 until 2008, remaining at the club until the end of 2009 as their draft manager,Beacham, Digby (3 September 2009) Trade option last Drum roll at Dockers, The West Australian with Brad Lloyd being appointed the national recruitment manager.Harvey plans to mix it up in the middle again Smart was the Claremont Football Club colts (under 19) coach in 1994, and wasn't appointed until near the end of the 1994 WAFL season on 1 September 1994, just 2 months before the team started training. He had also never seen a game outside WA, something that would factor in the trade of future Australian Football Hall of Fame inductee Andrew McLeod to Adelaide, considered one of the worst trades the Dockers have ever made. 1994/95 off season Fremantle's initial squad of 50 players was compiled from a mixture of uncontracted players from other AFL clubs (maximum of 12 over two years), players who had previously nominated for the AFL draft but not been selected (unlimited from the WAFL, two each from the SANFL, VFL and TFL), up to ten delisted AFL players, trades with any other AFL club, unlimited selections from their four \\"aligned\\" WAFL clubs and selections 1, 4 and then the first two selections in each round of the 1994 AFL draft. =The McLeod trade= Fremantle had flown the 18-year-old McLeod and his father to Perth for an interview, but none of the coaching or recruiting staff had actually seen him play, despite McLeod having played in a premiership for Port Adelaide Football Club in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL) a few weeks earlier. McLeod was puzzled and insulted when Fremantle coach Gerard Neesham asked him to stand up to see how tall he was. The result of this short meeting was that he was traded to Adelaide in return for promising centre half-forward Chris Groom, who they also hadn't see play. McLeod went on to play over 300 games, whilst Groom played only seven for Fremantle before being delisted at the end of the 1995 season. Fremantle made similar trades with Melbourne to obtain Phil Gilbert and North Melbourne to obtain Troy Polak, trading away Jeff Farmer and Glenn Freeborn respectively. =Uncontracted players= Attracting uncontracted players from other AFL clubs would prove to be very difficult, except for some West Australian players willing to move back to Perth. The AFL also awarded compensation selections to any club that lost a player to Fremantle, of a 16-year-old player, which had the effect of reducing the available talent in the following year's draft, with Fremantle the only club who would be unable to recruit these 16-year-old players. Prior to the 1994 draft, Fremantle arranged a deal with Essendon where they would recruit three players, all originally from Western Australia, and agree not to recruit any uncontracted players from any team that finished below Essendon in 1994. This would ensure that Essendon would have the first choice of the 16-year- olds in the compensation draft. Officially Todd Ridley was recruited as the uncontracted player, with Tony Delaney and Dale Kickett being traded for later picks. Whilst Kickett had a long and distinguished career at Fremantle, becoming the first player to play 100 games for the club and winning the Doig Medal in 1997, Delaney and Ridley weren't as successful. Essendon, however, recruited Matthew Lloyd with the 16-year-old compensation selection and Scott Lucas with the 4th selection, who would each play 270 games and kick a combined total of 1397 goals. Fremantle also recruited its inaugural captain, Ben Allan and three of their first four best and fairest award winners, Peter Mann, Stephen O'Reilly and Jason Norrish through the uncontracted player process. Only one of the uncontracted players recruited, Andrew Wills, was not originally from Western Australia. In contrast to the outstanding career of Lloyd, the careers of the other compensation selections was mixed. Whilst West Coast's Chad Morrison and Geelong's Steven King had long and successful careers, and North Melbourne's Stuart Cochrane and Geelong's Adam Houlihan each played around 100 AFL games, Hawthorn's selection of David McEwan didn't play an AFL game and Melbourne's David Cockatoo-Collins only played two games. ;Traded to Fremantle * Dale Kickett (Essendon) for selection #39 * Tony

which Fremantle sacked coach Damian Drum mid-year and only won 2 games, Fremantle then became the first club to trade away the first selection in the national draft, which it received in addition to selection 4 as a priority draft pick due to their poor performance. In what would end up being considered one of the strongest drafts ever, Fremantle traded its first three draft selections for Hawthorn's key forward Trent Croad, along with injury prone former East Fremantle junior Luke McPharlin. Two of those selections were used by Hawthorn to draft four time premiership players and club captains Luke Hodge (#1 selection) and Sam Mitchell (#36). Fremantle had not yet appointed a coach, so the recruitment was led by the chief executive officer (CEO) Cameron Schwab, who also had only recently been hired. Schwab is quoted as saying that it didn't matter if they traded draft pick 1 or 4, they still would have drafted Western Australian key position player Graham Polak with their first selection, ahead of the three Victorian midfielders that were chosen in the actual draft, Hodge, Luke Ball and Chris Judd. \\"It didn't matter whether we could take him (Polak) at No 1 or 4 ‚Äî the issue was that ranked the wrong player number one\\". Part of the reason for choosing three tall players in Croad, McPharlin and Polak was that they were concerned that Matthew Pavlich could leave Fremantle to return to Adelaide the following year, and they had no other key position players in their squad. Croad would only stay at Fremantle for two years, leading Fremantle's goalkicking in 2002, before being traded back to Hawthorn at the end of the 2003 season. He then played mainly in defence for Hawthorn and was a key member of their 2008 AFL Grand Final winning team. Polak played over 100 games for Fremantle before he was traded to Richmond in 2006, whilst McPharlin has played over 200 games for Fremantle and was named in the 2012 All-Australian team. Pavlich didn't return to Adelaide and remained at Fremantle to become the club's longest serving captain, games and goal scoring record holder, 6-time All-Australian and 6-time Doig Medalist and in 2014 became the first Western Australian based player to play over 300 AFL games. ;Traded to Fremantle * Trent Croad (Hawthorn) with McPharlin for selections #1, #20 and #36 * Luke McPharlin (Hawthorn) with Croad for selections #1, #20 and #36 * Jeff Farmer (Melbourne) for selection #17 * Troy Simmonds (Melbourne) for Daniel Bandy 2001 National draft: :4: Graham Polak (East Fremantle) :52: Andrew Browne (Claremont) :56: Paul Medhurst (Claremont) Rookie Draft: :1: Luke Webster (East Perth) :17: Josh Head (South Fremantle) :33: Aaron Sandilands (East Fremantle) Rookie Elevation: * Daniel Haines * Robbie Haddrill Retired * Tony Modra * Ashley Prescott Delisted * Adam Butler * Ashley Clancy * Adrian Fletcher * Dwayne Simpson * Keren Ugle * Brad Wira Traded Away * Daniel Bandy in a three-way trade with Troy Simmonds and Craig Ellis * Heath Black for selection #17 * Daniel Schell for selection #56 2002/03 off season ;Traded to Fremantle * Des Headland (Brisbane Lions) for Adam McPhee, selections #3 & 19 2002 National draft: :13: Byron Schammer (West Adelaide) :48: Greg Edgcumbe (Eastern Ranges) :55: Ryan Crowley (Calder Cannons) :63: Brett Doswell (NSW/ACT Rams) Rookie draft: :4: Ricky Mott (Sydney) :20: Ben Colreavy (Claremont) :35: Daniel Gilmore (South Fremantle) :51: Steven Dodd (East Fremantle) Rookie elevation: * Roger Hayden * Andrew Siegert * Aaron Sandilands Retired * Dale Kickett * Jason Norrish * Daniel Metropolis * Clem Michael (retired November 2001) * Simon Eastaugh * Brad Bootsma Delisted: * Brendon Fewster * Brad Dodd * Andrew Shipp Traded away: * Leigh Brown for selection #13 * Adam McPhee for selection #55, Des Headland to Fremantle, Blake Caracella to Brisbane 2003/04 off season 2003 National draft: :10: Ryley Dunn (Murray Bushrangers) :12: Ryan Murphy (Gippsland Power) :19: David Mundy (Murray Bushrangers) :27: Adam Campbell (North Ballarat Rebels) :43: Brett Peake (East Fremantle, Father-son selection) Rookie Draft :9: Paul Duffield (South Fremantle) :26: Dylan Smith (North Melbourne) :41: Michael Warren (Claremont) :55: Ben Colreavy (redrafted) Pre Season Draft :8: Michael Johnson (Perth) Rookie Elevation: * Daniel Gilmore * Luke Webster Delisted * Ben Colreavy (was redrafted in the rookie draft) * Josh Head * Anthony Jones * Ricky Mott * Luke Toia Traded Away * Trent Croad to Hawthorn for selection #10 * Steven Koops to Western Bulldogs for #19 2004/05 off season ;Traded to Fremantle * Josh Carr (Port Adelaide) for selections #11, #27 and #

He was an underground comics artist during the mid-1960s and early 1970s in California, eventually relocating to Canada, where he worked in animation.Vcon 35, October 2010. Biography Born in rural Illinois, Metzger moved with his family to northern California when he was six years old. As a youth, he collected comic strips and read such authors as H. P. Lovecraft, Robert E. Howard, and Herbert Asbury. He studied the work of such book illustrators as Fritz Eichenberg, and Lynd Ward. His later work was influenced by his interest in Maxfield Parrish, Hannes Bok, EC Comics, and various science fiction illustrators. After graduating from high school in 1957, he attended a two-year junior college, worked in forestry for two years and then returned to college. In the early 1960s, he contributed to fanzines and an underground newspaper, followed by a period in the National Guard.Estren, Mark James. A History of Underground Comics. Straight Arrow, 1974. Later, he lived in Santa Cruz, California and moved to San Jose, California, where he resided for many years near the San Jose State University campus. In the mid-to-late 1960s, he worked at Santa Clara's Hambley Studios, where he was a production serigraph printer for fine art print production of such artists as Corita Kent. Metzger contributed to such publications as Gothic Blimp Works and Bill Spicer's Graphic Story Magazine. He eliminated dialogue balloons in \\"Mal-Ig\\" (Gothic Blimp Works #7); reprinted in Graphic Story Magazine, \\"Mal-Ig\\" was a strong influence on Paul Chadwick's The World Below.Chadwick, Paul. The World Below. Obsessively drawing every night, Metzger could be found at his drawing board while friends gathered and talked around him. In the early days of the original Star Trek, Metzger and several friends would gather every Wednesday evening to watch. Always a guest at the hippest parties in the Bay Area, he often carried a flask of brandy in his back pocket for all to share. He was friendly with the underground artists of the day, plus many Bay Area bluegrass and country musicians, as well as the Grateful Dead.Gothic Blimp Works His best known creation is Moondog, a science-fantasy series notable for its sophisticated art and elaborate imaginative framework. Published by the Print Mint, it ran from 1969 until 1973. It has no connection with the character Moondog in the comic strip Monty. His story \\"Routine\\" was published in Graphic Story Magazine #16. The cover of Metzger's comic book Truckin (Print Mint, 1972) includes a self-portrait in the truck's mirror. In 1978, Kitchen Sink Press published Metzger's Mu, the Land that Never Was. Metzger later worked for several animation studios in Vancouver, including Marv Newland's International Rocketship Limited. In 2016, Fantagraphics Books re-issued Metzger's graphic novel, Beyond Time and Again.  Awards Metzger was the Artist Guest of Honor at Vancouver's Vcon 8 in 1980, invited back as the Artist GoH Emeritus in 2010.

Allegations =Pressure to become an informer= According to family members, Awad was pressured by US military personnel to become an informant against the insurgency. The area around Hamdania, a small village near Abu Ghraib prison, is an area of frequent insurgent attacks. His family indicated that Awad refused to become an informer. =Early morning abduction and killing= According to family members, around 2:00am on the night of April 26, 2006, US Marines went house to house in the small village pounding on doors. At the house of Awad's cousin's family they confiscated the family AK-47 (each family in Iraq is entitled to own one rifle), as well as a shovel. When they arrived at Awad's house the Marines were seen pulling him out of the house by the arms without asking him any questions. Approximately 30 minutes later gunshots were heard. In the morning the family was informed by local police that Hashim Ibrahim Awad had been shot in the face and left in a hole dug by the side of the road, with the AK-47 and shovel beside him as though he had been digging a hole to plant an IED.

Early years  Dell was born in San Antonio, Texas on January 10, 1910. She attended school in San Antonio and Mexico. Dell was blonde and blue- eyed, with a porcelain face. Her height was 5'5\\". In Bette Davis's 1962 autobiography The Lonely Life, she makes a passing reference to \\"Little Claudia Dell\\", an actress from the 1930s and early '40s, \\"whose image,\\" Bette remarks, \\"was used as Columbia Pictures' signature for years.\\" Early career Dell's aunt Mary Dell was an actress in vaudeville. Her niece desired to go on the stage from an early age. Claudia's first experience as an entertainer was playing her violin for soldiers at Kelly Field during World War I. She visited New York with Mary at age 14 and yearned to remain there. After completing her education at home, Dell returned to New York and became an understudy to Irene Delroy in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1927. She studied acting in New York City at the Academy and singing at the Juilliard School. Soon she was sent to London to play the lead in a musical comedy, Mary Mary. The play's run lasted one year. While in England, scouts from Warner Brothers noticed her and asked her to come to Hollywood. She returned to New York along with her aunt following a tour of southern Europe. Claudia became homesick, rejected leads offered her in two stage productions and moved to Los Angeles, California, where her family was living. Hollywood Dell made her screen debut following an interlude of three months after coming west. She was given a contract by Warner Bros. to star in a number of musical pictures. She played the title role in a lavish Technicolor musical film, Sweet Kitty Bellairs (1930). Her next role was in another important musical, co-starring with Al Jolson in Big Boy (1930). Unfortunately, late in 1930, due to the beginning of the Great Depression, the public had grown weary of musicals. Warner Brothers, however, had already begun to film two other musicals (which would be released in 1931) in which Dell was given a leading role. The first of these was another lavish Technicolor production entitled Fifty Million Frenchmen. In the second film, Sit Tight (1931), she played the love interest of Paul Gregory, another musical star. Ironically, both pictures had their musical sequences cut before release. Warner Bros. dropped her option in 1931 (along with most of its other musical stars) and Claudia (having become associated with musicals) was relegated to Poverty Row productions. B-movies Dell bounced back at Universal Pictures in the first of four westerns, Destry Rides Again (1932), which starred cowboy actor Tom Mix. In 1935 she played the heroine in a very low-quality serial, The Lost City. Other 1930s films in which she appeared included Algiers (1938) and We're in the Legion Now! (1936). By the close of the 1930s she was reduced to playing minor roles, and the 1940s continued her career decline. She was cast in low-budget productions like Black Magic (1944), a Charlie Chan series movie. Also in 1944 she was in \\"Meeting At Midnight\\", another Charlie Chan series movie. She had a part in Call of the Jungle (1944), a jungle \\"adventure\\" from Poverty Row studio Monogram Pictures that showcased stripper Ann Corio.  Radio  After her film career faltered, Dell was under contract for five years with RKO Howard Hughes organization and did many Lux Radio Theater programs for Cecil B. DeMille and Orson Welles. She had her own television show in New York, Leave It to the Girls. In the early 1970s Dell had a syndicated radio program that aired in the Midwest called The Claudia Dell Show. She wrote a syndicated column for eight years and in 1973 completed a collaboration with English author Helga Moray. This was for a television script which was considered for the Theater of the Week program.  Personal life  Dell and Phillip G. Offin married when she was 17. She obtained a divorce from him two years later, in 1930. On December 29, 1934, Dell married theatrical agent Edward Silton. She gave her age as 22. The couple honeymooned at the Palm Springs, California, desert resort and also in Europe. They were later divorced. She married retired chewing gum manufacturer Daniel Emmett in 1947. Modeling instructor She worked as a receptionist in a beauty shop in Hollywood and made appearances in early television dramas. In 1973 she became the student director of the John Robert Powers School of Charm and Modeling in Sherman Oaks, California, and Woodland Hills Promenade. Previously, she had worked 12 years as director of the John Robert Powers School in Beverly Hills, California. Claudia commented about her new position, \\"There is no better work than being able to be associated with a school which helps mold young people for the future and one that gives a whole new dimension to a woman's life.\\"  Death  Dell died in Los Angeles in 1977.

The station is named after the Kharkiv National University, which is located on top of the square. Up until 1994 the station was called Dzerzhinska according to the name of the square Poloscha Dzerzhinskoho, (Dzherzhinsky square) after the founder of the Soviet Secret Police Felix Dzerzhinsky. It currently forms a complex with the adjacent station Derzhprom on the Oleksiivska Line. The station is located deep underground and is a bi-level pillar-trispan with blank marble columns. The station's second level balconiesare The station's service rooms are located on one of the second level balconies, and the other balcony is used as an underground passenger transfer for when there are fairs and concerts on the Ploscha Svobody. The underground transfer was once used for daily passenger usage during the 1980s, but was closed down during the early 1990s. There are six-meter cupolas in diameter, each hanging 12 meters apart and weighing 120 tons, are incorporated into the ceiling, in which the station's chandeliers hang. The station itself is 13 meters in width, due to the transfer point to the Derzhprom station on the Oleksiyivsky Line. The transfer itself was supposed to include escalator access to passengers, but as there was an economic crisis in the country, the escalators were abandoned and replaced with regualer stairs. A large portrait of Felix Dzerzhinsky was located on the station which was later removed after the renovation of the station. Station vestibules are located on both ends of the station, which have been linked with a network of underground passenger tunnels which have many small shops.

His ratings have been a part of the Bowl Championship Series since the 1999 season. He is an assistant professor of mathematics at Carson‚ÄìNewman University in Tennessee.  Methods  Massey, unlike the developers of other sports rating systems, gives quite a lot of information on how his system works, but omits enough details to prevent someone from copying the calculations in their entirety. The Massey Ratings are designed to measure past performance, not necessarily to predict future outcomes. The first challenge for any computer rating system is to account for the variability in performance. A team will not always play up to its full potential. Other random factors (officiating, bounce of the ball) may also affect the outcome of a game. The model must somehow eliminate the \\"noise\\" which obscures the true strength of a team. The second goal is to account for the differences in schedule. When there is a large disparity in schedule strength, win-loss records lose their significance. The model must evaluate games involving mismatched opponents, as well as contests between well matched teams. It is necessary to achieve a reasonable balance between rewarding teams for wins, convincing wins, and playing a tough schedule. This issue is difficult to resolve, and rating systems exist that are based on each of the extremes. The overall team rating is a merit based quantity, and is the result of applying a Bayesian win-loss correction to the power rating. Only the score, venue, and date of each game are used to calculate the Massey ratings. Stats such as rushing yards, rebounds, or field-goal percentage are not included. Nor are game conditions such as weather, crowd noise, day/night, or grass/artificial turf. Overtime games are not treated any differently. Finally, neither injuries nor psychological factors like motivation are considered.  Justification  Massey's ratings are particularly relevant in the world of American college football, where, with over 100 teams in NCAA Division I competition, there is no way a team can play against more than a small fraction of its competitors. Therefore, in determining the participants in championship games and tournaments, it is necessary to distinguish between teams that have compiled impressive win-loss records against strong competition and teams that have defeated weaker opponents. Massey's analysis is a valuable tool for leagues that need to fairly seed playoff brackets, or schedule games that will encourage competitive play and good sportsmanship. Sports rating systems are generally used by gamblers to forecast results, but Massey is not affiliated with this industry. Massey's ratings came under some scrutiny, even from Massey himself in late 2008 for rating undefeated Utah ahead of then-consensus human poll #1 Alabama at the end of the season. In spite of the controversy, his ratings gained redemption after then-#6 Utah's 31‚Äì17 victory in the 2009 Sugar Bowl over then-#4 Alabama.  Background  Massey first got the idea to do sports ratings as an undergraduate at Bluefield College. He developed various rating models at that time, and presented his work in the form of an honors project. While doing graduate work in mathematics at Virginia Tech, Massey was invited by Roy Kramer, then commissioner of the Southeastern Conference and president of the Bowl Championship Series, to submit his ratings for inclusion in the BCS ranking formula. Massey's college football rankings were part of the BCS formula from 1999 to 2013. Massey also consults for various amateur and professional athletic leagues.  Personal life  Massey resides in a high neighborhood of Jefferson City, TN with his wife, a native of Sibiu, Romania. They currently have three small children, a daughter Page, and sons Charles and Vlad.

The males are blind, apterous, and their body length is only 40% that of females. With a body length averaging 186 Œºm (for 8 specimens measured, which ranged from 139 to 240 Œºm), males of D. echmepterygis have the shortest body length of all known insects (smaller than certain species of Paramecium and amoeba, which are single-celled organisms). The measured body length of a female was 550 Œºm. The eggs and larvae of this parasitoid are considerably smaller than the adult. Dicopomorpha echmepterygis male This species, described from Illinois, United States, is an idiobiont parasitoid of the eggs of a lepidopsocid barklouse, Echmepteryx hageni. Of five host eggs dissected, four contained one male and one female, the fifth one contained three males and one female. Adult males appear to mate with their sisters inside the host egg and die without ever leaving the egg. Similar life histories can be found with other species of Chalcidoidea, such as the trichogrammatid Prestwichia aquatica, which also mates within the host egg, fig wasps in the family Agaonidae, which exhibit similar sexual dimorphism and mate within the host fig, and mites in the genus Adactylidium, which mate inside the body of their mother before they are born.

This is a custom built wooden coaster based upon the original coaster Mr. Twister that was at Elitch Gardens before the park was moved to its new location in 1995. The roller coaster was designed by John Pierce, who also designed the famous The Rattler wooden roller coaster at Six Flags Fiesta Texas. It was constructed by the Hensel Phelps Construction Co. The trains were made by the Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters company. Twister II is significantly tamer than the original Mr. Twister. The motto for the ride is \\"Built wilder the second time around!\\" Layout =Queue= Riders venture through the queue area as it winds through the middle of the coaster's layout. Once riders head into the station area, there are paintings of the original Elitch Gardens' roller coasters hanging on the wall below the boarding area. Riders then board the Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters trains. =Ride Experience= Leaving the station, adjacent to the railroad tracks, the track makes a right hand turn to the lift hill. From the lift hill, riders can view other rides at the park, as well as the Downtown Denver skyline. Leaving the lift hill, trains snake around a swooping drop, mimicking the drop on the original Mister Twister. This is followed by a drop to the ground, and a rise up into a big turnaround, and another drop. After the second drop, the track goes through a double up type element wrapping around the first drop turn, before making another drop and hill and descending into the big helix. Upon leaving the helix, there is a slight straight segment before dropping to the left, entering a tunnel in the structure of the second turnaround. From the tunnel, a straight segment precedes another turnaround that leads into the final brakes. Overall, the layout of Twister II has similarities to the Mister Twister, but a noticeable difference is the helix entry. While Mister Twister went down the second drop and into the helix right away, Twister II leaves the second drop and goes up a double up hill, then makes another drop and rise, and enters the helix near the station. Because of this, the entrance to the tunnel does not cross over the second climb. Notes Throughout the 2005/2006 off season, some sections of Twister II got new wood and the trains received a new American flag theme. The front of the train also got a Six Flags 45th anniversary emblem painted on it, to celebrate the chains' anniversary. The height restriction was also lowered from 52 to 48 inches tall, in keeping with most other wooden coasters.

Development The neighborhood arose during the dictatorship of Juan Carlos Ongan√≠a in 1966, as part of a plan for the eradication of illegal settlements. This took place in stages, one of which coincided with the construction of the soccer stadiums for the 1978 World Cup. The military wanted it to be a well- guarded settlement, primarily for the poor. They deposited many people there who had been removed from the Villa 31 slum in Retiro.Clar√≠n (10/31/2000) According to the 2001 census, Fuerte Apache houses 17,777 people in 4,657 residences, although up to four times that number may reside in the complex, as many families lease spare rooms for extra income. During a brief period between dictatorships, the neighbourhood was christened \\"Liberation Father Mugica\\" in 1974, in honor of the anti-poverty activist, who had been murdered days before by paramilitary squads. The military renamed it \\"Ej√©rcito de los Andes\\" ('Army of the Andes') in 1976, and the nickname Fuerte Apache was given by the journalist Jos√© de Zer alluding to the movie Fort Apache, The Bronx while reporting about a gunfight in the complex.

Distinctive content included stories about children around the world and a pen-pal club that encouraged intercultural communication. The name of the show referred to the appearance of Earth as a giant marble, popularized by The Blue Marble, a famous photograph taken in December 1972 by the crew of Apollo 17. Each episode featured a segment about the real life of a boy and a girl, one American, the other foreign. The show also had occasional stories about world ecology. In addition there was a weekly segment in which a singing globe \\"Bluey\\" invited viewers to write letters to the show, often requests for pen pals. The address to send the letters was in Santa Barbara, California. The character was voiced by executive producer Robert Wiemer. Production personnel included creators Ken Snyder, Henry Fownes, and Robert Garrison, and later executive producer Robert Weimer, producer Rick Berman (who later became producer for the Star Trek series), writers Lynn Rogoff and directors Joe Napolitano, Joseph Consentino, Tom Hurwitz, John McDonald, J.J. Linsalata, Pat Saunders, and Ira Wohl. Robert Saidenberg was supervising producer, Peter Hammer supervising film editor and Dale Glickman post-production supervisor of the series late in its run. Paul Baillargeon composed much of the series' music and recruited Wiemer's young daughter Whitney Kershaw to sing \\"Get Closer,\\" the closing theme for the second half of the series' run. Weimer often rewarded staff members with the opportunity to pitch story ideas and direct segments of the series. As a result, many got their first chance to work in that capacity. Some children featured on the show who went on to high- profile careers include Tisha Campbell (actress/singer), France Joli (disco singer) and Kevin Clash (the first prominent performer of Elmo on Sesame Street). Before they were well known, actors Sarah Jessica Parker and Kelly Reno were featured in dramatic segments in the series. Each of the first 78 half-hour episodes produced during the original three years of production contained animated pieces sequences by Ron Campbell Films, Inc., executive produced and directed by Ron Campbell, written by Cliff Roberts. In 1974, A&M; Records released an album of songs from the show, also titled Big Blue Marble (catalog no. SP-3401). Funded by ITT, Big Blue Marble was syndicated to television stations throughout the United States and Canada. C/F International was the most recent rights holder to the series; that company folded in 2008.

It is located in the Tres de Febrero Partido, immediately to the west of the neighborhood of Liniers in Buenos Aires city proper. It is separated from the city by General Paz avenue. History Home to a cattle ranch in colonial times (Rancho de Castro), the area was the site of a base of operations for Viceroy Santiago de Liniers during the British invasions of the R√≠o de la Plata of 1806. The first settlement was named Villa Liniers in his honor, and was the site of a major military camp after 1902. The town began to take shape with the arrival of the Ferrocarril Oeste railway in 1910, and was officially established that year. Ciudadela gradually grew around the railway station, and eventually merged into the Greater Buenos Aires urban agglomeration. Fuerte Apache, whose official name is \\"Barrio Ej√©rcito de los Andes\\" (), is a public housing development in Ciudadela. The subject of ongoing controversy, its colloquial name stems from Fort Apache, The Bronx, a 1981 movie about a crime-ridden part of New York City. Ciudadela had 73,155 inhabitants according to 2001 census, and features a lively commerce hub along Avenida Rivadavia, as well as two Jewish cemeteries. The historic barracks are now the Argentine Army Museum.

It is online, 2 player, and features 2 decks (a triple deck, and a special 13-card pile). Each player must race to remove cards of the special 13-card pile, and put their cards on the shared piles/suit stacks (e.g. putting an ace of any suit on the pile, but putting 2's of a suit may only be possible after the ace of the suit is currently on the pile, not covered by any other cards). There are eight different suit stacks possible. Other differences between this and normal Solitaire are that not just Kings, but any card can be put on a blank row stack, and there are four black row stacks to put on instead of seven. The game ends if one player removes all cards of the 13-card pile, or when both players are \\"stuck\\" and cannot remove/put up any more cards, and manually end the game using the End Game button. This game is similar to the game nertz. = Checkers = A standard two-player game of checkers. = Bejeweled = A two-player game where pairs of jewels on a playfield are switched to arrange three or more in a line of the same colour therefore removing them from the game.

There are 51 mines on the map. If you find a flag you get to continue, otherwise it becomes your opponent's turn.

She held the WIBF light-heavyweight title in 2006.  Professional career  Ijeoma Egbunine's first professional match was a win by unanimous decision against Janaya Davis in December 2004. That decision was highly contested by Davis, however, who claimed she was set up to lose by the promoter. Egubine did not take these comments lightly, and promised to be more aggressive during their next fight. In her second match against the Atlanta favorite on 25 February 2005, Egbunine KO'ed Davis in the second round. According to, \\"In the second round the intensity did not let up as the bad blood began to boil between the two. At the 30 second mark of the 2nd round Egbunine landed a crushing overhand right that sent Davis brutally to the canvas. Davis struggled to get to her feet as she fell for a second time trying. As she stumbled to her feet referee Jim Korb stopped the fight -- Jose Santiago\\" Her only loss came on 12 March 2005, to Nikki Eplion (in her first fight since losing to Laila Ali) in a close decision. The bout, only the third for Egbunine, was the main event on the seven-fight \\"A Punch Of Class\\" in front of 600 fans in the ballroom at the Radisson Hotel, Huntington, West Virginia. Since then, Egbunine went on a string of victories (including 7 more KOs) against a number of talented boxers, including Carlette Ewell and Valerie Mahfood. On Saturday, 17 June 2006, she took on the well known √Ösa Sandell of Sweden at the Joel Coliseum Annex, Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Sandell had fought Laila Ali in December 2005 and lost in the 5th round. Egbunine won with a TKO in the second round, taking her one step closer to an inevitable first- time match-up with the popular Ali. Ijeoma Egbunine is scheduled to fight 28-year-old Laila Ali this summer in Cape Town, South Africa. Some proceeds from the 5 August bout will benefit the Nelson Mandela Foundation, and the light heavyweight matchup will be part of a monthlong celebration of women's empowerment in South Africa.

Early Life Born near Osceola Mills, Centre County, Pennsylvania to Welsh immigrants, Lewis worked in the local coal mines from 1878 to 1892. He studied law and Latin in his spare time, was admitted to the bar in 1892, and commenced practice in Cumberland, Maryland. Political Career Lewis served as a member of the Maryland State Senate from 1902 to 1906, and was an unsuccessful Democratic candidate for election to the Sixty- first Congress in 1908. In 1910, he was elected as a Democrat to the Sixty- second, Sixty-third, and Sixty-fourth Congresses, serving the sixth district of Maryland from March 4, 1911 to March 3, 1917. During the Sixty-third and Sixty-fourth Congresses, he served as chairman of the House Committee on Labor. He was not a candidate for renomination in 1916, but was an unsuccessful Democratic candidate for election to the United States Senate. President Roosevelt signs the Social Security Act into law, August 14, 1935. From April 1917 to March 1925, Lewis was a member of the United States Tariff Commission. He was again an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate in 1922, and resumed the practice of law in Cumberland. He was again elected to the Seventy-second and to the three succeeding Congresses, serving the sixth district of Maryland from March 4, 1931 to January 3, 1939, but was not a candidate for renomination in 1938, having run for senator, challenging incumbent Millard Tydings in the Democratic primary. Lewis was more sympathetic to the New Deal than Tydings and won the backing of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Nevertheless, his third bid for the Senate was again unsuccessful, and instead he served as a member of the National Mediation Board from 1939 to 1943. He died in Cumberland on August 12, 1952 and is interred in Hillcrest Cemetery. Social Security Act David John Lewis was the leading expert on social insurance legislation on the House Ways & Means Committee. He introduced the Social Security bill into the House on January 17, 1935. However, Chairman Doughton, exercising what he took to be the Chairman's privileges, made a copy of Lewis' bill and submitted it himself. Then he persuaded the House clerk to give him a lower number than Lewis' copy. Newspapers then began calling the bill \\"The Wagner-Doughton bill.\\" When Lewis found out, he sputtered and swore, then went to work to understand every sentence and master the arguments in favor of the bill. And when David Lewis walked down the aisle of the House to debate on the bill's behalf, he received a standing ovation.

The village lies about northeast of the town of Chippenham. The Bristol Avon forms most of the northern and eastern boundaries of the parish. The hamlets of Thornend and Upper Town lie within the parish. The unusual name is evidently a corruption of Christ mal Ford, Old English moel, mal being a mark: \\"Christ‚Äôs mal\\" is Christ‚Äôs mark or sign, the cross. Thus the name signified \\"Cross Ford\\". Deeds from Glastonbury Abbey cartulary relate to Christmalford Manor: in AD 940 King Edmund granted Christmalford to St Dunstan, Abbot of Glastonbury. In 1086 the Abbey of Glastonbury remained tenant-in-chief of Cristemeleforee in the ancient Domesday hundred of Sterchelai (Startley).The Historical Gazetteer of English Place Names: Hundred of Startley , accessed June 2017 Christian Malford and the other parishes of Startley hundred were amalgamated with additional parishes to form the hundred of Malmesbury.  Fossils  The village is known to palaeontologists as a rediscovered Lagerst√§tte, a site of remarkably preserved fossils, in this case in the Middle Jurassic Oxford clay, in which a chance discovery in the 19th century uncovered thousands of exquisitely preserved ammonites, fish and crustaceans. The site, whose exact location had not been publicly disclosed, became most famous for squid-like cephalopods and belemnites, complete with their phosphatized soft parts. The site was rediscovered in 2008.Philip R.

Religious sites  = Parish church = All Saints' church The Church of England parish church of All Saints, close to the river, is a Grade I listed building. The church dates from c. 1300 but has evidence of an earlier building. The south aisle and chapel were added in the 14th century; the tower is 18th-century with 14th- century lower stages. Inside, the font is c. 1200 and the chapel screen from the 15th century is richly carved. Several windows have fragments of 15th- century glass. The church underwent restoration in the 19th century and was re-ordered in the 1990s. The parish is now part of the Draycot Benefice. = Congregational chapel = A Congregational chapel named Shecaniah was built in 1836, near the main road on the western outskirts of the village, not far from the river bridge. William Jay (1769-1853), later an eminent preacher, was pastor here during his early career in the late 1780s. A schoolroom was added in 1909 and later in the century the congregation joined the United Reformed Church. The chapel closed in 1998, then was converted for residential use.  Transport  Christian Malford is near a crossing point of the Avon, which in this area flows south from Malmesbury to Chippenham. The centre of settlement is to the south of the main road, which in the past was the A420 from Chippenham to Swindon (via Lyneham and Royal Wootton Bassett). The M4 motorway, built in 1971 and passing less than a mile north of the village centre, became the preferred route for traffic to and from Swindon, and in the late 1980s the A420 was redesignated as the B4069. The Wilts & Berks Canal, built across the southeast of the parish, to the east of Thornend, opened in this area in 1801. Completed in 1810, the canal carried goods including Somerset coal to Wootton Bassett, Swindon and beyond; it was abandoned in 1914. The Great Western Main Line, the railway from London to Bristol, followed a similar route to the canal but further west, passing between Christian Malford and Thornend. The line opened in 1841 and in 1869 station opened at Dauntsey Lock, just over the eastern boundary of the parish. In 1926 a small station, , was opened to serve the village. The station closed in 1965 when local services were withdrawn. The line remains open, with the nearest railway station being at .  Amenities  The village has a small primary school, near the church; its first building dates from 1835. There is a village hall and a pub, the Rising Sun.

The piers may be masonry or of assembled sections of wrought iron. Aside from this stabilizing feature, the overthrow was largely freed of constraints of barring passage of animals or people. Consequently, the iron master was free to express his fancy. Overthrows often feature monograms or cyphers, armorial crests or supporters, and even fully realized coats of arms.

The parish includes the hamlet of Draycot Cerne. In the Survey of English Dialects, the recording from the village was one of the furthest away from Standard English that was recorded.Dialect Location Sutton Benger lies in the Dauntsey Vale, the wide floodplain of the Bristol Avon. The river forms much of the eastern boundary of the parish.  History  A settlement at Draicote with 22 households was recorded in the 1086 Domesday Book survey. Draycote Cerne was a separate parish until it was merged into Sutton Benger in 1934. The manor belonged to Malmesbury Abbey. Soon after the Dissolution it was acquired by Robert Long (d.1581), who also owned Draycot. The estate remained in the Long family, later the Tylney-Long baronets, until 1812 when it passed by marriage to the 4th Earl of Mornington. The Earl's descendants held the land until 1920 when it was sold as separate farms. Sutton Benger village developed along the Swindon-Chippenham road. Manor Farmhouse has 13th- century origins and was altered and extended in the 17th and 19th centuries. The road through the village was the A420 which ran from Bristol to Swindon and Oxford. This section was reclassified as the B4069 some time after the building of the M4 motorway in the early 1970s, passing to the north of the village.  Religious sites  The Anglican Church of All Saints is Grade II* listed. The stone rubble building has 12th-century origins and a 15th-century tower; it was heavily restored in 1851 by J.H. Hakewill. The circular stone font, decorated with a scalloped band, may be from an early date. Of the five bells, one is from c. 1400 and the dates of three others range from 1631 to 1706. The benefice was united with those of Christian Malford and Tytherton Kellaways in 1966. Today the parish is part of the Draycot benefice, which also covers Seagry and Kington Langley. St James's Church, Draycot Cerne was built around 1300 and declared redundant in 1994. Also Grade II* listed, it is in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. Local government The civil parish elects a parish council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions. Draycot Cerne and Seagry, formerly separate parishes, were added to Sutton Benger in 1934. In 1971 all land north of the newly built M4 was transferred to a recreated Seagry parish. Amenities The village has a primary school, a post office and a doctors surgery. The village hall has a recreation ground and a multi-use games area. Several community groups make use of the hall including a pre-school, Benger Bears,Benger Bears a playgroup, WI and Over 60's group. There is a pub - the Wellesley Arms, a restaurant - La Flamb√©, and a hotel/restaurant - The Bell House Hotel.

Description  Restoration and size comparison Theosodon was long-legged with a long neck resembling modern llamas or guanacos. It was large for a litoptern, reaching up to in length and weighing up to . It had a long neck and tapir-like, three-toed feet, and like other litopterns and modern horses, tapirs and rhinos, it bore its weight on its middle toes. Extraordinarily, rather than having nostrils at the front of its head, Theosodon had its nostrils on the top of its snout, halfway between the forehead and the tip of the snout, and its nostrils pointed upwards rather than forwards, possibly as an adaptation for browsing on prickly vegetation.  History  Theosodon has been known since the 19th century, and by 1910 seven species had been described within the genus, all from the early Miocene Santa Cruz Formation in Argentina. The name Theosodon means \\"god tooth\\". The first fossils were only dental remains, but it is unknown why this name was given. Though seven species had originally been described, the exact number of discovered species remains uncertain as it varies between different authors. There are either ten or seven species, and in 2014 Schmidt and Ferrero put forward that the genus needed a full taxonomic revision due to this issue. = \\"Theosodon\\" hystatus = In 1931, fossils found in the late Miocene Arroyo Chasic√≥ Formation were assigned to the genus under the name Theosodon hystatus. This was questioned in 1995, and in 2014 it was moved to the genus Paranauchenia due to similarities to the species Paranauchenia denticulata. This move was supported by phylogenetic analysis that showed the two species formed monophyletic clade. = \\"Theosodon\\" arozquetai = In 2018 a new species of macraucheniid litoptern was described based on the partial remains of a skull and two metapodials. A phylogenetic analysis tentatively linked the species to Theosodon as a sister clade and it was named Theosodon arozquetai pending revision. Its body mass was estimated to be somewhere from . It dated to the middle Miocene, about 13 million years ago, somewhat later than most other Theosodon species.  Classification  Reconstructed skeleton Theosodon is in the subfamily Cramaucheniinae within the family Macraucheniidae. A phylogenetic analysis of the family in 2014 found that Cramaucheniinae is a paraphyletic group, and that Theosodon is a sister clade to the subfamily Macraucheniinae, the least primitive of the members of Cramaucheniinae.  Paleobiology  Restoration of Theosodon garretorum and Borhyaena tuberata Theosodon was a terrestrial and cursorial animal that may have lived in both forests and more open environments. Due to its size and its long neck, Theosodon was likely a high browser, stripping leaves off of trees and shrubs high off the ground. Theosodon had a slender jaw compared to many other litopterns, indicating its food was softer, such as dicotyledons. As its nostrils are upward-facing and at the centre of its head rather than the front, Theosodon may have used this adaptation to feed on thorny plants. Some modern animals such as giraffes feed on thorny plants, and their nostrils are also further back and face more upwards than forwards. Other fossils were found in the Yecua Formation of Bolivia, the Honda Group of Colombia, the Chucal and R√≠o Fr√≠as Formations of Chile and the Ipururo Formation of Peru.Theosodon at Fossilworks.org  References  Category:Litopterns Category:Miocene mammals of South America Category:Laventan Category:Colloncuran Category:Friasian Category:Neogene Argentina Category:Fossils of Argentina Category:Neogene Bolivia Category:Fossils of Bolivia Category:Neogene Chile Category:Fossils of Chile Category:Neogene Colombia Category:Fossils of Colombia Category:Honda Group, Colombia Category:Neogene Peru Category:Fossils of Peru Category:Fossil taxa described in 1887 Category:Taxa named by Florentino Ameghino ","title":"Theosodon"},{"id":"5668829","text":"Amanda Louise Rishworth (born 10 July 1978) is an Australian politician who has served as the Australian Labor Party member for the House of Representatives seat of Kingston in South Australia since the 2007 election. Rishworth is Shadow Minister for Early Childhood Education and Shadow Minister for Youth in the Albanese Shadow Ministry. Early years Rishworth was born in Adelaide at Flinders Medical Centre to Judith and Leslie, and has two siblings, Julian and Shannon. She attended Unley High School and was a retail worker and swimming instructor while also doing volunteer surf lifesaving duties at Seacliff. She later worked as an organiser and trainer for the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association (SDA) and was president of Australian Young Labor in 2000.Australian Labor Party : Amanda Rishworth ‚Äì Member for Kingston . Australian Labor Party. Retrieved 13 January 2011. Rishworth studied psychology at Flinders University where she was president of the students' union before furthering her studies at Adelaide University with a master's degree in clinical psychology. She then became a practising psychologist in 2005 working in the delivery of mental health care to the community. Political career Rishworth was a Labor candidate at the 2006 state election for the electoral district of Fisher, where she was defeated by sitting independent Bob Such. Labor received a 59.4 per cent two-party- preferred vote from a 15.1-point swing against the Liberals, marking the first time since the 1985 state election that Labor won the two-party-preferred vote in Fisher. In November 2006 Rishworth was preselected unopposed to contest the seat of Kingston at the 2007 federal election. She was up against the sitting Coalition member Kym Richardson who held the most marginal seat for his party after winning it at the 2004 federal election by just 119 votes. Two opinion polls conducted throughout the year by The Advertiser had a swing to Rishworth of up to 7 per cent. Key issues she concentrated on included the lack of broadband access in the electorate, as well as the shortage of doctors. During a debate on industrial relations centring on the Howard Government's controversial WorkChoices legislation, Rishworth was forced to debate minister Joe Hockey after Richardson pulled out with a prior commitment. Once the election campaign began local announcements included a $12.5 million GP Super Clinic and a $7 million upgrade to the South Road and Victor Harbor Road intersection. A poll midway through the campaign had Rishworth with a similar lead over Richardson to earlier opinion polls and on election day she ended up defeating him with a 54.4 per cent two-party-preferred vote from a 4.5-point swing, one of the seats that took the party from opposition to government after nearly 12 years. =Government= Rishworth gave her maiden speech to the House of Representatives in February 2008. She spoke of the time when she was a retail worker at Toys \\"R\\" Us during her teenage years and was offered an Australian workplace agreement (AWA) as a result of new laws introduced by the Howard government, which she refused to sign and as a result was put out of work. Rishworth's work in the parliament included being a member of the health and ageing, communications as well as the industry, science and innovation committees. In September 2008, Rishworth introduced a private member's bill in the parliament calling for a new agreement between the Australian and British governments concerning the need to index the British pension in Australia. In February 2010, Rishworth again introduced a private member's bill into parliament, this time calling for a new code of conduct for the media industry to moderate the rapid growth of sexualisation in video clips, magazines, clothes and the internet. At the 2010 federal election, Rishworth's Liberal party opponent was Chris Zanker, a chief inspector with the South Australian Police who was only preselected a month before the election was called. During the campaign, Rishworth focussed on her record with construction underway on the GP super clinic as well as securing funds for an extension of the Noarlunga railway line to Seaford. A poll by The Advertiser showed a 12-point swing to her, with some suggesting this was in part due to new prime minister Julia Gillard having grown up in the Adelaide area. She was later re-elected with a 63.9 per cent two-party vote from a 9.5-point two-party swing, the largest margin of any party in Kingston's history, and the highest swing of any 2010 Labor candidate in the country, an election where the party suffered a 2.6-point swing against it nationally. In one stroke, she turned Kingston from the most marginal Labor seat in South Australia into the second-safest (behind only Port Adelaide). On 11 March 2011, Rishworth and four other Australian parliamentarians were stuck on a bullet train heading from Kyoto to Tokyo for around five hours because of the T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami. They were in Japan on a young leaders exchange. Rishworth was chair of the House of Representatives standing committee on education and employment as well as being a member of the Joint Standing electoral matters and Joint Select cyber- safety committees. She was also part of the Speaker's panel and was promoted to Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water along with Disabilities and Carers in March 2013. =Opposition= Rishworth retained her seat of Kingston at the 2013 election with a 59.7 per cent two-party vote from a 4.9-point swing, then the second-largest margin of any party in Kingston's history. Labor, however, lost government, making Rishworth only the fourth opposition MP in the seat's history. She was subsequently named Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Health in the Shorten Shadow Ministry. On 24 June 2014, she was promoted to the Shadow outer ministry as Shadow Assistant Minister for Education. She again retained her seat at the 2016 election with a 67 per cent two-party vote from a 7.3-point swing, the largest margin of any party in Kingston's history. Though Kingston remained Labor's second-safest South Australian seat behind Port Adelaide, Rishworth's primary vote of 49.4 per cent was the highest any candidate received throughout the eleven South Australian seats. Though Labor picked up a two-party swing in all eleven seats, the presence of Nick Xenophon Team candidates in all eleven seats produced, apart from a suppressed major party primary vote, a result where Rishworth was the only major party candidate in the state to pick up a primary vote swing. Following the 2016 election, Rishworth was named Shadow Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Shadow Minister for Defence Personnel. In late 2017 Rishworth was also named Shadow Minister for Early Childhood Education and Development and was promoted to Shadow Cabinet.  Positions  Rishworth supports same-sex marriage having voted in support of a bill in Federal Parliament in 2012 and 2017. Personal life Rishworth married Timothy Walker in January 2013 and they have one son, Percy. She lives in the Kingston electorate at Hallett Cove and continues to be a volunteer surf lifesaver at Christies Beach.

Leonard Alfred George Strong (8 March 1896 ‚Äì 17 August 1958) was a popular English novelist, critic, historian, and poet, and published under the name L. A. G. Strong. He served as a director of the publishers Methuen Ltd. from 1938 to 1958.  Life  Poet and novelist, born at Compton Gifford, of Irish parents, and was proud of his Irish heritage.[1] As a youth, he considered being a comedian and took lessons in singing. He was educated at Brighton College and earned a scholarship to Wadham College, Oxford, as what was known as an Open Classical Scholar (studies in literature and the arts).[3] There he came under the influence of W. B. Yeats, about whom Strong wrote fairly extensively; they met first in autumn 1919. Their friendship lasted for twenty years. He taught at an Oxford preparatory school, before becoming a full-time writer in 1930. His first two volumes of poetry were Dublin Days (1921) and The Lowery Road (1923), and his career as a novelist was launched with Dewer Rides (1929, set on Dartmoor). Later he formed a literary partnership with an Irish friend, John Francis Swaine (1880-1954), paying Swaine a percentage of royalties for five novels and numerous short stories, published between c.1930 and 1953, which were attributed to Strong. These included the Sea Wall (1933), The Bay (1944), and Trevannion (1948). Swaine's short stories described the thoughts and experiences of an Irish character, Mr Mangan, a fictional version of Swaine himself. Strong wrote many works of non‚Äêfiction and an autobiography of his early years, Green Memory (1961). He gained a wide interest in literature and wrote about many important contemporary authors, including James Joyce, William Faulkner, John Millington Synge, and John Masefield. He worked as an Assistant Master at Summer Fields, a boys' boarding preparatory school on the outskirts of Oxford, from 1917 to 1919 and from 1920 to 1930, and as a Visiting Tutor at the Central School of Speech and Drama. One of his pupils was a son of Reginald McKenna.[1] He was a director of the publishers Methuen Ltd. from 1938 until his death.[4] For many years he was a governor of his old school, Brighton College. Strong's autobiography, Green Memory, published after his death, described his family (including a grandmother in Ireland), his earliest years, his school-days, and his friendships at Wadham College; among them were Yeats and George Moore.[1] Following his death in Guildford, Surrey, a memorial service was held for him at St. Martin-in-the-Fields, London, on 3 October 1958.[5] His cousin was the nurse Emily MacManus; he wrote the foreword for her autobiography, Fifty Years Of Nursing - Matron of Guy's (1956).[6] * John Francis Swaine reference authority the Oxford Companion to English Literature, Ninth Edition, General Editor Professor Dinah Birch. Swaine's papers and manuscripts are lodged with the National Library of Ireland, Dublin. Career Strong was a versatile and prolific writer of more than 20 novels, as well as of short stories, plays, children's books, poems, biography, criticism, and film scripts. His oeuvre includes mystery novels, featuring Detective-Inspector McKay of Scotland Yard, and horror fiction. Many of his adventure and romance novels were set in Scotland or the West of England. The classic short story \\"Breakdown\\", a tale about a married man who has the perfect plan to murder his mistress, and which has a twist ending, has been reprinted often; it was a favorite of Boris Karloff. (Unhappy marriages were an occasional theme in his fiction, in works such as Deliverance.) His supernatural stories were often reprinted, as well. Strong was interested in the paranormal, as his haunted house and other horror stories attest, and believed he had seen ghosts and witnessed psychic phenomena.Strong, L. A. G. \\"Foreword.\\" The Psychic Sense, by Phoebe D. Payne and Laurence J. Bendit. London: Faber and Faber, 1944. One of his earliest writings, A Defence of Ignorance, was the first book sold by Captain Louis Henry Cohn, the founder of House of Books, which specialized in first editions of contemporary writers. Cohn was a New York book collector who of necessity became a bookseller due to the Wall Street Crash of 1929, and he had Strong's manuscript, a six-page essay, in his collection. Cohn published 200 signed copies of the title, priced at $2.00 each. Some of Strong's poems were set to music by Arthur Bliss. His Selected Poems appeared in 1931 (first American edition in 1932), and The Body's Imperfection: Collected Poems in 1957. He also edited anthologies of poetry, sometimes in collaboration with Cecil Day- Lewis. His 1932 novel The Brothers was filmed in 1947 by the Scottish director David MacDonald; it starred Patricia Roc. One reviewer commented, \\"In a break from tradition, the film substitutes the novel's unhappy ending with an even unhappier one.\\" Strong collaborated on or contributed to such filmscripts as Haunted Honeymoon (1940; a Dorothy L. Sayers story about Lord Peter Wimsey and Harriet Vane), Mr. Perrin and Mr. Traill (1948), and Happy Ever After (1954).  Verse  * Dublin Days. Oxford: B. Blackwell, 1921. * By Haunted Stream.

Critical reception Kirkus Reviews asserted in 1935, \\"L. A. G. Strong can be counted on for a nostalgic picture of the call of the wild, and spins a good yarn as well.\\" Garrett Mattingly, in The Saturday Review, praises Strong's \\"clean, muscular prose\\" and the \\"astonishing variety of mood and incident\\" in a review of The Seven Arms, saying that he \\"treats material which has become familiar, almost conventional, in the literature of the Celtic renascence with a freshness and power which makes it seem completely new and completely his own. ... He has been possessed by his material, and he has, in turn, completely possessed and mastered it.\\" (The review includes a photograph of Strong.) Strong enjoyed describing countrysides. He often dramatized the beginning and flourishing (and at times tragic ending) of romance between young people. For these reasons, among others, his fiction writing was sometimes considered sentimental. This was a quality popular among readers, though not always among those critics who embraced Modernist attitudes, which could be contemptuous of popular literature and which was a forceful influence at the time. For example, a reviewer of an early novel, The Jealous Ghost (1930), the \\"story of an American who goes to visit for the first time his English cousins in the West Highland house where his ancestors had lived,\\" judges that Strong's \\"feeling for 'the land' seems to be that of a tourist whose sensibilities are fluttered by views and sunsets,\\" but who also concluded that in his talent \\"lies the possibility of a delicate comedy akin to that of Jane Austen or Henry James.\\" Mattingly shows hostility to sentimentalism twice in his review of The Seven Arms (as his own writing can wax sentimental, perhaps he slightly protests too much, given the romantic qualities he admires), declaring of the heroine, \\"the splendor of her legend is a romantic figure out of a romantic time but a figure too robust for sentimental tenderness, too vital to be the focus of nostalgic revery\\" and adding that she is drawn \\"with sympathy and understanding but without sentimentality or exaggeration.\\" Richard Cordell, reviewing The Open Sky, likewise calls it \\"an exciting, unsentimental adventure.\\" However, a critic who did care for this quality in Strong's fiction wrote of the 1931 collection The English Captain and Other Stories that \\"there is nothing ingenious or fanciful in his writing--which means that the emotion is always preferred before the form, not the form before the emotion; and that, I fear, is uncommon enough in the short stories of today. There is one piece in particular--Mr. Kennedy in Charge--which contains the virtues of all the rest; delicate perception of character, tenderness, vigour, and a sublimation of brute pain. It is a stupendous piece of imaginative writing.\\" Reviewing The Buckross Ring and Other Stories of the Strange and Supernatural, Mario Guslandi writes, \\"at his best, Strong has an uncanny ability to create gentle, vivid and fascinating stories bound to leave the reader enchanted.\\" Ian McMillan of the Yorkshire Post called the stories \\"odd and genuinely chilling.\\"  References   External links   Category:1896 births Category:1958 deaths Category:English male journalists Category:English publishers (people) Category:People from Plymouth Category:Academics of the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama Category:James Tait Black Memorial Prize recipients Category:British male poets Category:English male novelists Category:20th-century English poets Category:20th-century English novelists Category:20th-century British male writers Category:Schoolteachers from Devon ","title":"Leonard Strong"},{"id":"5668859","text":"Troina (Sicilian: Traina) is a town and comune (municipality) in the province of Enna, Sicily, southern Italy.

Filmed mostly in the city of Goshen, Indiana, the film stars Casey Affleck as a chronically depressed aspiring writer who moves back into his parents' home after failing to make it in New York City. His older brother (Kevin Corrigan) already lives there with his two daughters. Liv Tyler stars as a good-hearted nurse who begins a sexual relationship with Jim and starts to see him as a potential stepfather for her son. Lonesome Jim premiered at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival, where it was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize,The Sundance Kid, New York, January 11, 2007.

The screenplay was based on characters and events in author Jim Strouse's life. The entire film was shot on a mini-DV digital video camera instead of actual film. Plot Jim (Casey Affleck) is a perennially gloomy 27-year-old aspiring writer from Goshen, Indiana who had moved to New York City in hopes of finding success with his writing. After two years of barely making a living as a dog walker, he decides to move back home to his parents' house in Goshen. Jim's 32-year-old brother Tim (Kevin Corrigan) is a recently divorced father of two young girls whose business recently failed. Tim has moved back into his parents' home and works in the ladder factory that's owned and operated by their father Don (Seymour Cassel) and cheerful mother Sally (Mary Kay Place). Jim has no interest in the family business and he resists pressure from Don to start working there. Jim meets Anika (Liv Tyler), a nurse, in a bar and they end up having sex in a hospital bed, though Jim finishes almost immediately. After a conversation between the two brothers on whose life is more pathetic, Tim, having previously made repeated unsuccessful attempts to commit suicide, drives his car into a tree. He is gravely injured, in a coma, and hospitalized. Jim finally gives in to Don and works in the factory by taking over Tim's duties. He also takes over Tim's job as the coach of a girls basketball team. The team, which has not scored a single point in the last 14 games, includes both of Tim's daughters. While visiting Tim is in the hospital, Jim runs into Anika, who works in pediatrics. They arrange a date, but on arriving to pick her up, he discovers she is a single mother. Their relationship progresses, however. Anika is sympathetic to Jim's problems, and she decides to stand by him even when he tries to convince her that it's in her best interest to not be around him. At the ladder factory, Jim encounters his uncle Stacy or \\"Stace\\" (Mark Boone Junior), who prefers to be called \\"Evil.\\" Over a joint, Evil offers advice about premature ejaculation, and they become better acquainted. Evil offers Jim some recreational drugs and asks Jim to open a checking account for him so he can pay for things by mail. Evil gives Jim $4,000, saying it is saved-up birthday and Christmas and graduation presents. Jim's mother, Sally, is arrested by DEA officers for allegedly shipping illegal drugs through the store's FedEx account. Evil is the drug dealer, but Jim cannot get him to confess. Evil points out that Jim will be implicated if he tries to report Evil, as he has opened an account with Evil's cash and will test positive for drug use. Eternal optimist that she is, Sally makes friends with her fellow prisoners and accepts a novel from Jim when he visits. Eventually she is released on bail. Despite working at the factory and feeling responsible for his mother's imprisonment, Jim allows his depression to be softened by Anika and finds himself believing that life is worth living. Jim invites Anika and her son to move to New Orleans with him, but after Jim gets cold feet and makes a questionable decision, the move seems to be off the table. Jim finally decides to leave town for New Orleans by himself, leaving a note for his parents promising not to take their love for granted again and revealing Evil as the drug dealer. Anika shows up at the bus station to say goodbye. Jim departs on the bus, but as Anika drives home with her son, Jim is seen running after them, luggage in hand. He asks \\"for a ride\\" and the movie ends with Jim, out-of-breath, finally getting a bottle of water from Ben in the back seat.

Bosnian food is closely related to Turkish, Mediterranean and other Balkan cuisines, along with some Central European influence. Many of the traditional dishes have been made from the same recipes for hundreds of years. Ingredients Bosnian cuisine uses many spices, but usually in moderate quantities. Most dishes are light, as they are boiled; the sauces are natural, consisting of little more than the natural juices of the vegetables in the dish. Typical ingredients include tomatoes, potatoes, onions, garlic, bell peppers, cucumbers, carrots, cabbage, mushrooms, spinach, courgette, dried and fresh beans, plums, milk, paprika and cream called pavlaka and kajmak. Typical meat dishes include primarily beef, lamb, and poultry due to Islamic dietary laws, although the Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Serbs can consume pork.

Stotzer Jr. Freeway, is a state highway in the U.S. state of Texas that runs from Loop 1604 to U.S. Highway 90 (US 90) in San Antonio. SH 151 is a limited-access freeway for its entire length with the exception of its junction with Loop 1604 at its western terminus where a traffic light controls the junction. The routing of the freeway was first conceived in 1983 and construction was conducted in phases through the 1980s and 1990s until completion in 2004. The freeway provides access to the western part of San Antonio, the SeaWorld San Antonio theme park, Chase, Northwest Vista College, and the future site of a Microsoft data center. History =Previous designation= The first SH 151 was designated on March 19, 1930, from Mason to Menard as a renumbering of SH 29A. On February 11, 1938, SH 151 was extended west to Eldorado. On April 29, 1942, the section of SH 151 west of Menard was cancelled and renamed FM 43, with the section west of the roadway north of the San Saba River west of US 83 cancelled. On March 17, 1948, FM 43 became part of SH 151, extending it to Eldorado. On August 22, 1951, SH 151 was cancelled and transferred to SH 29 which was extended. =Planning= The route of SH 151 was originally conceived in 1983 by local land developer Charles Martin Wender and later received approval by Raymond Stotzer, the district supervisor of the Texas Department of Transportation at the time and for whom the freeway would later be named. The freeway was a joint effort with landowners providing 85% of the right-of-way worth US$26 million and half of the cost of the frontage roads worth $14 million with the city buying the rest. During the construction of the freeway, the Texas Turnpike Authority considered SH 151 as a candidate to become a toll road, but this drew much criticism from local politicians and the Bexar County commissioners and did not come to fruition. SH 151 was designated on March 14, 1984, on its current route. =Construction= The freeway was built in phases with the frontage roads constructed first followed by the main lanes. The overpasses for Wiseman Boulevard, Westover Hills Boulevard and Military Drive between I-410 and Loop 1604 were completed over the main lanes of SH 151 in 1987. In 1988, the I-410 overpasses over the SH 151 frontage roads were completed, as was the interchange with US 90 at the eastern terminus. Also completed in 1988 were the frontage road bridges over Leon and Slick Ranch Creek, which enabled traffic to travel the entire corridor from Loop 1604 to US 90 by way of the frontage roads. The main lane overpasses at FM 1957 (Potranco Road) and Ingram Road were completed in 1997. The overpasses at Pinn Road and Enrique M. Barrera Parkway were completed in 1998, and completed at Callaghan Road in 2000. Construction of the freeway was completed in 2004. Route description SH 151 begins at Loop 1604, the outer loop around San Antonio, on the west side of San Antonio and from there follows a southeastern path through the western part of the city. The highway provides access to the SeaWorld San Antonio theme park as well as industry along its corridor to include Chase, Hyatt Hill Country Resort, World Savings, Philips semiconductor, the National Security Agency campus, QVC, American Funds, Maxim Integrated Products, and the Northwest Vista College, as well as the nearby Southwest Research Institute. Microsoft has also selected the corridor for a $550 million data center. The highway continues to the southeast to a junction with Interstate 410 (I-410), the inner loop around San Antonio. A new direct, flyover interchange was built connecting eastbound TX-151 with northbound I-410, alleviating traffic at its busiest stretches. A fully directional, stack interchange has been planned, partially funded, and is set to begin construction in 2019. The highway continues to the southeast through mainly undeveloped land until it merges with US 90. According to the San Antonio Master Thoroughfare Plan, there are plans to extend SH 151 westward from Loop 1604 to SH 211\\\\. The plan also shows the construction of an interchange at Loop 1604. Traffic volumes are low to moderate for the entire length of the freeway ranging from 14,500 average annual daily traffic (AADT) just east of Loop 1604 to 46,000 AADT between Farm to Market Road 1957 (FM 1957) and I-410. Between 2003 and 2005, traffic volumes have remained steady between I-410 and US 90\\\\. In that same time period, traffic between I-410 and Loop 1604 has increased by 1,100-7,000 AADT.

It is headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, and shares its operations with SEC Network and formerly with ESPNU. The corporation organizes sporting events for broadcast across the ESPN family of networks, including, most prominently, a group of college football bowl games and in-season college basketball tournaments. ESPN Events previously operated primarily as a syndicator of college sports broadcasts; the company was founded as Creative Sports, a sports programming syndicator that merged with Don Ohlmeyer's OCC Sports in 1996. After ESPN purchased the merged company, the division was renamed ESPN Regional Television (ERT), which distributed telecasts for syndication on broadcast stations and regional sports networks; these telecasts were also available on the ESPN GamePlan and ESPN Full Court out-of- market sports packages. Most of ERT's broadcasts were presented under the on- air branding ESPN Plus (not to be confused with the current subscription service ESPN+), but this name was later phased out in favor of dedicated on- air brands for each package, such as SEC Network (later renamed SEC TV as to not be confused with the then-upcoming SEC Network cable channel). Following its acquisition of the Las Vegas Bowl in 2001, ERT began to double as an organizer of sporting events. The subdivision, which later began to operate under the name ESPN Events, would acquire and establish other bowl games to provide additional post-season opportunities for bowl-eligible teams. ESPN Events also organizes several pre-season tournaments in college basketball, as well as the season-opening Camping World Kickoff and Texas Kickoff football games. All ESPN Events are broadcast by ESPN's networks. ESPN Regional Television began to wind down its syndication operations in the 2010s, as the proliferation of competing outlets (including other sports channels, conference-specific networks such as ESPN's own SEC Network, as well as digital services such as ESPN's own ESPN3 and WatchESPN platforms) took over most of the conference rights and overflow formerly held by the company. History The company traces its history to Creative Sports, Inc., a North Carolina-based sports syndicator owned and founded by Bray Cary. ESPN Inc. purchased Creative Sports, Inc. and OCC Sports, Inc. in the mid-1990s. On July 22, 1994, ESPN Regional Television was incorporated in Delaware. ESPN Regional Television was formed in 1996, through ESPN Inc.'s combination of Creative Sports and OCC Sports, under the direction of Chuck Gerber and Loren Matthews. In January 2000, Loren Matthews left ESPN Regional Television for an executive position at sister division ABC Sports. By February 2000, ERT acquired the production rights to the Arena Football League; this included responsibilities for AFL broadcasts on The Nashville Network, which had ESPN retain duties for the events in lieu of its own unit, World Sports Enterprises. In 2001, ESPN Regional Television moved beyond broadcasting college football bowl games, when it purchased the Las Vegas Bowl from Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. ESPN Regional did so to help partner conferences that had bowl qualified teams but no bowl available. The company bought four more bowls and started two others. In August 2008, ESPN reached a 15-year, $2.25 billion broadcast rights agreement with the SEC. As part of the deal, ESPN also assumed the syndicated package of games previously held by Raycom Sports; beginning in 2009, ERT syndicated SEC football and basketball under the SEC Network brand. The original business of ESPN Regional Television began to grow obsolete with the launch of dedicated networks dedicated to specific conferences, including the Big Ten Network, Pac-12 Network, and the ESPN- operated SEC Network, since they largely assumed rights to the game packages that ESPN had previously syndicated. As such, the division pivoted to focusing solely on organizing events, particularly within college football and basketball. Broadcast rights Logo of ESPN Plus, the branding initially used for ESPN's syndicated telecasts. =Former rights= ESPN Plus used to hold the rights to Conference USA football and basketball, Mountain West Conference football and basketball, and Big Ten Conference football and basketball, but has lost them as detailed below: * American Athletic Conference men's college basketball (starting with the 2008 football season, under the old Big East contract; games were branded as Big East Network, later the American Athletic Network, with SportsNet New York as the flagship station).

The company moved into the area as it saw that some of their conference partners had teams that were bowl-eligible, but with no bowl available to take them. By 2013, ERT had founded two new bowl games and purchased four additional games. The games primarily serve as a source of live content for ESPN during the early weeks of bowl season, prior to the larger, traditional games in proximity to New Year's Day (such as the College Football Playoff \\"New Year's Six\\", which are also broadcast by ESPN). This strategy has been successful for ESPN, although it has in recent years contributed to an oversaturation of bowl games that have prevented them from all being populated by bowl-eligible teams. ESPN also runs the Celebration Bowl in Division I FCS, which is played between the champions of the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC) and the Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC) ‚Äî the two prominent conferences of historically black colleges and universities. ESPN Events operates the following bowls, which ESPN televises: * Armed Forces Bowl * Birmingham Bowl * Bahamas Bowl * Boca Raton Bowl * Camellia Bowl * Celebration Bowl * Famous Idaho Potato Bowl * Fenway Bowl (2020) * First Responder Bowl * Frisco Bowl * Gasparilla Bowl * Hawaii Bowl * Las Vegas Bowl * Myrtle Beach Bowl (2020) * New Mexico Bowl * Texas Bowl ESPN Events also organizes several opening weekend games, such as the Camping World Kickoff, Advocare Texas Kickoff, and FCS Kickoff. ESPN Events is also involved in college basketball, operating early-season events such as the AdvoCare Invitational, the Champions Classic, the Jimmy V Classic, the NIT Season Tip-Off, and the Phil Knight Invitational. College marketing division The company's success with college tournament operation and broadcasting led ESPN Regional Television to form a college marketing division, which provides colleges all-in-one services for selling sponsorships, local media rights and other marketing campaigns. The University of South Florida, the University of Kansas and the University of Oregon are some of the clients that the division began representing in 2000.

Many of his field studies took place in Africa, where he was especially interested in the Nile crocodile, the evolution of pattern and colour in animals. During the Second World War, Cott worked as a camouflage expert for the British Army and helped to influence War Office policy on camouflage. His book Adaptive Coloration in Animals (1940), popular among serving soldiers, was the major textbook on camouflage in zoology of the twentieth century. After the war, he became a Fellow of Selwyn College, Cambridge. As a Fellow of the Zoological Society of London, he undertook expeditions to Africa and the Amazon to collect specimens, mainly reptiles and amphibians. Life and career Cott was born in Ashby Magna, Leicestershire, England, on 6 July 1900; his father was the rector there. He was schooled at Rugby. In 1919, he graduated from the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and was commissioned into the Leicestershire Regiment. Between 1922 and 1925, he studied at Selwyn College, Cambridge. He had intended to become a priest, and went to Cambridge to read theology, but after his first year he went on the university expedition to South America, where he studied natural forms in eastern Brazil in 1923, led by the entomologist Frank Balfour Browne, where he became fascinated by natural history, and changed his studies to zoology on his return. He then went on an expedition to the lower Amazon (1925‚Äì1926), and on research trips to the Zambesi river area in Africa (1927), including Mozambique, Zambia and East Africa, and Lanzarote (1930). He married Joyce Radford in 1928. He was a lecturer in Zoology at Bristol University from 1928 until 1932, when he moved to Glasgow University. He studied under another advocate of military camouflage, John Graham Kerr. His thesis, which he completed in 1935 under a Carnegie Fellowship, was on 'adaptive coloration' ‚Äì both camouflage and warning coloration ‚Äì in the Anura (frogs). In 1938 he was made a Doctor of Science at Glasgow, and he became a Zoology lecturer at Cambridge University and Strickland Curator of Birds at the university's Museum of Zoology. Cott served in the Leicestershire Regiment of the British ArmyLondon Gazette 26 January 1920. Cott is in the Leicestershire Regiment. as a camouflage expert from 1919‚Äì1922, and, during the Second World War, with the Royal Engineers as a camouflage instructor from 1939‚Äì1945. Cott was chief instructor at the Camouflage Development and Training Centre at Helwan, Egypt, under filmmaker Geoffrey Barkas from its inception in November 1941. After the war, Cott returned to Cambridge, becoming a Fellow of Selwyn College in 1945; he worked there until he retired in 1967. He gave the Fison Memorial Lecture of 1958 on 'Protective Coloration in Animals'. He continued to work from time to time after his retirement, for instance conducting a survey of crocodile nests on the Victoria Nile for the Uganda National Parks in 1972. He died at the age of 86 on 18 April 1987. Camouflage Disruptive coloration by Hugh Cott, from Adaptive Coloration in Animals (1940) While trying to photograph a hen partridge on her nest, Cott waited for hours for the bird to return, finally taking some pictures of the empty nest before giving up. On developing the photographs, he realized the bird had been there all along, perfectly camouflaged. As a camouflage expert during the Second World War, Cott likened the functions of military camouflage to those of protective coloration in nature. The three main categories of coloration in his book Adaptive Coloration in Animals are concealment, disguise, and advertisement. He studied, described and presented examples of such diverse camouflage effects as obliterative shading, disruption, differential blending, high contrast, coincident disruption, concealment of the eye, contour obliteration, shadow elimination, and mimicry. In his wartime lectures at Farnham Castle, he described nine categories of visual deception: # merging, e.g. hare, polar bear # disruption, e.g. ringed plover # disguise, e.g. stick insect # mis- direction, e.g. butterfly and fish eyespots # dazzle, e.g. some grasshoppers # decoy, e.g. angler fish # smokescreen, e.g. cuttlefish # the dummy, e.g. flies, ants # false display of strength, e.g. toads, lizards countershaded one camouflaged by Hugh Cott (above) and one in conventional style (below), August 1940 Cott's account of all this (illustrated by his own pen and ink drawings) is the 550-page book Adaptive Coloration in Animals (1940). It was proof-read by Kerr, who commented on its publication 'It is by far the finest thing of the kind in existence'. His co-workers' first-hand accounts of his work in military camouflage can be found in the memoirs of two of his fellow camoufleurs: Julian Trevelyan and Roland Penrose. Peter Forbes wrote of Cott's book: Cott was critical of attempts at camouflage not based on \\"vigorous disruptive contrasts\\". 1943 painting by Colin Moss of a cooling tower camouflaged with a landscape scene The book was written as war loomed, and published in wartime. Cott makes use of his knowledge of natural history to draw parallels between survival in nature and in war, and to advise on military camouflage, for example commenting: Forbes notes that Adaptive Coloration in Animals is a narrative, short on the experimentation that followed after the war, but Forbes continues: Cott attempted to persuade the British army to use more effective camouflage techniques, including countershading. For example, in August 1940, with the Battle of Britain imminent, he painted two rail-mounted coastal guns, one in conventional style, one countershaded. In aerial photographs, the countershaded gun is essentially invisible. Cott was triumphant, announcing: However (like Kerr before him in the First World War), Cott did not succeed in influencing policy on camouflage, and he resigned from the Camouflage Advisory Panel in 1940. Artwork Art with a purpose: Cott's invisible potoo, disruptively patterned Cott was a founding member of the Society of Wildlife Artists, and a fellow of the Royal Photographic Society. From material gathered in field expeditions, he made contributions to the Cambridge University zoological museum. Cott possessed considerable artistic skill. Like Abbott Thayer, he used his artistry in his scientific work, including in Adaptive Coloration in Animals, to help argue the case he was making. For example, his black-and-white potoo shows this rainforest bird sitting motionless on a mottled tree trunk, its behaviour and disruptive pattern combining to provide effective camouflage. The philosopher and jazz musician David Rothenberg wrote of Cott's art: Writings In addition to Adaptive Coloration in Animals, Cott wrote two essays on camouflage: ‚ÄúCamouflage in nature and in war‚Äùin the Royal Engineers Journal (December 1938), pp. 501‚Äì517 and ‚ÄùAnimal form in relation to appearance‚Äù.in Lancelot Law Whyte, ed. Aspects of form: a symposium on form in nature and art (London: Percy Lund Humphries, 1951) As a scientific illustrator and photographer, he also wrote three other books: Zoological photography in practice (1956); Uganda in black and white (1959); and Looking at animals: a zoologist in Africa (1975). He became interested in the relationship of bird colours with their role as warning colours, an idea that arose when he observed hornets attracted to some birds being skinned while ignoring others. This led him to study the palatability of birds and their eggs. Among his papers were several studies on the relative palatibility of the eggs based initially on the preferences of ferrets, rats and hedgehogs and later on the use of a panel of expert egg tasters. In one study he found that of 123 species of bird, the kittiwake eggs scored highly with 8.2 out of 10.

EOD application These vehicles are used to safely transport EOD operators, supplies, and equipment, including remotely controlled robots (TALON and Packbot), bomb suits, and explosives. JERRVs are more resistant to the effects of landmines, IEDs, and small arms than soft armored vehicles like the Humvees. The JERRV is designed to deflect blasts. They are in some ways like heavier versions of armored cars. =Development= The JERRV was the natural follow-on to the earlier USMC-directed purchase of some 30 Hardened Engineer Vehicles (HEV). HEV was an urgent UNS program which resulted in an order being placed with Technical Solutions Group in Ladson in April 2004. The original HEV requirement document (written on less than a single side of paper) called for some quite specific characteristics which were a major factor in the design of a new vehicle which was called Cougar only to provide a degree of continuity for the user community. The new Cougar was designated Cougar H to differentiate it from the earlier of lightweight and non-military vehicle which had been imported from South Africa by TS. The designer was a British ex-army officer who had been asked to help out TSG in previous years and who offered to design a new vehicle when the USMC approached the company with their requirement. His own experiences, as well as a desire to distance TSG from its former South African partners, led to a policy from the outset of creating a new vehicle which would address many of the deficiencies of the older designs as well as to meet first world standards of protection, performance and sustainability. The design team was small - as was the USMC purchasing team - and consisted of the designer plus two other engineers and an automotive supply engineer who specified and purchase the running gear from Peterbilt dealer Rush Crane. At the time, a few of the old South African designers tried to get involved and persuade TSG (led at that time by Mike Watts),to force the designer to abandon many of the new features. Watts' main contribution to the development of the modern mine protected vehicle (and one which should not be overlooked) was perhaps that he resisted all such pressures and kept these people away from the design team. In order to control the public utterances of some of the main critics, consultancies were awarded by TSG which allowed a degree of commercial confidentiality to be imposed. Major differences from the older designs included a vertical hull side to increase internal volume, a full-length bottom plate to increase strength and to provide blast and ballistic protection for the engine, full US- specification engine, cooling, power-train etc., sufficient payload to provide ballistic-protection upgrades and so on. Ergonomics were based upon first- world standards as were protection levels and automotive specifications (earlier South Africa designs paid scant regard for these, applying their own local standards which caused some problems when operated by NATO countries). During the design and construction of the first vehicle, considerable use was made of the carpentry team who worked closely with the design team and frequently led the whole process. They constructed many items in plywood and the engineering team measured the mock-ups and drew them in CAD. At the same time as the main 4x4 version was being developed, the designer pressed the need for a 6x6 version to reduce ground pressures and axle loads; other versions which were designed and mocked up in wood were a flatbed variant (intended to meet the USMC requirement for a lightweight prime mover system capable of pulling a 155mm howitzer and carrying the crew plus ammunition), an ambulance and a command vehicle. The first HEV was delivered to the USMC in Sep/Oct 2004, less than six months after contract award - at which time the design was still a couple of sketches on a pad. By September 2004, the US Army had shown interest in Cougar and sent its IED/EOD experts to Charleston, SC, to talk to the design team. The designer agreed to modify the vehicle to make better use of in-service equipment and changed the engine to the military version of the CAT C-7 2136 - increasing from 300 hp to 330 hp and making its electrical system 24V. Based upon these assurances, the Army decided to combine with the USMC and order the Joint EOD Rapid Response Vehicle.

It is situated in Bursa metropolitan district of Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m, also named after the same sultan. It underwent extensive renovation following the 1855 Bursa earthquake.  Architecture  The mosque comprises a central hall with a large dome flanked by eyvans on the east and west with smaller domes and another large domed eyvan with mihrab on the south. There are four rooms with fireplaces and cupboards to the north and south of side of the eyvans. The southern rooms are accessed directly from the central hall while the northern rooms are accessed thought small vestibules. Each northern room also contains two niches on the sides that are accessed through the vestibules. The entrance hall of the mosque features high domed ceilings. The last prayer section (semi-open section of the mosque at the north end) is built with five sub-sections and each subsection is covered with an individual dome. In the Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m Camii, all three eyvans were built three steps higher than the central hall. Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m Camii was the first structure where a Bursa Arch was implemented. This flattened arch is located in between the central hall and south eyvan and connects and supports the two large domes. There are two minarets on the sides of the mosque. Unlike similar mosques of its time in Bursa, Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m Camii was constructed entirely out of dimension stones and bricks were not used in any part of the mosque.

Gombu was born in Minzu, Tibet and later became an Indian citizen, as did many of his relatives including his uncle Tenzing Norgay. He was the youngest Sherpa to reach 26,000 ft. In 1964, he became the first Indian and the third man in the world to summit Nanda Devi (24,645 ft). In 1965, he became the first man in the world to have climbed Mount Everest twice‚Äîa record that would remain unbroken for almost 20 years. First was with American Expedition in 1963 as the eleventh man in world and the second was with Indian Everest Expedition 1965 as seventeenth. Early life and background Gombu was born in the Kharta region to the north-east of Everest. His early life was marked by the complexities of his parents' marriage. His father, Nawang, was a monk, the younger brother of the local feudal landowner. His mother, Tenzing's beloved older sister, was Lhamu Khipa, a nun from a family of serfs. The two eloped, causing a scandal, and for a time they lived in Khumbu, a Sherpa district on the other side of the border in Nepal. As a young boy, Gombu was sent back to Tibet to become a monk at Rongbuk Monastery, an hour's walk below what is now Everest base camp. Gombu's grandmother was a cousin of the head lama, Trulshik Rinpoche, but the connection offered him no protection from the brutal punishment often meted out to novices who failed in their studies. Career After a year, Gombu fled with a friend, crossing the Nangpa La into Khumbu, where the first western visitors were beginning to explore the southern approaches to Everest. He was the first man in the world to climb Everest twice with the Indian Expedition and American. No small feat as the record was not broken for a very long time. He climbed Mount Rainier numerous times and traveled extensively. Nawang Gombu lived in Darjeeling, India, and spent his life at the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute retiring as an adviser there. He had four children and a wife Sita who lives in Darjeeling. Honours and awards He was awarded Arjuna award and Padma Bhushan for his achievements. Gombu attended reunions of climbs during the 1950s and 1960s as part of the 1963 Everest Expedition Celebrations. In 2006, he was awarded the Tenzing Norgay Lifetime Achievement Award in the field of Indian mountaineering by President APJ Abdul Kalam. Gombu dedicated his later life to the Sherpa community, raising funds and being President of the Sherpa Buddhist Association for the past few years. =Awards= *1953 ‚Äì Tiger Medal *1953 ‚Äì Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal *1963 ‚Äì Hubbard Medal of the National Geographic Society, USA *1964 ‚Äì Padma Shree - India *1965 ‚Äì Padma Bhushan ‚Äì India *1966 ‚Äì Indian Mountaineering Foundation's Gold Medal ‚Äì India *1967 ‚Äì Arjuna Award ‚Äì India *2006 ‚Äì Tenzing Norgay National Adventure Award ‚Äì India See also *Indian summiters of Mount Everest - Year wise *List of Mount Everest records of India *List of Mount Everest records *List of Mount Everest summiters by number of times to the summit References External links * Online biography * The Sherpas of Everest Series: Nawang Gombu Sherpa - EverestHistory.com * Nawang Gombu: Mountain guide who became the first man to climb Everest twice - The Independent * Stupa after legendary climber Nawang Gombu at HMI - Millennium Post * Nawang Gombu: Heart of a Tiger - YouTube Category:1936 births Category:2011 deaths Category:Indian summiters of Mount Everest Category:Sherpa summiters of Mount Everest Category:Indian mountain climbers Category:Recipients of the Padma Bhushan in sports Category:Recipients of the Padma Shri in sports Category:Recipients of the Arjuna Award Category:Tenzing Norgay relative Category:Recipients of the Tenzing Norgay National Adventure Award ","title":"Nawang Gombu"},{"id":"5668940","text":"Marc Matthews (born 1940s) is a Guyanese writer, actor, broadcaster and producer. Biography Marc Matthews was born in British Guiana in the 1940s. He received, he reports, \\"a mid-Victorian education\\" at Queen's College, Georgetown. He worked as an operator, producer and presenter on Radio Demerara, as a scriptwriter and documentary researcher/ presenter for Guyana Broadcasting Service, and as a tutor in drama at the Cyril Potter Teachers Training College. He was a co-director/founder of Jaiai Independent Broadcasting Unit, and with Peter Kempadoo produced Our Kind Of Folk for radio in Guyana. In the 1960s Marc Matthews was in London as a freelance reporter, involved with the UK Black Power movement and alternative theatre productions. He was closely involved with the Caribbean Artists Movement (CAM), being, along with Linton Kwesi Johnson, one of the most prominent younger poets to come out of CAM in the 1970s. Unlike with Johnson, Matthews's pioneering role as a nation language performance poet has not been fully recognised, perhaps because his roots and material were always more Guyanese than Black British. Similarly, because of its nature as live theatre rather than as published scripts, his important work, first with fellow Guyanese Ken Corsbie in Dem Two in 1974,\\"Gaffing with Kraws\\", Stabroek News\\", 2 August 2010. then in 1975 in All Ah We, which added John Agard and Henry Muttoo, has largely vanished from the record, if not the memory of those who witnessed them.

It has a population of around 10,000 and is best known for its Baroque palace, Schloss Werneck. Geography =Location= Werneck lies in the Lower Franconia region of Bavaria, approximately 12 km from Schweinfurt and 25 km from W√ºrzburg. It is located on a bend in the Wern, a tributary of the Main, on the edge of the plateau above the river. Its highest point is at 337.20 m of elevation, its lowest at 212.50 m. The total area of the municipality is 73.65 km¬≤, of which approximately 9 km¬≤ are wooded. =Subdivisions= Werneck has the following Ortsteile: * Eckartshausen * Egenhausen * Ettleben * E√üleben * M√ºhlhausen * Rundelshausen * Schleerieth * Schnackenwerth * Schraudenbach * Stettbach * Vasb√ºhl * Werneck * Zeuzleben History The first written record of Werneck is dated 10 August 1223, as a fief granted by Bodo of Ravensburg, confirmed by the Pope on 9 April 1223. Between 1224 and 1250, possession of the fief was shared between first the Teutonic Knights and later Conrad of Reichenberg and Conrad of Schmiedefeld, until it finally passed to the Bishopric of W√ºrzburg. A fort located there was sacked in the Peasants' War in 1525 and then seized and burnt down by Albert Alcibiades, Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach in 1553. It was rebuilt in 1601 under Prince-Bishop Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn, but was again destroyed by fire in 1723 and merely patched up in 1724. The current baroque palace, Schloss Werneck, designed by Balthasar Neumann, was built in 1733-45 by Prince Bishop Friedrich Karl von Sch√∂nborn. For half a century it was, with Veitsh√∂chheim, a summer residence of the Bishops of W√ºrzburg. On 28 November 1802, the last Prince-Bishop of W√ºrzburg, Georg Karl von Fechenbach, released his vassals there from their oaths of service and recommended them to the new regional overlord, Maximilian, Prince-Elector of Bavaria. In 1803, following secularisation, Werneck became a Bavarian possession. In 1805 it was transferred to Ferdinand III, Grand Duke of Tuscany as part of the formation of the Grand Duchy of W√ºrzburg. The Treaty of Paris in 1814 returned it to Bavaria. Beginning in 1853, the palace was converted into a hospital for the mentally ill, the Unterfr√§nkische Landes-Irrenanstalt (Lower Franconian State Asylum), which opened on 1 October 1855. Its first director was Bernhard von Gudden (who later wrote the clinical assessment which justified deposing King Ludwig II and who drowned with him in Lake Starnberg). The hospital is thus one of the oldest psychiatric institutions in Germany. In 1940, the approximately 800 patients were murdered on the orders of Otto Hellmuth, Gauleiter of Mainfranken, as part of the Nazi elimination of mentally ill and handicapped people, Action T4. Demographics Werneck is predominantly Roman Catholic. A Jewish congregation existed in Werneck from the 16th century until 1904. Culture and sights =Buildings= * Schloss Werneck - The grounds of the palace, including the Baroque garden and English-style park, may be visited, as may part of the palace, chiefly the chapel, which dates to 1744. * Former palace in Vasb√ºhl, built in 1677 * Fortified churches in Schleerieth und Schnackenwerth The tithe barn (built in 1628) was converted into a church in 1856. There has been a parish since 1910; a new parish church was consecrated in 1967. The Church of St. Bartholomew in Zeuzleben was built in 1753-1754\\\\. =Others= * Sandstone shrines * Merovingian cemetery in ZeuzlebenDas Merowingische Gr√§berfeld von Zeuzleben, retrieved 13 June 2011 =Music= The Musikverein Werneck has a wind band and a young people's wind band, and a variety of beginners' musical groups. The Bayerische Kammerorchester Bad Br√ºckenau (Bad Br√ºckenau Chamber Orchestra of Bavaria) was founded in 1979 as the Kammerorchester Schlo√ü Werneck (Schloss Werneck Chamber Orchestra) and was formerly based in Werneck. Economy Although the villages within the municipality of Werneck are still agricultural in character, there have been several decades of economic dependency on industries in Schweinfurt, to which many residents commute. In 1998, the municipality had 8 agricultural and forestry jobs, 595 production jobs and 228 trade and transport jobs subject to social insurance; 1,555 were employed there in other fields. A total of 3,559 residents held jobs subject to social insurance. There were 2 businesses engaged in the harvesting of natural resources (such as mining and quarrying) and 10 in construction. In addition in 1999 there were 195 agricultural businesses, utilising 6,382 km¬≤, of which 5,681 km¬≤ was cropland and 672 km¬≤ permanently planted (pasturage, orchards, etc.) Infrastructure =Transport= Werneck is located at the Werneck Autobahn junction, where the A 7 and A 70 merge; in addition, the A 71 has passed close by since its Werntal connection to the A 70 opened in November 2005. Bundesstra√üen B 19, B 26 and B 26a pass through Werneck. On 16 December 2007 the Werneck bypass on the B 19 was opened. There is a railway station on the Schweinfurt - W√ºrzburg line in the centre of E√üleben and another very close to Werneck proper, on its border with Waigolshausen. The Werntalbahn (Wern Valley Railway), now used mainly for goods traffic, runs through the municipality. =Health care= Today the psychiatric clinic (Krankenhaus f√ºr Psychiatrie, Psychotherapie und Psychosomatische Medizin Schloss Werneck) is operated by the Administrative Region of Lower Franconia and serves northeast Lower Franconia (Schweinfurt, Hassberge, Rh√∂n-Grabfeld, Bad Kissingen and Kitzingen, with a total population of 500,000) with a modern 290-bed building, while the palace houses the Lower Franconia orthopaedic clinic (Orthop√§dische Klinik Schloss Werneck), one of the largest such facilities in Germany, with 153 beds. There are also care homes for psychiatric and senile dementia patients (Albert-Schweitzer-Haus, Haus Erthal and Haus Sch√∂nborn) on the grounds. Together these facilities are the largest source of employment in Werneck. Education In 1999, Werneck had 459 kindergarten spaces with 434 pupils, two Volksschulen with 973 pupils and the Lower Franconian school of nursing.

Williams Prior to serving as state representative, Williams was elected to the Saginaw city council‚Äîan office which he held from November 11, 1991 until April 17, 2000. Saginaw's city charter prohibits currently serving members of the city council from seeking any other elective office. As a consequence, Williams resigned from the city council immediately prior to becoming a candidate for state representative. During his tenure as a city councilman, Williams was selected by the city council to serve as mayor pro tempore for two years. Williams was first elected to the legislature in 2000 and subsequently re- elected in 2002 and 2004. Because of term limit provisions in the Michigan Constitution, he was ineligible to seek re-election in 2006. He was a candidate for the Michigan Senate representing the 32nd District and prevailed over two other candidates, Dave Adams and Aaron Dodak, in the Democratic Party primary election on August 8, 2006. In the general election held on November 7, 2006, Williams was defeated by Republican Party candidate Roger Kahn, a representative from the 94th state house district. It was the closest Michigan senate race that year, with Kahn winning by only 450 votes, or 0.48% of the vote, only after a recount. As a member of the State House of Representatives, Williams served on the Appropriations Committee and its Subcommittees for General Government (for which he was minority party Vice Chairman), State Police/Military and Veterans Affairs (for which he was also minority party Vice Chairman), Natural Resources and Environmental Quality and School Aid and Department of Education. Prior to his election to public office, Williams was employed by Delphi Steering Systems in Saginaw as an Employee Assistance Program Coordinator and manufacturing supervisor.

He is co-editor (with Stewart Brown) of TheOxford Book of Caribbean Verse (2005). McWatt has said his poetry was inspired firstly by the Guyana landscape, and it seems no accident that his first poetry collection was titled Interiors ‚Äì emphasising as it does his work‚Äôs central interplay between an emotional or psychological ‚Äòinterior,‚Äô with impressionistic descriptions of the Guyanese landscape. McWatt‚Äôs nuanced, careful and melodious language builds layered and detailed surroundings for each poem, which seem to at once alter and respond to interior states. This imagistic richness is especially evident in his poem, ‚ÄòBeyond Punta Playa‚Äô, in which his visual inventiveness becomes almost hallucinatory, with a river‚Äôs ‚Äòperception of glass / shattered by anchors from the sun‚Äô and ‚Äòwhite birds at daybreak / making and unmaking the sea‚Äô. At such moments McWatt‚Äôs language is able to directly register the effects of the outer upon the inner: ‚Äòthe casting of thought in stones‚Äô. The five poems here encompass McWatt‚Äôs intuitive and original readings of the natural world, as well as some other concerns, including a vampire of Caribbean folklore (‚ÄòOl‚Äô Higue‚Äô), and a playful account of marriage and domesticity (‚ÄòA Man in the House‚Äô), and form a perfect introduction to his poetry, which is admired far beyond the landscapes it is so deeply connected to Bibliography =Poetry= *Interiors - Dangaroo Press, 1989 *The Language of Eldorado ‚Äî 1994 *The Journey to Le Repentir - Peepal Tree Press, 2009 =Fiction= *Suspended Sentences: Fictions of Atonement ‚Äî Peepal Tree Press, 2005 =As editor= * The Oxford Book of Caribbean Verse ‚Äî 2005 (edited with Stewart Brown) * The Caribbean Short Story: Critical Perspectives ‚Äî Peepal Tree Press, 2011 References External links * Lucy Evans, \\"Landscape and Identity - Re-encountering Guyana in an interview with Mark McWatt\\", Kaieteur News, 27 September 2009.

In restaurants it may refer to a seating, i.e. the time given for a crowd to have their meal. The term is also used to denote the part of a party that is a seated meal. Though it can refer to any kind of meal, it is often used to refer to a student sittning. Student sittning A student sittning in Sweden or Finland is usually a dinner had at the student union's or nation's property, usually a pub room, or banquet hall if the student union is fortunate enough to have one. In academic environments some of the tradition is carried on even after one is no longer a student. =Dress code= The dress code is different depending on the occasion, everything from white tie to student boilersuit can be the evening's dress code. Sittnings often have themes, and the guests are encouraged to dress to match the theme. =The meal and drinks= The meal is prepared and served by students who often spend some time working at their union or nation. The number of dishes vary, but three courses is common, and alcohol is usually included in the price (beer or cider and snaps along with Punsch). If snaps or punsch is not included, there will often be tickets for sale. =Singing= A vital part of a sittning is singing. The guests are usually given a booklet with songs that will be sung during the sittning. Everyone sings when a song is brought up, and songs are often related to the current progress of the sitting. Sittnings often begin with a certain song and end with another, songs are sung when drinking snaps, and there is often a song to honor the students serving and cooking. These songs differ depending on student union or nation. The songs may range from traditional to pop music, depending on the formality of the occasion. If there is a theme for the evening, it is possible to write new lyrics to existing songs based on it. In some locations, such as Uppsala or Stockholm, it is common for a sittning to end with the song \\"O gamla klang och jubeltid\\". During the last verse of the song, the guests stand on their chairs and after the song is finished you are no longer supposed to sit down. During Finnish-language sitsit, many of the classic Swedish drinking songs are also sung in Swedish or in translated versions. In more formal sitsit, academic and patriotic songs, such as De Brevitate Vitae, Finlandia Hymn and the J√§ger March are sung. =Toasts= After a song is sung, glasses are usually raised for a sk√•l, or in English, a toast. Many places in Sweden and Finland have an etiquette concerning how to toast. In Uppsala, for example, the tradition is usually to raise your glass and to nod first to your table partner (for ladies, the gentleman to your left, and for gentlemen, the lady to your right), then with the person next to you who is not your table partner, and lastly with the person sitting across from you. After the three nods, you drink and then nod to the same people in the reverse order. Finally, you set your glass back down on the table (ladies first). During some sittnings this begins very formally but then becomes more and more sloppy (relaxed). =Seating= Often sittnings will involve sitting at long tables (l√•ngbord). In some cases, the guests will be designated seats, if possible every other lady and gentleman, and shifted on opposite sides of the table so that the ladies will sit opposite a gentleman, and vice versa. =Other entertainment= Other performances such as short spex (theatre), choir performances, speeches, and pretty much anything that may be entertaining to the guests may also take place during the sittning. =Toastmaster= The sittning is usually guided by a toastmaster and often also by a s√•nganf√∂rare (\\"song master\\"). The toastmaster keeps note of and introduces everyone who wants to perform something, communicates with the serving staff, and generally makes sure that the sittning runs smoothly. The s√•nganf√∂rare chooses which songs to sing and starts them off. =Differing traditions= Some students are very relaxed about all the traditions that come with a sittning and do as they please so as to have a very nice evening. Others recognize that the traditions in fact enhance the festivity of the sittning and adhere to them rigorously. Strangely, when Swedish students from different sittning traditions meet they will often find each other's traditions quite remarkable, even absurd. In Finland, breaking the code of the evening may result in a punishment for the person(s) in question. The punishment is usually decided by the toastmaster or song master. The people punished must, for example, sing a song in front of others. There are varying attitudes towards this custom and in some places it has been abolished. =Gask and ball= A gask or a ball usually starts with a sittning and then continues on with a party after the sittning is over. Usually there is dancing, either to live music or a DJ, and a pub. Formal etiquette suggests that a gentleman at a ball with a sittning should dance the two first dances with his table partner (the lady on the right), the following two dances with the lady who was on his left, and finally two dances with the lady sitting across from him.

It was accompanied by assaults, stone throwing and intimidation, which caused many Jews to leave the city. It was instigated in 1904 by a Redemptorist priest, Father John Creagh. According to a report by the Royal Irish Constabulary, five Jewish families left Limerick \\"owing directly to the agitation\\" while another 26 families remained.  Background  There were seven Jews living in Limerick City in 1790. Census returns record one Jew in Limerick in 1861. This doubled by 1871 and doubled again by 1881. Increases to 35, 90 and 130 are shown for 1888, 1892, and 1896 respectively.Keogh (1998), p. 11 A small number of Lithuanian Jewish tradespeople, fleeing persecution in their homeland, began arriving in Limerick in 1878. They formed an accepted part of the city's retail trade, centred on Colooney St.Keogh (1998), p. 31 The community established a synagogue and a cemetery in the 1880s. Easter Sunday of 1884 saw the first of what were to be a series of sporadic violent antisemitic attacks and protests. The wife of Lieb Siev and his child were injured by stones and her house damaged by an angry crowd for which the ringleaders were sentenced to hard labour for a month.Keogh (1998), p. 19 In 1892 two families were beaten and a stoning took place on 24 November 1896. In 1903, a reception was held in Limerick to mark the emigration of Bernard Wienronk to South Africa. The former Mayor of Limerick John Daly was asked to preside. He proposed a toast on the night to \\"Israel A Nation\\". Many details about Limerick's Jewish families are recorded in the 1901 census that shows most were peddlers, though a few were described as drapery dealers and grocers.Keogh (1998), pps. 12‚Äì14  Events  John Creagh, who incited the Boycott In 1904 Father John Creagh, a Redemptorist, gave a sermon attacking Jews.Keogh (1998), pps. 26‚Äì30 He repeated many antisemitic conspiracy theories, including that of ritual murder, and said that the Jews had come to Limerick \\"to fasten themselves on us like leeches and to draw our blood\\".Paul Bew, Ireland: The Politics of enmity 1789‚Äì2006, Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 364 Dermot Keogh describes what happened after Creagh delivered his lecture calling for a boycott on 11 January 1904. :Colooney Street where most Limerick Jews lived, was only a few minutes walk from the Redemptorist church. The hundreds who left the church after the meeting had to pass the top of Colooney Street on their way home; many were fired up by Creagh's incendiary sermon. The Jewish community immediately sensed the menacing mood of the crowd turned mob and remained locked in their homes as the church militants passed by. Jewish shops, however, remained open and their owners felt menaced. One old Fenian ‚Äì a member of the confraternity ‚Äì single-handedly defended a shop from attack until the police arrived to mount a guard.Keogh (1998), pp. 39 John Raleigh, a teenager (15 years of age), was arrested and incarcerated in Mountjoy Prison for one month for throwing a stone at the rabbi (which struck him on the ankle). Once released he returned home to a welcoming throng who were protesting that the teenager was innocent and that the sentence imposed was too harsh. While in prison Raleigh was called a \\"Limerick Jew slayer\\" by a warder, but Raleigh, who claimed he was innocent, was insulted by this and reported the incident to the chief warder.Keogh (1998), pps. 113 Later, after 32 Jews had left Limerick due to the boycott,Keogh (1998), pps. 123‚Äì125 Creagh was disowned by his superiors, who said that \\"religious persecution had no place in Ireland\\".Fisk, (1985), p. 430‚Äì431 There was a voice of opposition among the local population which was expressed in an anonymous letter to the Redemptorists labelling Creagh a \\"disgrace to the Catholic religion\\". The economic boycott of the Jewish community lasted over two years. It is sometimes referred to as the \\"Limerick pogrom\\"; Dermot Keogh suggests that this derives from the experience of Lithuanian Jews in their homeland, and was used even though no one was killed or seriously injured in Limerick. Limerick's Protestant community, many of whom were also traders, supported the Jews at the time, but despite this five Jewish families (numbering 32 persons) left the city because of the boycott.Shalom Ireland: a Social History of Jews in Modern Ireland by Ray Rivlin, , published by Gill & MacMillan Some went to Cork, intending to embark on ships from Cobh to travel to America.  Aftermath  Some of the families that left Limerick due to the boycott were the Ginsbergs, the Jaff√©s (to Newcastle), the Weinronks (to South Africa), and the Goldbergs (to Leeds).Keogh (1998), pps. 125‚Äì126 The Goldberg family ended up leaving Leeds and settling in Cork. Gerald Goldberg, a son of this migration, became Lord Mayor of Cork in 1977, and the Marcus brothers, David and Louis, grandchildren of the boycott, would become hugely influential in Irish literature and Irish film, respectively. Among the Jaff√© family that left Limerick due to the boycott was the grandfather (Henry Jaff√©) of the journalist and popular historian Simon Sebag Montefiore, and his brother Hugh. But Montefiore's great-great-grandparents (Benjamin and Rachel) remained in Limerick and were living in Catherine St. in 1911 along with his great- grandparents (Marcus and Leah) who at this time employed two local Roman Catholics who were resident at the same address. Marcus Jaff√©, who was a dentist, was still practising in Limerick in 1925. The boycott was condemned by many in Ireland, among them the influential Standish O'Grady in his paper All Ireland Review, depicting Jews and Irish as \\"brothers in a common struggle\\". The Land Leaguer Michael Davitt (author of The True Story of Anti- Semitic Persecutions in Russia), in the Freeman's Journal, attacked those who had participated in the riots and visited homes of Jewish victims in Limerick.James Joyce, Ulysses, and the Construction of Jewish Identity by Neil R. Davison, p. 37, published by Cambridge University Press, 1998, His friend, Corkman William O'Brien MP, leader of the United Irish League and editor of the Irish People, had a Jewish wife, Sophie Raffalovic. A supporter of the Limerick boycott was Arthur Griffith who founded the Sinn F√©in party the following year. Father Creagh was moved by his superiors initially to Belfast and then to an island in the Pacific. In 1914 he was promoted by the Pope to be Vicar Apostolic of Kimberley, Western Australia, a position he held until 1922. He died in Wellington, New Zealand in 1947. Since 1983, several commentators have questioned the traditional narrative of the event, and especially whether the event's description as a pogrom is appropriate.Magill Magazine Issue 1, 2008, 46‚Äì47Jewish envoy says Limerick pogrom is 'over- portrayed', Limerick Leader, 6 November 2010 Historian Dermot Keogh sympathised with the use of the term by the Jews who experienced the event, and respected its use by subsequent writers, but preferred the term \\"boycott\\".Keogh (1998), p. 26Keogh (2005), pp. xv‚Äìxvi. Creagh's anti-Semitic campaign, while virulent, did not result in the end of Limerick's Jewish community. The 1911 census records that, not only were 13 of the remaining 26 families still resident in Limerick six years later, but that nine new Jewish families had joined them.Fr. Creagh C.S.S.R. Social Reformer 1870‚Äì1947 by Des Ryan, Old Limerick Journal Vol. 41, Winter 2005 The Jewish population numbered 122 persons in 1911 as opposed to 171 in 1901. This number declined to just 30 by 1926.  Footnotes   References  * Fisk, Robert. In Time of War, Paladin: London, 1985. * Se√°n William Gannon.

Fossils of the genus have been found in the Sarmiento Formation of Argentina and the Salla Formation of Bolivia. So far, two valid species have been described, Pyrotherium romeroi, which lived in what it is today Argentina and P. macfaddeni from Bolivia, at the end of Oligocene. P. romeroi in particular is the most recent known pyrothere in the fossil record and best known for its fossil remains, which although incomplete are the best preserved in the entire order, indicating that they are also the largest, with an estimated body length from . It is also supposed to have developed a small trunk, but it is not related to the current elephants (proboscideans); the resemblance is so great that when studying the fossil remains, it was attributed in the past a relationship with elephants, although the true relationship of this herbivore is still controversial today. Discovery and naming The original remains of Pyrotherium, some molars, a premolar and an incisor, were originally identified in the Neuqu√©n province in strata dating back to the late Oligocene epoch, identified by the Argentine naturalist Florentino Ameghino as couche √† Pyrotherium (layers of Pyrotherium, in French) due to the presence of fossils of this animal that were the first to be identified there;Ameghino, F. 1894.

Physis, 1: 446-460. these strata are now known as part of the Deseadan mammal-age (SALMA) in the area of the Deseado estuary, although there is the doubt whether the holotype of Pyrotherium romeroi really comes from Neuqu√©n, it being possible that the remains actually came from Chubut.Kramarz, A. G., Forasiepi, A. M., & Bond, M. (2011). Vertebrados cenozoicos. In Relatorio del XVIII Congreso Geol√≥gico Argentino. Geolog√≠a y Recursos Naturales de la Provincia del Neuqu√©n (pp. 557-572). Buenos Aires: Asociaci√≥n Geol√≥gica Argentina. Ameghino considered that these areas corresponded to older terrains, from the Paleocene and even from the Cretaceous, because they were sent together with dinosaur remains;F. Ameghino. 1897.

Bolet√≠n Instituto Geogr√°fico Argentino 18(4‚Äì9):406-521 subsequent studies have shown that they actually come from the Oligocene, and in fact the Pyrotherium fossils have reached become the guide fossil of the late Oligocene. Because the remains of this animal originally appeared in the volcanic ash beds of the Deseado Formation, they gave rise to the name of the genus, which means \\"fire beast\\". The name of the species P. romeroi is due to the captain of the Argentine army Antonio Romero who sent Ameghino the first known remains of the animal, although in several texts the erroneous spellings P. romeri or P. romerii has been used.Ameghino, F. 1889. Contribuci√≥n al conocimiento de los mam√≠feros f√≥siles de la Rep√∫blica Argentina, obra escrita bajo los auspicios de la Academia Nacional de Ciencias de la Rep√∫blica Argentina para presentarla a la Exposici√≥n Universal de Par√≠s de 1889. Actas Academia de Ciencias de C√≥rdoba 6:1‚Äì1027. Ameghino named several species from the Deseado area such as P. sorondoi based on partial remains, mainly teeth, but later studies indicated that they are part of a single species. The first relatively complete skull did not appear until the 20th century, being discovered by Frederic B. Loomis during the Amherst College expedition in 1911-1912, and listed as specimen ACM 3207. Additional remains of the genus have appeared in Quebrada Fiera, from the Mendoza province (Argentina) and in Salla, in the department of La Paz in Bolivia; the latter consist of the remains of a partial jaw, fragments of skull bones, teeth, and some limb bone such as pieces of the humerus and astragalus, which were found between the 1960s and 1980s and were initially considered part of the species P. romeroi,MacFadden BJ, Frailey CD (1984) Pyrotherium, a large enigmatic ungulate (Mammalia, incertae sedis) from the Deseadan (Oligocene) of Salla, Bolivia. Palaeontol 27:867‚Äì874 and later they were classified as a different and smaller species, P. macfaddeni, whose species name is in honor of paleontologist Bruce J. MacFadden. Molar and postcranial bone remains found in sediments from the late Oligocene of Taubat√©, Brazil were considered as a possible finding of Pyrotherium,Couto-Ribeiro, G. and Alvarenga, H. 2009.

(Doctoral dissertation, Universidade de S√£o Paulo). Description =Skull= Cast of a skull of Pyrotherium romeroi at the Museo Paleontol√≥gico 'Egidio Feruglio', Trelew. Reconstructed skull of P. macfaddeni. The skull of Pyrotherium romeroi was long and narrow, made up of massive bones. It reaches in length from its front teeth to its occipital condyle, and has an elongated, relatively narrow snout seen from above, with retracted nostrils, a large nasal opening located between the eye sockets in the middle of the front bone, in parallel to the back of the skull, with thick bone walls for muscle support; inside there are cavities filled with air. The occipital region, in particular the condyles, was particularly high, as a consequence of the flexion of the posterior part of the skull with respect to the plane of the base, which formed an obtuse angle with that of the palatine bone; in this and other characteristics, Pyrotherium resembled proboscideans. There is a small ridge that emerges from the premaxilla and reaches the nasal bone, which appears to be broken and surrounded by a rough texture, which could be the result of erosion. How large it may have been is unknown, as it may have been only a prominence similar to that seen in the narial process of the notoungulates and rodents, or even almost a ridge; this ridge is not known in other mammals, but perhaps it served as a holding point for the muscles of a possible proboscis or trunk. The brain cavity (neurocranium) is damaged and surrounded by spongy bone tissue; Loomis considered that it indicated that in life P. romeroi had a small brain, about long and wide. Another very distinctive feature is the presence of two pairs of large front-facing incisors, in the form of tusks and arranged at a 45¬∞ angle. These showed continuous growth and were equipped with an enamel band only on the front. It lacked canines, and it also has peculiar premolars and molars, with two transverse high ridges (bilophodonts), whose general appearance is reminiscent of tapir molars. Between the incisors and the posterior teeth there was a space without teeth, the diastema, reaching long. The teeth in general, and particularly the posterior ones, also occupied a lot of the skull area, particularly in the palate. The auditory region is situated much higher than the palate in lateral view and curves upwards in its posterior part. In P. macfaddeni the premaxilla has an additional pair of very small alveoli, suggesting that it may have had a third pair of barely developed incisors, and their molars are distinguished by having a well-defined valley that separates the anterior and posterior lophs. The dental formula in P. romeroi is (2I/0C/3PM/3M, 1i/0c/2pm/3m) The mandible was robust and had a well-developed, long and narrow symphysis extending to the second molar, a marked foramen posterior to the third molar, and a large maseteric fossa. It only has only two incisors, which protrude forward and are oriented like the upper incisors at a 45¬∞ angle, making contact with the tips of these; it has been thought that these could be the second incisors (i2), but their actual identification is uncertain. At least in P. macfaddeni have a layer of enamel that only covers the ventral part of the incisors. As in the maxilla, it has bilophodont premolars and molars; the structure of the molars is reminiscent of that found in other large archaic mammals, such as dinocerates, Barytherium and deinotheriids. =Postcranium= Illustrations of the vertebrae and the humerus of Pyrotherium romeroi. Some postcranial bones of Pyrotherium romeroi have been recovered, mainly from the limbs. The vertebral column is very poorly known; the remains found mainly include cervical vertebrae, including the atlas, the axis and the third and fourth vertebrae, all of which are very short. Additionally, a lumbar vertebra is known, which is massive and with a reduced spine, somewhat similar to that of Astrapotherium. A fragment of the shoulder blade indicates that it was short and strong; the glenoid cavity was twice its length and the acromion was very high. The humerus is relatively short, 497 to 500 millimeters in length, but extremely wide, with great insertions for the muscles; the ulna and radius are also known, both even shorter, about 225 millimeters, and the ulna also had a large olecranon. Likewise, two bones of the wrist have been identified, the right unciform and the left great, both being elements short but thick and trapezoidal in appearance.Cerde√±o, E., & Vera, B. (2017). New Anatomical Data on Pyrotherium (Pyrotheriidae) from the Late Oligocene of Mendoza, Argentina. Ameghiniana, 54(3), 290-306. A pyramidal and semilunate have also been found. Also included is an astragalus and calcaneus, and a femur. The pelvis was equipped with a massive iliac bone, with an acetabulum located downwards and not laterally. The femur lacked the third trochanter, with a straight head much higher than the greater trochanter, and was flattened anteroposteriorly; in this species it reached 630 millimeters in length, being greater than the only other femur known between the pyrotheres, the one of Baguatherium, which reached 558 millimeters.Salas, R., S√°nchez, J. and Chacaltana, C. 2006. A new pre-Deseadan pyrothere (Mammalia) from Northern Peru and the wear facets of molariform teeth of Pyrotheria. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 26: 760‚Äì769. The shape of the distal joint allowed the tibia to move backwards widely, which compensated for the lack of flexibility in the foot joint. The tibia was much shorter than the femur, and the fibula was very close to the tibia, except in the central part. The astragalus was strongly flattened, very simple in appearance, and neckless, with a slightly hinted tibial trochlea and a facet of the navicular located directly below the trochlea. The tarsus of Pyrotherium was characteristic: the calcaneus tubercle was compressed dorsoventrally, as was the trochlea of the astragalus; in addition, it presents an extreme reduction in the contact between the heel and the cuboid. These derived characteristics, which involve a type of graviportal and plantigrade locomotion, are not found in any other known mammal, with the significant exception of the African Arsinoitherium. Phylogeny Because Pyrotherium has the characteristic bilophodont posterior teeth (that is, with two ridges), tusks formed by its upper and lower incisors, a huge and robust body along with the possible presence of a trunk, it was proposed in the past that it was a close relative of the proboscideans, or even a member of that group (Ameghino 1895, 1897; Lydekker 1896;Lydekker, R. 1896.

Loomis 1921Loomis, F. B. 1921. Origin of South American faunas. Bulletin of the Geological Society of America. 32:187‚Äì196. However, the mixture of characteristics of the animal is such that it has led to comparing and relating it at different times with other groups, such as the marsupial diprotodontids (Lydekker 1893;Lydekker, R. 1894.

(1986). Pyrothere sistematics and a caribbean route for land-mammal dispersal during the Paleocene. Revista Geol√≥gica de Am√©rica Central. in some studies, the complete study of the tarsus of Pyrotherium fails to support a relationship with xenungulatans, instead the derived characteristics of Pyrotherium were not observed other than in other mammals examined except for the embrithopod Arsinoitherium from the Paleogene of Africa. If this is due to a common ancestor, or to the unusual mode of locomotion used by these animals (graviportal and plantigrade) remains a mystery to be seen. However, Gaudry (1909) himself established that Pyrotherium was sufficiently different from any other group of large mammals that it should have its own order, with no clear relation to other mammals.Gaudry, A. 1909. Fossiles de Patagonie: le Pyrotherium. Annales de Pal√©ontologie 4:1‚Äì28. The most recent analysis published out, like the work of Billet in 2010, suggests that pyrotheres such as Pyrotherium are a group of specialized notoungulates, related to Notostylops,Billet, G. 2010.

Cladogram based on the phylogenetic analysis of Cerde√±o et al., 2017, highlighting the location of both species of Pyrotherium: Paleobiology Lower jaw of Pyrotherium romeroi. The Pyrotherium's bilophodont molariform teeth were examined to determine their dental enamel type, using an electronic microscope to examine their prisms. Examinations showed that its enamel follows a strange keyhole pattern, also known as Boyde pattern, in which the prisms are densely clustered with no interprismatic matrix between them. This type of prism in the enamel is characteristic of pyrotheres and is not known in the other orders of native South American ungulates (xenungulates, astrapotheres, litopterns, and notoungulates). In P. romeroi, the enamel also has a distinctive kind, just called \\"Pyrotherium's enamel\\" in which the enamel bands are arranged vertically with the prisms in a decoupled way (that is, forming patterns in \\"X\\").Koenigswald, W 647 . von, Martin, T. and Billet, G. 2015. Enamel microstructure and mastication in Pyrotherium romeroi (Pyrotheria, Mammalia). Pal√§ontologische Zeitschrift 89: 611‚Äì634. This analysis also made it possible to infer the chewing patterns of Pyrotherium. This would be dominated by the so-called phase 1, in which the mandible is tilted and directed mesially, while the cutting ridges of the molars were compressing the food bolus. Then a phase 2 was developed, in which the jaw moved laterally; this move seems to have been less significant. This type of chewing and molars resembles that observed in some other mammals, such as the Macropus kangaroos, the perissodactyl Lophiodon, the marsupial Diprotodon and the proboscidean Deinotherium, but in these animals their enamel (and molar lophs) wear out quickly into adulthood, leaving a flat surface for grinding, whereas in Pyrotherium the lophs are much more resistant and can be clearly seen even in elderly individuals, in whom the worn molars still have sharp ridges. A similar condition is only seen in embrithopods such as Arsinoitherium, which also has vertically arranged enamel and in Namatherium, which closely resembles Pyrotherium in this respect by having enamel and highly inclined enamel facets. Life reconstruction of P. romeroi Due to the robust structure of the animal, it was most likely a graviportal quadruped, that is, an animal weighing more than a ton whose physical structure is prepared to support that great mass, but not for speed.Johnson, S. C. (1984). Astrapotheres from the Miocene of Colombia, South America. University of California, Berkeley. With a weight of 900 kg in P. macfaddeni to more than 3.5 tons in P. romeroi based on estimates of its molars, and 600-700 kg in P. macfadeni at 1.8 to 2.7 tons for P. romeroi with base in equations derived from the head-body ratios,Croft, D. A., Gelfo, J. N., & L√≥pez, G. M. (2020). Splendid Innovation: The Extinct South American Native Ungulates. Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences, 48. Pyrotherium was among the largest native mammals in South America. Its bones are extremely dense, even more than in other large meridiungulates such as the notoungulate toxodonts and astrapotheres, which implies an extreme specialization towards graviportality; X-ray microtomography analysis of the bone density of its humerus and femur indicate that its medullary area was particularly compact, almost comparable to the pachyostosis of aquatic or semiaquatic mammals, with thick trabeculae and very small intratrabecular cavities, although they resemble externally the bones of proboscideans or rhinos, which would help it better absorb the impact energy on the bones. It is also inferred that its posture would have been semi- plantigrade, since the fingers of the hands would support its weight, but instead the feet they would have been plantigrade, as inferred from the ankle bones. Paleoecology Restoration of the head by Robert Bruce Horsfall. The Pyrotherium fossils recovered from both Salla, Deseado and Quebrada Fiera correspond to relatively dry environments, with xerophytic vegetation and periods of drought;Croft, D. A. (2016). Horned armadillos and rafting monkeys: the fascinating fossil mammals of South America. Indiana University Press. this would contradict the hypothesis that they were semiaquatic animals, similar to hippopotamuses, while the remains of astrapotheres (another group of large, tusked native ungulates) are in fact found in areas associated with bodies of water, which would imply that they would live in humid environments and were able to spend some time in the water.Houssaye, A., Fern√°ndez, V., and Billet, G. 2016. Hyperspecialization in some South American endemic ungulates revealed by long bone microstructure. Journal of Mammalian Evolution 23: 221‚Äì235. Pyrotherium would have used its incisors and trunk in order to collect food such as leaves and branches of the trees, in a similar way to black rhinos and African forest elephants. Pyrotherium cohabited with several other mammals, several of them large that are typical of the Deseadan fauna of places like La Flecha in Argentina. The presence of predatory sparassodonts such as Pharsophorus, Notogale and the enormous Proborhyaena is noteworthy, and other ungulates which were mainly notoungulates, such as Trachytherus, Leontinia, Rhynchippus, Propachyrucos, Argyrohyrax, Archaeohyrax, and Prohegetotherium.Marani, H.

It was endemic to the Mascarene island of Mauritius, east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. It had a close relative on Rodrigues island, the likewise extinct Rodrigues rail (Erythromachus leguati), with which it is sometimes considered congeneric. Its relationship with other rails is unclear. Rails often evolve flightlessness when adapting to isolated islands, free of mammalian predators. The red rail was a little larger than a chicken and had reddish, hairlike plumage, with dark legs and a long, curved beak. The wings were small, and its legs were slender for a bird of its size. It was similar to the Rodrigues rail, but was larger, and had proportionally shorter wings. It has been compared to a kiwi or a limpkin in appearance and behaviour. It is believed to have fed on invertebrates, and snail shells have been found with damage matching an attack by its beak. Human hunters took advantage of an attraction red rails had to red objects by using coloured cloth to lure the birds so that they could be beaten with sticks. Until subfossil remains were discovered in the 1860s, scientists only knew the red rail from 17th century descriptions and illustrations. These were thought to represent several different species, which resulted in a large number of invalid junior synonyms. It has been suggested that all late 17th-century accounts of the dodo actually referred to the red rail, after the former had become extinct. The last mention of a red rail sighting is from 1693, and it is thought to have gone extinct around 1700, due to predation by humans and introduced species. Taxonomy First known remains, 1866 The red rail was long known only from a few contemporary descriptions referring to red \\"hens\\" and names otherwise used for grouse or partridges in Europe, as well as the sketches of the travellers Pieter van den Broecke and Sir Thomas Herbert from 1617 and 1634. These were thought to depict separate species of birds by some authors, but were regarded as one by the English naturalist Hugh Edwin Strickland in 1848. The German ornithologist Hermann Schlegel thought Broecke's sketch depicted a smaller dodo species from Mauritius, and that the Herbert sketch showed a dodo from Rodrigues, and named them Didus broecki and Didus herberti in 1854. The Flemish artist Jacob Hoefnagel's 1610 painting, the 1601 sketch from the Gelderland ship's journal, and the English traveller Peter Mundy's 1638 description and sketch later surfaced, but there was still uncertainty about the identity of the birds depicted. In the 1860s, subfossil foot bones and a lower jaw were found along with remains of other Mauritian animals in the Mare aux Songes swamp, and were identified as belonging to a rail by the French zoologist Alphonse Milne-Edwards in 1866. He also determined they belonged to the birds in the 17th century descriptions and illustrations. In 1869, Milne-Edwards combined the genus name of Aphanapteryx imperialis, which had been coined the previous year by the Austrian naturalist Georg Ritter von Frauenfeld for the Hoefnagel painting, with the older specific name broecki. Due to nomenclatural priority, the genus name was later combined with the oldest species name bonasia, which was coined by the Belgian scientist Edmond de S√©lys Longchamps in 1848. S√©lys Longchamps had originally named the genus Apterornis, wherein he also included the R√©union solitaire and the R√©union swamphen, but the name was preoccupied by Aptornis, a bird described by the English biologist Richard Owen in 1844. Aphanapteryx means \\"invisible-wing\\", but the meaning of bonasia is unclear. Some early accounts refer to red rails by the vernacular names for the hazel grouse, Tetrastes bonasia, so the name evidently originates there. The name itself perhaps refers to bonasus, meaning \\"bull\\" in Latin, or bonum and assum, meaning \\"good roast\\". It has also been suggested to be a Latin form of the French word bonasse, meaning simple-minded or good-natured. More fossils were later found by Theodore Sauzier, who had been commissioned to explore the \\"historical souvenirs\\" of Mauritius in 1889. Around the end of the 19th century, a complete specimen was found by the barber Louis Etienne Thirioux, who also found important dodo remains. =Evolution= Further remains described in 1893 Apart from being a close relative of the Rodrigues rail, the relationships of the red rail are uncertain. The two are commonly kept as separate genera, Aphanapteryx and Erythromachus, but have also been united as species of Aphanapteryx at times. They were first generically synonymised by the British ornithologists Edward Newton and Albert G√ºnther in 1879, due to skeletal similarities. In 1892, the Scottish naturalist Henry Ogg Forbes described Hawkins's rail, an extinct species of rail from the Chatham Islands, as a new species of Aphanapteryx; A. hawkinsi. He found the Chatham Islands species more similar to the red rail than the latter was to the Rodrigues rail, and proposed that the Mascarene Islands had once been connected with the Chatham Islands, as part of a lost continent he called \\"Antipodea\\". Forbes moved the Chatham Islands bird to its own genus, Diaphorapteryx, in 1893, on the recommendation of Newton, but later reverted to his older name. The idea that the Chatham Islands bird was closely related to the red rail and the idea of a connection between the Mascarenes and the Chatham Islands were later criticised by the British palaeontologist Charles William Andrews due to no other species being shared between the islands, and the German ornithologist Hans F. Gadow explained the similarity between the two rails as parallel evolution. 1907 restoration of the similar Rodrigues rail by Frederick William Frohawk, based on old accounts In 1945, the French palaeontologist Jean Piveteau found skull features of the red and Rodrigues rail different enough for generic separation, and in 1977, the American ornithologist Storrs L. Olson stated that though the two species were similar and derived from the same stock, they had also diverged considerably, and should possibly be kept separate. Based on geographic location and the morphology of the nasal bones, Olson suggested that they were related to the genera Gallirallus, Dryolimnas, Atlantisia, and Rallus. The American ornithologist Bradley C. Livezey was unable to determine the affinities of the red and Rodrigues rail in 1998, stating that some of the features uniting them and some other rails were associated with the loss of flight rather than common descent. He also suggested that the grouping of the red and Rodrigues rail into the same genus may have been influenced by their geographical distribution. The French palaeontologist C√©cile Mourer-Chauvir√© and colleagues also considered the two as belonging to separate genera in 1999. Rails have reached many oceanic archipelagos, which has frequently led to speciation and evolution of flightlessness. According to the British researchers Anthony S. Cheke and Julian P. Hume in 2008, the fact that the red rail lost much of its feather structure indicates it was isolated for a long time. These rails may be of Asian origin, like many other Mascarene birds. In 2019, Hume supported the distinction of the two genera, and cited the relation between the extinct Mauritius owl and the Rodrigues owl as another example of the diverging evolutionary paths on these islands. He stated that the relationships of the red and Rodrigues rails was more unclear than that of other extinct Mascarene rails, with many of their distinct features being related to flightlessness and modifications to their jaws due to their diet, suggesting long time isolation. The speed of which these features evolved may also have been affected by gene flow, resource availability, and climate events, and flightlessness can evolve rapidly in rails, as well as repeatedly within the same groups, as seen in for example Dryolimnas, so the distinctness of the red and Rodrigues rails may not have taken long to evolve (some other specialised rails evolved in less than 1‚Äì3 million years). Hume suggested that the two rails were probably related to Dryolimnas, but their considerably different morphology made it difficult to establish how. In general, rails are adept at colonising islands, and can become flightless within few generations in suitable environments, for example without predators, yet this also makes them vulnerable to human activities. Description 1907 illustration by Frohawk From the subfossil bones, illustrations and descriptions, it is known that the red rail was a flightless bird, somewhat larger than a chicken. Subfossil specimens range in size, which may indicate sexual dimorphism, as is common among rails. It was about long, and the male may have weighed and the female . The pelvis was in length, the femur was , the tibia was , the tarsometatarsus was , and the humerus was . Its plumage was reddish brown all over, and the feathers were fluffy and hairlike; the tail was not visible in the living bird and the short wings likewise also nearly disappeared in the plumage. It had a long, slightly curved, brown bill, and some illustrations suggest it had a nape crest. It perhaps resembled a lightly built kiwi, and it has also been likened to a limpkin, both in appearance and behaviour. The sternum and humerus were small, indicating that it had lost the power of flight. Its legs were long and slender for such a large bird, but the pelvis was compact and stout. It differed from the Rodrigues rail, its closest relative, in having a proportionately shorter humerus, a narrower and longer skull, and having shorter and higher nostrils. They differed considerably in plumage, based on early descriptions. The red rail was also larger, with somewhat smaller wings, but their leg proportions were similar. The pelvis and sacrum was also similar. The Dutch ornithologist Marc Herremans suggested in 1989 that the red and Rodrigues rails were neotenic, with juvenile features such as weak pectoral apparatuses and downy plumage. Hume examined all available upper beaks in 2019, but found no differences in curvature. =Contemporary descriptions= Mundy visited Mauritius in 1638 and described the red rail as follows: Drawing by Peter Mundy, 1638 The yellowish colouration mentioned by Mundy instead of the red of other accounts was used by the Japanese ornithologist Masauji Hachisuka in 1937 as an argument for this referring to a distinct species, Kuina mundyi, but it has also been suggested it was due to the observed bird being a juvenile. Another English traveller, John Marshall, described the bird as follows in 1668: =Contemporary depictions= Edwards' alt=An oil painting depicting a red-feathered parrot with yellow wing tips; a large, ungainly, duck-like bird with grey, white and yellow feathers; a parrot with a black back, yellow breast and a yellow and black tail; and a brown- feathered bird with a long bill eating a frog Much information about the bird's appearance comes from a painting attributed to Hoefnagel, based on a bird in the menagerie of Emperor Rudolph II around 1610. It is the only coloured depiction of the species, showing the plumage as reddish brown, but it is unknown whether it was based on a stuffed or living specimen. The bird had most likely been brought alive to Europe, as it is unlikely that taxidermists were on board the visiting ships, and spirits were not yet used to preserve biological specimens. Most tropical specimens were preserved as dried heads and feet. It had probably lived in the emperor's zoo for a while together with the other animals painted for the same series. The painting was discovered in the emperor's collection and published in 1868 by Georg von Frauenfeld, along with a painting of a dodo from the same collection and artist. This specimen is thought to have been the only red rail that ever reached Europe. The travel journal of the Dutch East India Company ship Gelderland (1601‚Äì1603), rediscovered in the 1860s, contains good sketches of several now-extinct Mauritian birds attributed to the artist Joris Laerle, including an unlabelled red rail. The bird appears to have been stunned or killed, and the sketch is the earliest record of the species, but was only rediscovered in the 1860s. The image was sketched with pencil and finished in ink, but details such as a deeper beak and the shoulder of the wing are only seen in the underlying sketch. In addition, there are three rather crude black-and-white sketches, but differences in them were enough for some authors to suggest that each image depicted a distinct species, leading to the creation of several scientific names which are now synonymous with Aphanapteryx bonasia. Jacopo Bassano's 1570 painting Arca di No√®, perhaps showing a red rail in the lower right There are also depictions of what appears to be a red rail in three of the Dutch artist Roelant Savery's paintings. In his famous Edwards' Dodo painting from 1626, a rail-like bird is seen swallowing a frog behind the dodo, but this identification has been doubted, and it may instead show a bittern. A bird resembling a red rail is also figured in the Italian artist Jacopo Bassano's painting Arca di No√® (\\"Noah's Ark\\") from c. 1570. It has been pointed out that it is doubtful that a Mauritian bird could have reached Italy this early, but the attribution may be inaccurate, as Bassano had four artist sons who used the same name. A similar bird is also seen in the Flemish artist Jan Brueghel the Elder's Noah's Ark painting. Behaviour and ecology Labeled sketch from 1634 by Sir Thomas Herbert, showing a broad-billed parrot, a red rail, and a dodo Contemporary accounts are repetitive and do not shed much light on the life history of the red rail. Based on fossil localities, the bird widely occurred on Mauritius, in montane, lowland, and coastal habitats. The shape of the beak indicates it could have captured reptiles and invertebrates. There were many endemic land snails on Mauritius, including the extinct Tropidophora carinata, and subfossil shells have been found with damage matching attacks from the beak of the red rail. No contemporary accounts were known to mention the red rail's diet, until the 1660s report of Johannes Pretorius about his stay on Mauritius was published in 2015, where he mentioned that the bird \\"scratches in the earth with its sharp claws like a fowl to find food such as worms under the fallen leaves.\\" A 1631 Dutch letter (long thought lost, but rediscovered in 2017) uses word-play to refer to the animals described, with red rails supposedly being an allegory for soldiers: While it was swift and could escape when chased, it was easily lured by waving a red cloth, which they approached to attack; a similar behaviour was noted in its relative, the Rodrigues rail. The birds could then be picked up, and their cries when held would draw more individuals to the scene, as the birds, which had evolved in the absence of mammalian predators, were curious and not afraid of humans. 1601 sketches of a killed or stunned specimen, attributted to Joris Laerle The English traveller Sir Thomas Herbert described its behaviour towards red cloth in 1634: Many other endemic species of Mauritius became extinct after the arrival of man heavily damaged the ecosystem, making it hard to reconstruct. Before humans arrived, Mauritius was entirely covered in forests, but very little remains today due to deforestation. The surviving endemic fauna is still seriously threatened. The red rail lived alongside other recently extinct Mauritian birds such as the dodo, the broad-billed parrot, the Mascarene grey parakeet, the Mauritius blue pigeon, the Mauritius owl, the Mascarene coot, the Mauritian shelduck, the Mauritian duck, and the Mauritius night heron. Extinct Mauritian reptiles include the saddle-backed Mauritius giant tortoise, the domed Mauritius giant tortoise, the Mauritian giant skink, and the Round Island burrowing boa. The small Mauritian flying fox and the snail Tropidophora carinata lived on Mauritius and R√©union, but became extinct in both islands. Some plants, such as Casearia tinifolia and the palm orchid, have also become extinct. Relationship with humans Pieter van den Broecke's 1617 drawing of a dodo, a one-horned sheep, and a red rail; after the dodo became extinct, visitors may have confused the red rail with it Though Mauritius had previously been visited by Arab vessels in the Middle Ages and Portuguese ships between 1507 and 1513, they did not settle on the island. The Dutch Empire acquired the island in 1598, renaming it after Maurice of Nassau, and it was used from then on for the provisioning of trade vessels of the Dutch East India Company. To the sailors who visited Mauritius from 1598 and onwards, the fauna was mainly interesting from a culinary standpoint. The dodo was sometimes considered rather unpalatable, but the red rail was a popular gamebird for the Dutch and French settlers. The reports dwell upon the varying ease with which the bird could be caught according to the hunting method and the fact that when roasted it was considered similar to pork. Johann Christian Hoffmann, who was on Mauritius in the early 1670s, described a red rail hunt as follows: Hoffman's account refers to the red rail by the German version of the Dutch name originally applied to the dodo, \\"dod- aers\\", and John Marshall used \\"red hen\\" interchangeably with \\"dodo\\" in 1668. Milne-Edwards suggested that early travellers may have confused young dodos with red rails. The British ornithologist Alfred Newton (brother of Edward) suggested in 1868 that that the name of the dodo was transferred to the red rail after the former had gone extinct. Cheke suggested in 2008 that all post 1662 references to \\"dodos\\" therefore refer to the rail instead. A 1681 account of a \\"dodo\\", previously thought to have been the last, mentioned that the meat was \\"hard\\", similar to the description of red hen meat. The British writer Errol Fuller has also cast the 1662 \\"dodo\\" sighting in doubt, as the reaction to distress cries of the birds mentioned matches what was described for the red rail. In 2020, Cheke and the British researcher Jolyon C. Parish suggested that all mentions of dodos after the mid-17th century instead referred to red rails, and that the dodo had disappeared due to predation by feral pigs during a hiatus in settlement of Mauritius (1658‚Äì1664). The dodo's extinction therefore was not realised at the time, since new settlers had not seen real dodos, but as they expected to see flightless birds, they referred to the red rail by that name instead. Since red rails probably had larger clutches than dodos (as in other rails) and their eggs could be incubated faster, and their nests were perhaps concealed like those of the Rodrigues rail, they probably bred more efficiently, and were less vulnerable to pigs. They may also have foraged from the digging, scraping and rooting of the pigs, as does the weka of New Zealand. 1869 adaptation of the Hoefnagel painting 230 years before Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, the appearance of the red rail and the dodo led Mundy to speculate: =Extinction= Many terrestrial rails are flightless, and island populations are particularly vulnerable to man-made changes; as a result, rails have suffered more extinctions than any other family of birds. All six endemic species of Mascarene rails are extinct, all caused by human activities. In addition to hunting pressure by humans, the fact that the red rail nested on the ground made it vulnerable to pigs and other introduced animals, which ate their eggs and young, probably contributing to its extinction, according to Cheke. Hume pointed out that the red rail had coexisted with introduced rats since at least the 14th century, which did not appear to have affected them (as they seem to have been relatively common in the 1680s), and they were probably able to defend their nests (Dryolimnas rails have been observed killing rats, for example). They also seemed to have managed to survive alongside humans as well as introduced pigs and crab-eating macaques. Since the red rail was referred to by the names of the dodo in the late 1600s, it is uncertain which accounts that mention the species are the latest. When the French traveller Fran√ßois Leguat, who had become familiar with the Rodrigues rail in the preceding years, arrived on Mauritius in 1693, he remarked that the red rail had already become rare. He was the last source to mention the bird, so it is assumed that it became extinct around 1700. Feral cats, which are effective predators of ground- inhabiting birds, were established on Mauritius around the late 1680s (to control rats), and this has been cause for rapid disappearance of rails elsewhere, for example on Aldabra Atoll. Being inquisitive and fearless, Hume suggested the red rail would have been easy prey for cats, and was thereby driven to extinction.

The word has sometimes been used for other entertainments or innovations. Architect Carl Ferdinand Langhans introduced a pleorama in Breslau in 1831 with scenes of the Bay of Naples on both sides of 24 \\"voyagers\\" sitting in a wooden boat floating in a pool of water. The illusion was enhanced by light and sound effects: the boatman singing, Vesuvius erupting. Writer/artist August Kopisch was involved in designing the hour-long show. Carl Wilhelm Gropius, who had a diorama exhibit in Berlin, took over management of this pleorama in 1832, and there was also a pleorama of a journey along the river Rhine. The Swiss writer Bernard Comment, among others, has pointed out the similarities between Langhans' pleorama and the ambitious mareorama at the 1900 Paris Exhibition. A similar idea was used for a London padorama in 1834. Spectators were seated in railway carriages to watch a moving panorama of scenes visible from the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. In 1850s Finland the name pleorama was given to shows which presented historic scenes and panoramic views using glass, but posters for these do not mention anything resembling Langhans' boat concept.Posters in Swedish for pleoramas Etymology The name pleorama was coined from Greek elements. Like other 19th century novelties ending in -orama - diorama and cyclorama, for instance - the second half of the word has the sense of 'something seen'. The pleo- part here is understood to come from a Greek word meaning 'float' which applies to Langhans' boat in water idea. Pleorama is also the 21st century name of an innovative \\"floating house\\".

Life and work Edo Bertoglio received his degree in film directing and editing at the Conservatoire Libre du Cinema Francais in Paris in 1975. He moved to New York City in 1976, where he found work as a photographer for Italian Vogue, and Andy Warhol‚Äôs Interview, and other magazines. He became involved in the downtown art and music scenes of the late 70s and early 80s. During this time he was married to fashion designer Maripol, whom he has since divorced. He also took his photography experience and familiarity to rock music to do photographic work for the covers of LPs, completing many assignments for Atlantic, Arista, Chrysalis Records and Warner Brothers Records. He photographed The Bongos for RCA Records and for GQ Magazine. He also worked on Glenn O'Brien's late night countercultural talk show TV Party. In 1980, Bertoglio and Maripol secured backing from Rizzoli, through Fiorucci, to produce a film (with rock critic Glenn O'Brien) about the No Wave music scene and the general Lower East Side milieu. The film, titled New York Beat, was directed by Bertoglio, and young graffiti writer and future artist Jean- Michel Basquiat played the lead role, which was written by O‚ÄôBrien to mirror his real life. The no-wave bands DNA, Tuxedomoon, The Plastics, James Chance and the Contortions, and others appear in the movie, as well as Kid Creole and the Coconuts. Fab Five Freddy, Deborah Harry and others play bit parts. After shooting finished in January 1981 Rizzoli pulled out of funding the project, and footage lay unedited for almost 20 years until it was released under the title Downtown 81 in 2000. Bertoglio left New York for his hometown of Lugano, Switzerland, in 1990. He later returned to the world of Downtown 81, writing and directing the film Face Addict, released in 2005. He also plays a main part in the film, along with artist and musician Walter Steding, as the pair walk through memories of New York in the punk era, talking to such figures as Deborah Harry, Maripol, John Lurie, Glenn O‚ÄôBrien, and others about the time. A poetic pseudo-documentary mixing original footage with retrospective commentary, the film was less critically or commercially successful than Downtown 81.

It was released by Perlon on LP and CD on October 12, 2004. The album's French title, which translates into English as \\"Tea in the Harem of Archimedes,\\" is a reference to the Mehdi Charef book Tea in the Harem (French title: Th√© au Harem d'Archim√®de), as well as a pun on the French phrase \\"Th√©or√®me d'Archim√®de\\", the title of the album's fourth track. Th√© au Harem d'Archim√®de continues to build on the nuanced percussion of Villalobos' previous album, Alcachofa, while eschewing melodies in favour for rhythm and groove. On vinyl, \\"Hireklon\\" is extended by over five minutes and features a longer guitar solo, while the delay and dub effects on the clapping is toned down significantly. An additional song, \\"Stereobox\\", is also present. Reception Reception was mixed to positive. Andy Kellman, writing for Allmusic, says that Villalobos is \\"perfectly content with forming luscious, pensively roiling, ten-minute grooves that double as some of the most organic-sounding electronic productions imaginable\\". A review for Dusted Magazine, by Jon Dale, lauded the album's unusual synthesis of sounds and influences, while noting that it was not as accessible as Villalobos' debut, Alcachofa. Ron Schepper's review for Stylus Magazine had a similarly mixed feel, noting the album's less accessible nature when compared to Alcachofa and stating that \\"Villalobos dives ever more deeply into percussive gumbo and leaves accessible hooks behind\\".

He might best be understood as a social scientist who sought to integrate psychology (especially the work of Freud, Adler and Jung), sociology and religion into a unified theory of human being. He consolidated these insights into a theory of character development and finally into his \\"We-Psychology\\".  Biography  The following material comes from the brief life written by John A. Sanford with the assistance of Kunkel's two sons.Kunkel, Fritz. (1984). Fritz Kunkel: Selected Writings. John A. Sanford ed., intro., & commentary. NJ: Paulist. Kunkel was born the seventh of eight siblings, on a wealthy estate in Brandenburg (now Poland), on September 6, 1889. His early life was characterized as carefree, imaginative, active and social. While pursuing a variety of interests, he did manage to study medicine, receiving his medical degree ‚Äúa few days after the beginning of the First World War‚Äù (1984, p. 1). At the Battle of Verdun, working as a battalion surgeon, he received a shrapnel wound that led to the loss of his left arm. Around 1919-1920, Kunkel moved to Vienna, where he became associated with Alfred Adler. In 1924, he began to practice Adlerian psychotherapy in Berlin. Over the next 10 to 15 years he built on his Adlerian foundations, publishing a dozen books and founding his unique school of \\"We-Psychology\\". In 1920 he married Ruth L√∂wengard, who became his colleague and co-founder of the Adler Institute in Berlin. They had three children. After the death of Ruth in January 1932, he married Elizabeth Jensen, and they had two more children. When Hitler came to power, Kunkel became increasingly disturbed by the restrictions being placed on psychotherapy, and he planned to immigrate to the USA with his family. He accepted an invitation by the Quakers to give a lecture tour in the United States in 1936, and again in 1939. When the war broke out in September 1939, he could not come back to Germany to pick up his family. The oldest son came to the States in 1938, after having attended the Quaker school in Eerde, the Netherlands, and his two siblings, also Eerde students, followed after the war. Elizabeth and her two boys joined her husband in December 1947. Kunkel continued to develop the We-Psychology and his religious psychology, while leading an active life of writing, lecturing, and psychotherapy, until his death on Easter Sunday 1956.

It is situated on the right bank of the Elbe, 53 km west of Ludwigslust, 25 km northeast of L√ºneburg and 50 km east of Hamburg. It is part of the Hamburg Metropolitan Region. Boizenburg's historical old town stretches along the Elbe, has a harbour and offers heritage baroque timberframe and brick buildings. As per the dictates of the Yalta Conference, Boizenburg was placed just a few kilometers behind the perimeter of the Iron Curtain, otherwise known as the 'Inner German Border'. History The German name Boyceneburg was first documented in 1158. The written form changed to Boiceneburg (1171) and then Boizeneburg (1195). The old Low German name for the town and river (Boize) likely stems from the Slavic boj for war (boj-burg = war-castle). Boizenburg suffered during the Thirty Years' War and its old castle was burnt down by Swedish troops in 1628. In 1709 the church and 160 or more medieval dwellings were incinerated by a fire. The Town Hall was rebuilt in 1712 and the layout of the town was redesigned by Prussian architects sent from Schwerin. They focused on incorporating efficiency of movement with fire-resistance, better sanitation and public space. During the Napoleonic Wars French troops were quartered in Boizenburg in 1807. A battle was fought with the retreating French army near Boizenburg in 1813. From 1815 to 1918, Boizenburg was part of the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. In 1826 a highway was built, connecting Hamburg, Berlin and subsequently Boizenburg (Highway \\"B5\\"). In 1846 the railway between Berlin and Hamburg was constructed. Boizenburg was included with its own train station along this important route. The shipbuilding yard Lemmsche founded in 1793 became highly industrialized in 1852 and produced many wooden and steel ships. The shipbuilders Thomsen & Co supported the German war effort during World War II. In 1973 the SED reactivated the shipbuilding facilities for the production of smaller inland ships for the USSR. After being privatized in 1989, the yard was declared bankrupt in 1997. Today smaller independent companies are active in the old ship yard. The Boizenburg Tile Factory established by Hans Duensing in 1903, became Europe's largest tile manufacturer by 1937. After being re-established in 1991, it remains one of the town's main employers. Artistic impressions of the tile work produced in Boizenburg‚Äîparticularly in the Art Nouveau style - can be found at the Erstes Deutsches Fliesen Museum. During the communist East German era, residents of Boizenburg were kept under close scrutiny by the Stasi. Many deemed 'politically untrustworthy' had their property confiscated during a state- sponsored terror campaign code-named Operation Vermin (Aktion Ungeziefer). Sightseeing One of the advantages of Boizenburg's isolation during the Cold War, is the pristine natural landscape of the Elbe Valley region stretching to the North, South and East. Much of the architecture and infrastructure in the old city remained 'perfectly untouched' during the DDR regime. In addition to significant restoration projects, new installations such as the modern redesign of the harbor and the addition of a topiary garden have greatly added to the Old Town's charm.

Roopnaraine served as Minister of Education of Guyana between 2015 and 2017. Biography Roopnaraine was born in Kitty, Georgetown, Guyana. In 1954, he won a scholarship to Queen's College, where he excelled in cricket; he captained the team and represented Demerara in the Inter-county Cricket Finals. In 1962 he was awarded a Guyana scholarship to attend St John's College, Cambridge, where he studied Romance languages. He played first-class cricket for the Cambridge University team from 1964 to 1966 and was awarded a Blue for representing the university in the annual University Match against Oxford in 1965 and 1966. As a cricketer, he was a lower order right-handed batsman and a right-arm off-break bowler. In 1970 he was awarded a scholarship to Cornell University, New York, where he obtained an MA and PhD in Comparative Literature. From 1976 to 1996, he has worked as a university lecturer in the UK, Canada, the US and at the University of Guyana. Politics He joined the Working People's Alliance (WPA) in Guyana in 1977 and became one of the leaders of the party, along with Walter Rodney, Clive Thomas and Eusi Kwayana. He was an activist politician and at the height of the years of People's National Congress (PNC) repression was arrested on charges of burning down the PNC headquarters. He also narrowly escaped death when he was attacked by PNC party thugs, only reaching safety with the help of sugarcane workers who led him through the cane fields to escape. After the assassination of Walter Rodney, Roopnaraine became leader of the WPA. In 2015, Roopnaraine was appointed Minister of Education of Guyana. In 2017, he was reassigned to Ministry of the Presidency, and Nicolette Henry replaced him as Minister of Education. Author Roopnaraine is one of the leading Caribbean intellectuals of his generation, though political activism has restricted his output. Nevertheless, he is an art critic (champion of the work of Stanley Greaves), literary critic (author of a pioneering essay on Martin Carter), film-maker (The Terror and the Time) and poet. He is the author of The Web of October: Rereading Martin Carter (1986), a suite of love poems entitled Suite for Supriya (1993), and Primacy of the Eye: The Art of Stanley Greaves was published in 2003.

This is primarily because not all of the Animal Ark Series books were published in the United States. The original Animal Ark Series consisted of 94 books written between 1994‚Äì2008. Although the majority of the stories centred around Mandy Hope and her parents vet practice, Animal Ark, in the town of Welford in Yorkshire, a number of stories took readers to other continents around the world. The original series also included a number of books labelled as Summer Specials or Holiday Specials. In fact, by late 2003, the Animal Ark Series was mainly publishing holiday specials including Valentine's Day, Easter, Halloween, and Christmas. Animal Ark : 1. Kittens in the Kitchen (1994) : 2.

The German name Linde was originally an abbreviated form of older names such as Dietlinde and Sieglinde. In the form Linda it was used by the writer Jean Paul for a leading character in his four-volume novel Titan, published 1800‚Äì1803, and it became popular in German-speaking countries thereafter. The name-element Linde is possibly derived from the same root as the linden tree, with reference to a shield made of that wood, but may have become associated with Germanic lind meaning \\"soft, tender\\", the image of the tree being used to indicate a gentle personality. Alternatively, Linde may represent Old German Lindi or Linda, meaning a serpent. Subsequent support for its appeal may have come from the neo-Latin language (Italian, Spanish or Portuguese) word linda, which is the feminine form of lindo, meaning \\"beautiful, pretty, cute\\" (Spanish and Portuguese) and \\"clean\\" (Italian). It is also a common name in South Africa, Linda, meaning \\"Wait\\"(IsiZulu and IsiXhosa). Among other names in use in English-speaking countries that include the -linda suffix are Melinda, Belinda, Celinda, and Rosalinda. The name days for Linda are on February 13 (Hungary, Poland), April 15 (Finland/Germany), June 19 (Switzerland), June 20 (Sweden), August 21 (Latvia), September 1 (Czech Republic), September 2 (Slovakia), and September 4 (Poland). In the Albanian version, Linda is a feminine name which means \\"birth\\" or \\"fertility\\". The masculine form is Lind. In African terms the name Linda means \\"wait\\" and is not gender based; similar names are Lindiwe also meaning \\"waited for\\" but often just written as Lindi in short. Lindokuhle (waiting for something beautiful) and its short form Lindo are related South African-American names.  Notable people  * Linda Barker, British television presenter * Linda L. M.

With the method, investors add to (or withdraw from) their portfolios in such a way that the portfolio balance reaches a predetermined monthly or quarterly target, regardless of market fluctuations. For example, an investor may want to have a $3600 investment in 36 months. Using VA, the investor would aim to have a total investment value of $100 at the beginning of the first month, $200 at the beginning of the second month, and so on. Having invested $100 at the beginning of the first month, the investment may be worth $101 at the end of that month. In that case, the investor invests a further $99 to reach the second month objective of $200. If at the end of the first month, the investment is worth $205, the investor withdraws $5. The idea of VA is that in periods of market decline, the investor contributes more, while in periods of market climb, the investor contributes less. As illustrated in the above example, in contrast to dollar cost averaging, which mandates that a fixed amount of money be invested at each period, the value averaging investor may on occasion be required to withdraw from the portfolio to keep to the program. Value averaging was developed by former Harvard University professor Michael E. Edleson. The investor must provide the expected rate of return to the value averaging formula. The inclusion of this piece of information is claimed to allow the value averaging formula to identify periods of investment over-performance and under-performance versus expectations. If the investment grows faster than expected, the investor will be required to buy less or sell. If the investment grows slower than expected or shrinks, the investor will be required to buy more. Some research suggests that the method results in higher returns at a similar risk, especially for high market variability and long time horizons. Other research suggests that VA offers no benefit at all in dollar terms, claiming that the rate-of-return benefit of VA is illusory because it is mathematically biased, retrospectively giving more weight to past returns if they were strong and less weight if they were weak. Endorsement Michael E. Edleson and Paul S. Marshall argue that value averaging can provide for an increased rate of return when compared to dollar cost averaging and other investment techniques. Professor Edleson recommends a VA period of three years. He suggests an infusion or withdrawal of capital every three or six months. For example, if one were to win or be bequeathed one million dollars, roughly 8.33 percent, with the exact amount being set by the formula, could be invested every quarter. It is important to note that the quarterly or semiannual amount can vary greatly, even resulting in a withdrawal, as mentioned above. Opponents argue that this misses the opportunity of already being fully invested when a large market upswing occurs. This argument against value averaging and dollar cost averaging and in favor of lump sum investing ignores the suggestion of Ben Stein and Phil DeMuth that it is more important to avoid a large market downswing, which is theoretically equally possible, since market movements are essentially unpredictable. Participating early on in a large market downswing has been shown to be devastating to the success of long term retirement, for example. Author Timothy J. McManaman further outlines the benefits of Value Averaging when applied to the popular 401(k) tax qualified investment vehicle. As stated in McManaman's book, Building a 401(k) Fortune, Value Averaging a 401(k) is a precise method of making periodic internal transfers between Equity and Money Market funds within a 401(k) to take advantage of market fluctuations. This is accomplished by initiating minor movements out of Equity funds when the overall market trends higher and back into Equity funds when the market moves lower. It is essentially buying fund shares at a lower base price and selling them a higher base price within a tax qualified 401(k) on a monthly or quarterly interval. Criticism Edleson and Marshall base their claim that VA outperforms other strategies on the fact that it generates a consistently higher Internal Rate of Return (IRR). According to Hayley (2013), however, the IRR is a misleading measure of returns for strategies such as VA. These strategies systematically invest less after strong returns than they do after weak returns. This makes the IRR calculation put more weight on earlier returns when they were high and less when they were low. This is a retrospective change (as VA invests more after poor returns), so while it alters the measured IRR it doesn‚Äôt generate more wealth for the investor. The study claims to demonstrate mathematically that VA is an inefficient investment strategy since the same outturns can be generated using other strategies which require less total cash to be invested. In addition, compared to other strategies, VA requires more active management, and a large ‚Äúside fund‚Äù of cash or liquid assets which can be used to make the periodic investments required by VA. It concludes that ‚ÄúVA‚Äôs popularity appears to be due to investors making a cognitive error in assuming that its higher IRR implies higher expected profits‚Äù. The study accepts that VA will tend to outperform when there is mean reversion in market returns (e.g. a high return one month tends to be followed by a low return the following month). But even if an investor identifies a market which mean-reverts, VA is unlikely to be the best strategy to use. Consistent mean reversion would mean that market returns are easy to forecast, so it would be easy to construct other strategies which would take advantage of this predictability more effectively than VA. Mean reversion in the market is not the same concept as regression to the mean as used by statisticians where retesting a non-random sample of a population tends to produce results that are closer to the mean than the original test. The existence of mean reversion in financial markets is controversial and is a subject of active research. If it exists, then it is almost certainly very slight. Independent of the issue of mean reversion, the cash side account required for value averaging will always cause some amount of reduced return on the overall portfolio since the money in the cash account, on average, will be earning less than if it was in the main portfolio. Any benefits that value averaging provides in terms of market timing need to overcome this factor. Because value averaging sometimes calls for the sale of assets even during an overall accumulation phase, there can potentially be additional transaction costs and restrictions. For example, some mutual funds have frequent trader policies. Some funds forbid additional investment in the fund within N months of a redemption from the fund. Some funds charge an additional fee for a redemption if there has been an investment in the last N months. References Sources * * Timothy J. McManaman, Building a 401(k) Fortune, 2008 * *Hicks, C.

Densely populated during the Roman period, in particular its north-western parts, where ample ruins of ancient buildings have been found. The present settlements date back to the Middle Ages. It is also home to Califfi Castle. In 16th and 17th centuries the island saw multiple waves of refugees from Ravni Kotari, who settled the island fleeing from the Ottomans. The limestone part of the island is covered predominantly with macchia, while the dolomite area is occupied by farmland. Larger coves are Muline in the northwest, Lamjana Vela and Lamjana Mala in the southeast. The eastern coast descends mildly to the sea, characterized by many indents. Ugljan is one of the most densely populated Croatian islands. All settlements (Preko, Ugljan, Lukoran, Sutomi≈°ƒáica, Poljana, Kali, O≈°ljak and Kukljica) are situated along the coast of the cultivated eastern side of the island. Major crops include olives, figs and vines. Set high above Preko are the ruins of St. Michael Fort. Ugljan has a regional road connected by the bridge with the regional road running along the island of Pa≈°man. Ferry port in Preko; ferry connections with Zadar.

It is situated on the Barnim Plateau at the city limits of Berlin, about northeast of the city centre. The municipal area comprises the villages of Ahrensfelde, Blumberg, Eiche, Lindenberg, and Mehrow. History Ahrensfelde parish church Ahrensfelde, like the neighbouring village of Eiche, was first mentioned in the 1375 Landbuch (domesday book) survey executed for Emperor Charles IV, after he had acquired the Margraviate of Brandenburg two years before. The oldest village however is Blumberg, once a possession held by the Bishops of Brandenburg, which was first mentioned as Blumenberch in 1253. Blumberg manor was acquired by the poet and diplomat Friedrich von Canitz in the late 17th century, the castle was later rebuilt according to plans by Karl Friedrich Schinkel with a park designed by Peter Joseph Lenn√©. It was destroyed by the advancing Red Army during the 1945 Battle of Berlin. The art historian Adolf B√∂tticher was a native of Blumberg. In 1908 the Ahrensfelde Cemetery was established by the Evangelical Church of the Prussian Union as a multi-regional burial site outside of Berlin. Parts of the municipal area near Ahrensfelde station were overbuilt and finally incorporated into the East Berlin borough of Marzahn in 1990. The present-day municipality was established by the merger of Ahrensfelde proper with Blumberg, Eiche and Lindeberg on 26 October 2003.

They are parasitoids of phytophagous insects, primarily flies. The 44 species in 15 genera are almost entirely absent from the New World. The biology of most species of Tetracampidae is little studied. Most of those whose hosts are known are associated with insects that mine in plants. European species of one genus, Dipriocampe, are endoparasitoids of the eggs of diprionid sawflies, and the British species of Foersterella are endoparasitoids of the eggs of Cassida spp. (Coleoptera, Cassididae). One species, Dipriocampe diprioni, was introduced into Canada from Europe for the biological control of diprionid pests, but did not become established. In Africa and Madagascar, members of this family are egg parasitoids of beetles (Chrysomelidae) and wasps (Diprionidae), or larval parasitoids of flies (Agromyzidae). Numerous fossil taxa are in this group, but their relationships to other chalcidoid families remain obscure.

Filmo is a series of 16-mm and 8-mm movie equipment made by the Bell & Howell Company. The line included cameras, projectors and accessories. History The Filmo camera series started with the 1923 Filmo 70, beginning a series of models built on the same basic body that was to be continued for more than half a century. It was based on Bell & Howell's brilliantly designed 1917 prototype for a 17.5mm camera intended for amateur use. When invited (along with Victor) into Kodak's 16mm plans in 1920, the company was quick to see the advantages and immediately set about redesigning the 17.5mm camera for 16mm film. The Filmo 70 was the first spring motor-driven 16mm camera. In 1925 the Eyemo, a hand-held 35mm camera based on the design of the Filmo 70 was offered. It was also spring driven, but could be hand-cranked as well. Bell & Howell introduced the first 16mm turret camera with its Model C in 1927. A beautifully ornate and much more compact 16mm camera, the Filmo 75, marketed primarily as a \\"watch-thin\\" ladies' camera, was offered in 1928, followed in 1931 by a nearly identical counterpart designated as the Filmo Field Camera, offered initially in a plain covering, but also available with the ornate decorations of the Model 75, and in that form indistinguishable from the earlier version except for the nameplate. Bell & Howell 8mm amateur camera Filmo Straight Eight When Kodak introduced 8mm film in 1932, Bell & Howell was slow to take up the new format, and when it did so, it was not in the form of the Kodak standard. The first 8mm Filmo was offered in 1935 as a single run 8mm film camera, the Filmo 127-A called STRAIGHT EIGHT. However, STRAIGHT EIGHT did not appeal to the market as well as double-8, so the design was modified for double-8 as the 134-A in 1936. Production of Filmos around this body type continued into the 1950s. Description Ornate Filmo 75 camera (1928). Filmo 70-DR with Crystal Sync Motor The 16mm Filmo cameras all take 16-mm film on a Daylight spool although some versions can also take external magazines. Spring wind is standard, although some Filmos have provisions for attachment of a 12V DC or AC motor. A crystal-sync motor was developed for the Eyemo and later adapted to the Filmo. In 1927, the camera was equipped with a three-lens turret (Model C). Early turret models used a variable drum finder (Models D and DA) or sets of separate finder lenses matched to each focal length on later cameras (Models DL and DR). Early versions (The Filmo 70A and 70C) were designed for two speeds, either 8 and 16 frame/s, or 16 and 32 frame/s, with one option for a 12-16-24 frame/s 3-speed camera. Starting with the Model D in 1927, most versions could shoot a range of speeds up to 64 frames per second (8-12-16-24-32-48-64 frame/s), although there was a superspeed version, the 70-B (1925), designed to run at a single speed of 128 frame/s. This produced an extreme slow-motion effect and was used for motion analysis. The Model 70-E (1935) was a turretless version of the Model D, with a shorter range of speeds (8-16-24-64 frame/s). The camera was built to the most precise standards in the industry, and is still popular with student filmmakers. Durable and ruggedly built, it was standard equipment for U.S. military combat cameramen from World War II thru Vietnam, and the workhorse silent news-gathering camera for TV stations from the 1950s through the 1970s, when electronic news gathering (ENG) on video tape began to replace 16mm film. Most varieties are very common, but special models like the Model 70-B, and the 70-DB (Golf Model, 1931)) are quite rare, and the Filmo 70-AC Morgana Color System camera (1932), while advertised briefly, is unknown in any extant examples and may never have gone past the prototype stage.

Petillo (September 4, 1945 ‚Äì August 13, 2010) was an American luthier. In the 1970s he built prototypes for Travis Bean and Gary Kramer for what would become Kramer Guitars. Education Petillo's educational training included a BS in Industrial Engineering from Columbia University (1967), a Master's in Industrial Science from LaSalle University (1969). He later received an honorary BS from Eastern Virginia Graduate School of Medicine (1984) and a PhD in Engineering Technology from LaSalle University (1990). he was an apprentice of John D'Angelico and also of D'Angelico's, Jimmy DiSerio. Career Aside from his guitar making, he was also the former Director of Engineering at Millenium Cell Inc. and designed and invented hydrogen fuel cells known as Hydrogen On Demand, hydrogen from sodium borohydride generators for DaimlerChrysler. Even after the developing company Millenium Cell closed in 2008, Petillo continued with the product. Patent In the guitar circle, Petillo is most famous as the inventor of the \\"Petillo Precision Fret.\\" In a patent filed on June 22, 1976, the new fret was described as \\"a substantially T-shaped fret for a stringed instrument which has an elongated stem topped by a triangularly shaped cap.\\" Petillo's triangular frets result in more precise intonation; however, not all guitarists are comfortable with their rigid feel. The Revolutionary Drumstick Patent of Petillo was sold to Ambico at the NAMM Convention in GA, 1977 Manufacturing In 1970, Dennis Berardi and Gary Kramer asked Phil Petillo Master Luthier-Engineer to design and build 4 prototypes of a new neck made out of aluminum and wood. When Berardi and Kramer first came to the Petillo Home Workshop, they offered the guitar to be called PETILLO and Phil refused for he knew from past experiences in the Music Industry that often one loses one's good name with such offers that are appealing when the need demands it. Petillo designed the guitar with a forked headstock. When La Placa and investor Henry Vaccaro joined forces to open a plant in Neptune, New Jersey, they needed Petillo. The first four prototypes of Kramer Guitars were hand made in 1976 at the 1206 Herbert Ave. Ocean, NJ Studio Workshop by Phil Petillo. These unique guitars were photographed for the first Kramer Brochure that was introduced at the 1977 NAMM show in Chicago, Illinois in 1976. At that show, the fledgling guitar company sold $250,000 based on the interest generated from the 4 prototype guitars. Ironically, they had no guitars since the factory had yet to be set up. Petillo helped design and set up the factory located in Neptune and proceeded to build the First Fingerboard Machine that cut the slots in all fingerboards to Petillo's Trade Secret Scales with Perfect Intonation. These designs and prototypes were kept in a guarded Safe in Dennis Berardi's office at the Neptune Factory. By the time the next NAMM show, one year later in Atlanta, GA 1977, after Petillo organized the factory, set up, scaled fingerboards, then he was pushed out. Petillo saw things in the factory that were compromised for profit that he could not tolerate as a Luthier of the highest ethical standards. Due to extreme differences regarding payment and quality control, La Placa, Berrardi et all forced Petillo out after he had given the supreme sacrifice of his own business with Total Responsibility for completing this intense project of design, building from scratch these four guitars that were used to get endorsements from Stanley Clark and others in his home workshop, witnessed by his wife business partner, Lucille Petillo that propelled the Kramer Company under BKL to early success. Later they also eliminated Gary Kramer. Petillo did not receive compensation but instead was methodically forced out after all of his contributions that started the company. Their unethical behavior after Petillo organized the production of the first Kramers keeping quality control as a priority was unethical. Factory quality violations in Neptune, New Jersey plus lack of payment for his contributions of designing, building, and quality control along with disagreements with Peter LaPlaca and Lucille Petillo, Phil was forced out of the company. An article was written by Phillip and Lucille Petillo that appeared in the NAMM issue of Musical Merchandise Review describing in detail how these unique guitars were made featuring the construction of the Kramer Neck. (MMR Issue,October 1, 1976) The Kramer factory was originally located at 1111 Green Grove Road, Neptune, NJ 07753 before moving to a larger facility at 685 Neptune Boulevard, Neptune NJ 07753. Notable clients included Bruce Springsteen and members of his band such as Nils Lofgren and Garry Tallent, Tom Petty, Keith Richards, Steve Miller, Jim Croce, Johnny Cash, James Taylor, Loverboy, former Elvis Presley band members, Paul McCartney and Tal Farlow and Paul Stanley of Kiss, a one off White \\"Flying V\\" with a bolt on neck and rewired Guild pickups. Petillo and Springsteen were friends and actually from the same neighborhood when Petillo sold him a Fender Esquire which Springsteen continues to use. In 1985, Springsteen once waited six hours in Petillo's basement for him to finish furnishing his guitar for a concert. A guitar made by Petillo was featured on Springsteen's album Born to Run. Petillo was also friends with Croce and once repaired his Martin D-35. He also invented and promoted a line of strings for Tommy DeVito and The Four Seasons. He also performed some work for the Smithsonian Institution including a Stradivarius which arrived in an armored truck. In a 2012 book, luthier Bob Benedetto was quoted as saying \\"I had an advantage in 1968 when I started, because there were only a few achtop makers including Sam Koontz, Jimmy D'Aquisto, Phil Petillo, and Bill Barker\\". In 2004, he was honored for his inventions by the Research and Development Council of New Jersey. His son, David, who worked with him for several years, continued Petillo's work after his death. One of David's feats to Springsteen's guitar was adding \\"Asbury Park\\", \\"New Jersey\\" and silhouettes of Springsteen's redhead wife, Patti, and E Street Band saxophonist Clarence Clemons.

Canada The Dominion Land Survey of Western Canada took its origin at the First (or Principal) Meridian, located at 97¬∞27‚Ä≤28.41‚Ä≥ west of Greenwich, just west of Winnipeg, Manitoba. This line is exactly ten miles west of the Red River at the Canada-United States border. Six other meridians were designated at four-degree intervals westward, with the seventh located in British Columbia; the second and fourth meridians form the general eastern border and the western border of Saskatchewan. United States BLM map depicts the principal meridians and baselines used for surveying states (colored) in the PLSS. In the United States Public Land Survey System, a principal meridian is the principal north-south line used for survey control in a large region, and which divides townships between east and west. The meridian meets its corresponding baseline at the point of origin, or initial point, for the land survey. For example, the Mount Diablo Meridian, used for surveys in California and Nevada, runs north-south through the summit of Mount Diablo. Often, meridians are marked with roads, such as the Meridian Avenue in San Jose, California, Meridian Road in Vacaville, California, both on the Mount Diablo Meridian, Meridian Road in Wichita, Kansas on the Sixth Principal Meridian, and Meridian Avenue in several western Washington counties generally following the Willamette Meridian. Baseline Road or Base Line Street extends for about from Highland, California east of San Bernardino to La Verne, California where it meets Foothill Boulevard.

It is used to treat hypothyroidism. It is less preferred than levothyroxine. It is taken by mouth. Maximal effects may take up to 3 weeks to occur. Side effects may occur from excessive doses. This may include weight loss, fever, headache, anxiety, trouble sleeping, arrythmias, and heart failure. Other side effects may include allergic reactions. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is generally safe. Regular blood tests are recommended to verify the appropriateness of the dose. They contain a mixture of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Desiccated thyroid has been used since the late 1800s. It is usually made from pigs, sheep, or cows. It is available as a generic medication. In the United States the wholesale cost for a month of medication is about US$15.30. In 2017, it was the 130th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than five million prescriptions. Usage has decreased since the 1960s. Medical uses The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the Royal College of Physicians recommend against the use of thyroid extract for the treatment of hypothyroidism. Concerns include the potential for adverse effects from superphysiological levels of T3 and the absence of long-term safety data from randomized clinical trials. They recommend levothyroxine as the preferred treatment. Some practitioners refuse to use desiccated thyroid. About 65 mg of thyroid extract is equivalent to 100 ug of levothyroxine. Arguments against desiccated thyroid include: #Desiccated thyroid preparations have a greater variability from batch to batch than synthetic ones. #Desiccated thyroid has roughly a 4:1 ratio of thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3). In humans, the ratio is 11:1.Repas, Thomas. Desiccated thyroid in the management of hypothyroidism: Part I. #A combination of various ratios of T4 and T3 may not provide benefits over T4 alone. Some controlled trials have shown inconsistent benefits of various ratios of T4 and T3. #The use of desiccated thyroid is usually accompanied with the practice of dosing according to symptoms instead of dosing to achieve \\"ideal\\" lab results (e.g. serum levels of TSH). While there is debate as to what the ideal serum levels are, dosing according to symptoms often results in higher dosages. Most endocrinologists are opposed to these higher dosages as there may be risks of hyperthyroidism and osteoporosis. #The preference for \\"natural\\" treatment seems to stem from philosophical belief as opposed to science. Chemistry Desiccated thyroid has been described in the United States Pharmacopoeia for a century as the cleaned, dried, and powdered thyroid gland previously deprived of connective tissue and fat... obtained from domesticated animals that are used for food by man (USP XVI). In the last few decades, pork alone is the usual source. Before modern assays, the potency was specified only by iodine content (\\"not less than 0.17% and not more than 0.23%\\"), rather than hormonal content or activity. History The earliest oral treatment for hypothyroidism consisted of thyroid extract. George Redmayne Murray of the United Kingdom first described treatment of myxedema with thyroid extract in 1891, and published a description of long-term successful treatment (28 years) of a patient with myxedema (severe hypothyroidism) in 1920Murray GR. The life history of the first case of myxoedema treated by thyroid extract. Br Med J 1920;i:359-60. His treatment was quickly adopted in North America and Europe. The first recorded American use dates to 1891 by a woman who was still taking it 52 years later at 84 years of age Burgess AM. Myxedema-- controlled by thyroid extract for fifty-two years: report of a case. Ann Internal Med 1946; 25:146. Desiccated thyroid extract is prepared from pig thyroid glands. The glands are dried (desiccated), ground to powder, combined with binder chemicals, and pressed into pills. This was a new use for parts that were previously unwanted slaughterhouse offal, and Armour and Company, the dominant American meatpacker in the 20th century, supplied the best-known brand of thyroid extract. Replacement by thyroid extract in hypothyroidism was one of the most effective treatments of any disease available to physicians before the middle of the 20th century, and in severe cases afforded dramatic relief of the myriad symptoms. The decision to treat was usually based on the presence of signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism because there were no accurate, readily available laboratory tests of thyroid function. Many less severe cases of hypothyroidism went untreated. Dosage was regulated by improvement of symptoms. Desiccated Thyroid became a commercial treatment option in 1934 with Westhroid,. In the early 1960s, desiccated thyroid hormones (thyroid extract) began to be replaced by levothyroxine (synthetic T4), or by combinations of T4 and T3. Replacement occurred faster in the United Kingdom than in North America, but by the 1980s more patients were being prescribed synthetic T4 (levothyroxine) or synthetic T4/T3 combinations than desiccated thyroid extract. Several reasons have been identified as to why prescriptions changed from desiccated thyroid treatment. *Although thyroid extract was useful and usually effective, some patients continued to complain of fatigue, weight gain, or other symptoms. Dosing until the 1960s was often a matter of prolonged adjustment trials.Means JH, DeGroot LJ, Stanbury JB. The Thyroid and its Diseases. 3rd ed. New York:McGraw Hill, 1963. See chapter 9 for a lengthy discussion of the difficulties of assessing treatment in the era before effective tests, as well as the doctors' impressions of the superiority of the new synthetic thyroxine that had just become available. *It was known that not all of the iodine content of thyroid extract was in the form of effective T4 and T3 and that actual content of available preparations varied more than the permitted 15%. It was hoped that better dosing precision with levothyroxine (synthetic) alone would increase the proportion of patients effectively treated. In 1980, a widely publicized investigation published in JAMA revealed continued large ranges of hormone content and potency in all of the available thyroid extracts on the American market. *By the 1960s, it was known that thyroxine was the essential hormone produced by the thyroid gland, and that most T3 was manufactured in other parts of the body by deiodination of thyroxine. It was demonstrated in hypothyroid animals and people that replacement of thyroxine alone corrected the measurable manifestations (laboratory test results) of hypothyroidism. By the 1970s doctors could measure T4, T3, and TSH in human blood with approximate accuracy and confirmed that treatment with thyroxine alone could produce normal blood levels of both T4 and T3, but desiccated thyroid caused supraphysiologic levels of T3. In the majority of patients normalization of these levels eliminated all signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism. *It was discovered that a healthy person varied the amount of T3 produced from T4 in response to changing needs and conditions and it seemed wiser not to bypass this control system by providing larger amounts of T3 than were naturally produced each day. *Furthermore, when T3 could be measured, it was discovered that thyroid extract and synthetic combinations of T4 and T3 produced significantly greater fluctuations of T3 throughout the day than occurred in healthy people or hypothyroid people treated with thyroxine alone. *Endocrinologists found that treatment with thyroxine alone worked as well or better than thyroid extract for the majority of patients, although even thyroxine did not reverse all the symptoms of a minority. Thyroid care changed in other ways as well. Accurate T4 and T3 measurements became widely used in the 1970s, and by the late 1980s, TSH measurement had become sensitive enough to detect mild degrees of hyperthyroidism and overtreatment. Blood levels of thyroid hormones and TSH were found to be the best predictors of objective benefits from thyroid replacement: those with the most severe measurable deficiency enjoyed the most dramatic and sustained benefits. It was also discovered that even mild hyperthyroidism as defined by a suppressed TSH level, whether due to disease or overtreatment, was associated with poorer bone density in women, and with higher rates of atrial fibrillation in elderly patients.

Hunter served in the Cabinet of South Australia from October 2011 to 2018. Background Hunter grew up in the suburb of Holden Hill in Adelaide's North-East. He was educated at Gilles Plains High School and graduated from Flinders University with a Bachelor of Science (Honours), majoring in Microbiology and Genetics. Throughout university he worked as a Youth Worker at the Child Youth Support Service in Norwood. Hunter was active in community politics at university, becoming president of the Flinders University Gay Society and later going on to help found the South Australian AIDS Action Committee. He was involved in a variety of campaigns in the LGBT community, including a successful move to have sexuality included as a grounds for discrimination in 1986. Following his graduation Hunter worked as a research assistant in the Department of Clinical Immunology at the Flinders Medical Centre, later serving as an advisor to the federal government and as Labor South Australian State Secretary. Parliament Hunter was elected to the South Australian Legislative Council at the 2006 state election at fourth position on the Labor ticket, and at the 2014 state election he was re-elected at second position on the Labor ticket. He used his maiden speech to outline his commitment to social justice issues and education as a force for progressive change, and attacked the push for the teaching of Intelligent Design as \\"fundamentalist dogma dressed up as science\\". He also reflected on his political life in the Australian Labor Party, recalling his step-father's advice that \\"Labor stood for the working people and the Liberals stood for the rich\\", and saying, \\"in all my years since then I have not seen anything to refute his approach to politics\\". Hunter served as chair of the Social Development Committee's inquiry into Bogus, Unregistered and Deregistered Health Practitioners. The Committee produced a report recommending substantial regulation of currently unregistered health practitioners, a public awareness campaign, and strict rules on the display of legitimate health qualifications. In September 2010 Hunter gave a speech in parliament criticising the practice of homeopathy for failing to meet the standards of peer reviewed scientific research, and called for Nicola Roxon, the Federal Minister for Health, to immediately review all taxpayer funding of homeopathy. He has been the subject of three separate successful upper house no confidence motions, moved by the Liberal opposition and supported by the crossbench. Hunter was appointed to the Weatherill Ministry cabinet in October 2011 and served in a range of ministerial portfolios until the 2018 state election including communities and social inclusion, social housing, disabilities, youth, volunteers (2011 to 2013), sustainability, environment and conservation, water and the River Murray and climate change (2013 to 2018), and aboriginal affairs (between 2013 and 2015).Cabinet of South Australia: Premier.sa.gov.au =LGBT advocacy= Hunter is the first openly-LGBTI member in the Parliament of South Australia, as well as Cabinet, as well as the first to marry while in parliament and the second same-sex married politician in Australia, and is noted for his public advocacy for LGBT issues, which at times has conflicted with aspects of Labor policy. Hunter and his partner of 20 years, Leith Semmens chose to travel to Spain to marry as Australian law did not recognise same-sex marriage at the time. Official 2006 parliamentary photo. In June 2008 Hunter introduced a number of amendments to the Statutes Amendment (Surrogacy) Bill, including removing the term \\"marriage-like relationship\\" in order to remove discrimination against same-sex couples. The amendment would effectively give same-sex couples the legal right to access gestational surrogacy. Following an email campaign by Family First MLCs Andrew Evans and Dennis Hood the proposed amendment was defeated, and the Bill was referred back to the House of Assembly in its original form. On 16 June 2009 Hunter delivered a speech to parliament calling for same-sex marriage in Australia and criticising Prime Minister Kevin Rudd for supporting the current definition of marriage as \\"between a man and a woman\\". His speech gained national media attention, and went on to be included in an anthology of \\"Great Speeches on Gay Rights\\". Hunter co-sponsored the 2011 Marriage Equality Bill with Greens MLC Tammy Franks also supported by the Australian Marriage Equality under its then national convenor Alex Greenwich who became the first same-sex married parliamentarian in Australia and the NSW Legislative Assembly. If passed it would be the first piece of legislation in Australia to grant same-sex couples equal marriage rights. The legislation is based on formal constitutional advice from Professor George Williams that, while Federal marriage law prohibits same-sex marriage, the states may be able to introduce their own legislation without being rendered invalid by Section 109 of the Australian Constitution. Hunter's second reading speech on the bill once again drew media attention after he labelled the current Labor policy on marriage \\"morally bankrupt\\" and \\"a house of cards that cannot stand long\\", comparing it with the party's past support for the White Australia Policy. In February 2011 the South Australian state division of the Liberal Party announced that it would vote against the Marriage Equality Bill in the Legislative Council, declaring a view that marriage was beyond the legislative jurisdiction of the South Australian Parliament and the view that legislation could be struck down by the High Court of Australia. Liberal leader Isobel Redmond later declared her support for marriage equality, following Mike Rann's declaration of support in the final weeks of his Premiership. In May 2011 the multi-party Social Development Committee, which Hunter chairs, delivered the findings of its Inquiry into same-sex parenting to parliament. The recommendations of the committee included the introduction of adoption rights for same-sex couples, access to altruistic gestational surrogacy, legal parenting rights for non- birth mothers borne to gestational surrogates, access to reproductive technology for lesbian and single women, and a public awareness campaign on the rights of same-sex parents. Personal life Hunter, 52, married his long-term partner, Leith Semmens, 42, in Jun in the Province of Granada in southern Spain on 19 December 2012.

He first appeared in Smash Comics #1 (August 1939), and was created by Art Pinajian, who illustrated the story under the pseudonym \\"Art Gordon\\". Publication history The character first appeared in Smash Comics #1 in 1939, as published by Quality Comics in a story titled \\"Hooded Justice\\". Years after the character was acquired by DC Comics, a retroactive fictional history was developed. Fictional character biography =Kent Thurston= Little is known about Kent Thurston's early history except that he was a wealthy former private detective who originally fought crime as the Invisible Hood while wearing a hooded red cloak and carrying a gas-gun. Despite his name, the Invisible Hood did not originally have the power to become invisible in his first appearance in Smash Comics #1. In his second appearance, the Invisible Hood's robe is treated with an invisibility solution invented by a famous chemist named Professor Hans Van Dorn, who is kidnapped by a criminal and later murdered after refusing to cooperate with his kidnappers. Thurston reveals that he is the Invisible Hood to the dying Van Horn, and promises to use the power of invisibility only for good. According to Jess Nevins' Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes, \\"he fights enemies like the evil shaman Dr. Moku, the Green Lizard (who has a giant pet crocodile), the Voodoo Master, and Dr. Robb, who has Tutankhamen's jewel, which projects antigravity\\". Although the character was always known as the Invisible Hood, the name of his series was originally titled Hooded Justice in Smash Comics #1, but was changed to Invisible Justice as of Smash Comics #2. He was featured in Smash Comics #1-32, often sharing the book with other characters, such as Archie O'Toole and Wings Wendall. Hours before the attack on Pearl Harbor, Thurston was recruited by Uncle Sam to join the Freedom Fighters in defending the base. The entire team, except for Uncle Sam, appeared to be killed. It was later revealed that all of the team except for Magno had lived (Secret Origins #26). The Invisible Hood survived until 1974, when he was apparently murdered by Icicle and the Mist (Starman (vol. 2) #2).

A native of Glasgow (he was actually born outside the Glasgow boundary, in Thornliebank, Renfrewshire), he was the first ballplayer born in Scotland to appear in a major league game. McCormick was great friends with Mike \\"King\\" Kelly and was also very well liked by Cap Anson, two of the great personalities of early baseball. Anson was McCormick's captain-manager in 1885 and 1886, when Chicago won its last 19th-century pennants. Career In Paterson, New Jersey starting in 1885, McCormick co- owned a bar with a fellow former local player, Dave Treado. It had a ticker, to post results of games and races. Before the 1888 season and probably at other times, Kelly did some bartending for him. That August, when McCormick's wife Jennie died, Kelly wired a former mutual Chicago teammate, and \\"telegraphed Mr. Joseph Towell, the [Paterson] florist, to get up something handsome, and this consisted of \`The Gates Ajar,' the sides of which were made from nephetos [presumably nepetas, aromatic herbs in the mint family] and white roses, the base of carnations, yellow roses and white lilies. The gates were made of ivy leaves, the whole being surmounted by a dove.\\" Back in 1885, after their Chicago team won the pennant, Kelly and McCormick returned by train to Paterson with teammate Tom Burns, who was heading to Connecticut. A local social club met the players and took them to McCormick's bar. There, a state senator handed a silver ball to McCormick, \\"who was loudly called upon and cheered. He said he was suffering from the effects of a severe cold and he would like to make a speech but even if he did he could not tell them how much he appreciated this token of friendship, more than anything he had ever yet received. Kelly was called on and was cheered; in fact, the crowd at this stage was prepared to cheer everybody. As he arose some one [sic] called: 'Make a dead hit this time, Mike!' He said on behalf of Mr. McCormick and himself he desired to thank the donors of the ball; they would never forget this occasion and would ever keep this gift and try to be in the best club [sic]; but we are getting pretty old now.\\" About Anson, McCormick reportedly said the following in 1887, soon after being sold by Chicago to Pittsburgh: \\"Before I played ball with Anson I used to think he was a big dub, but I thought him a pretty fair fellow afterward. He never said much to me. If any one wants to get Anson mad let him say he is in one of those trances [presumably, mellow moments during a game]. Kelly used to make him wild by shouting in from the outfield: 'Have you got them again?'\\" That offseason, Chicago President Albert G. Spalding sold several of his best-known players, mainly for drinking during the 1886 season. After selling George Gore to New York and Kelly to Boston, he traded McCormick. In March, McCormick was still the property of Chicago when Spalding said \\"the only trouble between McCormick and the club has been a difference of opinion between him and me as to his habits. Anson is and always has been very partial to 'Mac,' and wants him this season.\\" Ten days later in Louisville, Anson said, \\"I desire his services very much, however, for I think that, under the new [pitching] rules [allowing for unrestricted overhand throwing], he will be the best pitcher on the diamond. If he is released, it will only be for a good sum of money.\\" About a week after that, Spalding sold him. He also served as a player/manager for the Cleveland Blues from 1879-1880 and 1882 with a 74‚Äì96 record. At 19th all-time, McCormick has the 2nd highest Jaffe Wins Above Replacement Score (JAWS) of any eligible pitcher not in the Baseball Hall of Fame.

C. Sarkar & Sons, p.1) was a Mughal prince and the youngest son of Emperor Aurangzeb and his chief consort Dilras Banu Begum. Akbar led a rebellion against his father and fled the Deccan after the failure of that venture. He later went into exile to Persia, where he died. He was the father of Nikusiyar, who was Mughal emperor for a few months in 1719. Early life Muhammad Akbar was born on 11 September 1657 in Aurangabad to Prince Muhiuddin (later known as 'Aurangzeb' upon his accession) and his first wife and chief consort Dilras Banu Begum. His mother was a princess of the prominent Safavid dynasty of Iran (Persia) and was the daughter of Mirza Badi-uz-Zaman Safavi, the Viceroy of Gujarat. Dilras died when Akbar was only one month old. For this reason, Akbar was brought up with special care and affection by his father and his oldest sister, Princess Zeb-un-Nissa. Akbar was his father's best-loved son as Aurangzeb, himself, said in a letter to him, \\"God be my witness that I have loved you more than my other sons.\\" Akbar's siblings included his older sisters: Zeb-un-Nissa, Zinat-un-Nissa and Zubdat-un-Nissa and his older brother, Azam Shah. Like other Mughal princes, Muhammad Akbar administered various provinces and fought minor campaigns under the guidance of experienced officers. His first independent command was during Aurangzeb's war of the Jodhpur succession. =Marriages= On 18 June 1672, Akbar was wedded to a granddaughter of his paternal uncle, Dara Shikoh, who had been killed at Aurangzeb's behest. Princess Salima Banu Begum was the eldest daughter of Prince Sulaiman Shikoh, the eldest son of Dara Shikoh. Later, Akbar also married a daughter of an Assamese nobleman. He was the father of two sons and two daughters, including Nikusiyar, who briefly became Mughal emperor in 1719. The Rajput War Maharaja Jaswant Singh, who was Maharaja of Jodhpur, was also a high-ranking Mughal officer. He died at his post on the Khyber Pass on 10 December 1678. He died without leaving male issue, but two of his wives were pregnant at the time of his death. The succession was thus unclear. When the news of the death reached Aurangzeb, he immediately dispatched a large army (9 January 1679) to occupy the state of Jodhpur. One of the division of this army was commanded by Akbar. Aurangzeb occupied Jodhpur ostensibly to secure the succession for any male infant born to Jaswant's pregnant widows. He declared that such rightful heir would be invested with his patrimony upon coming of age. However, relations between Jaswant and Aurangzeb had not been very happy, and it was feared that Aurangzeb, would annex the state for good on this pretext. Indeed, incumbent officers in Jodhpur state were replaced by mughal officers. After thus effectively annexing the largest Hindu state in northern India, Aurangzeb reimposed the jaziya tax on the non-Muslim population (2 April 1679), almost a century after it had been abolished by his tolerant ancestor Akbar I. All this made the emperor extremely unpopular among the Rajputs. One of Jaswant's pregnant wives was duly delivered of a son, who was named Ajit Singh. Officers loyal to Jaswant brought his family back to Jodhpur and rallied the clan to the standards of the infant. The Rajputs of Jodhpur (Rathore clan) forged an alliance with the neighboring Rajputs of Mewar (Sisodia clan). Maharana Raj Singh of Mewar withdrew his army to the western portion of his kingdom, marked by the rugged Aravalli hills and secured by numerous hill-forts. From this position, the smaller but faster Rajput cavalry units could surprise the Mughal outposts in the plains, loot their supply trains, and bypass their camps to ravage neighbouring Mughal provinces. In the second half of 1680, after several months of such setbacks, Aurangzeb decided on an all-out offensive. Niccolao Manucci, an Italian gunner in the Mughal army, says: \\"for this campaign, Aurangzeb put in pledge the whole of his kingdom.\\" Three separate armies, under Aurangzeb's sons Akbar, Azam and Muazzam, penetrated the Aravalli hills from different directions. However, their artillery lost its effectiveness while being dragged around the rugged hills and both Azam and Muazzam were defeated by the Rajputs and beaten back.Storia do Mogor By Niccolao Manucci Akbar's rebellion Akbar and his general Tahawwur Khan had been instructed to try to bribe the Rajput nobles to the Mughal side, but in these attempts, they themselves were ensnared by the Rajputs. The Rajputs incited Akbar to rebel against his father and offered all support. They pointed out to him that Aurangzeb's attempt to annex the Rajput states was disturbing the stability of India. They also reminded him that the open bigotry displayed by Aurangzeb in reimposing jaziya and demolishing temples was contrary to the wise policies of his ancestors. Prince Akbar lent a willing ear to the Rajputs and promised to restore the policies of the illustrious Akbar. On 1 January 1681, Akbar declared himself Emperor, issued a manifesto deposing his father, and marched towards Ajmer to fight him. As the commander of a Mughal division, Akbar had a force of 12,000 cavalry with supporting infantry and artillery. To this, the Maharana of Mewar added 6,000 Rajput cavalry, being half his own army. As this combined army crossed Jodhpur state, numerous war-bands of Rathores joined up and increased its strength to 25,000 cavalry. Meanwhile, various Mughal divisions deployed around the Aravalli hills had been racing to come to Aurangzeb's aid. Aurangzeb however resorted to threats and treachery: he sent a letter to Tahawwur Khan promising to pardon him but also threatening to have his family publicly dishonored by camp ruffians if he refused to submit. The Mughal noble secretly came over to meet his master but was killed in a scuffle at the entrance to Aurangzeb's tent. The crafty Mughal Emperor then wrote a false letter to Akbar and arranged it such that the letter was intercepted by the Rajputs. In this letter, Aurangzeb congratulated his son for finally bringing the Rajput guerillas out in the open where they could be crushed by father and son together. The Rajput commanders suspected this letter to be false but took it to Akbar's camp for an explanation. Here they discovered that Tahawwur Khan had disappeared. Suspecting the worst, the Rajputs departed in the middle of the night. The next morning, Akbar woke to find his chief adviser and his allies gone and his own soldiers deserting by the hour to Aurangzeb. The would-be emperor escaped the prospect of war with his father by hastily departing the camp with a few close followers. He caught up with the Rajputs commanders and mutual explanations followed. Aftermath Seeing that Akbar had attempted no treachery and that he could be useful, the Rathore leader Durgadas took Akbar to the court of the Maratha king Sambhaji, seeking support for the project of placing him on the throne of Delhi. For fully five years, Akbar stayed with Sambhaji, hoping that the latter would lend him men and money to strike and seize the Mughal throne for himself. But at that time, Sambhaji was engaged in uncovering the conspiracy against him. After which, he was engrossed in wars against Siddhis of Janjira, Chikka Dev Rai of Mysore, Portuguese of Goa and Aurangzeb. In September 1686, Sambhaji sent Akbar to Persia. In Persia, Akbar was said to pray daily for the speedy death of his father, which alone would give him another chance to wrest the Mughal throne for himself. On hearing of this, Aurangzeb is said to have remarked, \\"Let us see who dies first. He or I!\\" As it turned out, Akbar died in 1706, one year before his father's demise. He died at the town of Mashhad in Persia. Two of Akbar's children were brought up by the Rajputs, until as a result of peace negotiations, they were handed over to the old emperor. Akbar's daughter Safiyat-un-nissa was sent to her grandfather in 1696 and his son Buland Akhtar was returned in 1698. The latter, when presented in court, shocked his grandfather and nobles by speaking fluently in the Rajasthani language.

It is situated 16 km west of Frankfurt (centre). It has about 11,000 inhabitants. Kriftel is also commonly known as \\"Fruit Orchard of the Anterior Taunus\\" (Obstgarten des Vordertaunus), because of the fields around it which are mainly used for producing strawberries. History In July AD 754, the track which carried the dead Saint Boniface rested in the village over night. To the honour of the saint, the Bonifatiuskapelle (chapel of Boniface) was built. Kriftel was first mentioned documentary in 790. The Thirty Years' War damaged Kriftel including the chapel, which was not rebuilt until 1755. It took so long because a big fire destroyed almost the entire village (34 houses out of 38) in 1661. From 1945 up until the oil crisis in 1973, Kriftel experienced a population explosion due to massive immigration from urban sprawl and workers of the Hoechst-AG, who were offered cheap land to build their housing units. In 1959, the chapel had to be relocated due to community growth. During the mid-1970s, Kriftel fought for independence because Hofheim, the capital of the Main-Taunus district, wanted it to belong to it. Airaines has been Kriftel's French sister city since 1981. The \\"Platz von Airaines\\" (Place of Airaines) at the train station was named after this partnership. Today Kriftel has two churches, the catholic \\"St. Vitus\\" and the protestant \\"Auferstehungskirche\\". There are three schools, an elementary school (Lindenschule [Linden School]), a comprehensive school (Weingartenschule [Vineyard School]) and a vocational training school (Konrad-Adenauer-Schule). Kriftel lies at the federal motorway A 66 and the regional train line S 2 (From Niedernhausen over Frankfurt to Dietzenbach). Kriftel is known for its good leisure facilities. In addition to multiple playgrounds, Kriftel has a large play park (Freizeitpark). This sports an outdoor swimming pool, sports fields including for football and volleyball, a miniature/crazy golf course, a quarter pipe for skating and extensive playgrounds. The village is also hosts various club activities. The most important clubs are the SV 07 Kriftel (soccer) and the Turn- und Sportverein Kriftel (sports in general especially volleyball and trick cycling). There are also large community festivals. The most prominent are the Lindenbl√ºtenfest (Feast of the blossom of the linden) in summer and the Krifteler Kerb (Kriftel's Kermesse) in autumn.

History  Petite Pointe du Ch√™nes was settled by M√©tis farmers, traders, freighters and buffalo hunters. The name was changed to Lorette by Bishop Tache to honour a priest in France who had made a considerable donation to the St. Boniface Cathedral.Barkwell, Lawrence J. (2018) Historic Metis settlements in Manitoba and geographical place names. Winnipeg, Manitoba: Louis Riel Institute, 2018.  Transportation Lorette is located on Provincial Road 207, which is part of the historic Old Dawson Trail. PR 207 can be accessed via the Trans-Canada Highway from the north, PR 206 from the east or PR 405 from the south.  Education  There are three elementary schools in Lorette. √âcole Lagimodi√®re, a French school; Dawson Trail School, an English school; and √âcole Lorette Immersion, a French immersion school. Coll√®ge Lorette Collegiate is the community's only high school, offering English and French immersion programs. French grade 9-12 students travel to the nearby community of Ile-des-Ch√™nes at √âcole/Coll√®ge r√©gional Gabrielle- Roy. There is a community library located in the Coll√®ge Lorette Collegiate.  Industry  The major employers in the community are the Municipality of Tach√©, the Seine River School Division, Division Scolaire Franco-Manitobaine and All Star Concrete.  Notre-Dame de Lorette  Notre-Dame de Lorette, located on Dawson Road is a Roman Catholic church offering services in French and English. Notre-Dame de Lorette was built at a cost of $20,000 and completed in 1900. The architect and builder was Auguste Gauthier of Lorette. The task required a great deal of volunteer labour supplied by the community. The inside of the church features walls and ceilings adorned with oil murals by artist L.E. Monty of Montreal. The church is surmounted by three bells, which were poured in Haute-Savoie, France.  Sports  The Complex Communautaire de Lorette Community Complex (or CCLCC) features a hockey rink, three-sheet curling rink, meeting rooms and a large hall. The Lorette Golf Course offers a nine-hole course along the Seine River. The Lorette Scorpions were the 2011-2012 WHSHL champions.  Mascot  In late 2017, bison located adjacent to Provincial Highway 405 (south of Lorette) had, repeatedly, found their way past their electrified fencing and onto the highway. Through social media, the bison, officially unofficially named Frederick \\"Freddy\\" The Bison, quickly became the LUD's adopted mascot by many of the residents. Moving past social media, the story was reported by the CBC. In addition to the Freddy's quick popularity with the residents as a mascot, he has also amassed a non- profit merchandising campaign in support of the CCLCC's new Complex. This has included custom birthday cards from the local flower shop to \\"Run Freddy Run\\" hoodies from the local designer. Many Canadians believe Freddy should be replaced with a chicken.

There are over 4,000 members worldwide, including students and those in related non-academic sectors.There are 35 chapters throughout the world. The society was founded in 1985 and began publishing the peer reviewed journal Conservation Biology in 1987, published by Blackwell Scientific publishers. This has been supplemented since 2007 by the rapid publication journal Conservation Letters . History The origin of the society resulted from the emergence of the field as a distinct subject in the 1970s. The phrase conservation biology originated from a conference of ecologists and population biologists at the University of Michigan, that published the book \\"Conservation Biology\\" An Evolutionary-Ecological PerspectiveSoule, M. E. and B. A. Wilcox. 1980. \\"Conservation Biology\\" An Evolutionary-Ecological Perspective. Sinauer Associates. Sunderland. Massachusetts was highly influential internationally, eventually selling tens of thousands of copies including a Russian translation. Michael E. Soul√© was its co-founder and the first president. By the mid-1980s there was sufficient interest and participation to establish a formal society and publish a peer reviewed journal Conservation Biology, started in May 1987 and published by Blackwell Scientific Publishers. The society also launched Conservation magazine in 2000 which was designed to complement Conservation Biology by making current conservation biology tools, techniques, and case studies accessible to practitioners, policy makers, and others. In 2014, Conservation magazine was renamed Anthropocene magazine and it is now published by University of Washington. In 2007, SCB started their second publication, Conservation Letters, an online rapid publication journal that covers cutting-edge, policy- relevant conservation research from both natural and social sciences. International Congress for Conservation Biology Starting in 1998, SCB has hosted the International Congress for Conservation Biology. This congress is designed as a forum for addressing conservation challenges around the world. The congress was held annually until 2011, when it was changed to a biennial schedule to reduce carbon impacts of travel to global congresses. The location of the congress rotates worldwide through all sections. Sections In 2000 the SCB Board of Governors approved the creation of seven regional sections that were formed over the following two years. The seven sections are Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America & Caribbean, North America, Marine and Oceania. These sections were established to help implement the society‚Äôs mission and goals on a regional scale. Each section holds its own congress, often in alternating years with international congress. Each section also has its own international Board of Directors. =Africa Section= The SCB Africa Section is dedicated to advancing the discipline of conservation biology in Africa and to helping African conservation scientists find lasting solutions to conservation problems in Africa. It was established at a meeting in Nairobi, Kenya in 2001 where conservation scientists and practitioners met to discuss conservation issues in Africa. SCB Africa Section has multiple groups and committees, including a Social Science and Gender Committee, Conservation, Policy, Education and Science Committee, Young Women Conservation Biologists' Group, and Communications and Mentoring Program. SCB Africa has organized the African Congress for Conservation Biology since 2007. This congress brings conservation professionals together to promote and reflect on conservation biology in Africa. =Asia Section= The SCB Asia Section strives to bring together experts from across the world to address biodiversity science and policy across Asia. It was established at the annual SCB meeting in Duluth, Minnesota 2003. SCB Asia has organized the SCB Asia Section Meeting since 2015 to bring together conservation professionals in Asia and promote biodiversity conservation across Asia. =Europe Section= Section meeting at Freiburg, 2010 The SCB Europe Section is dedicated to promoting conservation biology and to applying it to conserve biodiversity in Europe and the EU. It was established at the annual SCB meeting in Canterbury 2002. SCB Europe Section has task-oriented committees including Policy, Education, Communication, and Membership. SCB Europe has organised the European Congress of Conservation Biology since 2006. This facilitates the exchange on conservation science and nature conservation practice and policy, with the aim of promoting the protection of biological diversity in Europe. =Latin America & Caribbean Section= The SCB Latin America & Caribbean, formally called the Austral and Neotropical American Section, was formed in 2003 to unite conservation efforts in Central and South America. The SCB Latin America & Caribbean Section organizes the Latin America and Caribbean Congress for Conservation Biology which aims to connect conservation efforts between the Caribbean and Latin America. =Marine Section= The SCB Marine Section, formed in 2001, is dedicated to advancing the science and practice of conserving the Earth's marine biological diversity. It does not have a specific regional focus but rather focuses on furthering all marine conservation science, public policy, and research as it regards marine issues as global. It has multiple committees, including a Marine Policy Committee, Diversity Committee, and Marine Education Committee.. The SCB Marine Section has organized the International Marine Conservation Congress since 2011 to bring together marine scientists and marine conservation professionals to further marine conservation science and policy. =North America Section= The SCB North America section represents the North American continent north of Mexico (Mexico is part of the SCB Latin America & Caribbean Section) and is dedicated to bridging the gap between research and practice in order to help its members be more effective in facilitating on-the-ground conservation success. The SCB North America Section has had the North American Congress for Conservation Biology since 2009. Each meeting has had a different theme relating to conservation in North America, including \\"Conservation Science, Policy, and Practice: Connecting the Urban to the Wild\\" and \\"Bridging the Gap: Connecting People, Nature & Climate.\\" =Oceania Section= The SCB Oceania Section, including Australia, New Zealand and Pacific Island regions, was established in 2005. The mission of the SCB Oceania Section is to promote conservation science and practice in local communities and bring together conservation professionals in the region. It has held the Oceania Congress for Conservation Biology since 2007 which focuses on bringing together conservation professionals to present new findings, methods, tools, and opportunities in conservation science and practice. Chapters SCB chapters are local groupings that are associated with regional sections, and are a means to work locally to achieve conservation success. The following chapters are listed within each of the seven sections: * Africa: Cameroon Chapter, Ghana Chapter, Madagascar Chapter, Nigeria Chapter, South Africa Chapter * Asia: Bangladesh Chapter, Indonesia Chapter, Iran Chapter, Israeli Chapter, India Chapter, Malaysia Chapter, Korean Chapter * Europe: Hungarian Chapter, Nordic Chapter * Latin America & Caribbean: Southern Cone of South America Chapter * North America: Kingston Chapter, Toronto Chapter, Berkeley Chapter, Central Arizona Chapter, Colorado State University Chapter, Davis Chapter, Hawaii Chapter, Lake Superior State University Chapter, Orange County Chapter, Santa Cruz Chapter, Washington DC Chapter, Student Chapter of Wisconsin, Tampa Chapter, Texas A&M; Student Chapter, Wisconsin Chapter, West Virginia University Chapter * Oceania: Sydney Chapter, University of Queensland/Brisbane Chapter, Papua New Guinea Chapter, Victoria University of Wellington Chapter Working Groups In 2001, SCB began to develop topical working groups that would focus on areas relevant to the mission and goals of SCB and to create a way to promote important conservation issues that are not currently addressed in SCB's activities. The first working groups were officially formed in 2003. Today SCB has 7 official working groups, which are: * Freshwater Working Group: The Freshwater Working Group was established in 2003 to promote effective freshwater ecosystem conservation and science across the globe. * Social Science Working Group: The Social Science Working Group was established in 2003 to strengthen conservation social science and its application to conservation around the globe. *Religion and Conservation Biology Working Group: The Religion and Conservation Biology Working Group was established in 2007 to strengthen collaboration between conservation and faith traditions and to promote awareness of this collaboration within the conservation community. *Conservation Marketing Working Group: The Conservation Marketing and Engagement Working Group was established in 2014 to promote awareness, acceptance, and use of marketing techniques within SCB and conservation science. In 2018, they will host the 1st Annual International Conservation Marketing and Engagement Congress. *Conservation Genetics Working Groups: The Conservation Genetics Working Group was established in 2016 to help integrate genetics with the practice of biodiversity conservation and improve how genetic studies are communicated to the broader conservation audience. *Participatory and Citizen Science Working Group: The Participatory and Citizen Science Working Group was established in 2016 to facilitate citizen science research and promote citizen science as an effective method in advancing biodiversity conservation. *Conservation Technology: The Conservation Technology Working Group was established in 2016 to promote and facilitate discussion, collaboration, and use of different and new technologies that can be used in conservation.

Best of Championship Wrestling) is an hour-long show, that was the Sunday evening edition of TBS' Saturday night wrestling shows, Georgia Championship Wrestling and NWA World Championship Wrestling. The rights to Best of World Championship Wrestling now belong to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). Early years Best of World Championship Wrestling began in the 1970s to complement GCW, which by 1984 had been renamed World Championship Wrestling. It became inactive shortly after Vince McMahon bought GCW on July 14, 1984 (a.k.a. Black Saturday). When McMahon sold the Saturday Night time slot to Jim Crockett Promotions, the Sunday edition of World Championship Wrestling was resurrected, first as Best of Championship Wrestling and later as Best of World Championship Wrestling. However, airings of Sunday editions became infrequent due to TBS' coverage of the Atlanta Braves and the Atlanta Hawks. Format BoWCW's format was essentially a magazine format, mainly featuring re-caps of matches which had previously aired on other related programming. In addition, Bill Apter, then of Pro Wrestling Illustrated, had a sit-down interview segment called the PWI Scouting Report. During the show's GCW years, the show was hosted solo by Freddie Miller. During the show's JCP years, it was hosted solo by Tony Schiavone. Notable angles One of the most-remembered wrestling angles to air on this show was the announcement of then-NWA president Bob Geigel stripping Magnum T.A. of the NWA U.S. Heavyweight Title for \\"conduct unbecoming a champion\\" due to Magnum clotheslining Geigel after Geigel reprimanded him for an attack on Nikita Koloff. This set up the famous \\"best- of-seven\\" wrestling series to fill the title vacancy. Koloff defeated Magnum 4-3 to win the vacant title. Cancellation In early 1988, Ted Turner expressed interest in a new Sunday evening wrestling show which featured original matches. Turner got his wish when NWA Main Event debuted to strong ratings. In November 1988, Jim Crockett Promotions was sold to Turner, who renamed the organization World Championship Wrestling.

Born in Tehran, he moved to California at the age of six during the height of the Iranian revolution. He attended high school in La Habra, California, where he met the other members of Zebrahead. Background Before joining Zebrahead, Tabatabaee was a pre-med student at UC Irvine majoring in Biology and minoring in Theater. After graduating, he decided to take a year off from school to take the MCAT and to apply to medical school. It was during this time that he started singing with the other members of Zebrahead. After a year away from school he was accepted into the University of Chicago Medical School. However, due to Zebrahead's early success, he deferred acceptance for one year. \\"I didn't expect music to go anywhere. I thought I'd do it for a year and then I'd leave, and in a week's period, I got an acceptance to med school and we were supposed to do a showcase and the label was going to fly us to New York and I had to tell the school; they wanted to know. So I deferred for a year and then decided that I didn't want to go back after a year.... I think [music is] the ultimate way to express culture. To do that for a living? Everybody should aspire to do that.\\" Tabatabaee cites some of his favorite bands as A Tribe Called Quest, System of a Down, and N.W.A.. In 1999, while on the Warped Tour, Tabatabaee was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Disease, a type of cancer, which he underwent chemo therapy and radiation therapy to cure. While being treated, he continued to work with his bandmates in writing songs for their album, Playmate of the Year, and a few months before the album's release, he completed his therapy. He claims that because of what he was going through, some of the songs from that album are very special to him. Career He is featured on the Reel Big Fish DVD You're All In This Together on the song \\"Unity\\" (originally by Operation Ivy).

It was signed on 11 May 1867 in the aftermath of the Austro-Prussian War and the Luxembourg Crisis. It had wide-reaching consequences for Luxembourg and for relations among Europe's Great Powers.Amry Vandenbosch, \\"The Luxembourg Affair\\" in her Dutch Foreign Policy Since 1815 (1959) pp 57-69 excerpt. Effects The immediate effect of the treaty, established in Article I, was the reaffirmation of the personal union between the Netherlands and Luxembourg under the House of Orange-Nassau.Treaty of London, Article I It lasted until 1890, when Wilhelmina ascended the Dutch throne. As a form of agnatic succession was then in effect in Luxembourg (under the Nassau Family Pact of 1783), the Grand Duchy could not pass in the female line. Instead it was the older branch of the House of Nassau (Nassau-Weilburg, now called Luxembourg- Nassau) that inherited that dignity, giving Luxembourg its own exclusive dynasty. The Luxembourg Crisis had erupted after French Emperor Napoleon III attempted to buy Luxembourg from the Dutch King William III. Consequently, maintaining Dutch dominance over the de jure independent Luxembourg, free from French interference, was of paramount importance to Prussia. The neutrality of Luxembourg, established by the First Treaty of London, was also reaffirmed. The parties that did not sign the earlier treaty were to become guarantors of Luxembourg's neutrality (an exception was Belgium, which was, itself, bound to neutrality).Treaty of London, Article II To ensure Luxembourg's neutrality, the (westward) fortifications of Luxembourg City, known as the \\"Gibraltar of the North\\", were to be demolished and never to be rebuilt.Treaty of London, Article V To the east, the city was protected by a deep river valley and medieval fortifications that still exist. Dismantling the westward and underground fortifications took sixteen years at a cost of 1.5 million gold francs and required the destruction of over of underground defences and of casemates, batteries, barracks, etc.World Heritage List - Luxembourg. UNESCO, 1 October 1993. Retrieved on 2 July 2006. The still very large residual fortifications of Luxembourg City are now part of the World Heritage List of the UNESCO. Furthermore, the Prussian garrison, which had been sited in Luxembourg since 1815 in accordance with the decisions of the Congress of Vienna, was to be withdrawn.Treaty of London, Article IV The Austro-Prussian War had led to the collapse of the German Confederation. Two former members, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and the Duchy of Limburg, had the Dutch king as their head of state (as Grand Duke of Luxembourg and Duke of Limburg). To clarify the position in the wake of the death of the Confederation further, the Treaty of London affirmed the end of the Confederation and stated that Limburg was henceforth to be considered with all its \\"territories\\" an \\"integral part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands\\".Treaty of London, Article VI The independent Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, still linked to the Netherlands by a personal union, would rejoin the newly re-established German customs union, the Zollverein, in which it would remain until 1 January 1919, long after the personal union had ended (1890). Signatories The treaty was signed by representatives of all of the Great Powers of Europe:See the text in R. B.

The treaty did not directly affect Italy in any appreciable manner, as she had little relation to Luxembourg. However, it marked the first occasion on which Italy was invited to partake in an international conference on the basis of being a Great Power, and, therefore, was of symbolic value to the fledgling Italian kingdom.

WaveCast history Cool lived in the Midwest before moving to California in the mid-1980s. Once in California, he picked up surfing and decided to fill the void of information that could accurately and affordably predict surf conditions to maximize quality time while surfing.WetSand author bio, www.wavecast.com/guide/author.shtml In the late 1990s, Cool founded his initial forecasting service WaveCast. Combining his engineering skills and ocean wave principles, he developed an accurate method for forecasting surfing conditions that is still in use today.WetSand.com, SoCal, NCal, CCal, and Central America reports Cool's approach brought the latest technology on the Internet into the hands of many surfers. Starting as a pay service, WaveCast quickly became a popular forecasting service for Southern California, providing members with inexpensive, accurate forecasts,Marc Kent, Surf Talk Radio Network, interview June 1999 and received accolades throughout various local media including Marc Kent's Let's Talk Surfing. The pay-per-view model that the original WaveCast service provided was kept information away from many surfers who could not afford the subscription. Cool eventually teamed with WetSand, a new portal for the surfing community. The business model was conducive to providing free forecasts, and the combined expertise brought the availability of demographic expansion while placing crucial information regarding coastal conditions to surfers around the globe. Forecasting achievements During the El Ni√±o weather inclemency of 1997 and 1998, when Internet WAM models were still in their infancy, and of questionable reliability after 60 hours, Nathan forewarned that an ominous system could be headed to the California coast, bringing with it surf that could reach over in Southern California. The Port Authority at Port San Luis released its boats, paying heed to Nathan's forecast, and was honored to receive an email of thanks from the Port Authority for his accurate predictions and early warning calculations. In recent times, Cool has given fair warning to areas of Central America for damaging surf from unusually large southern hemisphere storms, in particular, one that formed under Easter Island with seas that brought over waves to beaches in Costa Rica, and larger surf around Peru. Along with these storm forecasts, Cool has also provided seasonal forecasts, including a \\"State of our Surf\\" report.Los Angeles Daily News, June 3, 2006, \\"Summer's looking swell for LA\\" Cool has designed and develop unique automation software that can predict wind and wave height information worldwide.

Although the shape of most fire helmets has changed little over the years, their composition has evolved from traditional leather to metals (including brass, nickel and aluminum), to composite helmets constructed of lightweight polymers and other plastics. Leather helmets Example of stovepipe fire hat The original American fire helmet was created by a New York City luggage maker who was also a volunteer fireman in the 1830s, seeking a better design more tailored to the unique requirements for firefighting than the \\"stovepipe\\" \\"helmets\\" then in use. Stovepipe was essentially a top hat made of stiff leather with painted design to identify fire company and provided no protection.http://www.firemuseumcanada.com/fire-helmets/Leather was chosen as the preferred material both because it was what the man, Henry Gratacap, was familiar with, but also because thick treated leather was flame-resistant and highly resistant to breaking apart. Leatherhead is a term for evolutions of these leather helmets still used by many firefighters in North America. Leatherhead is also slang for a firefighter who uses a leather helmet as opposed to more modern composite helmets. The leather helmet is an international symbol of firefighters dating to the early years of organized civilian firefighting. Leatherhead helmet Typically, traditional leather helmets have a brass eagle adornment affixed to the helmet's top front of the helmet to secure a leather shield to the helmet front, though on the original design it also served as a glass-breaking device. Leather helmets have fallen into disuse, only seeing use in some fire departments in North America, such as New York and Houston. Canadian fire departments (e.g. Toronto Fire Services) that use the Leatherhead have a beaver in place of the eagle for the brass adornment. Such leather helmets, as well as modern derivatives that retain the classic shape but use lighter, more modern composite materials, remain very popular in North America and around the world in places that derive their firefighting traditions from North America. =Brass eagle and beaver= The eagle's origins can be traced to approximately 1825. An unknown sculptor created a commemorative figure for a volunteer firefighter's grave. Firefighters did not wear eagles before that, but eagles became associated with fire helmets ever since. Canadian firefighters adorn their helmets with the beaver because it's Canada's national animal. These ornaments protrude from the helmet and can catch on window sashes, wires and other obstacles, frequently leading to damage. As a result, many fire departments provide traditional helmets using modern plastic and composite helmets without eagles or beavers, jokingly referred to as salad bowls, turtle shells and slick tops due to their streamlined shape. However, many firefighters and fire departments still retain the leather helmet as a matter of tradition. Early respirators Dr√§ger smoke helmet, German fire service museum =Tyndall's hood= In 1871, British physicist John Tyndall wrote about his new invention, a fireman's respirator, featuring a valve chamber and filter tube. This device used cotton saturated with glycerin, lime and charcoal to filter smoke particles and neutralize carbonic acid. The device was featured in the July 1875 issue of Manufacturer and Builder. =Neally's smoke-excluding mask= George Neally patented a smoke-excluding mask in 1877 that he marketed to fire departments. This device featured a face mask with glass eyepieces and rubber tubes, allowing respiration through a filter carried on the chest. =Merriman's smoke mask= A Denver firefighter known as Merriman invented an early hose mask that was featured in the January 7, 1892 issue of Fireman's Herald. This respirator featured a tube like that of an elephant trunk connected to an air hose that ran parallel to the firefighter's water hose. =Loeb respirator= Bernhard Loeb of Berlin patented a respirator (US patent #533854) in 1895 that featured a triple-chambered canister carried on the waist that contained liquid chemicals, granulated charcoal and wadding. This respirator was used by the Brooklyn Fire Department. =Dr√§ger smoke helmet= Invented in 1903 by Dr√§ger & Gerling of L√ºbeck, Germany, the smoke helmet was a fully enclosed metal helmet with glass face mask, featuring two breathing bags covered by a leather flap worn over the chest. This respirator became so critical to mine rescue operations that rescue workers became known as draegermen. Metal helmets A traditional metal firefighting helmet from Arlington County, Virginia, c. 1974 =Napoleonic helmets= Napoleon Bonaparte reordered the various fire fighting organisations in Paris (and later other cities) into a unit of the French Army called the Sapeurs- pompiers. They wore a brass helmet with a high central crest, similar to that worn by dragoon cavalry, with a frontal plate on which a badge representing their city was embossed.Haythornthwaite, Philip (1988), Napoleon's Specialist Troops Osprey Books, (p. 19) This style of helmet was widely copied across Europe and beyond. =Merryweather helmet= Merryweather helmets were used by British fire brigades from the Victorian era until well into the 20th century. These helmets were modelled on the helmets of the Sapeurs-pompiers which Captain Sir Eyre Massey Shaw had seen on a visit to Paris and introduced to the Metropolitan Fire Brigade in London in 1868, replacing a black leather helmet. The design was widely copied by other British and British Empire fire services.Blackstone, Geoffrey Vaughan (1957), A History of the British Fire Service, Routledge (p. 178) These helmets were made of brass, but those belonging to officers were silver plated. Metal helmets are conductive, a safety hazard as use of electricity became widespread, so a new helmet made from a composite of cork and rubber was introduced in London and elsewhere from 1936. However, during World War II, military-style steel helmets were adopted, similar to the Brodie helmet used by the British Army, to improve protection during air raids. A composite helmet was reintroduced after the end of the war. Traditional brass helmets remained in service in Queensland, Australia until 1970.Bowden, Bradley (2008), Against All Odds: The History of the United Firefighters Union in Queensland: 1917-2008, Federation Press, (p. 6) =Aluminium helmets= Some departments, such as the Buffalo Fire Department for example, used aluminium helmets up to the mid-1980s. =German DIN fire helmet= In Germany, many fire brigades still use the old German DIN fire helmet. Early on, this helmet was simply an aluminium alloy version of the M1942 Stahlhelm used by the Wehrmacht, standardized in 1956 and normed in 1964 by DIN 14940. The material was AL-CU-MG, normed by DIN 1725. At about 800 g, it was lighter than most fire fighting helmets. The color was Wehrmacht black in the beginning or red in Bavaria. The norming process of the 1960s changed color to a fluorescent lime yellow. This helmet uses a white reflecting stripe and black leather neck protection. Most fire brigades use this helmet with an easily mountable visor. The German DIN fire helmet does not correspond to the currently valid European EN 443 standard for fire helmets due to its conductivity. German fire brigades are allowed to use existing aluminum DIN fire helmets, but if new helmets are necessary, firefighters must purchase either composite or a newly developed version of the old helmet with EN 443-compatible coating. At about 900 g, coated aluminum helmets are still relatively lightweight. Some manufacturers currently produce fire helmets constructed of glass fibre reinforced plastic, replicating the look of old German DIN fire helmets. However, it is not uncommon that fire brigades move to modern helmets like the F1. File:Basel 2012-10-14 Batch (15).JPGAn early 19th century French fire commander's helmet, on display in Basle.

Such helmets were designed to provide a more modern, sleeker look, and lighter weight compared to the traditional American helmet design, while retaining the distinctive profile. If desired, a face shield can be attached to the front. This helmet type is worn in the United States and Canada, as well as the United Kingdom, Australia and parts of Asia (notably Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and Guangzhou). Newer \\"Metro\\" helmets (the name given by several leading helmet manufacturers) with smaller brims and rounded edges are also much lighter than both leather and composite traditional helmets. However, designs which emulate the original New York-style American helmet design persist due to their continuing effectiveness and a general preference towards tradition or traditional appearance, and remain widely popular in both leather and composite. North American manufacturers continue to make both styles in parallel. =Urban rescue helmet= These helmets are used for urban search and rescue, technical rescue, and medical rescue applications and are shaped differently from traditional fire helmets. Most designs are derived from them, but feature a lower profile and elimination of excess protective area to facilitate better freedom of movement for the head in confined spaces. Those derived from North American-style helmets often appear to be similar to a commercial hard hat, while those derived from European styles such as the MSA Gallet F2 appear more similar to rock climbing helmets. As they are made from the same materials, these types of helmet often carry the same flame, impact and heat resistance standards that their larger counterparts do, and still offer mostly seamless compatibility with SCBAs. Helmet colors British Royal Navy firefighters with yellow helmets In some countries, most notably the United States and other Anglophone countries, the firefighter's helmet color often denotes the wearer's rank or position. In Britain, most firefighters wear yellow helmets; watch managers (two grades above a regular firefighter) and above wear white helmets. Rank is further indicated by black stripes around the helmets. In Canada, regular firefighters wear yellow or black; captains (two grades above regular) are in red and senior command officers in white. Likewise in the United States, red helmets denote company officers (one or two grades above regular), while white helmets denote chief officers (three or more grades above regular). However the specific meaning of a helmet's color or style varies from region to region and department to department. One noteworthy example is the Los Angeles County Fire Department's use of MSA Safety \\"Topgard\\" Helmets depicted in the 1970s television series Emergency!. Firefighters used all black with colored company numbers on the shield below the \\"L.A. County\\" in blue on the top half. Engine and squad companies used white numbers, with paramedics switching to green and a two-color \\"paramedic\\" decal later affixed to either side of the helmet. Truck companies used red numbers. Captains' helmets were black with a white stripe down the helmet's center ridge, and the numeric shield portion in white. Battalion Chiefs helmets were solid white with black numbers These helmets have since been discontinued in favor of a more modern style using bright yellow, orange, and red, among other colors to denote rank, though the colored number panels persist. This particular setup has been copied by a number of other California fire services. Another example is the San Francisco Fire Department. Engine company helmets are typically all black; truck company helmets are black with alternating red and white quarters on the helmet dome. Most other fire services in the United States and Canada simply use either black or yellow for most firefighters and white for commanders, with some using red for denoting unit leaders. The South Australian Country Fire Service, as with many Australian fire services, use specific colors for specific roles. White helmets are for firefighters (with a red stripe for senior firefighters). Lieutenants have yellow helmets; captains have yellow with a red stripe, deputy group officers and above have red helmets while paid staff have a blue stripe on their helmet. In New Zealand, helmet colours were changed in 2013 to assist with identification of the command structure at a large multi-agency incident. Firefighters wear yellow helmets, plain for a base-rank firefighter, with one red stripe for a qualified firefighter, and with two red stripes for a senior firefighter. Station officers wear red helmets with one blue stripe (previously yellow with one blue stripe), while senior station officers wear red helmets with two blue stripes (previously yellow with two blue stripes). Chief fire officers and their deputies wear white helmets; regional and area commanders and their assistants wear silver helmets; and the national commander and their deputies wear black helmets. Trainee and recruit firefighters wear fluro-green helmets (previously red). In Germany lime-yellow phosphorescent helmets are commonly used. Different colours, which indicate different ranks, are rarely used.http://www.feuerwehr- huerth.de/index.php/technik/helmfarben But it is common to use different kind of identification markings on the helmets. As fire service is mainly organized by the different federal states and in the end is the responsibility of the different communities, there is no standard kind of identification markings for helmets. In Bavaria for example the \\"Kommandant\\" (elected fire chief) is marked with a red vertical stripe on the helmet and the ‚ÄúGruppenf√ºhrer‚Äù (group leaders) with thin black rubber bands around the helmets.Staatliche Feuerwehrschule W√ºrzburg. \\"Merkblatt: Kennzeichnung der Dienstkleidungstr√§ger der Feuerwehren in Bayern\\", pp. 16/17, \\"http://www.sfs-w.de\\", 7th modified edition, Status 11/2009. It is also quite common to use helmet markings for different possible functions like medic or SCBA. While identification markings according to the rank on the helmet are permanent, officers and sub-officers usually wear coloured vests over their bunker-gear in order to indicate their currently carried leading-position.

The area has preserved much of its medieval street plan and many Reformation-era buildings. Together with the 18th/19th-century New Town, it forms part of a protected UNESCO World Heritage Site. Royal Mile The \\"Royal Mile\\" is a name coined in the early 20th century for the main street of the Old Town which runs on a downwards slope from Edinburgh Castle to Holyrood Palace and the ruined Holyrood Abbey. Narrow closes (alleyways), often no more than a few feet wide, lead steeply downhill to both north and south of the main spine which runs west to east. Significant buildings in the Old Town include St. Giles' Cathedral, the General Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland, the National Museum of Scotland, the Old College of the University of Edinburgh and the Scottish Parliament Building. The area contains underground vaults and hidden passages that are relics of previous phases of construction. No part of the street is officially called The Royal Mile in terms of legal addresses. The actual street names (running west to east) are Castlehill, Lawnmarket, High Street, Canongate and Abbey Strand. Street layout The street layout, typical of the old quarters of many northern European cities, is made especially picturesque in Edinburgh, where the castle perches on top of a rocky crag, the remnants of an extinct volcano, and the main street runs down the crest of a ridge from it. This \\"crag and tail\\" landform was created during the last ice age when receding glaciers scoured across the land pushing soft soil aside but being split by harder crags of volcanic rock. The hilltop crag was the earliest part of the city to develop, becoming fortified and eventually developing into the current Edinburgh Castle. The rest of the city grew slowly down the tail of land from the Castle Rock. This was an easily defended spot with marshland on the south and a man-made loch, the Nor Loch, on the north. Access to the town was restricted by means of various gates (called ports) in the city walls, of which only fragmentary sections remain. The original strong linear spine of the Royal Mile only had narrow closes and wynds leading off its sides. These began to be supplemented from the late 18th century with wide new north‚Äìsouth routes, beginning with the North Bridge/South Bridge route, and then George IV Bridge. These rectilinear forms were complemented from the mid-19th century with more serpentine forms, starting with Cockburn Street, laid out by Peddie and Kinnear in 1856, which specifically improved access between the Royal Mile and the newly rebuilt Waverley Station. The Edinburgh City Improvement Act of 1866 further added to the north south routes. This was devised by the architects David Cousin and John Lessels.Edinburgh: Mapping the City by Christopher Fleet and Danial MacCannell It had quite radical effects: *St Mary's Wynd was demolished and replaced by the much wider St Mary's Street with all new buildings. *Leith Wynd which descended from the High Street to the Low Calton was demolished. Jeffrey Street started from Leith Wynd's junction with the High Street, opposite St Mary's Street, but bent west on arches to join Market Street. *East Market Street was built to connect Market Street and New Street. *Blackfriars Street was created by the widening of Blackfriars Wynd, removing all the buildings on the east side. *Chambers Street was created, replacing N College Street and removing Brown Square (west) and Adam Square (east). It was named after the then Lord Provost of Edinburgh, Sir William Chambers, and his statue placed at its centre. *Guthrie Street was created, linking the new Chambers Street to the Cowgate. Sections Image of the Old Town from Calton Hill taken from page 179 of 'Edinburgh: Picturesque Notes' (1896) by Robert Louis Stevenson. Etchings by A. Brunet-Debaines from drawings by S. Bough and W. E. Lockhart. In addition to the Royal Mile, the Old Town may be divided into various areas, namely from west to east: * West Port, the old route out of Edinburgh to the west * Grassmarket, the area to the south-west * Edinburgh Castle * The Cowgate, the lower southern section of the town * Canongate, a name correctly applied to the whole eastern district * Holyrood, the area containing Holyrood Palace and Holyrood Abbey * Croft-An-Righ, a group of buildings north-east of Holyrood Residential buildings Buildings in the High Street Due to the space restrictions imposed by the narrowness of the \\"tail\\", and the advantages of living within the defensive wall, the Old Town became home to some of the world's earliest \\"high rise\\" residential buildings. Multi-storey dwellings became the norm from the 16th century onwards. Many of these buildings were destroyed in the Great Fire of Edinburgh in 1824; the rebuilding of these on the original foundations led to changes in the ground level and the creation of numerous passages and vaults under the Old Town. The construction of new streets including North Bridge and South Bridge in the 18th century also created underground spaces, such as the Edinburgh Vaults below the latter. Traditionally buildings were less dense in the eastern, Canongate, section. This area underwent major slum clearance and reconstruction in the 1950s, thereafter becoming an area largely of Council housing. From 1990 to 2010, major new housing schemes appeared throughout the Canongate. These were built to a much higher scale than the older buildings and have greatly increased the population of the area. Major events A replica gas lamp in the Old Town In 1824 a major fire, the Great Fire of Edinburgh, destroyed most of the buildings on the south side of the High Street section between St. Giles Cathedral and the Tron Kirk. During the Edinburgh International Festival the High Street and Hunter Square become gathering points where performers in the Fringe advertise their shows, often through street performances. On 7 December 2002, the Cowgate fire destroyed a small but dense group of old buildings on the Cowgate and South Bridge. It destroyed the famous comedy club, The Gilded Balloon, and much of the Informatics Department of the University of Edinburgh, including the comprehensive artificial intelligence library. The site was redeveloped 2013-2014 with a single new building, largely in hotel use. Old Town Renewal Trust In the 1990s the Old Town Renewal Trust in conjunction with the City of Edinburgh developed an action plan for renewal Proposed Development The Jeffrey Street arches which were redeveloped in 2015 An area directly to the north of the Canongate has been earmarked for a large redevelopment project named Caltongate. The scheme involves building of a mix of residential, hotel, retail and office buildings on the site of the former SMT bus depot in New Street, developing the arches under Jeffrey Street, redeveloping other surrounding sites and creating a pedestrian link from the Royal Mile to Calton Hill. The proposals have been criticised by commentators including the author Alexander McCall Smith and Sheila Gilmore MP who regard the modern design as incompatible with the existing older architectural styles of the Old Town and inappropriate for a UNESCO World Heritage site. The Caltongate development has also been opposed by the Cockburn Association and the Architectural Heritage Society of Scotland. The site developers Artisan Real Estate Investors have stated that the completed development will be a \\"vibrant, exciting\\" place. The plans were approved by the City of Edinburgh Council in January 2014 and construction was due to begin later in 2014.

The station was originally built to serve Portsmouth Park racecourse, opening as Farlington Race Course on 26 June 1891. On 23 July 1894, it was the scene of an accident when a brake van next to the engine hauling the 6.35pm from derailed and the first two coaches overturned. The guard on the train was killed and seven passengers were injured, one of whom seriously. The racecourse was closed during World War One, but the station was retained to serve the ammunition dump put in its place. The station closed in 1917. Re- opened in 1922 until 1927, it was used to serve the industrial estate that developed in the Railway Triangle. Under the Southern Railway, it re-opened as a general public halt in 1928 named Farlington Halt; however, this was short- lived as the station closed due to insufficient customers on 4 July 1937. The road next to the old site still retains the name Station Road and a footbridge over the railway to the industrial estate was in use for many years, but is now behind fences. When Eastern Road was built during World War II, piles were driven through the platforms, rendering it unusable thereafter. It can still be seen by passengers in trains, passing through the station. Future use According to the long-term plans on the website of Portsmouth City Council, there are plans to build a new Farlington station approximately 500 yards east of the old site near the local Sainsburys and B&M.;  References  Category:Disused railway stations in Portsmouth Category:Former London, Brighton and South Coast Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1891 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1917 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1922 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1927 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1928 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1937 ","title":"Farlington Halt railway station"},{"id":"5669726","text":"Bannewitz is a municipality in the S√§chsische Schweiz-Osterzgebirge district, in the Free State of Saxony, Germany.

The range is currently marketed in Japan, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, Iran and a number of other Asian countries, as well as in the United States. The same range has been marketed by Mitsubishi Fuso Truck of America in North America since 1985, though it was called the FE model rather than the Canter until the 2012 model year. The Canter is named after the English word describing the gait of a horse, emphasising the 'thoroughbred' nature of Mitsubishi trucks. Overview The Canter nameplate was first introduced in March 1963 for the existing T20 range of light-duty trucks. The preceding series originated with the \\"T710\\" of 1960. These early models were sold almost entirely in Asia. The Asia-Pacific was the main market for the Canter until the early 1970s. Later the series began seeing export or local manufacture in markets including Europe, the Middle-East and North America. In many markets the Canter was very expensive and was replaced by the Mitsubishi Fuso Truck when that model became available for worldwide market in the early 1980s. Australia was another important market for the Canter - to the extent that it was manufactured there from the 1970s using many local components. Most models of the truck are distinguishable by a front 'Canter' badge, but the common Mitsubishi badge is usually used on the rear. In several markets, including the United Kingdom, the Canter is sold as the \\"Fuso Canter\\" rather than as a Mitsubishi.  First generation (T720)  The very first Canter Canter was the successor of the T710 produced from 1960 through 1963. The T720 Canter had two round single headlights but the facelifted version from 1964 had a set of round twin headlights. At a payload of 2 tons it was equipped either with the KE42 gasoline engine or the 4DQ11A diesel engine.  Second generation (T90)  2nd generation T90 The second generation Canter appeared in 1968 with a 4DR1 diesel engine at and two gasoline options: the T91's KE42 was known from the first generation Canter, while long wheelbase versions (T93/97) received a 2.3-liter KE47 gasoline engine. The most common diesel version was the T90, available on a short or a long wheelbase. There was also a dual rear wheel version of the long wheelbase model with the T92 chassis code. In July 1970 a 2.7 l 4DR5 diesel option was added.  Third generation (T200)  3rd generation T200 (1976) The T200 series was structured into the diesel engined T200/T210 (4DR5, ) and the T205/215 with the 2,315 cc KE47 gasoline engine, moreover the 1,995 cc KE42 was still available. In January 1975, the gasoline engines were replaced by the 4G52 (1,995 cc; ) and 4G53 (2,384 cc;). The third generation was sold with various wheelbases and bed heights. A 3-ton payload variant was also available.  Fourth generation Canter 4th generation (wide cab) Canter 4th generation (standard cab), sold as Colt Diesel (FE114) in Indonesia Starting with the 4th generation in Japan the Canter was supplemented by variants with a 3-ton narrow cabin and 2- and 3-ton wide cabins. In February 1980, a power steering for the wide vehicles was added as an option, at the end of the same year a narrow 1.5 ton and a wide 3.5 ton followed. New direct injected diesel engines 4D30 (naturally aspirated, ) and 4D31 (turbo charged, ) were added in November 1982. According to some sources ratings of these engines were slightly higher at and , perhaps due to the use of gross ratings. In December 1983, a \\"Walk Through Van\\" with 1.5 tons and in- dash shifting completed the line-up. All weights mentioned here are payloads. European sales began in the Benelux countries in the late 1970s. About 200 of the narrow cabined fourth generation Canters had been sold there by 1980, when local assembly of a wide-bodied Canter in Belgium by importer Moorkens N V was begun on a trial basis. The Canter ended up being built in Tramagal, Portugal instead since 1980. Later in October 2004, the factory achieved a production capacity of 15,000 units per year and shift with approximately 430 employees. More than 110,000 vehicles had been produced there since then. The fourth generation Canter was mostly available with a variety of diesel engines, but a 2555 cc petrol inline-four was fitted to the FC 35 model. This is the 4G54 engine, producing .  Fifth generation  Fifth generation Mitsubishi Fuso Canter 20, pre-facelift model The fifth generation Canter appeared in October 1985. Its overall appearance was more square and smoother than the previous model, while larger, single, rectangular headlights replaced the earlier twin round units. Some export markets, such as the United States, kept using twin round headlights to meet local requirements. In the domestic Japanese market, the front \\"MMC\\" emblem was changed to the corporate three diamond logo, with an MMC emblem remaining on the passenger door. Also new was the adoption of front disc brakes on some models, while the shift lever location was changed from the column to the floor. The shifter was initially a long rod to reach the floor, but it was later moved to between the driver's and the centre seat. In July 1986 a 4WD option was added to the Canter 20 and Canter 30 series. The lightweight Canter 15 changed its name to Canter Guts (a name only used in the domestic Japanese market) in January 1987. In November 1989 the Canter underwent a facelift, with a reshaped front grill, and was also able to comply with the new 1989 vehicle emissions regulations. In June 1991 ABS brakes became available, a first for the class in the home market. At the same time, power windows became standard equipment across the board. In the North American market the Canter was available as the Mitsubishi Fuso FE (Class 3), FG (4WD version of the FE), and FH (Class 5). The FE and FG were both powered by a turbocharged and intercooled four-cylinder diesel engine with while the larger FH has a six-cylinder turbodiesel. A variety of wheelbases from were offered.  Sixth generation   Seventh generation  7th generation (2005-2009 7th generation, Model FB (2009‚Äì2012) 7th generation, tri-axle Canter The seventh generation of the Canter was introduced in Japan in June 2002, in Europe in 2005. Main goals were a modern vehicle, improved safety (new: disc brakes and Xenon head lights on some models) and comfort, e.g. the wide cabin became 20 mm higher and 100 mm lengthened to the front. For a more spacious cabin the shifting stick moved from between driver‚Äôs and passenger‚Äôs seat to the dashboard, a world-first for cab-over trucks.mitsubishi-motors.com MMC Launches New-generation Canter & Canter Guts Series, 18. Juni 2002. Until the end of production of the seventh generation the Canter was manufactured and sold in Japan without Selective catalytic reduction. In Europe the engines of the predecessor had been taken over at first, followed by Mitsubishi engines with common rail injection and finally by modern engines based on the F1C engine by FPT.mitsubishi-fuso.com Mitsubishi Fuso Unveils Advanced, New Powertrain for Light-Duty Trucks, 20. Juli 2010. Starting with the eighth generation these ‚Äúworld engines‚Äù were also utilized in Japan and around the world for all developed countries with strict exhaust gas limitation, for less developed countries a simplified seventh generation remained in production in parallel as General Export Models. In connection to the DaimlerChrysler‚ÄìMitsubishi alliance Fuso was hived off from MCC and when the alliance failed remained with Daimler (at that time DCX). Additionally continiously new scandals, i.e. concealment of issues on car safety, came up again and again.mitsubishi-fuso.com Mitsubishi Fuso Announces Radical Clean-up of Past, 14. Juni 2004. Perhaps to fence off from this past the appearance of Fuso trucks was changed gradually: The product name changed from ‚ÄúMitsubishi Canter‚Äù to ‚ÄúMitsubishi Fuso Canter‚Äù on the seventh generation and finally to ‚ÄúFuso Canter‚Äù on the eighth generation, the diamond emblem remained but changed from red to silver.  General Export Modell FE/FG  Continiously stricter exhaust gas limits resulted in raising production cost and complexity, e.g. Common rail injection and exhaust gas aftertreatment. Thus, for less developed countries simplified vehicles with the old Mitsubishi engines and manual 5-speed transmissions (the biggest engine without synchromesh for lowest and reverse gear) were introduced. These General Export Modelsmitsubishi-fuso.com Fuso General Export Modelle FE/FG base on the seventh generation Canter, engines comply to EURO II and were sold in parallel to the eighth generation til 2019. Since early 2018 they were offered in the Philippines with more modern Mitsubishi engines conforming to Euro IV.autoindustriya.com New eco-friendy Fuso Canter Euro4 trucks launched in the Philippines, 1. M√§rz 2018. In 2019 these vehicles were replaced once more by simplied variants of the eighth generation again equipped with outfashioned Mitsubishi engines (4V21) conforming to EURO IV instead of EURO VI for the FPT engines utilized on the standart eighth generation.  All-wheel drive  Two resp. three systems of all-wheel drive are available with the eighth generation: Standart (narrow) cabins have a permanent all-wheel drive. On 1.5 tons (payload) compact vehicles ground clearance remains unchanged (FD series) for legal reason, on longer or heavier narrow trucks ground clearance is improved by 100 millimetres (FG series). Canters with a wide cabin feature a part-time all-wheel drive with raised frame to improve ground clearance resp. approach angles (FG series). Since its fifth generation Fuso offered the Canter with all-wheel drive in Japan and probably some export markets. In Europe all-wheel drive became available to selected customers (Pfau in Springe/Germany, insolvent) with the seventh generation as standart (narrow) vehicles with 3.5 to 7.5 tons. For the eighth generation Pfau also offered Standart (and wide) vehicles with 5.5 to 7 tons GVW with all-wheel drive, despite the offical Canter programme only includes a 6.5 tons all-wheel drive vehicle.mitsubishi-fuso.com ‚Äì Fuso Brings 4x4 Model New Canter Light-Duty Truck To Europe for the First Time, 23.

Eighth generation  Fuso Canter 3C13, 8th generation, 3.5 tons Fuso Canter 7C18, 8th generation, 7.5 tons FUSO Canter 6C18 4x4 The eighth generation was first introduced in Japan in November 2010, sales started in Europe in 2012. At least in Europe this Canter also succeeds the Mercedes-Benz Vario since its discontinuation in 2013. The line-up includes chassis weighting from 3.5 to 8.55 tons gross with cabins 1.7 (S) or 2.0 (W) metres wide. Canters with 5 tons (gross) or less have front axles with independent suspension, selected variants are available with crew cabin (D = Double cabin). Generally, offerings depend widely on the country where done, i. e. no standart (narrow) cabins in the USA nor the U.K. and no standart (narrow) double cabins in Europe. Some bodies for the trucks are available ex works (Europe: drop-side and dumper beds, addionally in Japan: D-van (standart), D-wing and reefer boxes, skip and car carriers). The ‚Äúworld engines‚Äù ranging from 96 to 129 kW introduced in Europe with the 7th generation are now utilized worldwide paired to a manual five-speed transmission, the 6-speed Duonic¬Æ Dual-clutch transmission is an option for many variants and a PTO is available with both gearboxes. On the Eco-Hybrid a 110 kW diesel engine is combined with a 40 kW electric motorgenerator and a 2 kWh lithium-ion battery. In 2019 a new General Export Model based on the 8th generation was included to the line-up to replace the Export Modell based on the 7th generation, this is fitted with simpler 4V21 engines which are Euro IV compliant only. In late 2017, the first pure electric eCanter was delivered to its customer in New York City. This was the first time the ‚ÄúCanter‚Äù designation had been used in North America. Some 500 eCanters were planned for assambly as forrunners to be replaced by mass production starting in 2019. On October 19, 2020, Fuso introduced a facelifted version of the Canter, since then the line-up includes 1.5 ton variants to comply with the Japanese class of compact vehicles/trucks replacing the former Canter Guts. Improved engines had already been phased-in in early 2020, offered reduced fuel consumption and exhaust emissions while torque was improved and engine designation changed from 4P10 to 4P10+.  Canter Guts  FUSO Canter Guts 7th generation Gutsmitsubishi-fuso.com was the denomination for a JDM variant of the Canter in Japan from 1987 through 2008 having an extra narrow cabin and 3.5 tons gross weight (technically: max. 1.5 tons payload). In 2008 the Guts based on the 7th generation was discontinued but in January 2013 the same label was reinvented following an aggreement in late 2012 between Daimler/Fuso and Renault-Nissan to supply each other with certain products, mainly on the Japanese market. Nissan markets the Canter with 2 tons payload or more as a Nissan NT450 Atlas (H44), Fus≈ç a heavily revised variant of the Nissan NT400 (F24) with 1.5 tons payload as Canter Guts to fit the Japanese class of compact vehicles. * Payload limited to 1.5 tons, minimum is 1.2 tons depending on the variant, * width reduced to 1.69 m from 1.87 m, * height reduced to 1.99 m from 2.135 m, * max. length limited to 4.69 m instead of 4.75 to 6.25 m in Europe, * ZD30 engine reduced to 81 kW, * manual 5-speed transmission instead of six speeds, * various bed heights including reduced tire dimensions on the (driven) rear axle. The Canter Guts is powered either by a Nissan ZD30DDTI diesel engine having 81 kW @ 2800 rpm and 276 Nm @ 1260-2800 rpm or by a petrol engine with a manual 5-speed transmission with overdrive and rear- wheel drive. Options include an automated 6-speed manual transmission and a switchable all-wheel drive with crawler. The cabin is 1.7 metres wide and a double cabin is available. As usual with the other smaller trucks it features independent front suspension. End of 2019 production of the Nissan NT400 (F24) had been ceased, in early 2020 a rebadged Isuzu Elf has been presented as the new Nissan NT400 (F25). On October 19th, 2020, Fuso launched a facelifted Canter in Japan which now includes variants conforming to the class of compact vehicles. But the Guts label appears no to be utilized any more.

In certain years there was also a medium-duty (Class 5) FH series available which essentially was a Mitsubishi Fuso Fighter Mignon which because of its cabin was grouped as a Canter for Export. In the 2000th the Canter was also sold by Sterling Trucks with \\"Sterling 360\\" badging. In the United States the 8th generation was offered as FE/FG series (class 3 to 5). Since March 2018, specifically for North America the ‚ÄúGas Truck‚Äù was created featuring the 6.0 Liter GM Vortec V8 small-block engine and an Allison Automatic. It was produced at Freightliner in Gaffney/SC, USA. The all-wheel driven FG series had been discontinued in about 2019, and on May 27, 2020, Mitsubishi Fuso Truck of America annouced to cease sales of the Canter in the USA and Canada.

Unlike its relatives, Rhynchippus had no large tusks; they were the same size and shape as the incisors. Enamel on the molars allowed it to chew tough food.Palmer et al., 1999, p.252 The genus shows similarities with Mendozahippus, Eurygenium and Pascualihippus. In 2016, a well-preserved specimen of R. equinus was described by Mart√≠nez et al. from the Sarmiento Formation in Patagonia.Mart√≠nez et al., 2016, p.7 The extraordinary preservation of the specimen allowed the researchers to appreciate the three connected spaces that constitute a heavily pneumatized middle ear; the epitympanic sinus, the tympanic cavity itself, and the ventral expansion of the tympanic cavity through the notably inflated bullae.Mart√≠nez et al., 2016, p.27  Paleoecology  Fossils of Rhynchippus have been found in various fossiliferous stratigraphic units in South America, all restricted to the Deseadan South American land mammal age. Several specimens come from the Sarmiento Formation in the Golfo San Jorge Basin in southern Patagonia, with other finds from the Petaca Formation of the Subandean Belt in Bolivia, the Salla Formation from the same country, and the Trememb√© Formation of the Taubat√© Basin in eastern Brazil. The Sarmiento and Salla Formations have provided a rich assemblage of many mammals and terror birds, as Physornis. The faunal assemblage of Rhynchippus fossil locations also constitutes several crocodylians, snakes (Madtsoia), helmeted bull frogs, a catfish; Taubateia paraiba, and the caiman Caiman tremembensis. The Trememb√© Formation is known for the preservation of several insects.

It is situated 21 km southeast of Karlsruhe, and 14 km west of Pforzheim.  Municipality arrangement  The municipality Straubenhardt consists of the former municipalities Conweiler, Feldrennach, Langenalb, Ottenhausen and Schwann. Conweiler, Feldrennach, Ottenhausen and Schwann were part of W√ºrttemberg, while Langenalb was part of Baden. Only the respective villages belonged to the former municipalities Conweiler and Schwann. The former municipality Feldrennach consisted of the villages Feldrennach and Pfinzweiler as well as the houses Hasenstock-S√§gm√ºhle. The former municipality Langenalb was composed of the village Langenalb and the houses Bitzenh√ºhlers√§gm√ºhle, Br√ºckless√§gm√ºhle, Dampfs√§gm√ºhle, the dwellings Feldrennachers√§gm√ºhle, Heinzens√§gm√ºhle as well as Maisenm√ºhle. The municipality Ottenhausen was formed by the village Ottenhausen, the weekend community Hardthof and the houses Hochm√ºhle. Despite initial plans to also incorporate the village Dennach, on whose premises the name-giving fortress Straubenhardt was located, these plans were scrapped last minute and Dennach was awarded to Neuenb√ºrg.Pforzheim und der Enzkreis Werner Burckhart, Hermann Wahl, Hans Schleuning, Theiss, 1976 Ottenhausen absorbed the hamlet Rudmersbach which was mentioned initially in 1292 as 'Rutmerspach'Das Land Baden-W√ºrttemberg. Amtliche Beschreibung nach Kreisen und Gemeinden. Band V: Regierungsbezirk Karlsruhe Kohlhammer, Stuttgart 1976, . S. 578‚Äì580  History  Stone with coat of arms for all subdivisions Around the year 1000 the Counts of Calw had a fortress built near today's village of Neuenb√ºrg-Dennach. The fortress was called Straubenhardt after the inhospitable area (Alemannic: \\"Struben Hardt\\" - rough forest). The castellan soon took on the name of the fortress. Starting 1320 the castle and its surrounding areas came increasingly under the domination of the House of W√ºrttemberg. The Schmalensteiners who were related by marriage to the Lords of Straubenhardt and who also lived at the fortress, therefore joined a Federation of the Knights under the leadership of Wolf von Eberstein. In 1367 the Federation of the Knights committed an assault on Count Eberhard II of W√ºrttemberg while he was staying in Wildbad.Wildbad und seine Umgebungen Sonnewald, 1860 It is not clear whether this happened at the present Bad Wildbad or at Bad Teinach. However, the description of his escape route indicated that it indeed happened at today's Bad Wildbad.Das Wildbad im k√∂nigreich W√ºrttemberg Justinus Andreas Christian Kerner, 1839 The Count was able to flee to the fortress Zavelstein. In retaliation, and due to further differences, Count Eberhard II occupied the fortress Straubenhardt sometime between 1374 and 1381 and had it destroyed.Als die W√§lder auf Reisen gingen Max Scheifele, B√ºrgermeisteramt Dobel, 1968 After the destruction of their fortress the nobles of Straubenhardt moved their residence to Schwann and built a castle there. Schwann was the center of an administrative district and jurisdiction of the nobles of Straubenhardt and the family of Schmalenstein. The family Straubenhardt became extinct in 1442 and the sovereignty of the properties slowly moved towards W√ºrttemberg and Baden. It is suspected that the nobles of Straubenhardt initiated the foundation of the villages Conweiler, Feldrennach, Langenalb, Schwann as well as Arnbach, Dennach, Dobel, Neusatz and Rotensol.Dobel, ein aufbl√ºhender Kurort im n√∂rdlichen Schwarzwald G. Braun, 1996 The discovery of a relief of the hunting goddess Diana, found in the wall of the rectory of Ottenhausen, indicates an early Roman settlement in this area. Ottenhausen which consists of the older village Rudmersbach and the newer part Ottenhausen was first documentary mentioned in 1262 with the name 'Rutmerspach'. Pfinzweiler which was mentioned in 1328 as hamlet 'uff dr Pfinz' was abandoned during the Thirty Years' War. The reestablishment of Pfinzweiler in 1713 can be traced back to 7 citizens of Feldrennach and one person from Conweiler. On December 1, 1973, today's municipality Straubenhardt was created by the merger of the municipalities Conweiler, Schwann, Pfinzweiler-Feldrennach. On January 1, 1974 Ottenhausen joined Straubenhardt by a voluntary agreement and on January 1, 1975 Langenalb was incorporated by the order of the Baden-Wuerttemberg Municipal Reform Act . By nomenclature and adoption of the Straubenhardt coat of arms the historical connection to the earlier nobles of Straubenhardt was restored. = Coat of Arms of all Subdivisions = File:Wappen Conweiler.svgConweiler File:Wappen Feldrennach - Pfinzweiler.svgFeldrennach & Pfinzweiler File:Wappen Langenalb.pngLangenalb File:Wappen Ottenhausen.png Ottenhausen File:Wappen Schwann.svgSchwann = Mayors = Until the year 1973 each of the five formerly independent subdivisions elected their own mayor. * 1974 to 1991: Walter Weissinger (SPD) * since 1991: Willi Rutschmann (CDU) = Municipal Council = The municipal elections in Straubenhardt on June 7, 2009 resulted in the following distribution of seats: { cellpadding=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:33%; background:#e3e3e3; border-spacing:1px; white-space:nowrap;\\" - align=\\"right\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"   align=\\"left\\"  CDU  27,5%  ‚àí3,2  5 Seats  ‚àí1 - align=\\"right\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"   align=\\"left\\"  SPD  28,7%  ‚àí1,5  5 Seats  ¬±0 - align=\\"right\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"   align=\\"left\\"  FW  25,1%  ‚àí0,4  5 Seats  ¬±0 - align=\\"right\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Gr√ºne Liste  18,7%  +18,7  3 Seats  +3 } References  External links  * Official website of the municipality Straubenhardt * Official website of the Enz district - Straubenhardt * Official website of the Enz district - Neuenb√ºrg * Official website of Neuenb√ºrg Category:Enzkreis ","title":"Straubenhardt"},{"id":"5669817","title":"Lovin' You's a Dirty Job"},{"id":"5669829","text":"Peter Yanowitz (born September 13, 1967, Chicago, Illinois, United States), also known as Pedro Yanowitz, is an American musician, songwriter, and visual artist.

It is situated at the foot of the Swabian Alps and near the big cities of Reutlingen and Stuttgart. Although it has a considerable population with around 10,800 inhabitants, its structure is considered to be more the one of a village. The most important annual events include the Dorffest, the village festivity, the Kr√§merfest, and the Weihnachtsmarkt (the Christmas market). Eningen is surrounded by free-standing hills of the Achalm and the Swabian Alps with landscape full of dark green forests and cliffs. This makes volksmarching, hiking and biking popular. History The founding of Eningen is considered to be in the year 1090, through the contract of Bempflingen. At that time, Eningen was only a little village and its destiny was connected with the interests of the church and nobility. Although the village had grown steadily, until the Thirty Years' War, to a stately municipality inhabited by at least 1,300 inhabitants, Eningen was almost completely destroyed as a result of this devastating war. After the war, the municipality started to recover itself, albeit slowly. Over the years, Eningen developed into a major dealer community and has distinguished itself into this day therefore from all the other typical rural villages of the Swabian Alb. In 1843, Eningen had more than 5000 inhabitants and was considered to be \\"most beautiful and most populous village in the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg\\". After the Second World War (1945‚Äì1949) Eningen was considered a village and belonged to the city of Reutlingen but it could recover fast its traditional independence. Meanwhile, a lot has been done in this place: new roads and construction sites have been opened, it has got water supply from the Lake of Constance and different industries have established there. In 1970, Eningen was awarded with a ‚Äúrecreation and health locality recognition‚Äù. Today, Eningen counts with an area of approximately 2316 ha; 848 ha among of those are forest or green area. Administratively is Eningen a municipality of the county of Reutlingen which is assigned to the district of T√ºbingen in Baden W√ºrttemberg. In addition, Eningen counts nowadays with 10 889 inhabitants (as of 05/31/2009). Infrastructure Being a municipality, Eningen has its own town hall and also its own post and police offices. Although Eningen is considered to have the structure of a village, it possesses a wide service infrastructure: two pharmacies, two banks, one public library, one festival hall, one public outdoor swimming pool and more of five parks where people can go to walk and enjoy the nature or children can go to play. Furthermore, Eningen‚Äôs educational infrastructure is represented by nine kindergartens, two primary schools, one music school and an adult education center. Regarding to transportation infrastructure, Eningen possesses two different bus connections to Reutlingen, as well as one bus connection to several villages of the Swabian Mountains and one connection to Metzingen. In matters of sport‚Äôs infrastructure, Eningen has three sports halls, one sports field, one complex with several tennis fields, one horseback riding field and a one mini golf course. It is home to many companies including VIAVI Solutions, which was formally known as JDSU and prior to that Wandel & Goltermann. The artist Gudrun Kr√ºger lived in Eningen for most of her working life. Eningen is twinned with the town of Calne in Wiltshire, England.

She was a member of the South Australian Legislative Council from 1993 to 2009, first elected for the Australian Democrats for an eight-year term at the 1993 election and was re-elected for the Democrats for another eight-year term at the 2002 election. Kanck announced her parliamentary resignation in November 2008, taking effect in January 2009. Democrats nominee David Winderlich filled the upper house casual vacancy in a joint sitting of the Parliament of South Australia in February 2009.Sandra Kanck: SA ParliamentDavid Winderlich: SA Parliament Early life Sandra Kanck (n√©e Cederblad) was born in Broken Hill, New South Wales with six younger siblings and she credits the associated financial poverty and her Methodist Church upbringing to many of her views about inequality and injustice. She was a primary school teacher in NSW from 1978‚Äì80, teaching at Gillieston and Weston Primary Schools in the Hunter Valley. Early politics In 1971 she attended her first public meeting to express concern at nuclear weapons testing by the French at Muroroa Atoll. From this point onwards she became involved in the anti-nuclear and then peace and environment movements. From 1991-92 she was employed by the Conservation Council of South Australia as Administrative Assistant and then Administrative Officer. Continuing her anti-nuclear activism, in 2009, she authored, on behalf of the Australian Democrats (SA Division Inc.) a substantial submission in response to the Draft Environmental Impact Statement on the proposed Olympic Dam mine expansion. Parliament First elected at the 1993 election, Kanck's first speech in parliament was about the need for an environmentally sustainable level of population for Australia, and her first private member's bill was about the choosing and ongoing education of judges. Kanck twice introduced a bill for a Midwives Act, and during the course of debate on the Nurses Act 1999 fought hard and successfully to retain a register of midwives separate from that of nurses. For her advocacy the SA Branch of the Australian College of Midwives chose her for their inaugural Midwifery Advocate of the Year Award in 1999. On 14 March 2001 Kanck introduced her Dignity in Dying Bill 2001 to the South Australian Parliament. The bill was drafted in large part by the South Australian Voluntary Euthanasia Society (SAVES),Dignity in Dying Bill, SA Democrats: 14/3/2001. of which she has since been awarded life membership. She introduced the bill twice, and on the second occasion it passed the second reading vote, but failed at the third reading.

The so- called Mullighan Inquiry into the sexual abuse of children on the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunyjatjara Lands made 46 recommendations for action. Kanck's amendments required the government to respond within 3 months to indicate which of the recommendations they would implement, and then to table an annual report about that implementation for every year for the following five years after receipt of the report, a first in terms of causing action on a government-commissioned report on Aboriginal Affairs. During her time in parliament she served on the Social Development, Environment Resources & Development and Natural Resources Standing Committees, and numerous select committees, including chairing the Select Committee on the Impact of Peak Oil on South Australia which reported to the parliament late in 2008. Kanck was successful in moving a motion to refer the matter of Multiple Chemical Sensitivity to the Social Development Committee. With a strong environmental focus in her politics she also succeeded in referring the matter of Marine Parks to the Environment Resources and Development Committee and actively campaigned against the Upper South-East Drylands Salinity Scheme during her time as a member of that Committee and the Natural Resources Committee.

It handles production and distribution of programmes broadcast on the ITV network and third-party broadcasters, and is based in 12 countries across 60 production labels, with local production offices in the UK, US, Australia, Germany, The Netherlands, Italy, Israel, France, and Scandinavia. History ITV Studios Limited's history can be traced back to Granada Productions, which was founded in 1954 as Granada Television's in-house production arm, and Central Television Enterprises, Central Independent Television's international sales operations founded in 1987. Granada Productions and Carlton International (re- branded name for CTE) were merged in 2009 to form ITV Studios; however, some of ITV Studios' subsidiaries, such as ITV Studios Australia, still carried the Granada name until 2014. ITV Studios not only makes programmes primarily for its parent company ITV plc, but also for other networks such as the BBC and Channel 4. It was formed from a gradual amalgamation of the production divisions of all ITV plc owned 'channel three' licensees which occurred from 1994 to 2004, and for a number of years thereafter following the creation of ITV plc. The division is also responsible for ITV's production facilities The London Studios, 3SixtyMedia (based at ITV Granada, and co-owned with BBC Studios and Post Production), and location hire company ProVision (based at ITV Yorkshire, with sales offices at ITV Granada and The London Studios). ITV Studios Global Entertainment (formerly Granada International and Granada Ventures) is responsible for sales of finished programmes, formats and commercial licensing deals. Programmes on non-ITV channels (except S4C, which has always used the name ITV Cymru) retained the Granada brand (examples are Channel 4's Countdown, and The Royle Family for the BBC) until 2009. Many of the programmes shown on ITV network show the end-board featuring the ITV Studios logo after the credits as of 2009. In May 2017, ITV plc acquired production company World Productions. As a result of the takeover, the company is now a part of ITV Studios, with ITV Studios Global Entertainment handling international distribution of future series. That same year, ITV Studios also acquired Swedish game show and entertainment programming producer Elk Production, a stake in Danish drama producer Apple Tree Productions, founded by former DR Drama Deputy Head Lars Hermann and Piv Bernth (producer of the hit series The Killing) who had both left public broadcaster DR (which was the home for The Killing), and another stake in Italian film and television producer Cattleya, well known for producing the 2015 crime film Suburra and the 2017 RAI/Netflix television series co-production that serves as a prequel to it. Cattleya is also a partner in Vision Distribution, an Italian film distribution company founded in 2016 with Sky Italia, Wildside (owned by ITV Studios' rival Fremantle), Lucisano Media Group, Palomar and Indiana Production. In 2017, American Horror Movie production company Blumhouse Productions sold a 45% stake in their independent television studio Blumhouse Television to ITV. Blumhouse is known for their globally successful films such as Paranormal Activity and Insidious. On 1 October 2019, ITV Studios restructured their entire distribution business. The Creative Network division, led by Mike Beale, consists of all of ITVS' unscripted format labels in and outside the United Kingdom, including recently acquired Israeli company Armoza Formats. The Global Entertainment division, based in the Netherlands, focuses on international sales of ITVS' unscripted formats. As a result, Talpa Media became defunct while Talpa Global was absorbed into the Global Entertainment division. The Global Distribution division will handle ITVS' drama and finished-tape catalogue as well as co-financing, co-production and production of scripted series. On 1 July 2020, ITV Studios announced a music partnership with BMG Rights Management (the sister company to ITV Studios' rival Fremantle via both companies' parent Bertelsmann), which includes a joint venture production music label.

ITV Studios also produces programmes for other UK broadcasters outside of its own network. These include the BBC, Channel 4, Channel 5 and Sky. ITV Studios is based in London and Manchester, with the centre in Leeds now only home to Emmerdale and Shiver Productions (formerly Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television's then Granada Productions' northern features department). The production centres in Bristol and Norwich closed in 2006 and 2012 respectively. ITV Studios also owns So Television after acquiring Graham Norton's production company in 2012. On 22 April 2013, ITV announced they had acquired production company The Garden for ¬£18 million; which is best known for producing Channel 4 series 24 Hours in A&E.; In 2013, ITV launched a new production company named Potato. 2016 saw ITV Studios secure a four-year British horse racing deal which saw the Cheltenham Festival, Grand National and Royal Ascot all be shown on ITV. Since 14 January 2013, the ITV logo has been added to the opening credits of the majority of ITV Studios-produced shows airing on ITV's channels, similar to the BBC. Production franchises of ITV Studios In 2004, a duopoly had formed, and Granada owned six franchises, whilst Carlton Communications owned five. Granada bought a 64% controlling stake and took over Carlton in 2004 with the amalgamation of ITV. Consequently, programmes produced by all divisions were referred to as 'A Granada Manchester Production', 'A Granada London Production', etc., at the end of credits.

Both of these eastern Pacific crab species are recognized by ITIS as belonging to the much larger genus Cancer. M. gracilis has been caught from Alaska to Bah√≠a Magdelena, Baja California. Although M. gracilis is only found in the Pacific Ocean, it has cousins in the Atlantic Ocean. The genus Cancer (sensu lato) apparently evolved in the Pacific Ocean and later migrated to the Atlantic Ocean. Larvae and small juveniles of this species are often seen riding jellyfish, especially Phacellophora camtschatica. The juvenile crabs steal food from the jellyfish and also clean off parasitic amphipods. Morphology Like the other members of the family Cancridae, the slender crab has a very broad and oval carapace with dull, tooth-like protrusions toward the front of the carapace. Female crabs can be distinguished from males by a broad tail flap on their undersides, which are used for protecting their eggs when they are gravid. The slender crab carapace is usually olive brown, and its legs vary from yellowish brown to purple. M. gracilis only grows to a width of about and resembles a juvenile M. magister. Often the two species can be confused, as M. gracilis looks very similar to a juvenile Dungeness crab. They can readily be distinguished from each other, though M. gracilis has a notch behind the widest point of its carapace that M. magister lacks, and the top joint of its pincers are not serrated like those of M. magister. More obscure ways to tell are by the appearance of hair on the posterior three legs of M. magister where M. gracilis is almost always hairless. Another telling characteristic of the slender crab is that the last segment of its tail flap is pointed, where M. magister is curved.

Savvy licensing of cellular spectrum in the early 1980s put McCaw Cellular in an extremely strong position, quickly outpacing the growth of the \\"Baby Bells\\" in the emerging market. The company purchased MCI Communications's mobile businesses in 1986, followed by LIN Broadcasting in 1989, giving them widespread access in all of the major US markets. Partnering with AT&T; as a technology provider, McCaw introduced their \\"Cellular One\\" service in 1990, the first truly national cellular system. AT&T; purchased 33% of the company in 1992, and arranged a merger in 1994 that made Craig McCaw one of AT&T;'s largest shareholders. In 2002, the company was spun off from AT&T; to become AT&T; Wireless Services. History =McCaw Cellular Communications= In 1966 J. Elroy McCaw sold one of his cable television holdings in Centralia, Washington to his three sons, including Craig who was 16 years old at the time. Craig took an increasingly central role in the development of McCaw Communications, and by the early 1980s had grown the company from 2,000 subscribers to about $5 million in annual revenue.AT&T; Wireless In 1981 McCaw came across an AT&T; document about the future of cellular telephony, which predicted that by the turn of the century there would be 900,000 cellular subscribers in the United States. Intrigued, McCaw found that the licenses for cellular spectrum were being sold at $4.50 per \\"pop\\", meaning he could build a base for future subscribers for very low cost. By 1983, McCaw Communications had purchased licenses in six of the 30 largest US markets. McCaw then succeeded in using the licenses and collateral, based on the AT&T; projections, using that collateral to take out loans and buy more licenses, and eventually buying billions of dollars of spectrum. In 1987 he sold the cable business for $755 million, and used this new capital to buy even more cellular licenses. It was around this time that the first wave of analog cellular telephones were starting to enter the consumer conscience. The Baby Bells started the process of buying their own licenses, only to find that McCaw owned enough of most of the major markets to lock them out unless they purchased spare licenses from him, at a huge profit. His network of licenses in the major markets was used as a lever to buy, sell or trade licenses in other markets that were not considered profitable, at a considerable discount. In 1986 the company purchased MCI's wireless operations, cellular and paging, for $122 million, and changed their name to \\"McCaw Cellular Communications\\".Biography In 1989 the company outbid BellSouth for control of LIN Broadcasting, which owned licenses in Houston, Dallas, Los Angeles, and New York, paying $3.5 billion, a price that represented $350 per license. =Cellular One= At this point McCaw's focus turned from dealing licenses to servicing the network, signing up customers in what was now a maturing technology on the cusp of explosive growth. In order to handle the customer side of the business, McCaw turned to AT&T; for technology. In 1990, McCaw Cellular introduced SS7 signaling across their network. Prior to this, each cell tower in the network connected to local signaling, billing and sets of land-lines. Since only the towers in the area local to the customer's home had access to dialing and routing information, when they traveled to another area calls could not reach them. With the introduction of SS7 signaling, the dialing and routing information could now be switched across the entire network (known technically as Non-Facility Associated Signalling), tying it together into a single national network. They called the new system \\"Cellular One\\", and introduced the concept of roaming charges. That year, McCaw earned $54 million, making him America's highest-paid chief executive. The partnership grew in November 1992, when AT&T; purchased 1/3 of the company for $3.8 billion. At the time, the company was generating $1.75 billion in annual revenue, and had two million Cellular One subscribers - far more customers than AT&T;'s earlier projections for all cellular use in the US, at a point almost ten years earlier. =AT&T; Wireless= In 1994 the marriage of the two companies was consummated when AT&T; purchased the rest of McCaw Cellular for $11.5 billion, at that time the second largest merger in US history, second only to the RJR Nabisco takeover documented in Barbarians at the Gate. The merger was completed in late 1994, creating AT&T; Wireless Group, which was at that time the largest cellular carrier in the US. As a result of the merger, Craig McCaw became one of AT&T;'s largest shareholders, but he refused to sit on the Board of Directors because he couldn't stand long meetings. McCaw left daily operations to focus on Teledesic, passing control of AT&T; Wireless to James Barksdale, and then Steve Hooper when Barksdale left for Netscape.

It ceased at the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1538. Foundation St Mary's Church within Portchester Castle is all that survives from the original Portchester Priory. In 1133 Henry I founded a priory of Austin canons in the church of St. Mary, Portchester, within the walls of Portchester Castle. The foundation charter gave to the canons the church of Portchester, timber for fencing, building and fuel, common pasture in the wood of Hingsdon; the large manor of Candover; and a hide of land in 'each of' Southwick and Applestead. By the early part of the thirteenth century, the priory is referred to in charters (held at Lambeth Palace) as Southwick Priory and it is believed to have moved to the site in Southwick c. 1145‚Äì1153. 13th to 16th centuries The interior of the church Towards the end of the Middle Ages, the priory became a renowned centre of pilgrimage. In September 1510 Henry VIII passed through Southwick and made an offering of 6s. 8d. at Our Lady of Southwick. In 1538, shortly before the suppression, John Husee, a solicitor and servant of the Lisle family, wrote to Lord Lisle that Pilgrimage saints goeth down apace as Our Lady of Southwick, the Blood of Hales, St. Saviour's and others. And Leland mentions the fame of the pilgrimage to Our Lady of Southwick. By the dissolution, the priory still holding Preston Candover had gained: *the manors (almost all in Hampshire) of Southwick with its rectory, Newland, Hannington, Sutton Scotney, 'Moundesmer', 'Oldfishborne', Farlington with a fishery, Denmead Molens, Clanveld and Aldbourn, Weralles in Dorchester with the rectory, Colmer, Stubbington, Hoe, West Boarhunt, Boarhunt, Harbert and Bury *the rectories of Nutley, Swindon, Portsea, Portsmouth and 'Wanstede,' *lands and rents in Priors Dean, the city of Winchester and Andover. Dissolution In 1535, the Valor Ecclesiasticus estimated the annual value (net income) of the priory as ¬£257 4s. 4d (). But one of the canons, James Gunwyn, wrote to Thomas Cromwell on 20 January 1536 claiming: > We are bound by the will of William Wykeham to have daily five masses in our > church, which have not been said for more than forty years. On 26 May last > the Commissioners sat in our place to ascertain the yearly value of our > lands, that a tenth part might be assessed according to Act of Parliament, > when my master (the prior) delivered them a book of the yearly rents which > was not in all points made truly. Also on 22 September last we had a > visitation of our house by Dr. Layton, when we had certain injunctions given > us to be observed, several of which have been neglected hitherto. I send you > this information in discharge of my oath of obedience, and would have done > it earlier if I could have had a trusty messenger, for if my master knew of > my writing he would convey away the plate, money and jewels in his keeping. A letter to Lord Lisle of 16 March 1538 stated that the priory was to be suppressed, and that 'Our Lady of Southwick' was taken down. On 7 April 1538 the surrender was signed by the prior, William Norton, and twelve of the canons. James Gunwyn's signature is next to the prior's. Prior Norton received the large pension of ¬£66 13s. 4d. Post-Dissolution The priory came into the possession of John White, a servant of Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton. He pulled down the church and converted the prior's lodgings and other parts of the conventual buildings into a private house, known as Southwick Park, which became the family seat of one branch of the Norton family.\\"After the Dissolution the site of the priory church of Southwick was granted to John White, servant to Sir Thomas Wriothesley, in 1538, and eight years later the manor and church of Southwick were granted to Sir Thomas Wriothesley that he might alienate them to John White.\\" In October 1551, Mary of Guise Regent of Scotland and mother of Mary, Queen of Scots stayed in the house.WK Jordan ed., The Chronicle and Political Papers of King Edward VI, (1966) 90 & note, (though Jordan is mistaken in thinking John White was the future Bishop) On the death of John White in 1567 the manor passed to his son and heir Edward. In 1580 Edward died, leaving a son and heir, John, who, in 1606, settled the manor on his daughter and co-heir Honor on her marriage with Sir Daniel Norton, and they came into possession of the manor on the death of John White in the following year.(William Page (editor) 'Parishes: Southwick', A History of the County of Hampshire: Volume 3 (1908), pp. 161‚Äì165. URL: Date accessed: 2 April 2010.)\\"The buildings were not entirely destroyed at the suppression, but converted into a house, like those of Titchfield and Mottisfont. There is a record that in Richard Norton's time, Dryden's play 'The Spanish Friar' [1681] was performed in the frater. In course of time parts of the old work became ruinous, and in the beginning of the nineteenth century the house was rebuilt, and much of the monastic building finally disappeared in the process. Till this date a great chapel with fourteen windows on each side, attributed to William of Wykeham, is said to have remained standing.

Twin ruins and mansion on main estate The church of St Mary at Portchester survives, inside the Roman wall of Porchester Castle, returned to parochial use. It is substantially a Norman building, and hence the one the priory originally used. No trace of the conventual buildings survive above ground except for some drain openings and the marks of the abutment of the cloister against the south wall of the nave. The house that used materials from the priory was burnt down in 1750 and salvaged for scrap masonry. The site has been occupied since 1838 by Southwick House, which has been home to the Defence School of Policing and Guarding since 2005, and the regimental headquarters of the Royal Military Police since 2007. Of the priory itself, one section of wall and some earthworks survive. Some remnants of the priory church may survive transferred and reset in the parish church of St James, Southwick. The contiguous estate at Southwick is still intact and is formally referred to as the Southwick Estate.

He presented the three BBC 2 series Francesco's Venice (2004) and Francesco's Italy: Top to Toe (2006) where he explored the country in an Alfa Romeo Spider and Francesco's Mediterranean Voyage (filmed 2007, broadcast 2008) which sees him sailing aboard the Camper and Nicholsons ketch Black Swan from his home city, Venice, to Istanbul, visiting places including Split, Mostar and Dubrovnik. He presented the two part BBC 2 series: Shakespeare in Italy, (2012). Biography Ca' da Mosto Da Mosto was born into an aristocratic family in Venice, and his family has been part of the city's history since possibly as early as the fifth century. Originally, they were wine makers - the name da Mosto coming from the word mosto meaning grape must (juice from crushed grapes). Later, the family became traders, explorers and politicians. The family's previous Venice residence, the Ca' da Mosto, which can be seen from the Rialto market by the Grand Canal, was lost through marriage in the 17th century, when Chiara da Mosto, a female member of the family, married four times, with each husband dying of natural causes ‚Äì thus enabling her to become one of the wealthiest people in Venice. Unfortunately for the da Mosto family, the childless widow had a falling-out with them and on her death in 1603 she left everything to Leonardo Don√† dalle Rose, a nephew of her second husband, who went on to become Doge. Da Mosto is the younger son of Count Ranieri da Mosto and Contessa Maria Grazia Vanni d'Archirafi, who comes from a very old Sicilian noble family who are the Dukes of Archirafi and include many noted Italian diplomats and bankers. A Roman Catholic, da Mosto took his first Holy Communion in the crypt of St Mark's. A few years later, he received the sacrament of Confirmation from the future Pope John Paul I. Da Mosto lives in his family home in Venice, with his South African-born wife Jane, his four children, and his parents. Francesco‚Äôs grandfather Andrea acquired the palazzo in 1919, where the family now live. When he moved in, the empty picture frames on the walls of the portego were filled with copies of family pictures, including a 15th-century map of the voyages of Alvise da Mosto, who discovered the Cape Verde islands off the west coast of Africa. When BBC Two decided to make a four-part series about the history of Venice, they contacted Francesco to be the host. He has now presented three series for BBC Two: Francesco's Venice, Francesco's Italy - from Top to Toe and Francesco's Mediterranean Voyage, with accompanying books to the series. He has also published a book entitled Francesco's Kitchen. In the Doctor Who Confidential series 5 episode Death in Venice, Francesco is featured explaining the history of Venice to Matt Smith. Shakespeare in Italy was broadcast on BBC Two on 3 and 10 May 2012. In 2015, da Mosto co-presented the documentary A Sicilian Dream about the Targa Florio, a Sicilian motor race. Bibliography  * Francesco's Italy: Top to Toe Da Mosto's series Francesco's Italy: Top to Toe, broadcast on BBC Two, shows his journey from his home city of Venice to his mother's origins in Sicily.
