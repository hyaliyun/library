The film was screened on June 4, 2008 in Belgium and France, at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival (Midnight Madness), and at the Adelaide Film Festival on 20 February 2009. It was distributed by Peace Arch Entertainment from Toronto and opened in New York and select cities on 7 November 2008. Plot The film establishes Jean- Claude van Damme playing himself as an out-of-luck actor. He is out of money; his agent cannot find him a decent production; and the judge in a custody battle is inclined to give custody of his daughter over to his ex-wife. His own daughter rejects him as a father, much to his chagrin. He returns to his childhood home of Schaarbeek in the Brussels capital region, Belgium, where he is still considered a national icon. After posing for pictures with clerks outside a video store, Van Damme goes into the post office across the street. A shot is fired inside the post office, and a police officer responds but is waved off by Van Damme at the window, which is then blocked. The officer calls for backup. The narrative then shifts to Van Damme's point of view. He goes into the post office to receive a badly needed wire transfer but finds that the bank is being robbed. He is taken hostage along with the other customers. The police mistakenly identify Van Damme as the robber when he is forced by the actual perpetrators to move a cabinet to block the window. Van Damme finds himself acting as a hero to protect the hostages by engaging with the robbers about his career (one of them being a fan of his), as well as both a negotiator and presumed perpetrator. While speaking by phone as the ringleader of the robbers, Van Damme even goes so far as to demand $465,000 for the law firm handling his custody case. It is not clear if Van Damme demands the $465,000 out of self-interest, or out of a desire to appear as a genuine bank- robber to the police as he insists to the thieves, or perhaps both. The narrative continues to shift to show the media circus that develops around the post office and video store, which the police use as a base of operations, enhanced by the involvement of the actor. Archive footage showing him talking in a typically weird and cryptic way during french language interviews are shown on TV, to Van Damme's dismay. In a notable scene, Van Damme and the camera are lifted above the set, and he performs a six-minute single-take monologue, where he breaks the fourth wall, addressing the audience, or God, or both, with an emotional (but characteristically cryptic) monologue about his career, his multiple marriages, and his drug abuse, connecting his reflections with the current hostage situation where he is afraid of dying in such an absurd manner. Van Damme then persuades one of the bank robbers to release the hostages. After this happens, a scuffle ensues and in the resulting conflict, the head robber is shot by his partner. The police, after hearing a gunshot, storm the building. The police shoot another one of the thieves, and Van Damme is held at gunpoint by the final one. Van Damme briefly imagines a scenario in which he takes down the robber with an action-movie style kick, whereupon everyone including the police and crowd cheer for him, but in reality, he just elbows him in the stomach and the police take him into custody. Van Damme is arrested for extortion over the $465,000 and sentenced to 1 year in prison. The final scenes show him teaching martial arts to other inmates, then being visited by his mother and daughter.

The producer, knowing El Mechri was a Van Damme fan, asked him to review the original screenplay. The screenwriters had perceived Van Damme as merely a clown, but El Mechri felt that there was more to Van Damme than just what people knew from his big screen action-hero persona and TV antics. El Mechri, who was influenced by Jean-Luc Godard, offered to write a draft, and the producer asked if he would direct it as well. El Mechri agreed on the condition he could meet Van Damme first before starting the draft, so he would not waste six months on something that Van Damme might veto. El Mechri and Van Damme had dinner, where the idea of the bank heist and not knowing what has happened inside was pitched. Van Damme was thrilled with the concept. After watching El Mechri's film, Virgil, he immediately went to work with the French director. El Mechri stated that about 70% of the film was scripted, and the other 30% was improvised from the actors. Most of the ad- libs came from Van Damme. During Van Damme's six-minute, one-take monologue, he references past drug problems. In real life, Van Damme had troubles with cocaine during 1995, entering a month-long rehab program in 1996 but leaving after just one week. His acting in the movie, and that sequence in particular, were praised by critics as well as fellow actors like Nicolas Cage. The Gaumont title sequence was altered for this film. The normal sequence has a silhouetted boy pulling a daisy from the ground, which floats to space to become the company logo. In this film, the boy is confronted by a silhouetted Van Damme, who attempts to take the daisy from him. When the boy resists, Van Damme does a roundhouse kick on him and kicks the daisy upwards, where it becomes the company logo. Reception Reviews for JCVD have been positive. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a rating of 84% based on 107 reviews. This is one of only four Van Damme films to be listed as Certified Fresh by the website, along with The Expendables 2, Enemies Closer and Kung Fu Panda 2. On Metacritic the film has a score of 64 based on reviews from 26 critics. Peter Bradshaw reviewed the film for The Guardian and called the monologue \\"a Godardian coup de cinéma\\", describing the film as \\"inter-textual and self- referential\\".

Retrieved July 1, 2013.. Retrieved July 1, 2013. The specimen was first named by Fraas as Mesocetus schweinfurthi. However, the name Mesocetus was previously used causing a change to the species name to Eocetus schweinfurthi. Since the genus was first described in the early 20th century, several other specimens, mostly isolated vertebrae, have been attributed to Eocetus, but the taxonomic status of these widely distributed specimens remain disputed. Discovery and taxonomy described \\"Mesocetus schweinfurthi\\" based on a dorsoventrally compressed skull with only I2 in situ, a specimen supposedly originating from a 40 Ma Tethyan deposit at Mokattam. Fraas also referred two isolated teeth, P4 and M1, to the skull and the most important of his specimens is not the deformed skull, but the upper molar which retains three roots and a worn but well-developed protocone. Georg August Schweinfurth, a German palaeontologist who explored Mokattam in the 1880s, mentioned the quarriers there very eagerly offered \\"shark teeth\\" to tourists and that scientists and fossil collectors regularly bought their specimens from this source. There is reason to assume that Fraas were among them and that at least his two isolated teeth were described without direct knowledge of their original locality and stratigraphic context. Notwithstanding that the stratigraphic information supplied by Fraas and his contemporaries can be difficult to interpret, the geology of Egypt is well- studied, and both the skull and the accompanying teeth are most likely Bartonian in age — older and significantly more primitive than any other cetacean specimen known from Egypt at that time. Fraas soon discovered that the name \\"Mesocetus\\" was already occupied, and changed the name of his \\"Urform Protocetus\\" to Eocetus. Fraas also attributed two isolated vertebrae to his new genus, both of which moved to Basilosaurus drazindai. A holotype, described by Stromer 1903 as Zeuglodon macrospondylus, was discovered in Egypt. It is later used for comparison for other vertebrae. attributed two other vertebrae from Mokattam to Eocetus. These two vertebrae were lost for many years until described two bones that he discovered in a museum in Germany and appeared to fit Stromer's description. Uhen based his assignment of his own North American genus (see below) to Eocetus on the similarities to Stromer's vertebrae. =Previously-assigned specimens and taxa= described a new species, Eocetus wardii, from the late Lutetian (~42 Ma) of North Carolina based on more complete material: a partial skull, thoracic, lumbar and caudal vertebrae, ribs and an innominate. The innominate is sufficiently large to support a weight-bearing hind limb – suggesting the animal was a protocetid, a group of more primitive archaeocetes — but also has anatomical features in common with basilosaurids — more derived and fully aquatic archaeocetes. Uhen also noted that the composition of the ribs and vertebrae is different from that of other archaeocetes and sirenians: a core of light trabecular bone is surrounded by layers of dense cortical bone. Due to this mosaic of protocetid and basilosaurid features, regarded Uhen's specimen as unique among North American archaeocetes and an interesting find, but questioned the validity of Uhen's attribution (including that of Stromer's two vertebrae). This suspicion was confirmed by , who reassigned E. wardii to the genus Basilotritus (and hence Basilosauridae). described another partial lumbar vertebra discovered in Rohrdorf, Bavaria, Germany, in 2003. They attributed it to Eocetus sp. — the first confirmed protocetid from Europe — and argued that this specimen further supports the hypothesis that protocetids were aquatic to the extent that they managed to spread over the world. Two vertebrae, a thoracic and a lumbar, discovered on a riverbed in Virginia in 2009 were referred to \\"Eocetus\\" wardi by . described a still unnamed Bartonian protocetid from Peru based on the posterior portion of a skull, seven partial vertebrae, and ribs from and adult individual. Uhen et al. considered this specimen closely related to Eocetus based on vertebral morphology. described two vertebra, a thoracic and a lumbar, from a subadult individual found in Ukraine. They considered them comparable to those Uhen described in 1999 and attributed their specimen to \\"E.\\" wardii.

It is a socialist, secularist and Arab nationalist party founded in April 2011. The composition of the party has changed several times as a result of mergers and splits. Between 2013 and 2014, the People's Movement was a member of the Popular Front coalition, one of the three main coalitions of political parties in Tunisia. The former leader of the party, Mohamed Brahmi, was assassinated on 25 July 2013 by unknown killers. Foundation and policies On 20 March 2011 two nationalist parties merged, the People's Movement (Mouvement du peuple) founded by the lawyer Khaled Krichi and the Progressive Unionist Movement (Mouvement Unioniste Progressiste). The new party was called the Progressive Unionist People's Movement (Mouvement du Peuple Unioniste Progressiste). Some members disagreed with the merger and in April 2011 formed a new party, the People's Movement (Mouvement du peuple) with the slogan \\"freedom, socialism, unity\\". The Executive Committee was: *Mohamed Brahmi: General Manager, Coordinator *Adel Zraibia: Officer, Treasurer *Amor Chahed: Spokesman *Hocine Msadek, artist *Abdelwahab El Fahm, professor *Mohsen Nabti, official *Salah Badrouchi, director *Mohamed Sghaier Boukriba, professor *Ahmed Gasmi, professor *Aymen Dabbagui, student *Walid Gharsalli, teacher The People's Movement is a secularist and Arab nationalist party. It has a social democratic platform and is aligned with workers groups. The party belongs to the Popular Front coalition of left-leaning parties led by Hamma Hammami, leader of the Tunisian Workers Party. The coalition includes ten nationalist left-wing groups, including the People's Movement. 2011 elections Elections were held on 23 October 2011 for a National Constituent Assembly to write a new constitution for Tunisia, to be submitted for approval by referendum. In the election results announced on 14 November 2011 the leading party was the moderate Islamist Ennahda Movement, with 89 of the 217 seats. The Progressive Unionist People's Movement stood in all constituencies in Tunisia and in two constituencies abroad. It gained 36,641 votes, or 0.98% of the total, but failed to obtain a seat. The People's Movement gained 30,259 votes, or 0.75% of the votes, in 29 districts (26 in Tunisia and three abroad) and won two seats. Brahmi ran in Sidi Bouzid, the town where Mohamed Bouazizi set himself on fire in December 2010 and triggered the Arab Spring. He was elected with 3,617 votes. Mourad Amdouni ran in Bizerte, where his name happened to be placed to the right of that of Ennahda on the ballot. He received 10,353 votes, some cast incorrectly by supporters of Ennahda. Later developments =Merger with MPUP= On 26 February 2012, it was announced that the Progressive Unionist People's Movement and the People's Movement would join to form a new party, again called the People's Movement (Mouvement du peuple). This followed a two-day constituent congress in Nabeul attended by 300 delegates that adopted motions on political, economic, social, cultural and organizational subjects. The president of the congress, Salem Hadded, said a new 11-person executive committee with a two-year mandate would elect the secretary general for the party. The committee members were: * Mohamed Brahmi, General Coordinator * Zouhair Maghzaoui, Secretary General * Souad Cheffi * Fethi Belhaj * Ridha Dallaï * Mohsen Nabti * Mabrouk Kourchid * Badreddine Gammoudi * Ridha El Agha * Salah Ferjaoui * Omrane Maddouri =Coalitions= The People's Movement organized a meeting on 5 January 2013 to discuss subjects such as a new model for development, independence of justice, the nature of the political regime and the martyrs and wounded of the revolution. The focus of the meeting was an initiative of national unification. According to Mohamed Brahmi, the present crisis would be resolved by a political alliance of all democratic forces apart from Ennahda (Renaissance) and Nidaa Tounes. It would include the Republican Party, El Watd, the Social Democratic Path, Ettalia, the Ba'ath party, Ettakatol, the Congress for the Republic and the UGTT. The Popular Front (Front populaire pour la réalisation des objectifs de la révolution) is a coalition of left, nationalist and green political parties founded on 7 October 2012 as an alternative to the secular coalition of Nidaa Tounes and to the \\"troïka\\", the coalition of ruling parties that includes the Islamist Ennahda, the Congress for the Republic and Ettakatol. The Popular Front spokesman is Hamma Hammami, secretary general of the Workers' Party. Chokri Belaïd, who was murdered on 6 February 2013, was the leader of the Democratic Patriots' Movement, which belonged to the front. On 30 April 2013 Mohamed Brahmi made an official announcement on radio Shems FM that the People's movement would join the Popular Front coalition. He said that he thought the Popular Front was essential for Tunisia since it provided the hope of achieving the goals of the revolution: justice, democracy and productivity. =Assassination of Brahmi= Brahmi left the People's Movement in July 2013 to form a new organization. When he quit on 7 July he said that Islamists had infiltrated the Popular Movement. Four members of the political bureau of the party, as well as coordinators of regional offices and dozens of supporters, also resigned from the party after a strategy session that discussed the party position on national and pan-Arab issues, political Islam and the coalition with the Popular Front. A 17-member committee was announced to formalize the creation of a new party to be called the Courant Populaire (Popular Current). Speaking on the \\"Midi Show\\" Brahmi said that he had already written his resignation on 16 December 2012. He said he would act as interim general coordinator of the Popular Current until a congress was held to found the new party. On 25 July 2013 Brahmi was shot dead outside his house by unknown assassins. The killers fled the scene on a motorbike. The motive was not known. Khaled Khichi, a lawyer and member of the party, announced Brahmi's death from the hospital. The killing triggered demonstrations against the government of Prime Minister Ali Laarayedh.

The band played and recorded for four years before evolving into Gay & Terry Woods. In 2001, Terry Woods formed a new band and named it The Woods Band, which performed and recorded through 2003. History The Woods Band was formed in 1970 by ex-Steeleye Span members Terry and Gay Woods. The band was formed just a few months after the couple had left Steeleye Span, shortly after the release of Steeleye's first album Hark! The Village Wait, after personal disagreements with members. Performing under the name \\"Gay & Terry Woods\\" as well as \\"The Woods Band\\", they worked with a number of different musicians, including fiddler Joe O'Donnell. and King Crimson members Ian MacDonald and Mike Giles, amongst others. Eventually, a line-up solidified under the name The Woods Band with guitarist Ed Deane and drummer Pat Nash. Terry Woods also wanted to recruit uilleann piper Paddy Keenan, who declined and would go on to join the Bothy Band. They began to rehearse and perform soon after forming, releasing a self-titled album in December 1971. The record was a mix of traditional material and originals, including a re-recording of the track Dreams from Terry's old band Sweeney's Men. With standard rock instruments embellished by mandola, concertina, autoharp, dulcimer, bodhran, and harpsichord, the music sounded rather similar to, and held its own with, Steeleye Span's own early work, although showing a greater rock influence. Shortly after the album's release, however, Gay & Terry joined Dr. Strangely Strange on tour, before returning to work as both The Woods Band and Gay & Terry Woods, again with a changing cast of musicians. Their record label, Greenwich Gramophone Company went out of business leaving their album out of print. The Ireland division of Polydor gave the band a single release in 1974, the A and B sides were both penned by Gay and Terry but the single failed to chart. Subsequent releases by the couple were credited to \\"Gay & Terry Woods\\". Reformation In 2002, Terry Woods put together a new band, using The Woods Band as name. Despite the shared name, the only member of any version of the original band was Woods himself. Like the original band, this line-up featured a mix of traditional folk instruments with contemporary rock instruments, as well as a mix of traditional and original songs. The bulk of the lead vocals were handled by singer Shane Martin, with Dubliners singer Ronnie Drew guesting on a recording of \\"The Dublin Jack of All Trades\\". Gigging occasionally, the group put out a single studio album, Music From The Four Corners of Hell, in 2002, before becoming inactive.

She was a member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and was elected from the Thiruverumbur Constituency to the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly in 1989.  Life and career  Pappa Umanath was born as Dhanalakshmi on 5 August 1931 in Kovilpathu, near Karaikal, Madras Presidency, British India (now in Puducherry, a Union Territory in India). Her mother, Lakshmi, alias Alamelu, moved to Golden Rock, Tiruchirappalli after her husband's death. Lakshmi started a canteen near the Golden Rock Railway Workshop for railway workers. The railway workers who came to the canteen used to call Dhanalakshmi \\"Pappa\\" (small girl), which became the origin of her name. At a young age, Pappa participated in several agitations along with her mother and railway workers. Dhanalakshmi joined the Communist Party of India (CPI) in 1945 and moved to Madras (now Chennai). In 1948, the CPI was banned by the Government of India and members of the party were arrested, including Dhanalakshmi, her mother, and a number of the party's leaders. In the jail, when members of the party went on a fast against authorities, her mother died after 23 days of fasting. Pappa was not allowed by the jail authorities to attend her mother's funeral, as she refused to quit the party. In 1952, Dhanalakshmi married fellow party member R. Umanath in a self-respect marriage. She was arrested again during the Sino-Indian war. In 1964, her party split in two, and she joined the newly formed Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)). She co-founded the All India Democratic Women's Association in 1973 and became its general secretary. She contested the 1984 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election from Thiruverumbur Constituency, but lost. She won the election in 1989 but lost again in 1991. She had three daughters, one of whom was U. Vasuki, a CPI(M) politician. She died on 17 December 2010 in Trichy.

With music by Alan Menken and lyrics by Howard Ashman, \\"Human Again\\" was replaced during production of the original 1991 version of the film by \\"Something There\\", but retained and revised by Menken and new lyricist Tim Rice for the 1994 stage musical adaptation of Beauty and the Beast. A newly produced sequence featuring \\"Human Again\\" was added to the Beauty and the Beast animated film for its 2002 IMAX Special Edition and subsequent DVD, VHS, and Blu-ray home releases. The song is an upbeat waltz, with lyrics sung by several of the enchanted objects/house servants in the castle of the Beast, who are hopeful that now that he and Belle are getting closer to one another, they could fall in love and break the spell on their castle, which would restore all of them to human form. The song also expands the role of The Wardrobe, giving her a solo verse in the number. In the film, where it falls between \\"Something There\\" and \\"Beauty and the Beast\\", \\"Human Again\\" is primarily performed by Lumière (Jerry Orbach), Cogsworth (David Ogden Stiers), Mrs. Potts (Angela Lansbury), and The Wardrobe (Jo Anne Worley). Neither Belle nor the Beast sing in the song, but they are seen in a brief scene where Belle teaches the Beast to read starting with Romeo & Juliet (King Arthur in the stage version and demo). Production The song was originally written for the 1991 film, but was cut due to pacing issues and its length. It was included in the 1994 Broadway musical, and was brought back for the 2002 DVD release of the film. Don Hahn explained: \\"Kirk and Gary and I were sitting around talking about the Star Wars Special Edition that had just come out and Kirk jokingly suggested, 'wouldn't it be fun to do a special edition of Beauty with Human Again or new material in it?' When the head of Feature Animation said he thought it was a great idea, we stopped joking and began thinking about how we could actually do it. We had storyboarded the sequence for the original production, but completely reworked it for this special edition of the film.\\"http://www.digitalmediafx.com/Beauty/beauty-beast-review.html Kirk Wise (who directed the original film) also directed the reanimated sequence, with co-director of Beauty and the Beast Gary Trousdale. Wise explained, \\"we had many of the same animators, same background painters, same artists that worked on the sequence\\".http://www.rossanthony.com/interviews/kirkwise.shtml Composition Show Biz Training describes the song as a \\"beautiful waltz\\". Removal \\"Human Again\\" is considered by the Disney executives as somewhat of a controversial song within Beauty and the Beast. DigitalMediaFX said \\"there's a reason that the \\"Human Again\\" song was not included in the original Beauty and the Beast until 2002—it didn't quite fit\\", and cites Disney's own statement, \\"the song posed story problems which was difficult to solve in a timely manner. Because it was originally conceived as an 11-minute musical number, Disney had no other choice but to ultimately replace the song with the shorter and more direct 'Something There'\\". Show Biz Training explains the song was cut \\"in spite of the writers' and film makers' strong desire to keep it in the film\\". They eventually chose service to the story over self- indulgence and reluctantly cut the number. Kirk Wise explained the motivation behind the song's removal from the film and reinstatement in the stage version thus: \\"Back when it was originally written and storyboarded it was initially 11 minutes long, which is a pretty heavy milieu for an animated feature that already had a lot of songs. Length was one problem and the structure of the song was also a problem at the time because it indicated the passage of time, months of time, leaves falling. That presented a couple story problems for us because we kept asking, 'Well what? Is Maurice wandering around in the woods all this time? Is Gaston just sitting around in a tavern drinking beer after beer growing a long white beard?' we couldn't quite figure out what to do with the other characters during this time that Belle's at the castle and keep the motor of the story running. Those were the reasons for cutting it at the time. It wasn't until we saw the Broadway version where Alan[Menken] had made a substantial edit in the music and had found a slightly different place for the song to sit, so we realized there was a way to make this work. The bridge which was all about time passing was removed... so that issue went away. And Alan did a couple of additional edits for us when we were tailoring it for the movie, and now it works. There's a great little suite of music now that starts with \\"Something There,\\" the song that B&B; sing while they're having a little snowball fight, which segues into \\"Human Again\\" which gives the object perspective on what they hope for when B&B; fall in love and that transitions into \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" the ballad, which is the culmination of their relationship. So, it's a nice little story within a story now.\\" Reception DigitalMediaFX said \\"The first half of the song (including the intro to it) seem a bit weak, yet it got better as the song continued. Then, three-fourths the way through the song there is a scene where Belle is teaching Beast to read. This single sequence, albeit short, deepened the story and the relationship issue. It is definitely an excellent addition to the movie. I also must admit that it was quite interesting to have something \\"new\\" to see. But at the same time, \\"Human Again\\" almost makes it feel like there is \\"one too many\\" songs in this classic, particularly coming so soon after \\"Something There.\\" I think the movie would have been perfect if the \\"learning to read\\" scene had been added without the song\\". A review of Beauty and the Beast 3D by Collider noted the exclusion of the number, deeming it a smart move due to not being a \\"bad song\\", but being \\"nowhere near as good as the rest of the number and it slows down the pacing\\".http://collider.com/beauty-and-the- beast-3d-review/ While \\"Human Again\\" is not featured in the live-action film, a variation of it can be seen in \\"Days in the Sun\\", performed after the Beast rescues Belle from the wolves, preceding the number \\"Something There\\". The song is sung first by a child representing the then-human Prince during his youth, on his mother's deathbed; then by Lumiére, Plumette, Mrs. Potts, & Madame Garderobe; then by Belle, before being sung by everyone. The song is all about reliving everyone's \\"days in the sun\\" (representing their former lives: the enchanted curse for the Beast (as well as her mother being alive) and the castle staff, and freedom for Belle), and hoping for a \\"new day\\".

Lines include, \\"I'd walk a million miles For one of your smiles, My Mammy!\\" He also appeared in James Nares's 1978 well-known no wave 82-minute color Super-8 film entitled Rome 78. The narrative is about the Roman emperor Caligula now set in a shabby 1978 downtown Manhattan apartment. As such, it proposes an analogy between ancient Rome and modern America as cultural empires.Masters, Marc. No Wave. London: Black Dog Publishing, 2007, pp.148–149 Despite its large cast in period costumes, the work is never made out to be a serious undertaking, with actors who interject scenes with self-conscious laughter, and deliver seemingly improvised lines with over the top bravado. The work also features No Wave Cinema regular Lydia Lunch of Teenage Jesus and the Jerks along with artist David McDermott of McDermott & McGough as Caligula, James Chance, John Lurie, Eric Mitchell as a Roman general, Judy Rifka, Jim Sutcliffe, Lance Loud, Patti Astor, Anya Phillips as the Queen of Sheba and Kristian Hoffman, among others.Rebellion of the quiet Retrospective of James Nares, No Wave’s subtlest filmmaker In 1988 Corber conducted a taped interview with Leonard Cohen that was purchased by the New York Public Library for its collection.

On August 24, 2006, Corber presented \\"Cage Live Mix: Four Hours and 33 Minutes\\" at A Gathering of the Tribes, impresario Steve Cannon's legendary venue. It was a multi-screen, multi-speaker, multi- room, ambient music mix of John Cage: Man and Myth material, that included video, audio, interview, poetry and various inserts, some chance-oriented with some audience participation. The title \\"Four Hours and 33 Minutes\\" refers to Cage's notorious silent piano sonata 4′33″. Spread through different areas of Tribes Gallery, it was, said the artist, \\"an opportunity for chance events and audience participation.\\"INTERVIEW Gregory Stephenson:Skating On Thin Air: An Interview With Mitch Corber The program included interview sequences with Cage and the many avant-garde artists who contributed homage interviews, including David Antin, Philip Glass, Richard Kostelanetz, Jackson Mac Low, Alison Knowles, Allen Kaprow, pianist Grete Sultan, Marjorie Perloff, and microtonalist Johnny Reinhard.

It is a junction station on the Dortmund–Enschede, Dorsten-Coesfeld and Empel-Rees–Münster lines. History The Dortmund-Gronau-Enschede Railway Company (, DGE) began to build its line from Dortmund in 1874. On 1 August 1875, it opened Coesfeld Station (Westphalia) at the end of the section from Dülmen East. Nearly two months later, another section was opened to Gronau, so that Coesfeld station became a through station. The Wanne-Eickel–Hamburg railway of the Cologne-Minden Railway Company was of great national importance and the Rhenish Railway Company (Rheinische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, RhE) planned its Duisburg–Quakenbrück railway to compete with it. With the completion of this line on 1 July 1879, Coesfeld station became a “crossing” station (Kreuzungsbahnhof). The Rhenish line originally crossed the DGE line to the south of Coesfeld. In 1880, the RhE was the first of the Prussian railways to be nationalised and in 1903 the DGE was one of the last of the (nominally) private railway companies to be absorbed by the Prussian state railways (PSE). It had already begun to build its line from Empel-Rees to Borken around the turn of the century. On 1 October 1904, the new line reached Coesfeld and crossed the two existing lines south of the station. The line was extended to Billerbeck on 1 March 1908 and the last section of the line was completed to Havixbeck on 1 May 1908. The original weatherboard station building was demolished in 1910 and replaced by the existing building. The number of passengers in western Münsterland declined in the second half of the 20th century. None of the lines had ever played a significant national role. On 26 May 1974, passenger services on the western part of the Empel-Rees–Münster line from Isselburg-Anholt to Coesfeld were abandoned. Ten years later, passenger services were abandoned on the northern section of the Rhenish line from Coesfeld to Rheine. In the early 1990s, several modifications of the tracks began. The exit from Coesfeld station towards Ahaus (infrastructure line number (VzG) 2100) was realigned until 28 August 1993. Traffic on the Empel-Rees–Münster line (VzG 2265) towards Münster was transferred to the Duisburg–Quakenbrück tracks on 13 November 1994 and its original track to Lutum were dismantled. The section of the Duisburg-Quakenbrück (VzG 2273) from Lutum to St. Arnold was completely closed on 1 January 1996 and has since been partly dismantled. Now there were no through passenger services on either the Empel-Rees–Münster line or on the Duisburg–Quakenbrück line. The elaborate grade-separated southern exit from the station had thus become superfluous. The exit towards Dülmen (VzG 2100) was moved on 30 November 1997 to the route of the former line to Borken (VzG 2265). In 2008, construction started on the Coesfeld (Westphalia) Cf interlocking, an electronic interlocking of class SIMIS-D and ZSB 2000. In the period up to 2012, this took over the functions of the three mechanical signal boxes in Coesfeld and, by remote control, signalling at the stations of Steinfurt-Burgsteinfurt (26 October 2008), Altenberge (9 November 2008), Gronau (Westfalen) and Ochtrup (both on 12 October 2008), Beelen, Telgte and Warendorf (all three 26 on October 2009), Ahaus and Epe (Westf) (22 November 2010), and most recently Billerbeck and Havixbeck (29 January 2012). After a €6.5 million renovation, including the replacement of the old pedestrian tunnel with a new underpass with three lifts and the relaying of the tracks, Coesfeld station is now a modern, accessible station. It was officially inaugurated on 18 January 2013 in the presence of the transport minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, Michael Groschek.

She served primarily in the Battle of the Atlantic protecting convoys. She was sunk in 1944. She was named for Shawinigan, Quebec. Background Flower-class corvettes like Shawinigan serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different from earlier and more traditional sail-driven corvettes. The \\"corvette\\" designation was created by the French as a class of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877. During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, Winston Churchill reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a whaling ship design. The generic name \\"flower\\" was used to designate the class of these ships, which – in the Royal Navy – were named after flowering plants. Corvettes commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were named after communities for the most part, to better represent the people who took part in building them. This idea was put forth by Admiral Percy W. Nelles. Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named. Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts, while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles which was exemplified by their minesweeping gear. Eventually the Canadian corvettes would be modified to allow them to perform better on the open seas. Construction Shawinigan was ordered 24 January 1940 as part of the 1939–1940 Flower-class building program and laid down on 4 June 1940 by Davie Shipbuilding & Repairing Co. Ltd. at Lauzon, Quebec. However she was not launched until almost a year later on 16 May 1941. Shawinigan was commissioned on 19 September 1941 at Quebec City, Quebec. War service Upon entering active service, Shawinigan joined Sydney Force in November 1941. She served there until transferring to the Newfoundland Escort Force on 13 January 1942. She made three round trips across the Atlantic before being assigned to Halifax Force in June 1942. She spent only a few months before being assigned to WLEF. Almost simultaneous with her new assignment, she went for a major refit that was completed in March 1943. In June she joined EG W-3. In April 1944 she underwent another refit and transferred to EG W-2 and worked up in Bermuda. =Sinking= HMCS Shawinigan window CFB Halifax On 24 November 1944 Shawinigan and escorted the ferry Burgeo from Sydney to Port aux Basques. Sassafrass was detached from the escort without relief and Shawinigan was left alone. Shawinigan departed on an independent anti-submarine patrol and informed the ferry that it would meet her in the morning. The next morning Burgeo left Port aux Basques on schedule but in the fog, could not find Shawinigan. Keeping radio silence and without informing command of Shawinigan's lack of appearance, Burgeo made for Sydney unescorted. When Burgeo arrived at Sydney at 6 PM that night, the navy knew that something had happened to Shawinigan. Over the next three days searchers looked for survivors but could only find flotsam and eventually, six bodies. Shawinigan had been torpedoed by the during the early morning of 25 November in Cabot Strait. All 85 hands were lost.

The Constitution has remained unchanged since coming into effect on May 3, 1947, and many politicians are calling for a revision of Article 96 so that they can begin revising other, more central Articles (like Article 9).Politicians open debate on Article 96  The Japan TimesJapan Could Begin Real Constitutional Change after July - ForbesAbe seeks partners to pave way for constitutional revisions - AJW by The Asahi Shimbun  Text of the article  The full text of the article in Japanese, and its official English translation, reads: Debate The Japanese Constitution has not been revised since it was first created in 1947. By contrast, the United States has made six amendments since WWII.Constitution I  2013 ELECTION: JAPAN DECIDES  NHK WORLD TV Since then, many Japanese have advocated for revisions to numerous articles but they have been unable to gain the support of two-thirds (a supermajority) of both houses of the National Diet (both the House of Councillors and the House of Representatives), let alone the simple majority of the Japanese electorate in the subsequent referendum vote (as required by Article 96). As such, proponents of revision have set their sights on Article 96, hoping to revise it so that amendments no longer require a supermajority in the Diet.A Militarized Japan? The Quest to Revise Article 9 of Japan's Constitution  Unseen Japan The primary motive behind the revision of Article 96 appears to be the revision of Article 9, which \\"renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation\\" and promises that \\"land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained\\". However, other Articles (like Article 97 regarding fundamental human rights) have also been proposed for revision or deletion.Factbox: Key facts about Japan's constitution, proposed changes  Reuters Some scholars think Article 96 cannot be amended because this article defines the power to exercise constituent power which is a constituted power created by the constituent power, and constituent power itself cannot be changed by the Constitution. Hideki SHIBUTANI(渋谷秀樹)(2013) Japanese Constitutional Law. 2nd ed.(憲法 第2版) p35 Yuhikaku Publishing(有斐閣) Shinzo Abe, the former Prime Minister of Japan, has been a vocal proponent of revising Article 96, stating that \\"It's unfair that just more than one-third of lawmakers could block revisions even if 50 percent or more of the public want to amend the Constitution\\". Given that his Liberal Democratic Party controls both Houses of the National Diet (for the first time in nearly a decade), political pundits say that he has a fair chance to succeed.The LDP constitution, article by article: a preview of things to come?

He was also the father of Henry Lemoine, who took over his publishing business.Philip J. Bone, The Guitar and Mandolin, biographies of celebrated players and composers for these instruments, London: Schott and Co., 1914. Antoine Lemoine's father was a dramatic artist, who gave him his first elementary lessons on the guitar and violin, but beyond this rudimentary instruction Lemoine was self-taught. His father led a wandering, restless life. When Antoine Lemoine was sixteen-and-a- half years old he was married and for the next few years followed the example of his parents, wandering with his wife and obtaining a livelihood by violin and guitar playing. In 1781 he settled in Paris and obtained employment as violinist in the Theatre Montansier in Versailles; after playing in the orchestra for two years, he resigned this position to commence as a teacher of the guitar and violin in Paris. During the year 1789 he was worked in the Theatre Monsieur orchestra as alto player. In 1772, he began a music publishing business, called A l'Espérance (To Hope), which was continued after his death by his son Henry as Henry Lemoine and Company.Henokiens Association, Editions Henry Lemoine The business has flourished and by 1914 was well known for the number of good-quality compositions issued for the mandolin and guitar. In 1790 another publisher, Imbault of Paris, published several of Lemoine's compositions and theoretical works, including a method for the guitar. This rapidly passed several editions. Three years later Lemoine devoted himself entirely to music publishing, but after the revolution, he placed his business under capable management and officiated as conductor successively of the orchestras of the Theatre Molière, Mareux, and of the Rue Culture and St. Catherine. Although Lemoine had received no instruction in harmony or counterpoint, he successfully composed, arranged, and orchestrated all the music performed in these theatres. In 1795 he revised and augmented his method for the guitar, publishing this edition himself. Additionally, he, continued to write compositions for other publishers; he also issued about twenty-five of his own works, consisting of variations, potpourris, etc., for guitar solo and duos for guitar and violin. When the six-stringed guitar, constructed in the shape of a lyre and named the lyre-guitar, became fashionable at the beginning of the nineteenth century, Lemoine wrote and published (in 1805) a new elementary treatise for this instrument under the title of Method for the guitar of six strings, but a few years later his compositions for the guitar were eclipsed by those of Ferdinando Carulli. Lemoine, however, was fully aware of the superiority of the later works of this rising generation of guitar virtuosi and he was among the first to issue the compositions of Ferdinando Carulli, Fernando Sor, Luigi Sagrini, Dionisio Aguado, Mauro Giuliani, Joseph Küffner and Luigi Castellacci.

Visaitov was commander of 255th Separate Chechen–Ingush cavalry regiment during World War II. He was the first Soviet officer to radio-contact, meet, and shake hands with American forces under the command of General Bolling on the Elbe River, which Visaitov later joked about as \\"we came from Terek river to Elbe river\\". Both Bolling and Visaitov exchanged gifts: Visaitov gave Bolling his horse, and in return Bolling gave Visaitov a Willys MB utility vehicle. Visaitov received the Legion of Merit from US President Harry S. Truman. In 1946 Visaitov refused to participate in the plot to execute the Chechen dissident Abdurakhman Avtorkhanov who lived in Europe. He was deported to a prison settlement in the Kyrgyz SSR where many other deported Chechens and Ingush were located since 1944.  Early life  Visaitov was born on 13 May 1914 in the village of Lakha-Nevre in the Terek Oblast. He graduated from seven classes in 1931 at the village school. He graduated from the Grozny Co-Operative College in 1932, and worked as a store manager. In October 1932, he was drafted into the Red Army. Visaitov's birth date was changed to 1913, and his patrynomic to Aleroevich instead of Magomedovich. He served in a cavalry regiment in the North Caucasus Military District until February 1933, after which he graduated from the North Caucus Mountain Cavalry School of Krasnodar in January 1935 before graduating from the Ordzhonikidzevskaya Infantry School in November that same year. He was then assigned to the Kiev military District where he started as a platoon commander and left with the position of squadron commander. In September 1939 he saw combat during the Soviet invasion of Poland as a captain and squadron commander in the 34th Cavalry Regiment, which was at the time part of the 3rd Cavalry Division. He remained a squadron commander in Kiev until the end of 1940, and in May 1941 he completed further training in Rostov.  World War II  Not long after the launch of Operation Barbarossa Visaitov first saw combat against German forces in June 1941 as a squadron commander in the 34th Cavalry Regiment on the Southwestern Front. During the defense of Ukraine on 24 July 1941 he was wounded in the left shoulder and treated in a hospital until the end of August. After recovering he participated in the defense of Kiev as commander of a separate reconnaissance battalion of the 206th Rifle Division. On 19 September 1941 while the division was encircled near the city of Boryspil, Visaitov took command of over 200 men and managed to reunite them with troops in Donbas. He went on to take part in the defense of Rostov-on-Don before he sustained frostbite in his hand and severely injured his right leg in November 1941. He was sent to a hospital in Pyatigorsk where he remained recovering until the beginning of 1942, after which he was appointed as the chief of staff of the newly formed 255th Separate Chechen-Ingush Cavalry Regiment, which was initially placed under the command of Yaponts Abadiyev; later Abadiyev was appointed to a different position and Visaitov was made the commander of the regiment on 13 May 1942. From the very beginning of the Battle of Stalingrad the regiment saw heavy battle; on 3 August 1942 while covering the retreat of Soviet troops the regiment was engaged by the 78th Tank Corps of the Wehrmacht near Kotelnikovo. During the engagement the regiment took out four German tanks but suffered heavy losses from both German tanks and aviation-based attacks from numerically superior forces. Facing constant bombardment and high casualties, the regiment was forced to retreat, and after suffering further losses in Stalingrad the regiment was divided into two independent reconnaissance battalions for the 4th Cavalry Corps. Visaitov himself had expressed his disagreement with orders to send horsemen to fight against heavily armored German tanks, and he was punished for expressing such concerns; but members of his regiment appreciated that he did not want to lead them to a certain death. As the regiment was being dissolved, in October 1942 Visaitov was placed in command of one of the separate reconnaissance battalions, and remained in that position until January 1943, after which he was placed in charge of cavalry courses which trained junior lieutenants of the Southern Front. In September that same year he was reassigned again as an assistant inspector of cavalry, and fought in battles throughout Ukraine until he was expelled from his post into the reserve in May 1944 because he was Chechen; in February 1944 the entire Chechen nation was declared to be traitors, and the civilian population was deported to Central Asia. Visaitov was nearly executed at the warfront after he physically attacked General Oslikovsky who publicly shamed him front of his colleagues because of his ethnicity. The general had praised him, but when he heard his surname and realized he was Chechen, he ripped an epaulet off Visaitov's uniform and declared Chechens to be traitors. Visaitov fought back with a blow to Osilikovsky's face, and Visaitov was about to be shot for attacking the general when Pavel Brikel intervened and begged Oslikovsky to spare Visaitov. In September 1944 after protests from several Chechen servicemen of the Red Army in Moscow, Chechens including Visaitov were permitted to return to service in the Red Army. He was assigned as assistant commander of the 23rd Guards Cavalry Regiment, and in December he became commander of the 28th Guards Cavalry Regiment. He participated in the offensives of Mlavsko- Elbingskoy, East Pomeranian, and Berlin. During the Berlin operation his regiment was paired with tank and artillery units, and they broke through enemy lines in Schwedt on 27 April. As they continued to advanced they seized several towns, took out two enemy regiments, seized large amounts of enemy equipment, and liberated three concentration camps. On 2 May they reached the Elbe river, where Visaitov greeted American troops, and he was soon nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union. However, because he was Chechen he was only awarded the Order of Lenin at the time. Movlid Visaitov with his grandson For years after the victory he was not allowed to return to his home in Chechnya, and was sent to exile in Central Asia. In 1957 he was permitted to return to Chechnya, where he worked in agriculture. He later lived in Grozny and passed away on 23 May 1986 at the age of 72. On 5 May 1990 he was posthumously declared a Hero of the Soviet Union, after his nomination in 1945 had been rejected because of his nationality.

In a racing career which lasted from May 1999 until November 2000 she competed in seven countries and won six of her sixteen races. In the summer of 2000 she produced her best form, winning the German 1000 Guineas, Irish 1,000 Guineas, Coronation Stakes and Nassau Stakes. She was retired to stud at the end of the year and died in 2005 at the age of eight. Background Crimplene was a dark-coated chestnut filly with a white blaze bred in Ireland by her owner Marwan Al-Maktoum. She was one of the best horses sired by Lion Cavern, an American-bred stallion who won the Horris Hill Stakes and the Greenham Stakes when trained in France. Apart from Crimplene, the best of his offspring was the Australian sprinter Apache Cat. Crimplene's dam, Crimson Conquest, who won one minor race as a two-year-old, was descended from Bayrose, ancestor of the Poule d'Essai des Poulains winners Blue Tom and Fast Topaze. The filly was sent into training with Clive Brittain at his Carlburg stables at Newmarket, Suffolk and was ridden in most of her races by Philip Robinson. Racing career =1999: two-year-old season= Crimplene began her racing career by finishing second in a maiden race at Pontefract Racecourse on 18 May and then recorded her first success when taking a similar event at Redcar two weeks later. At the end of June, the filly was moved up to Listed class to finish third in the Empress Stakes over six furlongs at Newmarket. Despite her defeat, she was stepped up in class again in August, when she was sent to York Racecourse for the Lowther Stakes. Starting a 40/1 outsider, she pulled hard in the early stages before weakening to finish seventh of the nine runners behind the locally trained Jemima. Crimplene was then dropped in class for a minor stakes race at Salisbury Racecourse and won by a head from Forever Midnight. For her final start of the year, Crimplene was moved into the highest class when she contested the Group One Cheveley Park Stakes. Ridden by Frankie Dettori she again pulled hard in the early stages but finished strongly to finish third behind Seazun and Torgau. At the end of the season, representatives of Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin organisation purchased Brittain's Teggiano, the winner of the Fillies' Mile, but showed no interest in Crimplene. =2000: three-year-old season= Spring In March, Crimplene was sent to the United Arab Emirates and was matched against colts in the UAE Derby on dirt at Nad Al Sheba Racecourse. She turned into the straight in third place but faded in the closing stages to finish sixth of the sixteen runners behind China Visit. On her return to Europe she ran in the Fred Darling Stakes at Newbury Racecourse and finished third to Iftiraas, with the future 1000 Guineas winner Lahan in fourth place. Brittain later explained that the filly had been in season at the time of the race. She was then sent to Italy for the Premio Regina Elena in Rome where she finished third to the locally trained fillies Xua and Timi, after being roughly treated by the Italian stalls handlers. A week later Crimplene was in Düsseldorf for the Henckel-Rennen, Germany's equivalent of the 1000 Guineas. Drawn on the wide outside of the fifteen runner field, she took the lead after 400 metres, went clear of the field entering the straight, and won by four lengths from the Irish-trained Margay. Racing in her fifth country in a little over two months, Crimplene's next appearance was in the Irish 1000 Guineas at the Curragh Racecourse on 28 May. Starting aa a 16/1 outsider she took the lead soon after the start and was never headed, winning by one and a half lengths from the Aidan O'Brien-trained Amethyst, with Storm Dream third and Seazun fourth. After the race Brittain hugged the filly amid a shower of hailstones and commented \\"that should have been three Guineas\\", referring to her treatment in Italy. Summer Iftiraas, Seazun, Amethyst and the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches winner Blumamba were among Crimplene's rivals when she contested the Group One Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot on 23 June. She was made 4/1 joint- favourite with the French-trained Zarkiya, the winner of the Prix de Sandringham. Robinson sent Crimplene into the lead from the start and went clear of the field in the straight to win by two and a half lengths from Princess Ellen. After the race Robinson said: \\"This filly seems to thrive on racing. She'll be going all over the world. She just loves it\\". Brittain described the winner as \\"a bit like me... people have underestimated her\\". In August, Crimplene was moved up in distance and matched against older fillies and mares in the ten furlong Nassau Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse. Starting the 7/4 favourite, she took the lead at half way and went five lengths clear of her opponents in the straight. She began to tire in the closing stages but held on to win by one and three quarter lengths from the four-year-old Ela Athena. Commenting on the filly's fourth consecutive major victory, Brittain said: \\"There may have been a doubt about whether we were right to go a mile and a quarter, but as I said before the race, when you've got an animal of class they can go any distance\\". Robinson felt that the filly did not truly stay the distance but won on \\"sheer guts\\". Eight days later Crimplene was sent to France to contest the Prix Jacques Le Marois over 1600 metres at Deauville Racecourse. She led for most of the race, but was overtaken in the last 400 metres and finished fourth behind the five-year-old horse Muhtathir. Autumn On 23 September, Crimplene was the only female in the field of twelve for the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot. She raced in second place for much of the way before weakening in the straight and finishing eighth behind Observatory, who won by half a length from Giant's Causeway. Crimplene's final racecourse appearance came on 4 November, when she was sent to the United States for the Breeders' Cup Distaff over nine furlongs on dirt at Churchill Downs. Starting as a 42/1 outsider, she reached third place in the straight before finishing fourth behind the American filly Spain. Assessment Clive Brittain called Crimplene \\"one of the toughest fillies I have trained, and ranks alongside Pebbles and Sayyedati as one of the best\\". In the International Classification for 2000, Crimplene was given a rating of 119, making her the best three-year-old filly in Europe over one mile. Stud record Crimplene was retired from racing to become a broodmare for the Darley Stud. Her first foal was Crimson Sun, sired by Danzig, who won two minor races and finished second in the Somerville Tattersall Stakes. In 2005, Crimplene died from complications after giving birth to a foal by Storm Cat.

The resulting company would have been called Publicis Omnicom Group, and would have been the world's biggest advertising group with market capitalisation of $35.1 billion, pro-forma revenue of $22.7 billion, and more than 130,000 employees across the world. After the merger, Publicis Omnicom and WPP would have been the largest advertising groups in the world., followed at a distance by Dentsu and Interpublic Group of Companies. The Publicis and Omnicom chief executives heralded the proposed operation as a \\"merger of equals\\" saying that Publicis and Omnicom shareholders will each hold about 50 percent of the new group's equity. The group would have had head offices in Paris and New York. The deal was called off in mutual agreement by both sides on 9 May 2014 after a relationship breakdown in proposal.  Merger  = Rationale = The unexpected merger was proposed by Maurice Lévy, CEO of Publicis. The mega- merger puts together Publicis with Omnicom, respectively with $8.8 and $14.2 billion in revenues in 2012, and a market capitalisation of $14.6 billion and $16.7 billion at the announcement. This compares with WPP, who recorded $15.6 billion in 2012 revenues and has market capitalisation of around $20 billion. On a pro-forma basis, the merged entity becomes the biggest advertising group on the market, and would have around $5 billion more revenue than the current market leader. The merger consolidates the sector, as it pulls the two largest, Publicis Omnicom and WPP, significantly ahead of the next largest – Interpublic Group, Dentsu and Havas. In a reference to the increasingly powerful new media giants Google and :Facebook, Lévy noted the merger was a response to the sea-change in the communication and marketing landscape and the blurring the roles of all players, to the benefit of clients. Publicis stated that $500 million in synergies would be generated. Although Omnicom generated more top-line revenues than Publicis, its profit margin is only 15% compared to 18% achieved by Publicis. Thus Lévy was able to leverage this and obtain half of the new company for Publicis shareholders in an \\"equal\\" merger\\". Sir Martin Sorrell, head of WPP, praised the \\"extremely bold and brave and surprising move\\", but expressed reservations about the different cultures to be merged. = Organization = The proposed company would be listed on stock exchanges in both Paris and New York, corresponding to the previous headquarters of Publicis and Omnicom respectively, and the OMC ticker on the NYSE retained. However, Lévy stated that for reasons of neutrality (and not tax), the new holding was to be registered in the Netherlands. The merger, which received unanimous approval of both boards, would close in late 2013 or early 2014. The 71-year-old Maurice Lévy would jointly head the group with Ominicom's John Wren during the initial integration and development period lasting 30 months, after which Levy would become non-executive chairman and Wren sole CEO. The board would have equal representation from Publicis and Omnicom, its 16 directors include both Lévy and Wren. = Ownership = The Publicis and Omnicom chief executives heralded the proposed operation as a \\"merger of equals\\" saying that Publicis and Omnicom shareholders will collectively each hold about 50 percent of the new group's equity. Trade press reported the unwillingness of Élisabeth Badinter, daughter of Publicis' founder Marcel Bleustein-Blanchet and chairman of the supervisory board of Publicis, to exit – she apparently refused to be bought out by a banking syndicate. However, as the largest shareholder of Publicis, she is expected to have her 9.13 percent holding of the company diluted by half as a result of the merger.\\"Publicis-Omnicom Merger Set\\". AdWeek, 26 July 2013 Omnicom CEO John Wren is reported as holding 1.1 million Omnicom shares, and considerable number of stock options that a change of control would crystallise. = Concerns = The deal is subject to regulatory approval, although the French government has indicated its support, according to Lévy. As the deal will bring together worldwide networks like BBDO, TBWA and DDB from Omnicom as well as Leo Burnett, Publicis, Saatchi & Saatchi under a single holding company, there exists potential for client conflict. AdWeek notes that PepsiCo is handled by Omnicom's TBWA\\\\Chiat\\\\Day and the Coca-Cola account resides at Publicis' Leo Burnett. Similarly, AT&T; is with Omnicom and Verizon with Publicis. Some commentators have expressed concern, with Craig Le Grice of The Drum saying that it will be \\"creating a sector essentially owned by two holding companies\\", but not all industry observers are equally worried. Wren believes that the merger would \\"create value and new opportunities\\".  Cancellation of merger  The expected completion of the merger in late 2013 failed to materialise, and created great uncertainty for the industry players. In May 2014, it was announced that the merger would no longer go ahead due to the magnitude of challenges yet remaining. The announcement was made in a statement released jointly from the two chief executives of Publicis and Omnicom. Reuters reported that the two holding companies' agencies had been losing billions in business pitches due to the uncertainty, and that business worth $1.5 billion had been lost just in the last month prior to the decision to cancel, and that WPP agencies had aggressively cut fees to gain new business from their rivals, but this was denied by Omnicom From the start, huge difficulties were foreseen for a merger of this magnitude, most importantly different corporate cultures and management philosophies. There were known to have been significant tax issues. While Wren was keen to emphasise in explaining the collapse that \\"there was no one factor\\" at play responsible, Lévy indicated the deal-breaker was Omnicom's insistence on keeping all three top posts for its own executives. Lévy said: \\"it is not a merger of equals if you have a CEO, CFO and general counsel only from one side\\". While Omnicom has a more devolved organisation and lower margins than its counterpart, it is known that Publicis enjoys higher net margins and does so through greater centralisations; the CFO position would have been a key determinant in the merged organisation.

She came into public view after launching a massive drive against corruption and illegal sand mining within her jurisdiction of Gautam Budh Nagar. She was later suspended by the Uttar Pradesh government for allegedly demolishing an illegal mosque wall in a village in Greater Noida, which resulted in severe opposition as it was perceived to be based on flimsy grounds. There was a growing demand from various political parties, associations of Indian bureaucrats, and by the general public on online social media for her suspension to be revoked. Her suspension was revoked by the Uttar Pradesh government on 22 September 2013. Nagpal was appointed in the Agriculture Ministry as OSD (Officer on Special Duty) to the Union Agriculture & Farmers Welfare Minister, Radha Mohan Singh in January 2015. Since 19 July 2019, she is working as the Deputy Secretary in the Department of Commerce, Ministry of Commerce & Industry, Government of India. Background Durga Nagpal was born in Agra, Uttar Pradesh on 25 June 1985. Her father is a retired government officer who was awarded the President's Medal for distinguished service at the Delhi Cantonment Board. Her grandfather was a police officer who was murdered in 1954 while on duty in Sadar Bazaar, Delhi. She graduated from the Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University in 2007 with an undergraduate degree in computer engineering. She obtained an All India Rank of 20 in the UPSC Civil Services Examination in 2009, after which she joined the Indian Administrative Service (IAS). In her first attempt to pass the civil service exam, she was accepted into the Indian Revenue Service, but chose to take the UPSC exam another time. She is married to Abhishek Singh, who is also an IAS officer. She met Singh while preparing for the UPSC examinations in 2009. Career Nagpal began her career in the Punjab cadre of the IAS. She joined the Mohali district administration in June 2011, and served there for fourteen months. As a trainee IAS officer in Punjab, she exposed a land scam in Mohali. In August 2012, she moved to the Uttar Pradesh (UP) cadre as the Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM) of Sadar, Noida, after marrying Abhishek Singh. She was later appointed as the SDM in Gautam Budh Nagar. She came into public notice after acting against the \\"sand mafia\\" in Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh by forming special investigation teams to stop the illegal sand-mining in the Yamuna and Hindon river banks. Under her leadership, the administration confiscated 24 dumper trucks and 300 trolleys used in illegal operations, and arrested 15 people who were fined . =Crackdown on illegal mining= Most of the sand- mining activity in the NCR region, comprising Noida (Uttar Pradesh), Faridabad (Haryana) and Delhi, is illegal as no environment impact assessment (EIA) has been carried out, and it is estimated that about 250 to 350 truckloads of sand is illegally dredged every day. The cost of this sand varies from per month to per annum. According to environmentalists and engineers, the massive amount of mining is responsible for soil-erosion and changing the natural flow of the Hindon and Yamuna, which shifted its course by about 500 metres toward east and posed a threat to flood embankments in six sectors of Noida. A \\"Special Mining Squad\\" was established by the Noida district administration to curb sand mining and was expected to succeed, but high demand of sand for increased construction activity, police inaction and the political nexus with the \\"sand mafia\\" has ensured that various rules to safeguard the environment are regularly flouted. After receiving many complaints of dredging in the Yamuna and Hindon rivers banks, the UP Chief Minister's office in Lucknow asked the GB Nagar district administration to prevent further illegal activity. Nagpal, as the SDM, oversaw a large operation to stop illegal sand mining in the district, and used surprise and secrecy to arrest illegal miners and to confiscate their machinery. On 23 July 2013, Nagpal had said that she would take strict action against dredgers engaged in illegal mining, adding that such activity could affect the environment adversely. Since April 2013, the Uttar Pradesh Police had filed 17 FIRs and the Chief Judicial magistrate had ordered the arrest of illegal sand miners in 22 cases. From April to June 2013, the police had impounded 297 vehicles and machinery used for illegal mining and collected Rs in fines. Under Nagpal, a joint operation involving the revenue, police and transport departments was launched and villages of Asgarpur, Nangla Wajidpur, Gulavli, Kambakshpur, Jaganpur Chaproli were monitored. On 25 July, the government transferred the mining officer of the GB Nagar district Ashish Kumar, who was assisting Nagpal, to Bulandshahr. Before being transferred, Kumar survived three attempts on his life, the last one was on 9 February 2013. Nagpal was also targeted on 26 April 2013, during a visit to the Kasna police station. These attacks were attributed to the \\"sand mafia\\" operating in the district. On the night of 29 July 2013, the Gautam Buddha Nagar police arrested 15 persons and confiscated 26 vehicles in the district and registered seven cases, some of which were in Dankaur and Greater Noida areas. =Suspension= Nagpal was suspended on 28 July 2013, a day after she allegedly demolished a wall of an under-construction mosque in Kadalpur village, in the Rabupura area of Greater Noida. The construction of the mosque had not been cleared by the state government. Whether Nagpal was actually involved in the demolition of the wall, and whether she was justified in her actions even if she was, are disputed. Her supporters and most of the media sources claim that Nagpal did not order the demolition of the wall and was not even present at the site when the incident happened. According to them, she was targeted due to her campaign against illegal sand-mining, and allegations of Nagpal's involvement in the demolition are false. However, there are other sources which quote residents of Kadalpur village claiming that Nagpal personally supervised the demolition of the wall. On 16 August, Nagpal submitted her reply to the chargesheet filed by the UP government, in which she declared herself innocent and said that her action was within the rules of service and as per the directions of the Supreme Court. On 28 August, Noida district magistrate Ravikant Singh, who backed Nagpal's actions, was transferred from his post and was put on a wait list. =Suspension revoked= Nagpal, accompanied by her husband Abhishek Singh, met Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on 21 September 2013 for the first time since her suspension. Her suspension was revoked by the UP government on 22 September 2013, and she joined as Joint Magistrate of Kanpur (Rural) on 5 October 2013. =Targeting of Family= On 11 October 2014, Nagpal's husband, Abhishek Singh, also a bureaucrat was suspended. Abhishek Singh was the SDM (Sub Divisional Magistrate) in Mahawan, Mathura, was suspended by the chief minister Akhilesh Yadav, for allegedly treating a teacher, Fauran Singh, in an inhuman manner. Abhishek Singh denies the charges, while the government refuses to elaborate further on what inhuman actions he was guilty of. Reactions to her suspension =Public= The administrative actions and subsequent suspension of Nagpal received widespread attention in India. She was widely praised for making efforts to clean up the corruption in the Indian political system. References were made with the Hindu goddess Durga for taking action against the politically well-connected sand-mining mafia and real estate barons. According to Surinder S. Jodhka, professor and chair at the Centre for the Study of Social Systems in Jawaharlal Nehru University, the protest after Nagpal's suspension are due to the growing discontent within India's growing middle-class with criminalisation in politics. Due to the public protests, the UP government had to engage in damage control, highlighting its welfare schemes and announcing that it is considering to set up a task force to check illegal mining. Kiran Bedi and large number of people on social media like Facebook and Twitter protested against the IAS officer's suspension. Several serving and retired IAS officers like former Central Vigilance Commissioner (CVC) N. Vittal, former cabinet secretaries T. S. R. Subramanian and Naresh Chandra, and former Comptroller and Auditor General Vinod Rai came out in support of Nagpal, calling her actions bold and courageous, and asked the Chief Secretary to revoke her suspension. The All India IAS Association, a national body of IAS officers, termed the government's actions \\"wrong\\" and believes that Nagpal was suspended due to her stringent actions which hurt the sand-mafia. It has demanded immediate revocation of her suspension, and called the incident \\"demoralising\\" for young IAS officers. The collective voicing of these concerns by the state's IAS officers was deemed unusual and surprised the ruling Samajwadi Party. Senior officers have attributed this backlash to the general feeling of discontentment in the officer cadre, which they say is due to increasing political interference in public administration. On 1 August, in a rare act, thousands of IAS officers filed a petition to the Department of personnel and training, demanding intervention by the Central government to direct the UP government to revoke Durga's suspension. On 5 August 2013, reacting to the suspension of Nagpal, the National Green Tibunal ordered a pan-India suspension of all sand mining activity carried without a license from the Ministry of Environment and Forests. =Political parties= Since Nagpal's suspension came to public view, it has been alleged that Samajwadi Party leader Narendra Bhati, who had cabinet-minister rank as the then chairperson of the UP State Agro Industrial Corporation Limited, was responsible for getting her abruptly suspended because he was frustrated by Nagpal's drive against illegal mining. Bhati was later recorded on video boasting about getting the officer suspended within 40 minutes. Other leaders of the Samajwadi party such as Azam Khan and Naresh Agarwal had issued statements supporting the suspension order. The then opposition parties in the state of Uttar Pradesh, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party accused the state government of ignoring the rule of law and protecting criminals. The former president of the BJP Nitin Gadkari criticised the action as \\"... fanning communal and caste-based sentiments\\" and \\"harassing a good officer for vote bank politics...\\" The BJP in Uttar Pradesh asked the state's then Governor BL Joshi to intervene and revoke the suspension. On 2 August 2013, the Indian National Congress condemned the suspension order and said that public reactions of Samajwadi Party leaders supporting the suspension order, indicated that those orders were dictated by the sand mining mafia. However, it also criticised the \\"arbitrary demolition\\" of the mosque's wall. UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi wrote a letter to the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, demanding fair treatment of the officer. =State government= The Samajwadi Party government said in a statement that Nagpal was suspended for demolishing a mosque's wall and the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Akhilesh Yadav justified the order saying that Nagpal's actions \\"lacked foresight and disturbed communal harmony\\" and she was suspended due to \\"administrative compulsion to ease communal tension\\". This was later refuted by reports that the area had not reported any communal tension. The Station Officer of Rabupura police station said that since the demolition took place in night, most residents were not even aware of the incident. The demolition was reportedly executed in compliance to Supreme Court orders forbidding construction of illegal religious structures on public land. The court, in a judgement passed in 2009 had ruled that \\"no new temples, mosques, churches and gurdwaras can be constructed on public parks, public streets and public spaces\\" and \\"the ban must be enforced even if it gave rise to a law and order problem.\\" According to the report on the demolition incident submitted by Ravikant Singh, District Magistrate (DM) of Greater Noida to the UP government, Nagpal did not demolish a wall of any religious structure, in fact there was no religious structure in place. The construction of the wall had just begun, and on being warned by Ms. Nagpal of the structure being constructed on government land, the local residents decided to dismantle the constructed wall themselves. The report called Nagpal's actions \\"blemish- free\\". The report also says that there was no communal tension or the possibility of any clashes between religious communities. The UP government appointed a committee to verify the DM's report. After the IAS officers' association protested on 29 July, Uttar Pradesh Chief Secretary said that the suspension order would be reviewed, but despite the assurances, no decision has been taken. After the suspension, Nagpal was attached to the Board of Revenue in Lucknow, the state capital. =Kadalpur= The residents of Kadalpur village however challenged the anti-corruption narrative in the media, and say that the suspension order was justified. They even threatened to protest if she is reinstated. They said that the mosque was being built on gram sabha land and they had got the panchayat's approval, adding that they were unaware about seeking permission for it. The construction of the mosque was started in 2011, hence they questioned the delayed response of the authorities. Stressing on Nagpal's \\"high-handedness\\" and getting the police to demolish it, they said they requested more time to obtain the construction permission, which she rejected. On the District Magistrate's report to the UP government, they claimed that he did not contact them or any of the panchayat officials. They said that donations for the construction of temples and mosques were given by everyone, and they aim to re-build the mosque. Dhirendra Singh, spokesperson for the Uttar Pradesh Congress party, said that the villagers were not aware of the Supreme Court rulings and it was the duty of the administration to direct them into getting permission and at least stop the construction temporarily. The majority of the villagers are Muslims and the rest are Hindus, and there is a minimal threat for communal violence there. A month later the villagers said they felt cheated by the UP government since permission to build it was still not given; they blamed the Samajwadi Party leaders for unnecessarily punishing her. They said that the party leaders should have got them permission to build the mosque at that time, preventing this incident from happening. =Public-interest litigations= The suspension order of Nagpal was challenged in the Allahabad High Court on 30 July 2013 through a Public interest litigation (PIL). The petition was filed by social activist Nutan Thakur at the Lucknow bench of the court. It also requested the court to direct the central government to ask the state governments to prevent harassment of those officers who have ordered action against illegal construction of religious places, and illegal mining. On 1 August, the court ruled that the suspension is not a matter of a PIL, and the officer should directly approach the court. It however praised her work in preventing illegal sand mining and ordered both the central and the state government to report how they are tackling illegal mining and what security is being provided to the officers engaged in stopping it. On 8 August, the Supreme Court of India accepted a PIL filed by an advocate M. L. Sharma. The PIL sought to dismiss all charges against Nagpal and argued that Nagpal was suffering hardship for following the court's rulings in 2009 and 2010 regarding demolition of illegal religious structures. On 16 August, the court refused to accept the PIL, questioning the standing of the lawyer, but saying that \\"it may entertain the petition if she (Nagpal) herself approaches the court.\\" The court also sought an explanation from the UP government for arresting Kanwal Bharti, a scholar who allegedly wrote a post on Facebook in support of Nagpal. The central government had passed an advisory notification based on an earlier order of the court which said that a person cannot be arrested for posting objectionable comments on social networking sites without taking permission from a high-ranking police official. =Intervention by central government= On 31 July, the central government said that they are awaiting a detailed report on her suspension from the state within 15 days. The Minister of State for Personnel V. Narayanasamy, during a meeting with a delegation from All India IAS Officers' Association assured that justice will be done to Ms. Nagpal. He later assured that both version of the incident will be taken into account before reaching a decision. As per the All India Services (Discipline And Appeal) Rules, 1969, the UP government cannot keep her under suspension for more than 90 days, pending disciplinary proceedings, without the consent of Central Government.All India Services (Discipline And Appeal) Rules, 1969 On 5 August 2013, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said that the central government had asked the UP government to provide details of the case. On 19 August, associations of the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Indian Police Service (IPS) and Indian Forest Service (IFoS) met with the Secretary of Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) S K Sarkar and demanded that the central government should modify the rules related to suspension of bureaucrats by state governments, as those rules were widely abused. The three associations want the central government instead of various state governments to have the authority to suspend any All India Services officer. On 20 August, the central government decided not to intervene in the suspension of Nagpal, as she did not appeal or challenge the suspension order given by the Uttar Pradesh government. Since Nagpal's suspension on 27 July, the centre had issued three reminders to the UP government, seeking a detailed report. On 4 August, the UP government had sent a report on Nagpal's suspension to the DoPT and had served a chargesheet to Nagpal, which deemed her actions as unwarranted and in violation of rules.

Webb was the son of John Webb, merchant and alderman of Gloucester, and his wife Jane Greville, daughter of Giles Greville of Gloucester. He was a mercer of Gloucester and became progressively freeman of Gloucester in 1685, sheriff for the year 1690 to 1691, alderman in 1695 and Mayor of Gloucester for the year 1701 to 1702. From 1702 to 1706, he was receiver-general of land tax for Gloucestershire. Webb was returned as Member of Parliament (MP) for Gloucester at the 1708 British general election. He was a very inactive Member in the House, presumably because he was involved in supporting the Tories in local affairs for which he was deemed indispensable. He voted against the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell in 1710. On the appointment of the Tory ministry he applied to Harley to be restored to his post as receiver-general, which had been taken from him by the Whigs, but to no avail. He was returned for Gloucester at the 1710 British general election with the support of Dr Knightley Chetwode, dean of the city, and the Duke of Beaufort. He was included as a ‘worthy patriot’ who helped to detect the mismanagements of the previous administration, and as one of the ‘Tory patriots’ who voted for the peace. He was also a member of the October Club. He was frequently absent from Parliament because of corporation affairs. In October 1712 he was issued with an Exchequer writ for £27,000 of land tax receipts which he was alleged to be still holding. The allegation was probably Whig ploy to disrupt the Tories’ electoral arrangements, since it was said that the general understanding was that ‘no receiver in England hath made better payments than Alderman Webb'. He was however persuaded to stand down at the 1713 British general election in favour of a wealthier Tory candidate. However promises of good posts, as a reward, never materialized. Webb died unmarried on 26 March 1734, aged 71, and he was buried at St Michael's, Gloucester.

Throughout the war he killed a total of 349 enemy combatants for which he was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union just shortly before he was deported to the Kazakh SSR solely on the grounds of his Chechen ethnicity. He was only able to return to his native village in Chechnya in 1957 where he worked in agriculture after the Chechen nation was granted the right of return in the Khrushchev era.  Early life  Idrisov was born on 17 May 1918 in Berdikel, Mountain Republic (present-day Komsomolskoye, Chechenya) to a Chechen peasant family. He graduated from primary school and worked as a shepherd at the Sovetskaya Rossiya collective farm.  Military career  Idrisov was drafted into the Red Army in October 1939 and assigned to the 125th Rifle Division in the Baltic states. He received training as a machine-gunner and saw combat from the first day of the German-Soviet War during the defense against Operation Barbarossa. With the rest of his regiment he retreated Northeast. In July 1941, his Division took up defensive positions on the Pskov-Velikiye Luki line between Lake Ilmen and Lake Seliger. There, they repulsed frequent German attacks against Leningrad; Idrisov was reported to have killed 22 German soldiers with his machine gun, resulting in him being sent for training to become a sniper. After completing sniper training he was assigned in October 1942 to a sniper group positioned on a section of the North-Western Front where Axis forces were expected to advance. In a period of ten days of intense fighting Idrisov managed to kill approximately 100 enemy infantrymen as a sniper. By April 1943 he was reported to have killed over 300 German soldiers in total, while serving with the 1232nd Rifle Regiment of the 370th Rifle Division. After participating in the breakthrough of the blockade in Leningrad he fought in the offensives to retake the Pskov region and Baltic states. By March 1944 his tally as reported by his superiors totaled 349 kills and he had been nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union. Idrisov was demobilized in April after he was seriously wounded by a fragment of a mine that exploded next to him. He survived due to his fellow soldiers finding him unconscious and sending him to a hospital, and on 3 June 1944 he was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union. At a military exhibition his rifle and wartime photographs were put on display with the title \\"The glorious son of the Chechen people, Hero of the Soviet Union Abukhazhi Idrisov, destroyed more than three hundred German fascists.\\"  Postwar life and exile  Despite his awards and honors for serving loyally in the Red Army he was deported to Kazakhstan after spending four months in the Gorky hospital recovering from his wounds. While in exile he lived in Southwest Kazakhstan and worked on a farm as a sheep breeder. He returned to Chechnya immediately after being granted the right of return and became a member of the Communist Party in 1962. He lived in Chechnya for the remainder of his life and died in Grozny on 22 October 1983.

He immigrated from Germany to Skien around 1540. He came as a mining administrator at a time when King Christian III of Denmark tried without success to establish a mining industry in Bratsberg (now Telemark). He subsequently became a pioneer in the timber industry in the district as an owner of several sawmills and a major timber merchant. He organized efforts to make water flows from the Hjellevannet on the lower water basin in the Skien watercourse (Skiensvassdraget) to the Skien River (Skienselva) so that water could drive recovery saws. He established sawmills and the timber trade rose sharply in Skien. He was cited as mayor of Skien in 1568, 1570 and 1578. His considerable fortune was largely derived from the number of properties he owned in the city and district. These properties were divided between his five daughters whose descendants dominated the commercial life in Skien into the 17th century as timber merchants and estate owners. Among his descendants were Anne Clausdatter (1659–1713) who owned Borgestad Manor and Christian Cornelius Paus (1800–1879) who was Governor of Bratsberg.

Early life and family Nether Lypiatt Manor House Coxe was the second son of John Coxe of Tarlton, Gloucestershire and his wife Deborah Driver, daughter of John Driver of Avening, Gloucestershire. He matriculated at St. Edmund Hall, Oxford on 10 July 1674, at the age of 13. He then entered Lincoln's Inn in 1677 to study law and was called to the bar in 1684. In 1692, he succeeded to his father's estates. He married Catherine Chamberlain, the daughter and heiress of John Chamberlain of Wainborough, Wiltshire and his wife Ann Freame, daughter of Thomas Freame of Lower Lypiatt, on 15 February 1693. He thereby acquired the manor of Nether Lypiatt in 1699. As a lawyer Coxe was Clerk of the Letters Patent from 1699 to his death and serjeant-at-law from 1700. Career In 1698, Coxe was returned as Member of Parliament for Cirencester. He was returned unopposed at the first general election of 1701. Subsequently, he was blacklisted for opposing preparations for war. Returned again at the second general election of 1701 he was classified as a Tory. He had a close friendship with Harley through which he was appointed a puisne justice in June 1702 among the Tory appointments that followed the accession of Queen Anne. He was returned unopposed for Cirencester at the 1702 general election. In 1704 he was promoted to chief justice of Brecknock on the South Wales circuit through Harley's influence. At the 1705 general election Coxe was involved in a double return at Cirencester with Henry Ireton. He petitioned but then withdrew on 15 November, leaving Ireton to be declared duly elected. It was claimed that he did so to avoid a scrutiny by the House of the bribery that been practised by both sides, which would have damaged his position as a judge. Coxe recovered his seat at Cirencester at the 1708 general election, but his election was declared void on 10 December 1709. He was successfully returned in the subsequent by-election on 23 December 1709. At the 1710 general election he was returned again for Cirencester. His former partner at Cirencester, Allen Bathurst, was raised to the peerage in 1712. At the 1713 Bathurst asked Coxe to make way for one of his brothers at Cirenccester, while the other seat was taken by Thomas Master. Coxe was forced to transfer to Gloucester where Thomas Webb, one of the sitting Members, was persuaded to give up his seat, and Coxe was elected as MP for the constituency. With the change of regime in 1714 Coxe was dismissed from his post as judge, but was returned again as MP for Gloucester at the 1715 general election. He voted consistently against the government. He did not stand at the 1722 general election. Death and legacy Coxe built the present house of Nether Lypiatt manor in 1717. The house is now Grade I listed. He died on 17 October 1728 and was buried at Rodmarton. He and his wife had four sons and two daughters. He left the house at Lower Lypiatt and his estate at Tarlton to his son John, while he left his three manors and various other lands near Cirencester and Stroud to his grandson.

Beginning as a television broadcaster in 1957, the company expanded into newspapers, advertising and radio; after completing a restructuring in 2010, STV Group is active in broadcast television, video-on-demand and television production. The company is a constituent of the FTSE SmallCap Index. History SMG's last logo before rebrand Scottish Television began broadcasting in August 1957. The company changed its name to Scottish Media Group in 1996 when it acquired Caledonian Publishing, owners of Glasgow-based newspapers The Herald and Evening Times (both of which have since been sold). It went on to acquire the ITV licence holder for Northern Scotland, Grampian Television in June 1997.Scottish Media seeks to loosen ties with ITV. Eric Reguly. The Times (London, England), Wednesday, 11 June 1997 In August 1997 the company acquired a 15% stake in UTV, Northern Ireland.Scottish buys into Ulster TVBuckingham, LisaThe Guardian (1959–2003); 15 Aug 1997 In 1999 it launched a new Sunday broadsheet newspaper, the Sunday Herald. The company was renamed \\"SMG plc\\" in 2000, by which time it had expanded further through the acquisitions of Primesight (outdoor advertising), Pearl & Dean and Ginger Media Group, which included Ginger Television and the original Virgin Radio UK radio station. Talks were also held which could have led to Border Television and Ulster Television being bought, but they came to nothing. On 24 March 1999, Mirror Group sold its 18.6% stake in SMG to Granada. During the summer, the STV Group held talks about buying out the other shareholders in GMTV, with Disney believed to be keen on the idea; many city observers believed this was a defensive move to fend off a takeover bid from Granada. By September an agreement had been reached to acquire Guardian Media Group's 15% stake in GMTV for £20 million, but both Carlton and Granada objected to the deal. Guardian Media Group eventually sold its stake for £18m in January 2000, but STV Group only acquired 5% with the remaining 10% going to Carlton and Granada, resulting in each of STV Group, Carlton, Granada and Disney holding 25% of GMTV. In September 1999, the company acquired a 37.4% stake in Heart of Midlothian F.C. for £8 million. A few days later the company unveiled its interim results with its pre-tax profits up 2 per cent to £24 million on a turnover of £111.2 million. In December 2000, the group acquired a 14.9% stake in Scottish Radio Holdings, in anticipation of a relaxation of radio ownership rules and within four months increased this to 27.7%. By 2004 the company sold their 27.8% stake in Scottish Radio Holdings to EMAP for £90 million in anticipation of consolidation in the radio market. Flextech owner Telewest sold its 16.9% stake in STV Group to an investment bank for £45 million as part of their plan to raise funds to help clear off debt. Throughout 2003/2004 rumours appeared about the company being broken up, with its ITV interests being sold off in an attempt to wipe out its £380m debt and boost its balance sheet. However, the group instead sold the Herald newspapers and its stake in Scottish Radio Holdings. In late 2003 Northern Ireland's UTV, in partnership with venture capital group 3i and Scottish Radio Holdings, sought to acquire SMG for £400 million, but they withdrew the offer as they felt the share price was too high. In September 2004, ITV plc purchased STV Group's 25% stake in GMTV for £31 million, after being given the go ahead from the Office of Fair Trading, despite advertiser fears it could give ITV influence over pricing. SMG said \\"SMG are pulling out of GMTV because it did not want to hold a minority interest in someone else's media business\\". Andrew Flanagan unexpectedly resigned as chief executive in July 2006. Although he helped create the company since 1998, his spell in charge will be remembered by many in the television industry as a period which saw a dramatic decline in the amount of programmes made by the company for transmission within Scotland alone. Rob Woodward became the new chief executive in 2007, and started a major reconstruction of the group by instigating a sell-off of poorly performing assets, starting with Primesight being sold for £62m to a private equity firm. SMG said in a statement that the price GMT Communications Partners paid represented a \\"clear uplift\\" on offers previously received for Primesight. Primesight have been prosecuted a number of times for the display of advertisements without consent which is an offence under UK Planning Acts. The lack of consent for many of Primesight's displays is said to have reduced the selling price by up to £30 million. Further major changes occurred when STV Group sold Virgin Radio to a group led by The Times of India on 31 May 2008. In June 2008, SMG plc announced plans to change its name to STV Group plc. The company said the proposed name change was to highlight its renewed focus on television, encompassing the STV Central and STV North franchises, as well as the company's TV production business. This name change was approved at an extraordinary general meeting in September 2008, along with a new deal resulting in Pearl & Dean handling advertising for Showcase Cinemas, which meant that the Pearl & Dean titles would appear in just under half of UK cinema sites. The new STV Group branding was introduced on 1 October 2008. By 2010 the group had sold off all non-television assets, including selling cinema advertising company Pearl & Dean for £1 to Image Ltd, a newly formed company backed by Empire Cinemas director Thomas Anderson, with STV still recouping £9.1m from the business due to a 2010 payment from Vue Cinemas. This action helped reduce the group's debt and allowed it to concentrate on its core television businesses. As a result of this, STV Group largely reverted to its Scottish Television plc days, but with the addition of the former Grampian Television and Ginger Productions businesses (the latter retained from the Ginger Media acquisition). =Merger proposals= In September 2006, STV Group (then SMG) officially rejected a merger offer from Northern Irish ITV franchise holder UTV. The merger approach would have given SMG shareholders a 52% stake in the combined company. The Scottish group said its board had examined a revised merger proposal from UTV, but did not believe it reflected the value of the company. In 2006 ITV plc considered making an offer for STV Group, according to The Mail on Sunday. The newspaper quoted an ITV source as saying John Cresswell, acting chief executive at the broadcaster, was most interested in the group's television franchises, but that any deal would have been for the whole group. SMG warned that its 2006 profit would be materially behind expectations, sending its shares down more than a quarter in value to a 15-year low. On 10 January 2007, SMG and UTV agreed details of a merger, including a revised share split between the two. UTV would own 54% of the group, with SMG owning the remaining 46%. This merger was finally rejected at the end of February 2007, and a new board and management team were introduced at SMG shortly afterwards. =Relationship with ITV plc= In September 2009, ITV plc announced it was to launch legal proceedings against STV for a claimed unpaid debt of £38 million from network programming contributions, following STV's practice of dropping a number of network programmes on the STV franchise. At the same time, STV claimed it was also following procedures against ITV plc, for up to £40 million owed to STV under its advertising sales agreements. Television =STV= STV Group plc owns two Scottish ITV licences: Scottish Television, which covers Central Scotland, and Grampian Television, covering Northern Scotland. On 2 March 2006, it was announced that Scottish Television would revert to using its former brand name of \\"STV\\", which it previously used from the start of colour broadcasting in 1969 until 30 August 1985, and which the station was still informally known as in parts of Scotland. Scottish Television became known as STV Central. At the same time, Grampian Television would also become known as STV North, with the one main identity of STV serving the two licences. The rebrand took place on 30 May 2006. Other channels The former SMG plc ran its own digital channel, S2, throughout the Scottish and Grampian ITV regions. S2, which aired on the Digital Terrestrial platform, was launched on 30 April 1999 and was replaced by ITV2 just over two years later – as part of a deal with ITV Digital – on 27 July 2001. Sky Scottish was a satellite television channel operating on the analogue Sky TV service between 1 November 1996 and 31 May 1998. The service was a joint venture between British Sky Broadcasting and SMG. It initially broadcast between 6.00pm and 8.00pm. The channel was closed due to poor ratings. A high-definition channel, STV HD, launched on 6 June 2010. On 11 January 2013, STV were awarded two local TV licences by Ofcom to operate digital terrestrial television channels in Glasgow and Edinburgh for up to 12 years. The two channels, STV Glasgow and STV Edinburgh, were to be delivered in partnership with Glasgow Caledonian University and Edinburgh Napier University respectively. STV Glasgow launched on 2 June 2014, and STV Edinburgh launched on 12 January 2015. In March 2015, STV were awarded local licences for the Aberdeen, Ayr and Dundee areas. In April 2017, STV Glasgow and STV Edinburgh were re-branded as STV2. Just over a year later in May 2018, STV announced that it would be closing STV2 on 30 June 2018.https://stv.tv/news/scotland/1415173-stv-to-close-stv2-channel-as- broadcaster-cuts-59-jobs/ Production =STV Studios= STV Studios (previously STV Productions, SMG Productions) forms part of the network television production arm of STV Group plc, producing drama, factual, entertainment and children's output from its bases in Glasgow and London for all UK terrestrial networks as well as key satellite and cable channels. =Ginger Productions= Ginger Productions (founded by the presenter Chris Evans), alongside STV Productions, is part of the network production arm of STV Group plc.

On 16 October the same year he became major general and became Military alliance secretary as well. From 1935 to 1936 he was charged with an assassination attempt on General Damyan Velchev, but the charges were dropped due to the lack of evidence. When the war started, he was given orders by the Soviet Communist Party to resist the German occupation, but was later on arrested on 22 March 1942 on the charges of espionage and was sentenced next day.

He served as the fourth Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia from 1933 to 1953 and remained in office as the first Prime Minister of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland until October 1956, becoming the longest serving prime minister in British Commonwealth history.Statesman and Surgeon. British Medical Journal, 20 November 1971, pp. 497. Early life and education Huggins was born at 'Dane Cottage', Knoll Road, Bexley in northern Kent, England (now a borough of London), the second child, but eldest son of a stockbroker. The family later moved to a property his father built, 'Shore House' in Sevenoaks, a town 27 miles from London. He was educated at Brunswick House, a preparatory school in Hove and then moved to Sutherland House, a similar school in Folkestone. He suffered a severe infection of the left middle ear at the age of 11, which left him deaf on that side and delayed his move to Malvern College in 1898,Godfrey Huggins. The Malvern Register 1865–1904, 1905. p. 414. a school from which he later took part of his title. From there he moved on to study medicine at St. Thomas's Hospital, London, after some difficulty obtaining the necessary entrance qualifications. After practising medicine and training as a surgeon in London, spending some time as a Resident Superintendent at Great Ormond Street Hospital, Huggins travelled to Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia, in 1911, initially to act as a locum to some doctors there, but eventually deciding to stay on. First World War Huggins returned to the UK in late 1914 following the outbreak of war and joined the Royal Army Medical Corps with the rank of Captain, stationed at Colchester Hospital which had become a casualty clearing station. Although he wanted to go to France, he was sent to Malta where he dealt with incoming casualties from the Battle of Gallipoli. Doctors only had to serve for a year at that point in the war, and so in 1916 Huggins went out again to Southern Rhodesia but returned to the UK within a few months. This time he was posted to the Hammersmith Orthopaedic Hospital and then the Pavilion Hospital in Brighton. In 1917, he finally got to go to France with the 5th Cavalry Field Ambulance, attached to the 2nd Cavalry Division near Amiens. His surgical work at this time led to his writing a book, Amputation Stumps: Their Care and After Treatment (Frowde, Hodder & Stoughton, London 1918). Practice in Southern Rhodesia He returned to Southern Rhodesia at the end of the war, just in time to deal with the 1918 influenza epidemic, and bought Craig Farm on the outskirts of Salisbury, now Harare, which was to remain his home for the rest of his life. He began again as a surgeon, quickly becoming the best known, albeit in a small field, in Southern Rhodesia. He married in 1921 to Blanche Slatter of Pietermaritzburg, the daughter (some sources say stepdaughter) of a Major in the South African Constabulary. He and his wife had two sons, born in 1922 and 1928. Having become a spokesman for the local Comrades of the Great War Association, he began to have contact with government, intervening for the Association with the then-Administrator, Sir Drummond Chaplin. Although he was on the side of union with South Africa when there was a referendum on the matter in 1922, he accepted the Southern Rhodesian decision to 'go it alone' and accept responsible government. Political career He entered politics in 1924 as a Rhodesia Party member and was elected, unopposed, in the Salisbury North constituency, to the Southern Rhodesian Legislative Assembly of the newly created self-governing colony. In 1932, he broke with the Rhodesia Party government led by Howard Unwin Moffat when it introduced a measure to cut civil service salaries by 10%; a cut that was especially unpopular in Huggins's constituency which had a large number of civil servants. Huggins could not vote against the government without precipitating an early general election, something he did not wish to do as an election was already scheduled for the next year. Instead, Huggins voted for the bill and then crossed the floor the next day to join the newly formed Reform Party which appointed Huggins Leader of the Opposition. =Prime Minister= Mackenzie King, Britain's Winston Churchill, New Zealand's Peter Fraser, U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower and South Africa's Field Marshal Jan Smuts, in England just before the Normandy landings in June 1944 Huggins became Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia following the 1933 general election which his Reform Party won by a one-seat majority with 16 out of 30 seats in the Legislative Assembly. The Reform Party's platform included measures such as the creation of a central bank and various economic, credit and monetary reforms designed to provide support for the white working class during the Great Depression. The Reform Party was believed by many in Rhodesia to be a left-wing party but Huggins presented a cautiously conservative Cabinet after winning power in 1933. In particular, Finance Minister Jacob Smit was a strong believer in conventional economics and opponent of Keynesianism. The course of government led eventually to a confrontation in August 1934 with the left-wing of the party over reform to the Rhodesian Railways. Huggins decided to approach Sir Percy Fynn, leader of the Rhodesia Party, who pledged support for a National Government under Huggins. However, the acting Governor refused a dissolution on the grounds that the Assembly had many years left, and the government had not been defeated. Huggins persuaded the majority of the Executive of the Reform Party to suspend the party's constitution to allow a National Government on 17 September, and then formed the United Party with Fynn, asking a second time for a dissolution on the basis of a changed party alignment. This time the Acting Governor acceded. The November 1934 election resulted in a landslide for Huggins' United Party, which won 24 out of 30 seats, while the Reform Party returned only one seat in the new legislature. Huggins himself switched electoral districts and ran and defeated Reform Party MP Thomas Nangle who had been one of the Reform Party's founders. Huggins won successive elections and was knighted in 1941 by King George VI. He was a leading guest at the 1947 wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.Royal Collection: Seating plan for the Ball Supper Room Royal Ball (1947) In addition to prime ministership, Huggins was the Minister of Finance on several occasions. Huggins became an advocate of federating Southern Rhodesia with some of the neighbouring British colonies in the region so that they would become an independent state within the British Empire while maintaining white minority rule with only a small number of educated Blacks having the vote in addition to white settlers. As a result of his efforts, the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland was created in 1953 uniting Northern Rhodesia, Southern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, with Huggins as the federation's first Prime Minister after his new United Federal Party won the federation's first general election. Huggins remained in office until October 1956 and was elevated to the Peerage of the United Kingdom as Viscount Malvern in March 1955, over a year and a half before his retirement. He was succeeded as federal Prime Minister by Sir Roy Welensky. The biggest political issue of his tenure as federal Prime Minister was the question of race relations. Huggins and other proponents of Federation claimed to stand for a policy of partnership, which was claimed to be much more enlightened than the apartheid that the new Nationalist Party government was then installing in South Africa. He compared it to \\"the partnership of rider and horse.\\" The following quotation, from a speech he made to the Federal Assembly on July 28, 1954, against a motion to enforce equal treatment of the races, illustrates Huggins's attitude towards black Africans: > You cannot expect Europeans to form in a queue with dirty people, possibly > an old mfazi with an infant on her back, mewling and puking and making a > mess of everything... It is perfectly obvious to anyone that the system we > have in Southern Rhodesia at the present time is the most satisfactory to > both sides and it is certainly impossible to alter it until the hon. leaders > of the African people have cleaned up their brother Africans a bit; and then > we can perhaps consider it.Colonialism to Cabinet Crisis, Andrew C. Ross, > Kachere Books, Zomba, 2009, p. 76. Lord Malvern's successor, Welensky, spent his time in office trying to prevent an inevitable break-up of the Federation. Having served 23 years as Prime Minister, Lord Malvern, as he now was, became the longest serving Prime Minister in British Commonwealth history, beating the records of Mackenzie King of Canada and Sir Robert Walpole of Great Britain and Ireland. He is the only Prime Minister in British Commonwealth history to serve under four monarchs (George V, Edward VIII, George VI, and Elizabeth II). Lord Malvern lived out the remainder of his life in Southern Rhodesia, continuing his quiet retirement under the territory's Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) administration. He died in May 1971 aged 87.

It belongs to the Virgo Cluster of galaxies and is positioned near the northeastern edge of this assemblage. The morphological classification of NGC 4698 in the De Vaucouleurs system is SA(s)ab, which indicates a purely spiral structure with moderate to tightly wound arms. It is inclined to the line of sight from the Earth by an angle of 53° along a position angle of 170°. A unique feature of this galaxy is that the stars and dust of the nuclear disk are rotating in a direction that is aligned perpendicularly to the galactic disk. The bulge likewise appears elongated out of the galactic plane. This unusual alignment may have been the result of a past merger event. NGC 4698 is classified as a Seyfert-2 galaxy with an active galactic nucleus, which displays a prominent emission of radio and X-ray energy from the core while showing narrow emission lines in the optical spectrum. The unified model of Seyfert galaxies proposes that the nucleus of a Seyfert 2 galaxy is obscured by a thick torus of gas and dust. However, the varying X-ray emission of the core of NGC 4698 shows little indication of being obstructed, suggesting instead that the source of the energy emission is generally unobscured but anemic in nature.

She saw action primarily in the Battle of the Atlantic as a convoy escort. She was named for Lachute, Quebec. After the war she was sold to the Dominican Navy. Background Flower-class corvettes like Lachute serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different from earlier and more traditional sail-driven corvettes. The \\"corvette\\" designation was created by the French as a class of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877. During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, Winston Churchill reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a whaling ship design. The generic name \\"flower\\" was used to designate the class of these ships, which – in the Royal Navy – were named after flowering plants. Corvettes commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were named after communities for the most part, to better represent the people who took part in building them. This idea was put forth by Admiral Percy W. Nelles. Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named. Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts, while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles which was exemplified by their minesweeping gear. Eventually the Canadian corvettes would be modified to allow them to perform better on the open seas. Construction Lachute was ordered in June 1942 as part of the 1943–44 Increased Endurance Flower-class building program, which followed the main layout of the 1942–43 program. The only significant difference is that the majority of the 43–44 program replaced the 2-pounder Mk.VIII single \\"pom-pom\\" anti-aircraft gun with 2 twin 20-mm and 2 single 20-mm anti-aircraft guns. She was laid down 24 November 1943 by Morton Engineering & Dry Dock Co. in Quebec City. She was launched on 9 June 1944 and commissioned at Quebec City later that year on 26 October. Service history After being worked up in Bermuda Lachute was assigned to the Mid- Ocean Escort Force. She was allocated to escort group EG C-5. She served the rest of the war as a trans-Atlantic Ocean escort and participated in the final westbound convoy ON 305 on 26 May 1945. Lachute was paid off on 10 July 1945 and placed in reserve at Sorel. She was transferred to the War Assets Corporation and was sold to Dominican Republic in 1947. Renamed Cristobal Colon she served as a coastal escort until 1978 when she was removed from the active list. On 31 August 1979, Hurricane David struck the island. Cristobal Colon, along with her sister ship, Juan Alejandro Acosta, were driven ashore and wrecked.

After executing a \\"fire taran\\" attack in January 1944 and was believed by the military to have died doing so, after which he was nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union; but before he could be honored with the title the repressions of the Chechens and Ingush began. Ozdoev had parachuted out of his plane seconds before ramming it into the German railway and hence survived but was taken prisoner. After the prison camp where he was held was liberated by Allied forces on 8 May 1945 he was welcomed back to the 431st Fighter Aviation Regiment by his friends, and continued to serve in the regiment with a promotion to flight commander until Soviet authorities ordered he be deported to Akmola like the rest of his family because he was Ingush.  Early life  Ozdoev was born in 1922 to an Ingush family in Nazran, Ingushetia of the Russian SFSR. After completing secondary school he studied at the Grozny aeroclub while working in local industries. After completing flight training in Grozny he joined the Red Army in 1940, upon which he underwent further training at the Armavir Military Aviation School before being deployed to the warfront of the Second World War as part of the 431st Fighter Aviation Regiment.  World War II  Ozdoev scored his first aerial victory in September 1941 and went on to become a flying ace, totaling eight shootdowns of enemy aircraft, including a high-altitude Focke-Wulf Fw-189 which had been labeled by the Soviet Air Forces as a difficult target. Throughout the war he piloted Po-2, LaGG-3, Yak-1, Yak-7B and Yak-9 aircraft. During the Battle of Kursk, he shot down two Fw 190s in one sortie while escorting a group of Petlyakov Pe-2 dive bombers. In Autumn 1943 he provided air support in the Polotsk and Leningrad-Novgorod offensives. While escorting a group of bombers on 25 January 1945 his plane was hit by an anti-aircraft missile from the ground; while his fighter was falling to the ground he directed the stricken fighter into a railroad to inflict maximum damage on the enemy seconds before bailing out of the burning plane. The pilots of the planes he was escorting witnessed his \\"fire taran\\" attack and presumed him to have died as a result of executing the maneuver, which was nearly always suicidal for pilots. Ozdoev had actually survived, unbeknownst to his colleagues, but was severely wounded and had been captured by the Germans. He was nominated for the USSR's highest title, Hero of the Soviet Union; but before the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet could award him the title, all Chechen and Ingush peoples were collectively repressed and exiled to Central Asia. After he was captured by the Germans he was sent to a prison camp in Lodz, Poland and later relocated to a different prison camp in the Czech Republic. Throughout his imprisonment he attempted to escape twice but was unsuccessful; after both attempts he was tortured and badly beaten. On 8 May 1945 Soviet forces took over the prison camp and in June he was allowed to return to his regiment. Upon return he was welcomed by his comrades who were shocked he had survived the suicidal attack and Ozdoev was promoted to flight commander, but was not allowed to stay after he was ordered to be exiled to Central Asia like the rest of the Ingush nation; it did not matter to the authorities that Ozdoev was a flying ace and war hero who had been nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union; only his Ingush ethnicity mattered to the authorities and that was all it took for him to be considered an \\"enemy of the people\\".  Later life  In January 1946 Ozdoev was forcibly deported to the Akmola Region of the Kazakh SSR where the rest of his family had been deported. His parents had been forced out of Ingushetia just shortly after receiving a notice that their son was killed in action. Four years after the death of Stalin, Ozdoev returned to his hometown of Nazran, where he lived for the remainder of his life. On 8 May 1995 he was belatedly honored with the title Hero of the Russian Federation for his actions in the war. He passed away on 25 February 1999 at the age of 76.

Its three portals contain some of the richest medieval sculpture on the island. Martebo Church lies in the Diocese of Visby. History Detail of one of the sculpted portals of Martebo church, with remains of original paint Little is known about the origins and oldest history of the church. The stone church may have been pre-dated by a stave church. Of the presently visible church, the tower is the oldest part, dating from the middle of the 13th century and Romanesque in style. The Gothic nave and choir are from the early 14th century and replaced and earlier and smaller Romanesque building. Architecture The church is of a type which is rather characteristic for Gotland, in which the nave and choir were rebuilt during the High Gothic, but where the older tower remains, resulting in an unproportionally short tower in relation to the rest of the building. Adjacent to the tower there is a rather unusual detail, a small chamber which has a window onto the nave but lacks any other connection. It probably functioned as a hagioscope (perhaps for sick members of the congregation) and which was added during the 14th century. The external façade of the church, notably the three portals, display some of the most accomplished medieval sculpture on Gotland. They date from the 14th century and were made when the church was rebuilt in Gothic style. On some of the sculptures traces of the original paint still survive. The sculptures were probably executed by the local stonemason's workshop which is sometimes referred to by the notname Egypticus. They depict the life of Jesus as told in the New Testament, with scenes following each other chronologically and from one portal to the other, so that the three portals together make out an entire sculpted narrative. Inside the church are the remains of medieval murals and a baptismal font from the 13th century. Two medieval tombstones are placed in the floor of the choir. The pulpit is one of the oldest on Gotland, dating from middle of the 16th century.

(RKL), formerly Rampur Distillery & Chemical Company Ltd., is an Indian company that manufactures industrial alcohol, Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL), country liquor and fertilizers. It is the fourth largest Indian liquor company, . Radico brands are sold in more than 60 countries, including USA, Canada, South America, Africa, Europe, South East Asia and the Middle East. History Radico Khaitan Ltd. was established as Rampur Distillery & Chemical Company Ltd. in 1943 at Rampur, Uttar Pradesh. The distillery in Rampur initially produced extra neutral alcohol (ENA) and supplied bulk alcohol for several liquor companies such as Shaw Wallace, Mohan Meakin and the United Breweries Group. It had a turnover of 6.5 million in 1979. It was only in 1999 that the company commenced production of its own brands. Lalit Khaitan's father, G. N. Khaitan, bought out the loss-making Rampur Distillery from Vishnu Hari Dalmia for 1.6 million in 1972. According to Lalit Khaitan, his father was a teetotaler throughout his life, and even Khaitan himself had never tasted alcohol until his father bought the distillery. G. N. Khaitan divided the family business (which included construction, real estate, liquor industries and others) among his 4 sons in 1995, and Lalit Khaitan inherited the relatively small liquor division. Prior to that the distillery was run by Lalit's cousin and others. In 1991, Radico set up a malt spirit plant with an installed capacity of 460 KL per annum; a soya oil/rapeseed extraction plant with an installed capacity of 300 tpd based on soyabean seeds & 350 tpd based on rapeseed oil cake at Ratlam, Madhya Pradesh and a biogas cogeneration and secondary treatment plant. The company also modernized the distillery unit by installing new copper distillation plant and a fully automatic bottling line. It also balanced its Single Superphosphate (SSP) plant by putting equipment like a ball mill and a scrubbing system. The entire modernisation-cum- expansion programme cost the company 365 million. The company undertook a major expansion of its solvent extraction plant to increase the capacity from 300 tpd to 600 tpd in 1994, and launched Contessa Rum, Contessa Whisky and a few other products in CMI markets in 1995. Contessa Rum is mainly sold to the Canteen Stores Department (CSD). Radico entered into a joint venture with Whyte & Mackay Group plc. in the same year, and launched Scotch whisky brands 15 YO, Findlater and WMSR in India. While planning to launch a new brand in 1996, Khaitan and his son Abhishek, who had joined the company recently, found that more Scotch was consumed in India than was bottled in Scotland, and there was no Scotch blended whisky brand available in India in the lower price range at that time. The Khaitans intended to launch a brand to target that segment, but had low finances, which was compounded by the entry of MNCs into the Indian liquor industry. The first Radico Khaitan IMFL brand was 8 PM whisky, launched in 1999, and currently Radico's flagship brand. According to Abhishek Khaitan, the name was chosen as the company felt that \\"8 was the simplest thing to depict\\", and also because \\"people usually start drinking at 8 pm.\\" in India. The TV advert for the whisky was in black-and-white, and depicted opposing soldiers bonding over 8 PM whisky at an international border. Radico announced in May 1999 that it had submitted a proposal to set up a distillery in Kyrgyzstan, which had been and it had been accepted by Kyrgyzstan government. RKL created an international division, called Radico International, in 2003. Radico International introduced brands such as Beck's beer and wines from E&J; Gallo in the Indian market. On 14 January 2003, RKL president (finance) RK Mehrotra announced that the company was planning to set up a bottling facility in Mauritius for their 8PM brand through a tie-up with a local company. In July 2003, Radico announced the installation of an ENA deluxe plant at its Rampur Distillery at a cost of 200 million. The company would use some of the ENA for its own IMFL brands, while the rest is sold in India and exported to liquor majors in Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) . Radico purchased Bacardi's 51% stake in Whytehall India for over 300 million in 2004, gaining control of the Whytehall brand. In a press release on 7 April 2004, Radico announced that it had acquired Anab-e- Shahi, a bottling plant in Andhra Pradesh. This was the company's first acquisition in South India. Radico entered the vodka market in November 2005, with the launch of the grain-based Magic Moments vodka. Although Magic Moments was not an instant success like 8 PM, it earns Radico more revenue than 8 PM. In 2005, the company set up a grain-based distillery plant in Uttar Pradesh at a cost of 850 million. In May 2006, Radico announced that it had entered into two overseas joint ventures in the United Kingdom and western Africa, becoming the first Indian liquor company to have overseas production lines. The joint ventures are intended to help Radico launch its brands in the UK and African markets. Radico handles sales, marketing and distribution functions, while manufacturing is outsourced to the local partner. The whiskies Radico sells outside India are grain-based, while its whiskies in India are made from molasses. In August 2006, Diageo and Radico Khaitan announced a 50:50 JV called Diaego Radico Distilleries Pvt Ltd in the Indian spirits market, with the latter handling distribution and manufacturing base and former providing marketing. The move marked Diageo's return to the IMFL market, which it had previously exited in 2001. Diageo Radico launched Masterstroke Deluxe Whisky in the premium segment in March 2007. However, the joint venture did not launch any new brands following that. Diageo instead developed its own marketing and distribution machinery to strengthen its presence in India. In 2011, Diageo announced its intention to buy half of Radico's stake in the JV. In October 2007, Radico entered into a tripartite joint venture with NV Distillers and Ridhi Sidhi Pvt Ltd to set up a greenfield distillery in Aurangabad, Maharashtra with a combined investment of 1.60 billion. Radico would have a 36% stake in Radico NV Distilleries Maharashtra Ltd, which would manufacture ENA, IMFL and ethanol, and also have a bottling facility. The distillery is Radico's second, after the Rampur Distillery Morpheus brandy was launched in May 2009. Its largest markets are Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Karnataka. The company named the brandy after Morpheus, the Greek god of dreams, in order to \\"convey a sense of softness with a European touch\\". Radico launched Carlo Rossi wine in Mumbai in April 2009, through its joint venture with E&J; Gallo, which owns the brand. Radico had already been selling other E&J; Gallo brands such as André, Wine Cellars, Sonoma County and Turning Leaf in India. Radico announced on 7 April 2011 that it had entered into an agreement with Japanese firm Suntory Liquors Ltd to market and distribute the latter's Yamazaki single malt and Hibiki blended whiskies in India. Radico launched After Dark, a 100% grain-based whisky manufactured at its Rampur distillery, in September 2011. PET Division Radico Khaitan's PET division, started in 2003, produces a wide range of PET bottles and jars for the pharmaceutical, cosmetics, home & personal care, edible oil and confectionery industries. It utilizes single stage machines of Nissei ASB Machine Co. Ltd., Japan to meet in-house needs, but eventually began supplying PET bottles even to competitors. The PET division operates as an independent profit group. The company has a 750 ml kidney shape PET bottle manufacturing plant in Uttarakhand. The unit started with a production rate of 08.5 million bottles annually in October 2004, and currently produces 600 million PET bottles that cater to Radico's own captive consumption of 300 million bottles annually, while the sold to outside clients in liquor, pharmaceuticals and FMCG.

It manufactures high grade ENA from molasses and grain with a production capacity of 75 Million litres of molasses ENA, 30 million litres of grain neutral spirit and 460 thousands litres of malt whisky annually. Rampur Distillery also manufactures country liquor and IMFL, of which some IMFL meets the domestic requirement and the rest is exported. The unit is self-sufficient in meeting its fuel and power requirements by utilizing its effluent for generating the biogas which, in turn, is utilized for generating the steam and power for its captive requirement. The distillery complies with the zero discharge concept set up by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Primary treatment of the effluent yields biogas, which is used as fuel in a Cogen boiler to generate steam and then power through a backpressure turbine. The backpressure steam is used again in the distillation plant to produce ENA and rectified spirit. The treated effluent is not discharged outside, in keeping with pollution control norms, and is in turn mixed and cured with organic mass like press mud of sugar mills and suitable organic manures to manufacture bio manure or bio compost, a bio fertilizer used in growing crops like sugar cane. The cogeneration plant of the Rampur Distillery consists of 26 MT capacity of a stand-alone, biogas fired steam boiler, a 2 MW turbine generator, a 30 MT capacity biogas and rice husk based boiler, and 2.5 MW in tandem to make the unit self-reliant in meeting power requirements for normal operation. =Company owned units= Radico Khaitan owns 5 units in India.

He played college baseball at North Carolina State. The San Diego Padres selected Turner in the first round of the 2014 Major League Baseball draft, and traded him to the Nationals in 2015. Turner made his MLB debut with the Nationals on August 21, 2015. Developed by the Padres and Nationals primarily as a shortstop, Turner broke into the major leagues in the 2016 season as Washington's starting center fielder, before returning to what he considers his \\"natural position\\" as the Nationals shortstop starting in the 2017 season. He has also made a handful of major league appearances at second base. He is one of the fastest runners in Major League Baseball, having been clocked at a speed of at least twice in 2016. Amateur career Turner attended Park Vista Community High School in Lake Worth, Florida, where he played for his school's baseball team. Turner was lightly recruited by college programs, only receiving scholarship offers from NC State and Florida Atlantic University. The Pittsburgh Pirates selected Turner in the 20th round, with the 602nd overall selection, of the 2011 Major League Baseball draft. Turner opted to attend NC State, to play college baseball for the NC State Wolfpack baseball team in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division I. As a freshman in 2012, Turner shifted from the shortstop position to play as a third baseman. That year, he had a .336 batting average, a .432 on-base percentage, and recorded 57 stolen bases while only being caught stealing four times. His 57 steals were more than the team totals of 158 Division I teams, and set an NC State record. He also tied the ACC record for steals in one game with five. Turner was named to the All- Tournament Team in the 2012 ACC Tournament. In 2013, Turner had a .378 batting average with seven home runs, 41 runs batted in (RBIs), and 27 stolen bases. He was named to the All-ACC first team, and was named a second team All- American by Perfect Game and a third team All-American by the National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association and Baseball America. He was named a finalist for the Brooks Wallace Award, given to the best shortstop in NCAA's Division I. That summer, Turner played for the United States national collegiate baseball team. As a junior in 2014, he hit .321 with eight home runs and 26 stolen bases. After the season, he was named the winner of the Brooks Wallace Award. Professional career =2014: Drafted and traded= =San Diego Padres= Aaron Fitt of Baseball America considered Turner a likely first round choice in the 2014 MLB draft. The San Diego Padres selected Turner in the first round, with the 13th overall selection. He signed on June 13, receiving a $2.9 million signing bonus. He made his professional debut three days later with the Eugene Emeralds of the Class A-Short Season Northwest League. After he batted .228 in 26 games for Eugene, the Padres promoted him to the Fort Wayne TinCaps of the Class A Midwest League, where he batted .369 in 46 games. The Padres assigned him to play for the Surprise Saguaros of the Arizona Fall League after the regular season. =Washington Nationals= On December 19, 2014, the Padres reportedly agreed to trade Turner to the Washington Nationals as a player to be named later as part of a three-team trade, in which the Padres traded Jake Bauers, Burch Smith, and René Rivera to the Tampa Bay Rays and Joe Ross to Washington, and Washington traded Steven Souza and Travis Ott to Tampa Bay, and Tampa traded Wil Myers to San Diego. This unusual arrangement was a result of Turner being ineligible to be traded before mid-June because of MLB rules that prevent players to be traded within a year of their being drafted. Turner's agent, Jeff Berry, stated to the media that it was an unfair process to force him to play half the season for a team that traded him and had no further interest in promoting his development. He claimed he would be filing a grievance through the players' union. =2015: Major league debut= Turner reported to spring training with the Padres as a non-roster invitee, and the Padres assigned him to the San Antonio Missions of the Class AA Texas League. He hit .322 with five home runs and 35 RBIs with 11 stolen bases for San Antonio.

The Nationals optioned Turner to Syracuse at the end of spring training. Turner was called up on June 3, 2016, for a three-game series against the Cincinnati Reds. He went 3-for-3 with a walk in his first game of the season at MLB, playing second base and shortstop. He was optioned back to Syracuse at the end of the series, as first baseman Ryan Zimmerman was reactivated from paternity leave. With Michael A. Taylor and Ben Revere turning in lackluster offensive performances as the Nationals' primary center fielders, and Espinosa performing well as the team's everyday shortstop, Turner began getting starts in center field with the Chiefs midway through the season. He debuted in center field on June 27, his first professional appearance as an outfielder, and after being recalled by the Nationals in July, Turner made his first major league start in center field on July 26.

Two days later, Turner was hit on the right wrist by a fastball from Cubs reliever Pedro Strop and suffered a non-displaced fracture, sending him to the 10-day disabled list for the second time in the season. Turner told The Washington Post's Thomas Boswell it was the first time since he was 12 that he had broken a bone, though he claimed the injury \\"didn't feel that bad\\" after Strop's pitch hit him, and he remained in the game for an inning and a half before being lifted for a defensive substitute. The Nationals purchased the contract of infielder Adrián Sánchez from the Class- AAA Syracuse Chiefs to take Turner's place on the roster. Turner was activated from the disabled list on August 28 and made his return to the lineup the following night against the Miami Marlins. =2018= Turner in 2018 In 2018, Turner started the year with the big league club.

After the war it was sold to a Jewish resettlement movement and eventually made its way into the nascent Israeli Navy. Background Flower-class corvettes like Beauharnois serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different to earlier and more traditional sail-driven corvettes. The \\"corvette\\" designation was created by the French as a class of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877. During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, Winston Churchill reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a whaling ship design. The generic name \\"flower\\" was used to designate the class of these ships, which – in the Royal Navy – were named after flowering plants. Corvettes commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were named after communities for the most part, to better represent the people who took part in building them. This idea was put forth by Admiral Percy W. Nelles. Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named. Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts, while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles which was exemplified by their minesweeping gear. Eventually the Canadian corvettes would be modified to allow them to perform better on the open seas. Construction Beauharnois was ordered in June 1942 as part of the 1943-44 Increased Endurance Flower- class building program, which followed the main layout of the 1942-43 program. The only significant difference is that the majority of the 43-44 program replaced the 2-pounder Mk.VIII single \\"pom-pom\\" anti-aircraft gun with two twin 20 mm and two single 20 mm anti-aircraft guns. She was laid down as Buckingham before her name was changed to Beauharnois on 8 November 1943 by Morton Engineering & Dry Dock Co. in Quebec City. She was launched 11 May 1944 and commissioned 25 September of that year in Quebec City. War service After working up in Bermuda, Beauharnois joined the Mid-Ocean Escort Force escort group C-4 and worked escorting convoys across the Atlantic. Due to her late entry into the war, she did not see much action, and her final duties of the war consisted of escorting the cable ship . Post-war service Beauharnois was paid off 12 July 1945 at Sorel. She was sold to Mossad LeAliyah Bet in 1946 along with the ex-. The two ships were used to smuggle Jewish immigrants into British-held Palestine as part of the Aliyah Bet. As Josiah Wedgwood she sailed from Italy and was intercepted by on 26 June 1946. She was impounded in Haifa until Israel's independence.

The Film was produced by Infinite Frameworks, the production house before working on the musical animated film Meraih Mimpi (Achieved a dream) in 2009. Filming and production of the film was done in the filming facility integrated in Batam Island. Plot Warren Price (Les Loveday), the son of a millionaire, is on a mission to explore a former Japanese military bunker on the island of Una-Una, Gulf of Tomini, Sulawesi, together with Japanese scientist Rie (Miki Mizuno), Price's girlfriend Su-Ling (Carmen Soo), Price's personal bodyguard Stanley (Sam Hazeldine). They are escorted by a team of mercenaries, consisting of Captain Tino Prawa (Ario Bayu), Djoko (Joe Taslim), Richard (Mike Lewis), and Sergeant Papa Snake (Jaitov Tigor). After being ambushed by pirates, the group are forced inside an abandoned Japanese military bunker where they become trapped. Wounded and desperate, the group is left with no choice but to move deeper into the mine in the hopes of finding an alternate exit route. Warren finally informs the group that the true purpose of their excursion has always been to find the mine and that he believes it contains massive riches (the legendary Yamashita's gold). This reveal is met with scorn by the mercenaries in the group but with no other choice they proceed deeper into the mine. The group uncovers a hidden storage area where pictures of POW abuse is found. The group starts to realise that the bunker was actually a chemical and biological weapons research facility (based on Unit 731) Where the Japanese used prisoners of war as subjects for horrendous experiments. Su-Ling, Stanley and Djoko remain behind in the infirmary with the wounded soldier Richard. Warren, Su-Ling, Captain Tino Prawa and Sergeant Papa Snake decide to separate and explore the bunker further with a view to finding a way out. Stanley and Rei bond while in the infirmary where Stanley explains why he works as a bodyguard and why he no longer serves in the military, describing a violent bar brawl he was involved in. Meanwhile Tino moves deeper into the bunker where the second group find more military relics indicating Australian POWs were used by the Japanese for experimentation. Rei admits her purpose was never to find the gold but evidence of the abuse. Suddenly the injured Richard screams and is dragged into a hole by a mysterious figure. Richard, Rei and Djoko drop into the tunnel in pursuit but are soon separated, Rei and Stanley find Richard's badly mauled body while Djoko encounters a crypt with human skeletons. He quickly dispatches a monster as it approaches him but is soon overwhelmed, blinded and devoured by a horde of monsters. Meanwhile Warren and the second group uncover a control room with medical notes detailing some of the experiments the Japanese were conducting. The group are attacked and Price is stabbed. They manage to kill the monster. Warren examines the mutated body and spots a Japanese tattoo identifying the monster as an Australian POW (aged 24 years). Where they suddenly realise the monsters are actually POWs who have been mutated. Warren is shocked to find a needle and when he inspects it, he is angered to see that it is full of gold and realises that there is no gold as the Japanese used it as part of the experiments on the POWs. Stanley and Rei are captured by a final remaining Japanese officer. He takes them back to his lair where Stanley manages to overpower him but stops short of killing him upon Rei's request. He removes his gas-mask and reveals horrible mutations. Rei interrogates him and he explains, that he and another officer were tasked with looking after the Bunker and instructed to guard the POWs. He explains that their superiors were experimenting on the POWs and turned them into bloodthirsty monsters. When Rei asks what happened to his fellow officer, the soldier admits that he killed him for trying to desert as he thought the war was still ongoing. The officer explains that the experiments didn't finish with the POWs, the Japanese were trying to create super soldiers so experimented on the elite Imperial Guard troops. The officer also explains he was given an injection to keep him young, but this failed and mutated him. After Rei shows him evidence on her tablet of the Japanese surrender at the end of World War 2 he agrees to show them the way out of the Bunker. Tino and Papa Snake explore a room off the experiments chamber and find what looks to be statues of Japanese Imperial Warriors. When Tino steps forward the warriors animate and attack him. Papa Snake is mortally wounded attempting to close the doors and Tino witnesses them killing his friend. Su-Ling and Warren escape into the tunnels with Tino coming after them. The Imperial Warriors begin pursuit and as they chase the group they are joined by the POW monsters. Tino finds the bodies of his men in the crypt just as Warren is attacked by a POW monster. Su-Ling fends off a monster and they manage to escape reuniting with Stanley and Rei. Warren is mortally wounded and the group debates leaving him before Su-Ling panics and injects him with the mutant serum, hoping to save him. The Imperial Warriors emerge from the tunnel and they execute the Japanese Officer as Rei, Stanley, Warren, Su-Ling and Tino try to escape. Tino and Stanley are attacked but Rei helps by killing the monsters. Warren and Su- Ling become separated from the others. Tino, Stanley and Rei are soon surrounded and forced deeper into the tunnels. Tino makes a valiant last stand to give Stanley and Rei time to get away but is quickly overwhelmed and killed by the Imperial Warriors. Meanwhile Su-Ling tries to drag Warren to safety but he has fallen unconscious. As she explores ahead of them she realises they are almost at the surface and she returns for Warren only to see him seemingly reanimate. He violently smashes her against the tunnel wall killing her. Rei and Stanley dive into a pond of water hoping to follow it to the surface and escape the Bunker. Rei emerges in a pond outside in the jungle and calls for Stanley. Slowly an Imperial Warrior appears and Rei attempts to fight him off only for him to draw his sword and dispatch her. The remaining Imperial Warriors emerge from the water as the film ends.

The hall stands in an exposed situation at almost 200 metres above sea level on Edge Lane, some six km NW of the city centre and has been designated a Grade II listed building by English Heritage as has the Falconry which stands in the garden. History The hall was constructed in two phases, the easterly facing wing was constructed in the Late Middle Ages when it was known as “Byrlay Edge”, it was built with an oak cruck frame with an exterior of squared stone. Part of the cruck frame can be seen on the Edge Lane side of the original wing. In 1705 J. Carr added a new and more impressive south facing wing at right angles to the original. The 1705 extension has been described as having “restrained elegance” and included the construction of a gazebo in the garden, called the Falconry. The hall underwent some alterations and additions during the late 18th and mid 19th centuries, including a two- storey addition to the original wing. The hall was used briefly as a Youth Hostel in the 1940s and was purchased by Sheffield City Council after World War II. In 1959 the council leased the building to the steel manufacturers Daniel Doncaster and Sons as offices and the hall was extensively restored. The hall and Birley Edge lost much of its rural isolation in the 1960s when the Fox Hill council housing estate was constructed on land to the immediate south. The hall returned to use as a private dwelling in the early 1980s and once more was totally restored during its conversion back to residential use.\\"Sheffield‘s Remarkable Houses\\", Roger Redfern, The Cottage Press, , Page 16 Gives historical details of hall. The interior of the house has features such as large fireplaces dating from the 1600s, along with exposed original stone work in one of the lounges and larger bedrooms. Architecture The hall is constructed from locally quarried squared stone and is L shaped, the 1705 building has a coped date stone above the main door with the inscriptionS “JC 1705” and “DD 1959”. The roofs are gabled and hipped. The building has a mixture of mullioned, sash and casement windows.

Peter Peter is also notable for working with filmmaker Nicolas Winding RefnInternet Movie Database and has written scores and soundtracks for a number of films. Biography Schneidermann was born on the island of Bornholm, but the family soon moved to Copenhagen after his birth. As a young man, Peter was very interested in film and music. He got a Hagstrom guitar which he later painted pink. The guitar followed him throughout life, and he has it tattooed its picture on his upper arm. He was also into judo and won the Copenhagen Cup Baunehøj Hall. During his judo practices, he met Lars Nybo, who played drums in the band Space-brain, later known as Suck. Steen Jørgensen seeing his potential as a singer invited him in. Sods / Sort Sol Soon after the break of Suck, Steen Jørgensen and Peter Schneidermann formed a new band called Sods (stylized as SODS), with Steen's girlfriend Camilla suggesting the name. Later Knud Odde and Tomas Ortved joined the band. Sods released the LPs Minutes to Go and Under En Sort Sol. SODS was later renamed Sort Sol (meaning Black Sun) and extended with a new member: Lars Top-Galia, who along with Peter came to be known as the \\"evil twins\\". The change of name also signified a shift in genre of music they played, moving from thrash punk to a more pop band. In 1993, the band released the album Glamourpuss. However soon after Peter Peter decided to leave the formation in 1995. Bleeder / The Bleeder Group In 1995, Peter Peter formed the more punk-oriented band Bleeder, after establishing his own record label I Hate You Records. The debut single was \\"Knucklehead\\" followed by the album Psycho Power in 1997. The title track, greatly affected by David Bowie, was filmed by Nicolas Winding Refn starting a long collaboration between Peter Peter and Refn. Another standing out track was a cover of The Osmonds hit \\"Crazy Horses\\". In 1996, Bleeder put music to Refn's cult film Pusher. Refn, an avid fan of the band called his second film Bleeder after Peter Peter's new band. Inclusion of singer Charlotte Bagge, known from the underground formation Squirm signalled a new development for Bleeder. Peter Peter also cooperated with the band Düreforsög producing their album Beach in (1999), also producing Kristian Vester's band Goodiepal. Other Peter Peter projects included the score notably for the film De Skrigende Halse In 2000s, Peter Peter launched a new project he called The Bleeder Group (to differentiate from the original Bleeder). The new formation released the greatly acclaimed Sunrise in 2004. Tracks included \\"The Men Behind the Moon\\", \\"It's Just A Game\\", and \\"I Know You're Going to Love My Sad Song / About People And What They Do\\" and a new version of \\"Knucklehead'.

The hunger strike was organized by inmates in long term solitary in the Security Housing Unit (SHU) at Pelican Bay State Prison in protest of inmates housed there that were in solitary confinement indefinitely for having ties to gangs. Another hunger strike that added to the movement started the week before in High Desert State Prison. The focus of the High Desert State Prison hunger strike was to demand cleaner facilities, better food and better access to the library. Due to the two-month hunger strike, lawmakers agreed to hold public hearings on the conditions within California's maximum security prisons where this prolonged solitary confinement has taken place. Following this announcement, a week later on September 4, 2013, there were 100 inmates in two prisons on a hunger strike; 40 of them had been on a hunger strike continuously since July 8. All remaining hunger strikers, in light of the lawmaker's promise, resumed eating on September 5, 2013.  Human rights concerns and solitary confinement  Health and human rights concerns surrounding California's use of solitary confinement are not a new phenomenon. Questions regarding both the mental and physical health of prisoners kept in solitary confinement have been prevalent since the practice began in the early 1800s. Solitary confinement in United States' prisons is the practice of detaining prisoners in a single cell for between 22 and 24 hours a day. The majority of prisoners confined in solitary confinement in California are contained to 11-foot-by-7-foot windowless concrete cells. These cells generally contain a toilet, shower, a slot in the door large enough for a food tray, and a bed. California opened Corona and Pelican Bay State prisons in the late 1980s, which were two of the first and largest supermax prisons to be erected. In the case of Madrid v. Gomez in 1995, the U.S. district court for Northern California determined that a significant number of inmates held in SHU units within Pelican Bay prison suffered from mental health issues. California law allows for any prisoner to be placed into an SHU unit for an indefinite amount of time, so long as they are suspected to be active within a gang. The prisoners' release from the SHU unit can only be reviewed every six years. In Madrid the court determined that the Pelican Bay prison was failing to provide adequate mental and physical care for prisoners, and that the Pelican Bay SHU was in a state of a \\"mental health crisis\\". The Madrid case also brought to light the violence and cruel and unusual punishment that guards were inflicting upon inmates within the SHU unit of the prison, including acts such as caging inmates outside during inclement weather. The Supreme court in 2011 declared that the California prisons were overcrowded to the point of it being considered cruel and unusual punishment, effectively violating the 8th amendment. The supporting opinion on this bipartisan and landmark decision described that the California prison system had failed to meet the minimum requirements needed for the mental and physical health of prisoners. One year after the supreme court decision in 2011, California still had more than 10,000 inmates confined to solitary confinement, with 1,557 inmates having been kept in solitary confinement for at least 10 years. No state besides California is believed to have held such high numbers of prisoners in solitary confinement for such a prolonged period of time. Human Rights Watch, an independent organization that focuses on human rights, found that prolonged use of solitary confinement is inconsistent with respecting the inmates humanity. Amnesty International, a global human rights NGO, voiced support for the hunger striker's concerns as well as saying that California has fallen short of international law and the necessary standards for humane treatment due to California's use of solitary confinement.  Organization of the strike  The Hunger strike began in early July 2013 by inmates across prisons in California in an effort to protest solitary confinement and inhumane conditions within the prisons. The strike began and was led by inmates within the Pelican Bay Prison's SHU unit. The leaders of the strike formed the Pelican Bay State Prison SHU Short Corridor Collective in 2011 to protest prolonged solitary confinement and debriefing practices that were common within the prison. At its peak 6,600 prisoners across 13 California jails participated in the 2011 hunger strike. The 2011 hunger strike was ended by the organizers after approximately a month because of the agreement by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to make reforms. The 2013 strike began because the Corridor Collective felt as if the CDCR had not kept their promises to them, and the Corridor Collective also announced that they had successfully gotten all racial groups to agree to band together to fight for better prison conditions. The creators of the Corridor Collective and also the leaders behind the strike were Todd Ashker, Arturo Castellanos, Ronnie Dewberry, and Antonio Guillen. Each of the leaders were prisoners within the Pelican Bay Prison SHU, with Ashker being a member of the Aryan Brotherhood, Castellanos belonging to the LA street gang Florencia 13, Dewberry being in the Black Guerrilla Family, and Guillen in the Nuestra Familia gang. The four men who collaborated to begin the strike had been placed within the short corridor section of the SHU due to the guard's belief that they were influential within the prison gangs, and the want to isolate them. Effectively, placing these men within the same pod made it possible for them to communicate with each other by yelling between their cells in order to coordinate the massive hunger strike. The men used their family and neighborhood networks to spread the message both inside and outside of the prison system of the upcoming strike, also sending letters to multiple prison solidarity groups in order to get the word out. Prisoners within the SHU unit also used methods such as speaking through the toilet drains, writing ghost messages in library books, or sending coded messages through family members in order to communicate with each other. The strikers made multiple demands of the prisons, including asking for an end to long-term solitary confinement along with group punishments, better and more nutritious food, along with ending policies surrounding the identification and treatment of suspected gang members. One of these specific practices is referred to as the \\"debriefing\\" policy, where California places suspected gang members into solitary confinement, and only agrees to place them back into general population if they provide the identities of other gang members. Along with the hunger strike, many inmates also began refusing to attend work and classes.  Health concerns  After a few days of refusing food, the body stops feeling hungry and begins to break down proteins within muscle to create glucose according to the California Correctional Health Care Services. After two weeks of refusing food, people on hunger strike will begin to lose coordination and have difficulty standing and begin feeling overwhelmingly cold and sluggish. Once an individual has not eaten for 45 days or beyond, the risk of death due to cardiac arrest is very high. Prisoners' attorneys and doctors expressed concern over the strikers' potential health risks. Prison officials, however, implemented inhumane tactics in an attempt to force prisoners to end their strike. Prisoners were denied access to their medications, and were denied medical oversight. Some of the prisoners were only refusing solid foods, and they were denied access to any liquid substance other than water. These cruel methods of punishment received an abundance of backlash from the medical community, and the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) was heavily criticized. As a result, the plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit about medical care in state prisons, the federal receiver in charge of prison health care and the CDCR jointly submitted a request to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on August 19, 2013, for an order authorizing the refeeding under specified conditions of inmate-patients who were participating in the hunger strike. Judge Thelton E. Henderson granted the order the same day. The process of force-feeding, often referred to as \\"refeeding\\" within the prison system, can be as severe as inserting feeding tubes into prisoner's noses or stomach. Previously to this order, prisoners who had signed orders not to be resuscitated were not allowed to be force-fed based on California policy. Officials cited concerns over prisoners being coerced into participating in the hunger strike by gangs as a reason to force-feed them, which Judge Henderson agreed to ignore the signed \\"do-not resuscitate\\" orders of the prisoners due to these concerns. Despite the concerns by the CDCR that inmates were being coerced into participating, only one instance of explicit coercion was ever recorded by prison officials. By the time the order was put into effect, there were less than 200 prisoners still fasting, and numerous others had been hospitalized. There was only one fatality from the strike. Billy \\"Guero\\" Sell died on July 22, 2013 after requesting medical attention for seven days leading up to his death.  Legal actions  The lawsuit, Todd Ashker, et al., vs. Governor of the State of California, et al., was brought by 10 Pelican Bay State Prison inmates who were housed in the Security Housing Unit (SHU). The lawsuit alleged that long- term confinement in the SHU violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment as well as the Fourteenth Amendment's clause for due process. The court case on September 1, 2015 was settled resulting in the termination of indeterminate solitary confinement in California and greatly reducing the number of individuals in solitary confinement as a whole. The court ruled in January 2019 that California continues to make constitutional violations, and that there will be an additional year of monitoring. Many prisoners feel that there is still much change needed as the debriefing process for gang affiliated prisoners was not revised.

Image is around 25 km across. Note the lack of any sharp ridges anywhere in the image. The landscape polewards of around 30 degrees latitude on Mars has a distinctively different appearance to that nearer the equator, and is said to have undergone terrain softening. Softened terrain lacks the sharp ridge crests seen near the equator, and is instead smoothly rounded. This rounding is thought to be caused by high concentrations of water ice in soils. The term was coined in 1986 by Steve Squyres and Michael Carr from examining imagery from the Viking missions to Mars. Below 30 degrees of latitude, impact craters have steep walls; well- defined, sharp rims; and flat or smoothly bowl-shaped floors. Ridges on intercrater plains come to similarly well-defined, pointed crests. However, above this latitude, these same features appear very different. The crests seen on ridges and crater rims appear strongly rounded and much more poorly defined. The relief (height) of features is somewhat reduced. Small craters are noticeably less common. In other words, terrain which elsewhere looked sharp here looks \\"soft\\".Squyres, Steven W., and Michael H.

Squyres. \\"The topography of impact craters in “softened” terrain on Mars.\\" Icarus 100.1 (1992): 26-39. Softened craters are also commonly infilled with concentric patterns on their floors. On Earth, diffusive creep of soils is associated with rounded hillslopes.Roering, Joshua J., James W. Kirchner, and William E. Dietrich. \\"Evidence for nonlinear, diffusive sediment transport on hillslopes and implications for landscape morphology.\\" Water Resources Research 35.3 (1999): 853-870.Rosenbloom, N. A., and Robert S. Anderson. \\"Hillslope and channel evolution in a marine terraced landscape, Santa Cruz.\\" California: Journal of Geophysical Research 99.B7 (1994): 14-013. Squyres and Carr thus attributed the softened texture to accelerated viscous creep in shallow soils near the surface, and went on to associate this accelerated creep with the presence of ground ice at these latitudes. This conclusion has been largely borne out by subsequent research.Berman, Daniel C., David A. Crown, and Leslie F. Bleamaster III. \\"Degradation of mid-latitude craters on Mars.\\" Icarus 200.1 (2009): 77-95.

Terrain softening is one of a suite of features seen in the midlatitudes of Mars—also including lobate debris aprons, lineated valley fill, concentric crater fill, latitude dependent mantle, patterned ground, viscous flow features, arcuate ridges, recurring slope lineae, and gullies—whose form and distribution strongly suggest the abundance of ice at the surface.

The forestry sector has marked the economy. Today, tourist activities, especially the resort, are increasing rapidly. An important hamlet of chalets is located around the northern part of the lake. While several cottages on the south side are accessible only by water or mountain biking, but they are accessible in winter on the ice.  Geography  Located in the north of Sainte-Thècle, this lake has a surface of and a total length of . The maximum depth of the lake is the Jesuit . Transparency of water is estimated at . Its shape has two water bodies whose main has the shape of the peninsula of Italy, with a length of in the north-south axis, and a maximum width of . Northwest, pass around connects the second body of water that has a length of (north to south) by (east to west). This second lake has three large bays and an island. Roads surrounding By road, the northern part of the lake is reachable by bypassing the mountains from the west, from the mouth of the lake, just follow the path of the Jesuit Lake (west), the road Lejeune Township (passing near Chnabail lakes) to route Joseph Saint-Amand where you have to turn right (heading north) and spend almost three lakes Champlain. Because of the mountains, there is no waggon road on the east side of the southern part of the lake to the Baptist lakes, three lakes Grandbois, lakes of the Center and Lake one mile. However, the \\"chemin des érables\\" (from the route Joseph Saint-Amand and southbound) serves the northern part of the lake (east side), up to a large bay. While the \\"chemin des cèdres\\" is serving west side of the northern part of the lake.  Location  In 1933 and 1945, a total of 17,000 brook trout fry were stocked. In 1970, only 4 species of fish were living in the lake.René Veillette, Chronique sur l'histoire de Sainte-Thècle (Chronicle about the history of Sainte-Thècle), \\"La profondeur des lacs de Sainte-Thècle\\" (The depth of the lakes of Sainte-Thècle), Journal Le Dynamique, October 31, 1973. Located entirely in forest and mountainous areas, the Jesuit lake is (direct line) southwest of Missionary Lake and (direct line) southeast of Lac Le Jeune. Lake Jesuit is three miles from Lake Traverse and (by road) from bridge of Croche Lake, in the lower village of Sainte-Thècle. The dam at the mouth of Lake Jesuit is located at the southeast end (geographic coordinates: latitude 46.842558856° and longitude −72.541008842°). After an initial fall at the foot of the dam, the lake outlet flows Jesuit direct line to the southeast over 0.3 km to the lake Aylwin (which is long). The latter lake is 191 meters above sea level and is 8 m. less than the lake Jesuit. The route of the lake outlet Jesuit resumes east of Lake Aylwin to empty into the lake from the Traverse.Map searches conducted on July 8, 2013, by historian Gaetan Veillette (Saint-Hubert, QC) from Google Map. At 940 m before it end, the \\"Décharge du lac Jésuite\\" (outlet of Lake Jesuit) receives the right shore waters \\"Ruisseau de l'Aqueduc\\" (Brook of Aqueduct) (approximate length: 850 m) which drains water from \\"Lac de l'Aqueduc\\" (Lake Aqueduct) (length of 320 m.) whose elevation is 303 m. In the southern part of Lake Jesuit (the East and West sides) high cliffs plunge into the lake. The top of the mountain that faces the mouth reaches 385 m. Boutet Lake is located behind this mountain at 341 feet above sea level. These cliffs are known for climbing enthusiasts. The maximum recorded on map depth is in the northern part of the lake. For water lovers, boat launch for boats, is located close to the mouth, south of the lake, on the way-du-du-lac-Jesuit.  History  Its form and extent, Lake Jesuit was an important route in the history of forestry to access licensed territories for logging and timber transport. The company Veillet & Brothers Limited operated a sawmill (two floors) powered by steam at the southern end of the lake near the outlet. The mill was built in the summer of 1938 by workers under the direction of entrepreneurs Jeffrey Veillet and Freddy Veillet on a lot of Philorum Béland. The equipment of the mill came from the demolition of the sawmill and Veillet Brothers Limited located at Audy (Lac- aux-Sables). The first slaughter of hardwoods in this area (especially in the north of the lake) took place in the winter 1938-1939 to be sawn at the mill in the spring. The wood was transported on the lake with a boat boom driven by steam.Gaétan Veillette, article \\"The businessman Jeffrey Veillet (1881-1946) of Sainte-Thècle (QC) directed until 6000 forestry workers, \\"The Pathiskan newsletter, March 1994, p. 14, published by the Association Veillet/te of America Inc. Collaboration: Armand Veillet (St-Jean-sur-Richelieu). Researchers Lorenzo Martel (Hervey-Jonction) and Clément Veillette (Hervey- Jonction) In 1945, Jeffrey Veillet sold his share of the mill to his brother Freddy Veillet who continued operations until his death occurred in 1949. Arsène Abel, son of Freddy Veillet sold the sawmill to 1952-1953, with all the equipment to a company that subsequently demolished the mill. Generally, about 25 to 30 employees were working at the same time at the mill.  Toponymy  Lakes Le Jeune and Jesuit in the territory of Lejeune Township, referred to highlight the work of the Jesuit missionary life Paul Le Jeune (1591-1664) in New France. This gazetteer recognition extends northeast with Missionary Lake. The Geographic Board, became the Commission de toponymie du Québec (Geographical Names Board of Québec), adopted the place name \\"Lake Jesuit\\" in 1936, replacing the usual place name \\"Little Long Lake\\".

It was built during the 13th century and has remained largely unaltered since. It lies in the Diocese of Visby. History The church was originally built as the church for a large farmstead. This first church was wooden, and built during the early 12th century. A few painted remains of the church have been preserved at the Gotland Museum in Visby. They were painted by a Russian artist and the scene depicts the Last Judgement. It has been speculated whether the remains were originally parts of an iconostasis, given the Russian origin of the work, but more probably they are the remains of a ceiling. The first church was torn down during the early 13th century and replaced by the presently visible stone church in Romanesque style. Before that, however, a defensive tower had been built near the church, the ruins of which are still standing. It probably served as a haven for the congregation in times of danger or war. The tower of the church was added in the middle of the 13th century. No major alterations have been made to the church since the Middle Ages, except for the addition of the vestry. Restorations were carried out in 1931 and 1969-1970. During a large part of its history, the church functioned as a navigational aid for sea-farers, as it is located on a height not far from the sea. It appears as such in a Dutch navigation book in 1627. Architecture The church is built of local sandstone, except the entrance portals which are executed in more durable limestone. It is a relatively homogeneous Romanesque church. The interior of the church is decorated with a suite of medieval murals depicting the Passion of Christ. A few medieval wooden sculptures have also been preserved, including a triumphal cross from the 15th century. The perhaps most unusual piece from the church is an organ dating from 1370 and today also on display in the Museum of Gotland in Visby. According to an inscription in Latin, it was made by a master named Verner from Brandenburg. It depicts the coats of arms of what has been interpreted as the ten farms of the parish. Near the church are the relatively well-preserved ruins of a circular defensive tower, dating from the early Middle Ages.

In 1760, she married Charles Bingham, later 1st Earl of Lucan.

Her work was collected in the United Kingdom and in France. In Paris she was given access to the Palais-Royal to copy pieces by the artists on display there, which were owned by the Duke of Orléans. Her foremost work was to supply miniatures and illuminations for a five-volume edition of Shakespeare's historical plays, for the library at Althorp, Northamptonshire.Charles Spencer, Althorp: The Story of an English House. Viking. . This took 16 years for her to complete. She also painted portraits, still lifes, and landscapes. Bingham was admired by Horace Walpole, who makes several flattering allusions to her in his letters.

Selwyn was the eldest son of Lieutenant-general William Selwyn, MP of Matson, Gloucestershire. He was commissioned into the Army in his infancy as ensign and lieutenant of the 3rd Foot Guards on 31 December 1688. His father died in 1702 whilst Governor of Jamaica and he inherited the Matson estate. He became captain and lieutenant- colonel in the 1st Foot Guards in 1707 and served in Flanders as aide-de-camp to the Duke of Marlborough. By 1709, he married Mary Farrington, the daughter of Lieutenant-general Thomas Farrington MP of Chislehurst. He rose to the rank of Colonel of the 3rd Regiment of Foot in 1711 until 1713. Selwyn was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament (MP) for Truro on the Boscawen interest at the 1715 general election. He was also appointed Commissioner of the Equivalent in 1715. He was appointed clerk of the household to Prince of Wales in 1716 through the influence of Lord Townshend. In 1717, he followed Lord Townsend into opposition and lost his Commissioner post. He was promoted to Groom of the Bedchamber to the Prince of Wales in 1718. After the Whigs came together again in 1720, he was appointed to the post of Receiver General and comptroller of customs but had to give up his seat in the House of Commons in February 1721 and did not stand in 1722. In 1726 Selwyn acquired property at Whitchurch which gave him a seat in Parliament. He was Mayor of Gloucester in 1727 and after passing the Receivership to his brother, returned himself as MP for Whitchurch at the 1727 general election. He continued as Groom of the Bedchamber after the Prince of Wales became King George II until 1730 when he became treasurer of the Queen's Household. As such he was accountable for payments from the Treasury to support Richmond Lodge and the households of the Duke of Cumberland, the Princesses Amelia and Caroline, and the Princesses Mary and Louise, children of the King and Queen. He was a member of the gaols committee of the House of Commons in the year 1729 to 1730. In 1733 he bought the manor of Ludgershall which gave him electoral influence at Gloucester. He was Mayor of Gloucester again in 1734 and was elected in a contest as MP for Gloucester at the 1734 general election. He spoke for the new colony of Georgia in a debate on the army estimates on 3 February 1738 and voted regularly with the Government. He was re-elected MP for Gloucester at the 1741 general election. He was appointed paymaster of marines in 1746 but to avoid a by-election, did not take it up until the 1747 general election when he was returned unopposed.

It opened on October 7, 2011 in the city's Ballard neighborhood, at a building constructed in 1947. The company is named for its founder Ryan Hilliard, a self-described home brewer turned professional who stepped back from his career as a flight instructor to open the brewery. Hilliard's was one of the first craft breweries in Washington to focus on producing beer in aluminum cans. Packaging beer in cans was an important part of the brewery's business plan: better for the beer's longevity, better for business operation sustainability and better for the environment. The company's brewing philosophy was 'keep it simple' and focus on quality ingredients. Their philosophy was displayed on their beer cans which were created by Seattle design company Mint. Hilliard's Beer is described as a \\"retro cool beer brand that embraces good design\\". In June 2016, it was announced that Hilliard's was to be bought out by Tukwila-based Odin Brewing Company and that Hilliard himself was to leave the craft beer industry rather than merge his company or join the new team.https://seattle.eater.com/2016/6/24/12025846/odin-brewing- company-buys-hilliards-beer The brewery is now permanently closed.  Products  Hilliard's brewed various styles of beer in 16 ounce tall boy cans. It typically served several beers on draft such as Hilliard's Nautical Reference Pale Ale (Pale Ale), Chrome Satan (California Common 'Style' Beer), Murdered Out Stout (Dry Irish Stout) and E.xtra S.pecial B.elgian (E.S.B. for short, a Dark Saison). The Hilliard's taproom served people seven days a week. The brewery's overall production in 2012 (its first calendar year) was 1600 barrels; or 384,000 cans. It was able to can beer at a rate of 24 cans per minute.  Community  Hilliard's frequently supported local non-profit groups in the visual arts, theater, youth media, film, and sports. Organizations which partnered with Hilliard's Beer included the Northwest Film Forum, Seattle Art Museum, Henry Art Gallery, Tilted Thunder Rail Birds Roller Derby, Seattle Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, Frye Art Museum, and the Uganda Village Project. Hilliard's Beer was also active in collaborations within the brewing community and was the first small craft brewery to jointly brew a beer with craft beer veteran, Redhook Ale Brewery. Together they turned out a product in July 2013 called, \\"Joint Effort\\", a hemp-infused beer brewed in response to the legalization of marijuana in Washington state. The session ale was brewed with hemp seeds and dry-hopped with Zeus, Cascade and Summit hops.http://brewwiki.com/index.php/Cascade_Hopshttp://brewwiki.com/index.php/Summit_Hops See also * Beer in the United States  References  Category:Beer brewing companies based in Washington (state) Category:Manufacturing companies based in Seattle Category:2011 establishments in Washington (state) Category:2016 disestablishments in Washington (state) ","title":"Hilliard's Beer"},{"id":"40094908","text":"The Texas LoneStar Strikers are an American professional men's basketball team based in the Magnolia, Woodlands, and Conroe, Texas area.IBL heads to Texas with addition of LoneStar Strikers, IBL website link, March 26, 2013 They are currently Independent, but once were members of the International Basketball League and began play in the league in 2013.

The song is on his album, Rigor Mortis Sets In. This entire album is an affectionate homage to, or satire of, 1950s and 1960s rock music. In addition to some actual \\"oldies\\", original compositions include \\"Roller Skate Kate\\" and \\"Peg Leg Peggy\\". The lyrics for the latter say that Peggy \\"really knows how to hop\\", a phrase originally used in rock songs to mean that a person was a skilled dancer, but in this case is a blackly humorous reference to Peggy having an artificial (\\"peg\\") leg. The song is also found on Entwistle's compilation album So Who's The Bass Player? The Ox Anthology. The BBC said that \\"Do The Dangle\\" song \\"prospers\\" Entwistle's dark sense of humour, and that it is a \\"1950s\\" rock and roll homage about strangulation. The song's opening lines list actual popular dances from the early to middle 1960s: the Shake, Boogaloo, Mashed Potatoes, Hoochie-Coo, Twist, and Funky Chicken. All of these dances, and numerous others, were created after the huge international popularity of the aforementioned Twist, which began in 1960 with the release of the song of the same name by Hank Ballard. A sound-alike cover version by Chubby Checker tremendously out-sold the original, and was the first recording to attain the number one position on Billboard magazine's Top 100 listing in two different years (1960 and 1961). The overall dance fad faded after 1965 when progressive rock music rapidly evolved away from lightweight subjects like dancing. In \\"Do the Dangle\\", composer Entwistle sings of three new dances, invented by him in 1972 but described in the style which would have been used a decade earlier. These are the Wheezy, the Strike, and the Dangle. Instructions for dancing the latter, from the lyrics, are: \\"Here's a brand new dance with a brand new angle / It's the very last waltz, and it's called the Dangle / You tie a rope 'round your neck, then you stand on a chair / Then you kick it away, and you're dancing on air.\\" The dark humor of this ironically light-hearted description of suicide by strangulation ends with Entwistle urging his listeners, \\"Everybody get up and - swing!\\" This phrase too had been used in older songs as an exhortation to dance, but here conjures a vision of a body swinging from a rope. Entwistle called this album \\"Rigor Mortis Sets In\\" and illustrated the cover with a photo of a coffin and a grave, implying that rock music was dying or dead, and that one could only look back at its earlier days of glory. In fact it was released just as a re-appreciation of older rock & roll was just getting started, which served to invigorate the careers of former singing stars and introduced their songs to a new audience. An early manifestation of this awareness was the performance of the group \\"Sha Na Na\\" (a nonsense phrase from the 1950s doo-wop song \\"Get A Job\\") who sang 1958's \\"At The Hop\\" at the Woodstock music festival in 1969. Popular music had changed so drastically in the previous ten years that the Woodstock audience could laugh knowingly at the perceived naivete of the 1950s. The film \\"American Graffiti\\", first shown in 1973 (the same year of \\"Rigor Mortis Sets In\\") was the real instigation of the fad for the so-called \\"Fabulous '50s\\" which also inspired the hit TV series \\"Happy Days\\". Although \\"American Graffiti\\" was set in 1962, its soundtrack featured 1950s music, to emphasize that society was about to change drastically the following year with the death of President Kennedy and the subsequent upheavals in much of society.

Kepler was followed by the Maxwell microarchitecture and used alongside Maxwell in the GeForce 700 series and GeForce 800M series. The architecture is named after Johannes Kepler, a German mathematician and key figure in the 17th century scientific revolution.  Overview  Where the goal of Nvidia's previous architecture was design focused on increasing performance on compute and tessellation, with Kepler architecture Nvidia targeted their focus on efficiency, programmability and performance. The efficiency aim was achieved through the use of a unified GPU clock, simplified static scheduling of instruction and higher emphasis on performance per watt. By abandoning the shader clock found in their previous GPU designs, efficiency is increased, even though it requires additional cores to achieve higher levels of performance. This is not only because the cores are more power- friendly (two Kepler cores using 90% power of one Fermi core, according to Nvidia's numbers), but also the change to a unified GPU clock scheme delivers a 50% reduction in power consumption in that area. Programmability aim was achieved with Kepler's Hyper-Q, Dynamic Parallelism and multiple new Compute Capabilities 3.x functionality. With it, higher GPU utilization and simplified code management was achievable with GK GPUs thus enabling more flexibility in programming for Kepler GPUs. Finally with the performance aim, additional execution resource (more CUDA Core, register and cache) and with Kepler's ability to achieve a memory clock speed of 6 GHz, increases Kepler performance when compare to previous Nvidia GPUs.  Features  The GK Series GPU contains features from both the older Fermi and newer Kepler generations. Kepler based members add the following standard features: * PCI Express 3.0 interface * DisplayPort 1.2 * HDMI 1.4a 4K x 2K video output * Purevideo VP5 hardware video acceleration (up to 4K x 2K H.264 decode) * Hardware H.264 encoding acceleration block (NVENC) * Support for up to 4 independent 2D displays, or 3 stereoscopic/3D displays (NV Surround) * Next Generation Streaming Multiprocessor (SMX) * Polymorph-Engine 2.0 * Simplified Instruction Scheduler * Bindless Textures * CUDA Compute Capability 3.0 to 3.5 * GPU Boost (Upgraded to 2.0 on GK110) * TXAA Support * Manufactured by TSMC on a 28 nm process * New Shuffle Instructions * Dynamic Parallelism * Hyper-Q (Hyper-Q's MPI functionality reserve for Tesla only) * Grid Management Unit * NVIDIA GPUDirect (GPU Direct's RDMA functionality reserve for Tesla only) = Next Generation Streaming Multiprocessor (SMX) = The Kepler architecture employs a new Streaming Multiprocessor Architecture called \\"SMX\\". SMXs are the reason for Kepler's power efficiency as the whole GPU uses a single unified clock speed. Although SMXs usage of a single unified clock increases power efficiency due to the fact that multiple lower clock Kepler CUDA Cores consume 90% less power than multiple higher clock Fermi CUDA Core, additional processing units are needed to execute a whole warp per cycle. Doubling 16 to 32 per CUDA array solve the warp execution problem, the SMX front-end are also double with warp schedulers, dispatch unit and the register file doubled to 64K entries as to feed the additional execution units. With the risk of inflating die area, SMX PolyMorph Engines are enhanced to 2.0 rather than double alongside the execution units, enabling it to spurr polygon in shorter cycles. Dedicated FP64 CUDA cores are also used as all Kepler CUDA cores are not FP64 capable to save die space. With the improvement Nvidia made on the SMX, the results include an increase in GPU performance and efficiency. With GK110, the 48KB texture cache are unlocked for compute workloads. In compute workload the texture cache becomes a read-only data cache, specializing in unaligned memory access workloads. Furthermore, error detection capabilities have been added to make it safer for workloads that rely on ECC. The register per thread count is also doubled in GK110 with 255 registers per thread. = Simplified Instruction Scheduler = Additional die spaces are acquired by replacing the complex hardware scheduler with simple software scheduler. With software scheduling, warps scheduling was moved to Nvidia's compiler and as the GPU math pipeline now has a fixed latency, it introduced instruction-level parallelism in addition to thread level parallelism. As instructions are statically scheduled, consistency is introduced by moving to fixed latency instructions and a static scheduled compiler removed a level of complexity. = GPU Boost = GPU Boost is a new feature which is roughly analogous to turbo boosting of a CPU. The GPU is always guaranteed to run at a minimum clock speed, referred to as the \\"base clock\\". This clock speed is set to the level which will ensure that the GPU stays within TDP specifications, even at maximum loads. When loads are lower, however, there is room for the clock speed to be increased without exceeding the TDP. In these scenarios, GPU Boost will gradually increase the clock speed in steps, until the GPU reaches a predefined power target (which is 170 W by default). By taking this approach, the GPU will ramp its clock up or down dynamically, so that it is providing the maximum amount of speed possible while remaining within TDP specifications. The power target, as well as the size of the clock increase steps that the GPU will take, are both adjustable via third-party utilities and provide a means of overclocking Kepler-based cards. = Microsoft Direct3D Support = Nvidia Fermi and Kepler GPUs of the GeForce 600 series support the Direct3D 11.0 specification. Nvidia originally stated that the Kepler architecture has full DirectX 11.1 support, which includes the Direct3D 11.1 path. The following \\"Modern UI\\" Direct3D 11.1 features, however, are not supported: * Target-Independent Rasterization (2D rendering only). * 16xMSAA Rasterization (2D rendering only). * Orthogonal Line Rendering Mode. * UAV (Unordered Access View) in non-pixel-shader stages. According to the definition by Microsoft, Direct3D feature level 11_1 must be complete, otherwise the Direct3D 11.1 path can not be executed. The integrated Direct3D features of the Kepler architecture are the same as those of the GeForce 400 series Fermi architecture. = Next Microsoft Direct3D Support = NVIDIA Kepler GPUs of the GeForce 600/700 series support Direct3D 12 feature level 11_0. = TXAA Support = Exclusive to Kepler GPUs, TXAA is a new anti- aliasing method from Nvidia that is designed for direct implementation into game engines. TXAA is based on the MSAA technique and custom resolve filters. It is designed to address a key problem in games known as shimmering or temporal aliasing. TXAA resolves that by smoothing out the scene in motion, making sure that any in-game scene is being cleared of any aliasing and shimmering. = Shuffle Instructions = At a low level, GK110 sees an additional instructions and operations to further improve performance. New shuffle instructions allow for threads within a warp to share data without going back to memory, making the process much quicker than the previous load/share/store method. Atomic operations are also overhauled, speeding up the execution speed of atomic operations and adding some FP64 operations that were previously only available for FP32 data. = Hyper-Q = Hyper-Q expands GK110 hardware work queues from 1 to 32. The significance of this being that having a single work queue meant that Fermi could be under occupied at times as there wasn't enough work in that queue to fill every SM. By having 32 work queues, GK110 can in many scenarios, achieve higher utilization by being able to put different task streams on what would otherwise be an idle SMX. The simple nature of Hyper-Q is further reinforced by the fact that it's easily mapped to MPI, a common message passing interface frequently used in HPC. As legacy MPI-based algorithms that were originally designed for multi-CPU systems that became bottlenecked by false dependencies now have a solution. By increasing the number of MPI jobs, it's possible to utilize Hyper-Q on these algorithms to improve the efficiency all without changing the code itself. = Dynamic Parallelism = Dynamic Parallelism ability is for kernels to be able to dispatch other kernels. With Fermi, only the CPU could dispatch a kernel, which incurs a certain amount of overhead by having to communicate back to the CPU. By giving kernels the ability to dispatch their own child kernels, GK110 can both save time by not having to go back to the CPU, and in the process free up the CPU to work on other tasks. = Grid Management Unit = Enabling Dynamic Parallelism requires a new grid management and dispatch control system. The new Grid Management Unit (GMU) manages and prioritizes grids to be executed. The GMU can pause the dispatch of new grids and queue pending and suspended grids until they are ready to execute, providing the flexibility to enable powerful runtimes, such as Dynamic Parallelism. The CUDA Work Distributor in Kepler holds grids that are ready to dispatch, and is able to dispatch 32 active grids, which is double the capacity of the Fermi CWD. The Kepler CWD communicates with the GMU via a bidirectional link that allows the GMU to pause the dispatch of new grids and to hold pending and suspended grids until needed. The GMU also has a direct connection to the Kepler SMX units to permit grids that launch additional work on the GPU via Dynamic Parallelism to send the new work back to GMU to be prioritized and dispatched. If the kernel that dispatched the additional workload pauses, the GMU will hold it inactive until the dependent work has completed. = NVIDIA GPUDirect = NVIDIA GPUDirect is a capability that enables GPUs within a single computer, or GPUs in different servers located across a network, to directly exchange data without needing to go to CPU/system memory. The RDMA feature in GPUDirect allows third party devices such as SSDs, NICs, and IB adapters to directly access memory on multiple GPUs within the same system, significantly decreasing the latency of MPI send and receive messages to/from GPU memory. It also reduces demands on system memory bandwidth and frees the GPU DMA engines for use by other CUDA tasks. Kepler GK110 also supports other GPUDirect features including Peer‐to‐Peer and GPUDirect for Video. = Video decompression/compression =  NVDEC   NVENC  NVENC is Nvidia's power efficient fixed-function encode that is able to take codecs, decode, preprocess, and encode H.264-based content. NVENC specification input formats are limited to H.264 output. But still, NVENC, through its limited format, can support up to 4096x4096 encode. Like Intel's Quick Sync, NVENC is currently exposed through a proprietary API, though Nvidia does have plans to provide NVENC usage through CUDA.  Performance  The theoretical single- precision processing power of a Kepler GPU in GFLOPS is computed as 2 (operations per FMA instruction per CUDA core per cycle) × number of CUDA cores × core clock speed (in GHz). Note that like the previous generation Fermi, Kepler is not able to benefit from increased processing power by dual- issuing MAD+MUL like Tesla was capable of. The theoretical double-precision processing power of a Kepler GK110/210 GPU is 1/3 of its single precision performance. This double-precision processing power is however only available on professional Quadro, Tesla, and high-end TITAN-branded GeForce cards, while drivers for consumer GeForce cards limit the performance to 1/24 of the single precision performance. The lower performance GK10x chips are similarly capped to 1/24 of the single precision performance.

Smolin argues for what he calls a revolutionary view that time is real, in contrast to existing scientific orthodoxy which holds that time is merely a \\"stubbornly persistent illusion\\" (Einstein's words). Smolin hypothesizes that the very laws of physics are not fixed, but that they actually evolve over time. Content and concepts Time Reborn is divided into two parts: Part I describes established physics and its history from the time of Plato and the main established ideas, Newtonian physics (and Leibniz' philosophical views that countered Newton's e.g. on background dependent physics and his religious justification), Albert Einstein's special and general relativity, and quantum mechanics. Part II describes Smolin's views (his \\"future\\" for physics, relying on his and ideas of others) on why these all are slightly wrong, that is, the need to reestablish time as fundamental (and probably space as non-fundamental, rather than vice versa, that was Einstein's view) through e.g. one idea, shape dynamics, a duality of Einstein's general relativity, that does that. Smolin argues for what he calls a revolutionary view that time is real, in contrast to existing scientific orthodoxy which holds that time is merely a \\"stubbornly persistent illusion\\" (Einstein's words). Smolin reasons that physicists have improperly rejected the reality of time because they confuse their mathematical models—which are timeless but deal in abstractions that do not exist—with reality. Smolin hypothesizes instead that the very laws of physics are not fixed, but that they actually evolve over time. Smolin asserts that overturning the existing orthodoxy is the best hope for finding solutions to contemporary physics problems, such as bringing gravity into line with the rest of the currently accepted models, the nature of the quantum world and its unification with spacetime and cosmology. Outside science, Smolin asserts his views have important implications for human agency, and on how our social, political, economic and environmental decisions affect our future, Smolin saying that contrary to deterministic philosophies derived from conventional physics, humans do have the power to exert control over climate change, our economic system and our technology. The book's topic was the subject of the author's 2013 presentation at the Royal Society of Arts. Reception The New York Times' James Gleick wrote that Smolin's arguments from science and history were \\"as provocative, original, and unsettling as any I’ve read in years,\\" contradicting the commonly accepted views of H.G. Wells, Hermann Minkowski, Albert Einstein, Isaac Newton and Plato; Gleick predicted it will ring false to many contemporaries in theoretical physics. Gleick further wrote that Smolin has a \\"fairly puritanical view of what science should and should not do\\"—disfavoring multiverses or other non-testable concepts or quests for timeless truths, but allowing that science creates “effective theories” even though they are incomplete, of limited domains, and approximate. Kirkus Reviews described the book, which omits mathematical explanations, as being as much philosophy as science, and as providing \\"a flood of ideas from an imaginative thinker.\\" For the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies, author Rick Searle wrote that Time Reborn is \\"just as much a diagnosis of contemporary economic and political ills\\" as it is a book about physics. Possible economic and political similarities/\\"implication\\" (to physics and philosophy discussed in the book) are only mentioned in the preface and epilogue of the book.

Its present appearance dates largely from the 13th and 14th centuries. History Interior view towards the choir A wooden church was built on the site of the current one during the early 12th century, at the latest. The church has later been replaced by first a Romanesque church, of which the portals survive, and later once more rebuilt in Gothic style during the 13th and 14th centuries. Few alterations have been made to the church since. The church was one of three so-called asylum churches on Gotland during the Middle Ages, a place where suspected criminals could find refuge awaiting trial. The name Tingstäde also translates to \\"location of a thing\\", indicating that the place has ancient judicial traditions. Architecture The church has a high () tower, adorned with Gothic galleries on several storeys. Inside, remains of picture stones have been used as building material. The nave is vaulted and the ceiling supported by a single, central column with richly sculpted capitals, a work by an anonymous master sculptor sometimes referred to as Calcarius during the 13th century. The choir lacks an apse. Externally, the Romanesque portals are also decorated with stone sculptures. Another portal, inside the choir and leading to the vestry, is even older, dating from the 12th century and decorated with the Lamb of God, which is also the heraldic symbol of Gotland. Given the location of the church at an ancient political site, this has led some scholars to speculate whether it was already a symbol for the island during the 12th century. Tingstäde church has a baptismal font probably made by the artist known by the notname Majestatis, possibly a remnant of the first, wooden church. The church also has a noteworthy triumphal cross from the 14th century. The altarpiece is considerably later, dating from the 18th century, while the pews are probably from the 17th century.

Introduced in September 1990, she was portrayed by several child actors until the character left the series in 1992, with further guest appearances in both 1996 and 1997. The character was reintroduced to the series in July 2013, under the portrayal of actress Jen Lilley, best known for her portrayal of Maxie Jones on General Hospital, and departed in November 2016. Lilley reprised the role in May 2018 for a three- month stint, departing again in July. Theresa is the daughter of supercouple Shane Donovan and Kimberly Brady (Charles Shaughnessy and, most prominently, Patsy Pease). With the casting of Lilley in the role, the character entered her first major story line, opposite Casey Moss who portrays JJ Deveraux.  Casting  Lilley's temporary portrayal of Maxie Jones on General Hospital caught the eye of executive producer Ken Corday and other executives at Days of Our Lives, which led to her audition for Theresa. In April 2013, it was announced by Soap Opera Digest and several other sources that Jen Lilley joined the cast of Days of Our Lives in a newly created role with ties to the canvas. Due to the show's advanced filming schedule, Lilley began filming in the (then-unknown) role in March 2013. Lilley made her on-screen debut as Theresa on July 3, 2013. In May 2016, Daytime Confidential reported that Lilley had quit the soap after three years. Lilley made her final appearance on November 18, 2016. On November 17, 2017, it was announced that Lilley would reprise the role of Theresa; she returned on May 3, 2018. Lilley once again exited the role on July 19, 2018.  Character development  With the casting of Lilley, executive producer Ken Corday admits that seeing the actress' work on General Hospital helped with the casting of the actress in the role of Theresa. Upon Theresa's re-appearance on the canvas, she was characterized as the \\"bad girl\\". In an interview with MSN Entertainment on her role, Lilley spoke: \\"Part of me doesn't want to make excuses for her, because you can have horrible upbringing and make something positive of it. Some of the most amazing, well-grounded people have come from the wrong side of the tracks. Obviously, the Brady-Donovan family is a great family, but her dad Shane is a spy and I watched the episode where he leaves the kids with Kimberly. Theresa was probably one, at most, so she didn't have a dad growing up, which is a formula for trouble. Typical psychological path for a girl like that is to look for love in the wrong places and look for a father figure in older guys.\\" The role of Theresa has been described as \\"sarcastic, calculating, mischievous\\" and \\"mysterious\\". Lilley also called her \\"such a badass\\". For her casting, Lilley stated she originally went in for two roles, those of both Theresa and Jordan Ridgeway. At the time, she was hoping to book the \\"good girl\\" role; however for her second audition, was asked to amp it up to a more bad girl persona and concentrate on Theresa. She revealed: \\"I got to skip the first audition, which is called a pre-read and is an audition to audition. So then I auditioned with everyone else, and I got to do my screen test twice, which is very unusual. I was the only girl who got to do that, so I went first and last. The reason they had me do it twice is that I wore my hair curly, and I have a really young face, and they said that I looked too sweet and innocent and young with the curly hair. So they straightened my hair and had me do it again. On the second take, I knew that I had nothing to lose. I had already done a perfect first take, and they told me it wasn't going to get better than that so I could do whatever I wanted. I just did everything out of the box, and that's what got me the job. I mean I took the guy's shirt off in the scene! I told the actor that this is a character with no concept of personal space, so I asked him if it's ok if I touch him. He said that was fine and it was my screen test. So I took his shirt off and I threw some props at him at the end. I broke all the rules, and I think [the casting staff] thought, that is that character.\\"  Storylines  Jeannie Theresa Donovan is introduced in September 1990, to Kimberly Brady (Patsy Pease), and was originally believed to be the daughter of Cal Winter. However, paternity tests and a confession from Cal proved her father to be Shane Donovan (Charles Shaughnessy). She grew up with her parents in Salem, before relocating to Los Angeles. = 2013–2018 = In July 2013, Jeannie returns to Salem, this time going by her middle name, Theresa. Initially, she strikes up a connection with resident bad boy JJ Deveraux (Casey Moss) while trying to secure some pot. During a confrontation with JJ and his mother Jennifer Horton (Melissa Reeves) in her office, her aunt Kayla confirms that Theresa is in fact Jeannie and that Jen promised to hire her as her assistant, a promise she reluctantly agrees to. Kayla reminds Theresa it is her last chance at a fresh start. Theresa also strikes up a bad first impression with Jennifer's daughter Abigail Deveraux (Kate Mansi) when Abigail smells pot on Theresa in her mother's office. To continue to battle against Jennifer, she teams up with Anne Milbauer (Meredith Scott Lynn) in hopes of exacting her perfect revenge. In a ploy, Theresa reveals her intentions to hopefully woo Dr. Daniel Jonas (Shawn Christian). After sleeping with JJ, Theresa overdoses on marijuana and GHB. Upon hearing of their daughter's overdose and continuing problems, Shane and Kimberly return to town in the hopes of handling their daughter's problem, together. After believing that Theresa has a handle on her addictions, Shane and Kimberly leave town together. Theresa then teams up with hospital co-worker Anne Milbauer (Meredith Scott Lynn) to conspire against Jennifer, using Daniel as a way to hurt their relationship. In early 2014, following a Narcotics Anonymous (NA) meeting, she begins a sexual and drugged-fused relationship with Brady Black (Eric Martsolf). In 2015, after it is found that Kristen DiMera (Eileen Davidson) stole Theresa's embryo and carried it to term, Brady and Melanie Jonas return her son, Christopher, to her and Brady, and the pair rename him Tate. When Theresa moves into the Kiriakis mansion, tensions arise between her and Victor. She eventually expresses her interest in purchasing Basic Black and running it as her own fashion company, with financial backing from Maggie Horton (Suzanne Rogers). In the hopes of finding the right partner, she teams up with Kate Roberts (Lauren Koslow) and Nicole Walker (Arianne Zucker) to achieve the goal of purchasing Basic Black, with Kate and Nicole's business background and her own interest in fashion design. As she and Brady share several instances of rekindling their romance, she is kicked out of the mansion by Victor; as a result, Brady quits Titan and moves in with Theresa and Tate, in their own penthouse.  Reception  Upon the news of Lilley joining the cast, Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps credited her casting as, \\"fantastic news for [Jen Lilley] fans\\". Despite rumors of Lilley joining the cast as a recast for either Belle Black or Cassie Brady, it was informed she would portray a new character. Janet DiLauro of About.com praised Theresa as a \\"riveting character\\", writing: \\"Days of our Lives has been seriously lacking in the bad girl department [...] Enter the deliciously naughty Theresa Donovan and suddenly it seems like Salem will never be the same.\\"  References and notes  = Citations = = Notes =  External links  *Soapcentral.com  Who's Who in Salem  Jeannie Donovan Category:Days of Our Lives characters Category:Television characters introduced in 1990 Category:Fictional people in fashion Category:Fictional cocaine users Category:Fictional drug addicts Category:Fictional female businesspeople Category:Female characters in television Category:Female villains ","title":"Theresa Donovan"},{"id":"40095131","text":"Amélie Oksenberg Rorty was a Belgian-born American philosopher known for her work in the philosophy of mind (in particular on the emotions), history of philosophy (especially Aristotle, Spinoza and Descartes), and moral philosophy.  Career  Rorty received her B.A. from the University of Chicago in 1951, M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Yale University in 1954 and 1961 respectively, and an M.A. from Princeton University in anthropology (where she has projected getting a second Ph.D.). She began her academic career at Wheaton College (Mass.) (1957–1961), then began teaching at Rutgers (Douglass College) in 1962 and taught there through to 1988, by which time she had achieved the rank of distinguished professor. She was also professor in the history of ideas (and director of the program) at Brandeis University from 1995–2003, and from 2008–2013 was visiting professor at Boston University. , she was a visiting professor at Tufts University. She was also a lecturer in the Department of Global Health and Social Medicine, Harvard School of Medicine. Rorty was the recipient of numerous awards and fellowships over the course of her career: Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Studies (1968-1969), King's College, Cambridge (1971-1973), Institute for Advanced Study (1980-1981), John Simon Guggenheim (1990-1991), Woodrow Wilson Center (1994-1995), and the National Humanities Center (2007-2008). =Work= Rorty has primarily worked on problems in moral psychology and moral education. She is especially interested in the many distinctive –-and often conflicting—functions of morality as a social practice, as it sets prohibitions, projects ideals, defines duties, characterizes virtues. Exploring the dark side of some of the virtues—courage as bravado, integrity as moral narcissism, the ambivalence of love--, she has also analyzed the advantages of resistance to the obligations of morality: the benefits of self- deception, the lures of moral weakness, the wisdom of ambivalence, the hidden rationale of allegedly irrational emotions. She approaches many of these issues historically (through Aristotle, Spinoza, Hume and Freud) and anthropologically (projecting a study of exiles, immigrants, refugees. who perforce absorb a new set of ‘moral’ values.) She is presently finishing a book provisionally entitled On the Other Hand: The Ethics of Ambivalence. Rorty is the author of over 120 scholarly articles and the author or editor of more than a dozen scholarly books of original essays. A monograph, Mind in Action: Essays in Philosophy of Mind, was published by Beacon Press in 1988 (paperback edition 1991). She also edited and contributed to Explaining Emotions (U. California Press, 1980), Essays on Aristotle’s Ethics (1980, U.California Press), and co-edited Essays on Aristotle’s De Anima (Oxford, 1992) with Martha Nussbaum. She initiated and served as general editor of Modern Studies in Philosophy (Doubleday-Anchor) and of Major Thinkers (University of California Press). Other notable books she edited include The Many Faces of Evil (Routledge, 2001), The Identities of Persons (1976, U. California Press) and The Many Faces of Philosophy (Oxford, 2000).

The Faculty has 288 full professors, associate and assistant professors, 180 junior researchers and about 6000 students. The Faculty of Science was formally established in 1946, although the teaching of these subjects had existed in the University since 1876. The Faculty offers undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate study programmes, and pursues research in the fields of natural sciences and mathematics. It also encompasses the seismological service, the mareographic and meteorological stations, and the Zagreb Botanical Garden. The Faculty of Science is engaged in excellent cooperation with numerous universities and institutes abroad. Professors of the Faculty have been invited as visiting lecturers to European and American universities, and young staff members, as well as postgraduate students, are regularly sent to international universities and institutes for further research.  History  On 23 September 1669. Leopold I certified at the Jesuit Neoacademica Zagrebiensis, a three-year higher education institution, which gradually developed the studies of Philosophy, Law and Theology. At the Jesuit School philosophy was taught even earlier, and part of its first year studies were logic, physics, and metaphysics. Neither Jesuit School (until 1773), nor royal Regia Scientiarum Academica (until 1850) represented a real university. Croatian Parliament and Franz Joseph I of Austria, introduced the Law on founding the University of Zagreb. Soon after the establishing of the University of Zagreb, Faculties of Law, Theology and Philosophy started operating. The Chairs of the Faculty of Philosophy were appointed gradually. In the field of natural sciences the teaching started in 1876, with first lectures in mineralogy and geology, and then in botany, physics, mathematics, chemistry and zoology and geography. A long endeavour of the Science Department of the Faculty of Philosophy to attain the status of Faculty, finally materialized in 1946, when the Faculty of Science was established.

His father managed a printing roller factory, and Hart worked there for a time in his teens but lost the job due to an explosion that took place when he was off sketching instead of watching the glue vats.Raynor, Vivien. \\"Art: A Substantial 'Pop' Hart Sampling at Rutgers's Zimmerli\\". New York Times, Dec. 21, 1986. Around the age of 18, he went to London on a cattle boat and while in England became an itinerant sign painter to support himself. Eventually he landed in Chicago, where he worked for a while as an illustrator for a newspaper and also as a sign painter for the Chicago World's Fair of 1893 and other clients. Although Hart was initially self-taught, in the 1890s he attended the Chicago Art Institute on and off for several years, and in 1907 he spent a year at the Académie Julien in Paris.\\"Hart, George Overbury 'Pop'.\\" New Jersey Encyclopedia. Ed. Maxine N. Lurie and Marc Mappen. New Jersey: Rutgers University, 2004, p 351. For the first few years of the 20th century, Hart traveled all over the world: to Mexico, Central America, North Africa, the Caribbean, and the South Pacific, where he visited Tahiti in 1903, shortly after the death of Gauguin. Following his 1907 studies in Paris, he supported himself for about five years by working as a sign painter around New York City, and then he worked for most of a decade painting sets for the nascent film industry in New Jersey. He set up a studio in Coytesville, a neighborhood in Fort Lee, New Jersey, but he spent much of the 1920s traveling again.\\"Hart, George Overbury 'Pop'.\\" Oxford Dictionary of American Art and Artists. Ed. Ann Lee Morgan. Oxford University Press, 2007. Hart is said to have acquired his nickname of \\"Pop\\" after growing a beard during one of his many trips, and thereafter many of his works appear with the signature \\"Pop Hart\\". He died in 1933 in Coytesville, where he had lived in poor health during his last years. Career From his early travels onward, Hart worked often in the highly portable medium of watercolor, and he developed a loose, vigorous style that eventually attracted the attention of Knoedler Gallery in New York, which gave him his first show. Critics have singled out his eye for detail, his technical accomplishment, and his roguish humor for praise. After moving to the New York City area, Hart became part of an artist colony in Fort Lee, New Jersey, that included such champions of avant-garde art as Walt Kuhn, Arthur B. Davies, and Edward Hopper. Among his close friends in New York art circles were members of the Ashcan school of social realism, especially Robert Henri and John Sloan. Hart painted seaside and marine subjects near his studio in Coytesville, New Jersey, as well as a wide range of other subjects including animals, botanical studies, nudes, and landscapes. On his travels, he focused on people's daily activities and street scenes, giving those works a markedly dynamic quality that meshes well with his spontaneous, fluid brushwork. His style varies: some works show affinity with the delicate expressiveness of John Marin and Cézanne, while others lean towards the brusquer social realism of Diego Rivera or Robert Henri. By 1921 he had taken up printmaking, working in drypoint, etching, and lithography from sketches made during his trips. Hart also continued to work in watercolor as well as gouache and was considered one of the leading watercolor artists of his day.\\"Hart, George Overbury nicknamed 'Pop'.\\" Britannica Encyclopedia of American Art. New York: Simon & Schulster, 1973, p 270. He was awarded a bronze metal at the Sesquicentennial Exposition in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1926, and in 1935 the Newark Museum mounted a memorial retrospective exhibition of his work. An indication of his popularity during his lifetime is the fact that in December, 1929 some of Hart's paintings were included in a New York exhibition of nineteen living American painters held by the Museum of Modern Art - the second exhibition held by the museum MOMA Archives http://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/1912?locale=en. His work was also part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics. Hart's work is in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Brooklyn Museum; the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; the Smithsonian Institution; the Los Angeles County Museum of Art; the British Museum, and other institutions in the United States and Europe. However, the largest single collection of his work is held by the Zimmerli Art Museum at Rutgers University, which received some 5000 items as a gift from Hart's niece, Jeane Overbury Hart, in the early 1980s. The Zimmerli Museum mounted a survey show of Hart's work in 1986 to coincide with the publication of a book on Hart's life and work by Gregory Gilbert, then a research fellow in Rutgers's Department of Art History.

According to the New American Cyclopedia, and Moore's Complete Encyclopaedia of Music, her father died when she was 20, leaving the family short of funds, and obliging her to employ professionally her musical talents, which had previously been under the direction of her mother, as \\"an elegant accomplishment\\". She must have had a good education as she developed into a versatile linguist, proficient in English, French, German and Italian. After a tour in France and part of Germany, the influence and support of Count St. Antonio resulted in her engagement at King's Theatre in London, where she made her first appearance as Cherubino in Le nozze di Figaro on 12 January 1822. The Examiner of 20 January 1822 reviewed her début favourably Her salary for this first season was £300. In 1823, she was re-engaged, at a salary of £400, and appeared as Vitellia in Mozart's La clemenza di Tito, and as Carlotta in Saverio Mercadante's Elisa e Claudio. In 1824, she married Mr. E. T. Allan, the secretary of the King's Theatre, where she was again engaged at a salary of £500, singing with Catalani in Mayr's Nuovo latico per la Musica, and (as a benefit for herself) as Zerlina in Don Giovanni. In the following year her chief parts were Carlotta in Pietro Generali's L'Adelina, Fatima in Gioachino Rossini's Pietro l'Eremita, and Palmide in Giacomo Meyerbeer's Il crociato in Egitto; in the latter opera she was associated with the castrato Velluti. In 1826, her salary, which had been lowered to £400, was raised to £700, and she sang with Giuditta Pasta in Zingarelli's Giulietta e Romeo, and as Rosina in Il Barbiere di Seviglia. However, during the following year, her salary rose to £1,200, but this was the last season of Italian opera in England for some time. After that, Caradori-Allan went to the continent. She sang in Venice in 1830, where she created the role of Giulietta in Bellini's I Capuleti e i Montecchi, but in 1834 re-appeared in Italian opera in London, and after 1835 remained mainly in England until her death. She sang the soprano solo at the British première of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 on 21 March 1825 and, at about that time, took part in the York festival and was at Gloucester. In 1827 she performed at the Leicester and Worcester festivals. In 1834, she sang in the Handel festival in Westminster Abbey, in 1836 at the Winchester festival with Maria Malibran, and in 1846 she took part in Felix Mendelssohn's Elijah at a production given at the Birmingham festival. In the final phase of her career, she abandoned the stage for oratorio and concert singing, in which she achieved great success. In 1840, she undertook a successful concert tour in the United States. She was a regular performer at the Concerts of Antient Music, and did some teaching. She also composed; The Daily News of 12 July 1847 reviewed her compositions favourably: Her mother, Elizabeth de Munck, died in London in 1841, aged 79. She was buried in Highgate Cemetery. Her grave monument has a relief carving of a pelican illustrating the legend that a mother pelican would sacrifice herself in times of need by pecking her breast and letting her chicks drink her blood. Beneath this are the words, “Ici repose ma meillure amie, ma mère”. She retired in 1848 following the end of season Concert of Ancient Music on 14 June, although she put in one final appearance on the platform, for the Crystal Palace concert which opened The Great Exhibition on 1 May 1851. She died at Elm Lodge, Surbiton, on 15 October 1865. Assessment Throughout her life, Madame Caradori-Allan enjoyed great popularity. She was personally amiable and unaffected. Musically, she was highly accomplished, being an excellent sight reader and a well-regarded composer of songs for solo and ensemble voices. Her singing was more remarkable for finish than for force; her voice was characterized as pure, sweet, clear, silvery, and flexible. However, it was said of her that \\"she always delighted, but never surprised\\" her audiences. As an actress she was charming.

He was the main intermediary of the Gulf Cartel in Colombia, responsible for shipping large sums of cocaine from the Cali Cartel in the 1990s. Before becoming a drug trafficker, Malherbe worked as a shoeshiner and car washer. He then turned to the auto theft industry and was recruited in 1976 by Casimiro Espinosa Campos (alias El Cacho), a former leader of a cell within the Gulf Cartel. By age 22, the Mexican authorities had charged Malherbe with at least 10 homicides. In 1984, his boss was killed by the then- leader of the Gulf Cartel, Juan García Ábrego, who later appointed him as one of his top lieutenants and moneymen. Under García Ábrego, Malherbe coordinated cocaine shipments from Colombia via aircraft into Tamaulipas before they were smuggled by land to the United States. García Ábrego was arrested in January 1996 and Malherbe became his successor. However, his leadership was short- lived; about a year later in February 1997 in Mexico City, he was apprehended at a shopping center and imprisoned at Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 1, where he now serves his sentence. Early life and career Óscar Malherbe de León was born in Mexico on 10 January 1964. Before joining the drug trade, he was a shoeshiner and a car washer for several local drug lords. He then turned to car theft and was later recruited by the crime boss Casimiro Espinosa Campos (alias El Cacho) in 1976 and join the Gulf Cartel. Espinosa Campos headed a criminal cell in Matamoros that oversaw the area's auto theft industry, drug trafficking rings, protection rackets, and the cartel's score- settlings. By the 1980s, Malherbe's notoriety within the Gulf Cartel grew because he proved to be a cold-blooded and cunning assassin. At the age of 22, he was indicted by the Public Ministry of Matamoros (Spanish: Ministerio Público de Matamoros) and was alleged to have been involved in at least 10 homicides from 1983 to 1984. The name of the late Luis Medrano García, another leader in the Gulf Cartel arrested in 1993 in Ciudad Juárez, also appeared in the indictment. Medrano and Malherbe usually worked together by supervising the drug trafficking shipments in the corridor of Matamoros, Tamaulipas. Both of them had from six to eight armed henchmen watching their backs inside a walled compound from where they hid and gave orders. In 1984, however, Espinosa Campos's reign underwent a challenge when Juan García Ábrego, the head of the Gulf Cartel, wanted him dead. Their rivalry for the control of the Gulf Cartel prompted several killings in Matamoros, but García Ábrego managed to eventually wound and kill Espinosa Campos in May 1984 to thereby take control of the criminal organization and align it under a single command structure. With Espinosa Campos dead, his gang disintegrated and joined the lines of García Ábrego, marking the beginning of the modern Gulf Cartel. Malherbe, once close to Espinosa Campos's gang, went on to work with García Ábrego and later became one of his most trusted lieutenants and moneymen. In 1990, Malherbe supervised the Gulf Cartel's cocaine shipments that arrived to the U.S.-Mexico border via aircraft, and was allegedly responsible of arming and handing out uniforms of the Federal Judicial Police to his gunmen. The drugs were supplied by the Rodriguez Orihuela brothers of the Cali Cartel and arrived in clandestine runaways in San Fernando and Matamoros, Tamaulipas. They were then smuggled by land to the United States for future distribution. He was the main enlace (intermediary) of the Gulf Cartel in Colombia, where he held business relations with the top echelons of the Cali Cartel. The supremacy of the Gulf Cartel reached its peak in the 1980s and early 1990s, when it controlled at least one-third of all the cocaine that entered the United States and reportedly made $20 billion annually. Malherbe's boss headed the Gulf Cartel with a combination of \\"bribes, brutality and business acumen,\\" and authorities on both sides of the border made him a top priority in the War on Drugs. In 1995, García Ábrego was placed on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list; a year later in January 1996, he was arrested in a massive operation in northern Mexico and quickly extradited to the United States. Since the last months of 1995, the Gulf Cartel was having difficulty moving drugs into the United States, and only managed to introduced about a ton and a half of cocaine that year. Malherbe responded to this dilemma by forging an alliance with Amado Carrillo Fuentes of the Juárez Cartel, but the business partnership with him was short-lived. With García Ábrego behind bars, his brother Humberto and Malherbe became his successors, though the latter only commanded the Gulf Cartel for a little more than a year. Arrest Malherbe was arrested at a shopping center in the area of Mixcoac in Mexico City on 26 February 1997. Though his request was put down, he reportedly tried to pay off his release by bribing Mexican officials with US$2 million. At the time of his arrest, he had pending accusations on conspiracy to buy, traffic, and sell cocaine and marijuana, alongside charges on homicide and illegal use of firearms under Mexican law. He was then sent to the Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 1 in Almoloya de Juárez, State of Mexico to serve his sentence. Though the U.S. authorities asked for his extradition to the United States, a Mexican judge ordered Malherbe to be tried in Mexico because he believed that the evidences against him were insufficient. Kingpin Act sanction On 1 June 2001, the United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned Malherbe under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (sometimes referred to simply as the \\"Kingpin Act\\"), for his involvement in drug trafficking along with eleven other international criminals. The act prohibited U.S. citizens and companies from doing any kind of business activity with Malherbe, and virtually froze all his assets in the U.S. See also *Mexican Drug War Sources References Bibliography  * * Category:Gulf Cartel members Category:Mexican mob bosses Category:1964 births Category:Living people Category:People sanctioned under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act ","title":"Óscar Malherbe de León"},{"id":"40095504","text":"Rolighed is a historic property in the Frederiksberg district of Copenhagen, Denmark. Built in about 1770, it is one of few surviving examples of the summer retreats which dominated Frederiksberg from the late 18th century and until the area was absorbed by the expanding city of Copenhagen in the second half of the 19th century. It is now owned by University of Copenhagen. History The property traces its roots back to 1742 when Finance Minister Nicolai Ahrentzen leased an area to the south of Ladegården to build a facility for bleaching of wax for candles which he supplied to the Royal Court. The complex consisted of a 27 bay half-timbered house, stables, a wagon house and a number of bleaching benches. In 1749, Lüder Stiefken took over the wax bleachery but when he went bankrupt eight years later it was sold at auction. The buyer was Judge Military Prosecutor General Andreas Bruun, who acquired additional land in the area, closed the breachery and converted the property into a summer retreat with 18 cows and a garden with a fishing pond. He renamed the estate Mariendal, possibly after his daughter. Conrad Alexander Fabritius-Tengnagel After just a few years, the property changed hands again when it was purchased by Conrad Alexander Fabritius de Tengnagel, a prominent merchant and ship owner who also owned a town house in Christianshavn and Enrum at Vedbæk north of Copenhagen. Fabritius gave the property Rolighed and built the current house on his estate. Fabritius owned Rolighed until 1785. Over the next decades the estate changed hands several times and continued to grow through new acquisitions until reaching all the way from Rolighedsvej to Gammel Kongevej in the south. In 1855, Rolighed was purchased by the Ministry of Interior Affairs. The land was needed for the construction of the new Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University which opened in 19598 on Bülowsvej. The adjacent farm buildings photographed by Johannes Hauerslev in the 1900s The university sold off an area of land, where N.J. Fjords Allé, L.J. Brandes Allé and Dr. Abildgaards Allé later emerged, separating Rolighed from the rest of its grounds. The land where Rolighed was located, about 3.5 hectares, was sold to Københavns Sygehjem (litearlly \\"Copenhagen Sick Home\\"), which, after the 1853 Copenhagen cholera outbreak, was to provide care a respectable alternative to the poorhouse for chronically sick members of the middle class. The new institution opened in 1859 and Rolighed was used as residence for the chief physician. Architecture The adjacent farm buildings Rolighed is designed in the Rococo style. It has an almost quadratic footprint and is topped by a Mansard roof with black-glazed tiles. To the rear of the building is a cluster of low, yellow farm buildings located on three sides of a central courtyard.

Work  = Genre Classification = Janja Vidmar's youth and YA works fall into six prose literary genres: socio- psychological novels (Baraba, Debeluška, Princeska z napako, V imenu ljubezni, Vsiljivka, Fantje iz gline, Zoo, Nimaš pojma, Uspavanka za mladega očka), socio-psychological narratives (Matic je kaznovan, Matic v bolnišnici, Matic prespi pri prijatelju, Matic je zaljubljen, Moja Nina, Prijatelja, Sence poletja, Punce za znoret, Smetiščni dnevnik, Na vroči sceni, Superzvezda, V imenu ljubezni, Manca&rock;), adventure realistic stories (Zala Zgaga, Junaki petega razreda, Druščina iz šestega b, Moj prijatelj Arnold, Peklenske počitnice, Potovanje groze), horror stories (Krvava legenda, Hiša groze, Stvor, Otok smrti, Obrazi, Izgubljena avtocesta, Furija, Klovn iz Strahovskega Dola), short realistic prose (Bučko Superga) and fantastic narratives (Aknožer, Leteči krožnik na našem vrtu, Čudni vitez, Vrtiljak čudežev, Zgaga in mesto lutk, Zgaga in mačje oko).  The theme of her works  At the forefront of her socio-psychological novels and stories, Vidmar put the alienation and stratification of society. In almost every work, the author addresses various taboo topics, such as death, homosexuality, peer violence, domestic violence, eating disorders, xenophobia and the division of people by religious affiliation in a way that reveals a moral dimension. Her literary characters come from different social backgrounds, but their paths nevertheless intersect several times. Through the internal monologues and comments of a third-person narrator, the characterization of literary figures is revealed. In the works, however, we also find a considerable measure of the self-irony of the main characters, through which they try to maintain their dignity. The structure of storytelling is often synthetically constructed, and sometimes retrospectives appear to help us understand the background to what is happening.  Protagonists  The most common challenges her protagonists face coincide with motives and taboos such as poverty, loneliness, long-term violence, misunderstanding with adults and misunderstanding with peers. Vidmars works feature sudden twists, and troubled characters are commonly in conflict with the environment, stories however usually do have a happy ending.  Decline form socio-psychological topics  In later years Janja tends to write funny and cheerful stories, as in her own words she has enough of hard and moralising topics. In her later works (Elvis Škorc, genialni štor and Zala Zgaga) her protagonists are rather average teenagers dealing with challenges that most of the teenagers face. In those works, Vidmar rather uses humour than hard topics to attract and entertain readers. = Most visible works =  Fatty  This novel talks about the tragedy of longing for the perfect body. Teenager Uršula causes her own suffering, tragically not of her own choice, but to satisfy her mother’s ambition for winning in the modeling world (mother’s failure should be daughter’s success). This sick aspiration results in a serious illness. Urša is adaptable enough to pretend she is accepting the offered help and even behaves as if she plans to live healthily, but all that is just a front, because deep inside she will always think of herself as a - fatty.  Pink  Janca Vidner, a regular teenage girl, is yearning for normal things teenagers yearn - Levi’s jeans, for records of world-renowned musicians, for things not accessible at home but available right across the Austrian border. Janca’s story is an experience of growing up at the end of socialism, just before the disintegration of Yugoslavia and at the same time an experience of maturing from a little girl, a proud Tito’s pioneer, to a rock girl, who loses her virginity on the day of Tito’s death and makes the transition from girl to woman. A novel using autobiographical strokes on a thematic level, as clearly indicated by the name of the main character.  Boys of Clay  In this novel the topic of homosexuality, another taboo theme close to the author’s heart, is revealed. The author deals with the topic with great sensitivity. The novel mainly addresses social questions connected with the condemnation of same sex love and the prejudices that the main (Aik, Little) and supporting characters deal with. The novel develops through two first person narratives of the main characters with chapters taking turns equally.  Elvis Stork, a Genious Clutz  This novel represents Janjas deviation from social- psychological topics to humour and comic novels. Elvis, an unlucky teenager, has a father that spends all his time at the gym, his mother likes to get on Elvis’s nerves, his grandmother keeps pestering him to get fit, his younger sister Ella is oddly fixated on collecting creepy-crawlies, and his neighbour is so hot Elvis gets a suntan just by looking at her. Elvis is a lover who doesn’t stand a chance with girls, an inventor whose inventions are useless and a babysitter whose wards have to babysit themselves. His relatively uncomplicated life gets complicated when his mom makes an announcement that turns his world upside down.  The Third Way  This is her adult fiction debut, written with coauthor, lawyer Boris Grivić. The story, in a way a sequel to Princess With A Flaw (1998), is set in the time of Yugoslaw Wars and portray a young Bosnian refugee Fatima in Germany, assigned to a legal guardian, Mueller. Mueller himself is a disreputable, immoral German lawyer and criminal law scholar, alienated from himself and the world. Incapable of emotional commitment, he feels nothing when his best friend, Carsten, a former UN soldier stationed in Srebrenica, commits suicide. During their conflicted relationship, Mueller learns, through Fatima's reminiscences, about the events from 1992 to 1995 that led up to the genocide. Mueller goes back and reads Carsten's suicide note and the diary entries that describe the genocide. He begins to fantasize about seeking justice for all that happened.

In July 2013, the entire cabinet, including Machar, was dismissed by Kiir on the ostensible reason to decrease the size of government. However, Machar said that this was a step towards dictatorship on the part of Kiir and that he would seek to challenge Kiir for the presidency. In December 2013 a related coup d'état was put down. While civil war ensued, at the end of September 2014 an IGAD-mediated resolution was agreed upon that would lead to the federalisation of the country's governance. The transitional constitution required the election to be held by 9 July 2015, the date on which the first post-independence presidential term ends. Kiir told the Warrap parliament that a lack of funds to conduct a census and complete the new constitution could result in a delay of the election. This caused doubts as to Kiir's intention to merely hold on to power and was coupled with the dismissal of the Governor of Unity Taban Deng Gai on allegation that he would back Machar in replacing Kiir as the SPLM chairperson and therefore the party’s candidate for the election, though Gai denied this.

The sixth tropical cyclone and named storm of the annual hurricane season, Flossie originated from a tropical wave that emerged off the western coast of Africa on July 9\\\\. Tracking westward across the Atlantic with little development, it passed over Central America and into the eastern Pacific Ocean on July 18, where favorable environmental conditions promoted steady organization. By 0600 UTC on July 25, the wave acquired enough organization to be deemed a tropical depression; it intensified into a tropical storm six hours later. Continuing westward, Flossie attained peak winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) on July 27 before entering the central Pacific Ocean. There, unfavorable upper-level winds established a weakening trend; on July 30, Flossie weakened to a tropical depression, and by 1200 UTC that same day, the storm degenerated into a remnant low, northeast of Kauai. In advance of Flossie, tropical cyclone warnings and watches were placed into effect for various Hawaiian Islands. In addition, numerous flash flood watches were issued in fear of over a foot of precipitation. Ports and numerous facilities were closed to the public, and authorities opened shelters for refuge. Upon approach, Flossie threatened to become the first tropical storm to make a direct hit on Hawaii in two decades; however, the system weakened prior to doing so. Flossie brought high surf to the state, leading to minor beach erosion. Gusty winds exceeded tropical storm threshold, downing numerous power poles and trees; as a result, several thousand locals were without power for a few days. The storm produced several inches of rainfall across the island, with a peak of on Mount Waialeale. Though one man was injured due to lightnings, no fatalities were reported in association with Flossie. Damage totaled to $24,000 (2013 USD) as a consequence of lightning. Meteorological history On July 9, 2013, a tropical wave emerged off the western coast of Africa. Tracking swiftly westward across the Atlantic, it passed across Central America on July 18 and emerged into the eastern Pacific Ocean shortly thereafter. Early on July 21, a broad low-pressure area formed in association with the wave, and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring the disturbance for slow development into a tropical cyclone accordingly. Shower and thunderstorm activity coalesced over the subsequent days, prompting the NHC to increase its chances for development to the high category; despite this, satellite data from early on July 24 did not reveal a well-defined circulation necessary for classification. By that evening, a combination of visible and microwave satellite imagery depicted an improvement of the vortex, and the system was upgraded to a tropical depression at 0000 UTC on July 25, while situated 980 miles (1,575 km) west-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. The depression tracked west to west-northwest upon classification, steered by a mid-level ridge centered over the southwestern United States. Deep convection increased in coverage and intensity over the following hours, leading to an increase in satellite intensity estimates; at 0600 UTC, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Flossie. Within an environment of low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures, Flossie gradually intensified over the next two days; a mid-level eye became observable in microwave imagery and intermittently on visible satellite imagery by early on July 27\\\\. At 1200 UTC, the system attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 994 mb (hPa; 29.35 inHg). Thereafter, Flossie crossed the 140th meridian west into the central Pacific Ocean, where the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) assumed responsibility of the system. Unfavorable upper-level winds in association with an upper-level trough began to impede the system's organization around this time, and it began a slow weakening trend. In conjunction with high wind shear, marginal ocean temperatures caused deep convection in association with Flossie to weaken and become ragged; as a result, the forecast called for continued weakening. Instead, a brief reprieve in upper-level winds allowed the system to intensify to a secondary peak of 65 mph (100 km/h) by 1200 UTC on July 28\\\\. An anticyclone northwest of the system increased shear atop the system once again by the following day, and dry air began to become ingested into the circulation. The low-level vortex became exposed to view and progressively ill-defined as outflow boundaries in association with a previous convective burst impeded on the low. At 0000 UTC on July 30, Flossie was downgraded to a tropical depression; after the circulation became indistinguishable on satellite imagery twelve hours later, the system was declared a remnant area of low pressure. At this time, the vortex was centered near the northern coast of Kauai. Preparations and impact Tropical Storm Flossie over Hawaii on July 29 Upon entering the central Pacific Ocean, Flossie prompted the issuance of a tropical storm watch for Hawaii and Maui counties on July 27. This was upgraded to a tropical storm warning hours later, while Oahu was placed under a tropical storm watch. Due to the threat of heavy rain, forecast to reach in localized areas, a flash flood watch was issued for all of Hawaii, valid between July 29 and 30. All Maui County parks were closed due to the storm as county authorities activated emergency operations. Along the Big Island, all courts and colleges were closed. Hawaii Governor Neil Abercrombie signed an emergency proclamation. Three ports were closed, including two on the Big Island and one on Maui. Under the anticipation that Flossie would become the first tropical storm to make landfall in the state since 1992, authorities opened 11 shelters across the state, including four on Maui and seven on Oahu. In total, 177 persons used these shelters. A scheduled water outage in Hanalei and Waipa was postponed due to the storm. While still offshore, Flossie brought high surf to much of the state. Upon passing narrowly by the island, gusty winds downed trees and power lines: Kahului reported a peak wind gust of during Flossie. More than 10,000 residences were without electricity across the state, with most outages concentrated in Maui and Big Island. Heavy rains impacted several islands; rainfall rates of an hour were recorded in Haleakalā. Along the eastern side of Maui, a total of was reported in the Kaupo Gap, while a storm- total peak of was observed on Mount Waialeale. One man was injured in Maui due to lightning. Damage from lightning across the state amounted to $24,000. Six vehicle accidents were reported and several roads required closure, but overall, damage from Flossie was relatively minor.

Asad was the editor, publisher and the sole contributor of the periodical.

Three months before the partition, he wrote an article under the title “What do we mean by Pakistan?” in which he emphasized the real purpose underlying the future establishment of Pakistan.

The oldest part of the presently visible church is the tower. The nave and choir both date from the middle of the 14th century. The church walls display fragments of medieval murals that were found during a restoration in 1958-1959. A few medieval stained glass windows are likewise preserved in the church. Of the furnishings, the baptismal font is the oldest, dating from the 12th century and richly sculpted. It was probably made for the earliest church. The high altar has a retable from the 14th century, probably made in Lübeck. Two other wooden sculptures from the same century are also preserved in the church, one of the Virgin Mary and one of St. Olaf. An unusually well- preserved medieval bench also stands in the church. In the floor of the choir is a gravestone, made for a farmer and his son who were beaten to death in 1340. The pews and the pulpit date from the Baroque era. In 2004, an extremely well-preserved mail coif was discovered in a room in the tower during cleaning of the church.

The company was also known for its high-quality lead stemware, which was hand-made for nearly a century. Customers included Eleanor Roosevelt, Lyndon Johnson, the president of Liberia, the Ritz Carlton Hotel, Tiffany's, and Neiman-Marcus. The firm's first glass plant was located in Fostoria, Ohio. The company took possession of the plant on January 1, 1892, after it was vacated by the Fostoria Glass Company. Otto Jaeger was the first president of Seneca Glass Company, and he had been part of the Fostoria Glass Company management team. Like Jaeger, many of the new company's original leaders were German craftsmen. In 1896, the firm moved to Morgantown, West Virginia, and continued to produce high-quality decorated glassware. A second plant was built in 1911 to produce tumblers and less-elaborate ware. During the 1950s, Seneca introduced its Driftwood Casual table setting pattern in an attempt to capture a less formal segment of the glassware market. This pattern was produced for nearly 30 years, and became especially important to the company as formal glassware became less popular. In 1982, the company was sold to a group of investors that renamed the firm Seneca Crystal Incorporated. The firm filed for bankruptcy in 1983. Today, the Seneca Glass Company building is listed in the National Register of Historic Places and contains small retail shops and offices. Regional history =Wheeling= German glass engraver, circa 1912 Wheeling, Virginia was an early glass producing center in what was, during the 1820s, the American \\"West\\". The city is located in Ohio County near the northernmost tip of what was the commonwealth of Virginia, which became part of West Virginia during the American Civil War. Wheeling had an advantage of the Ohio River as a transportation resource, and coal was available in the area as a fuel. Wheeling was also connected to the eastern United States by the National Road, and by the end of the 1840s major cities in Ohio were also connected. By the 1850s, railroads added to the area's transportation superiority. As the leading producers of glass in the region, Wheeling and Ohio's Belmont County (located across the river from Wheeling), eventually became sources of glassmaking talent for Ohio and Indiana. Among the talent developed in Wheeling was Otto Jaeger—future president of Seneca Glass Company. Jaeger was born in Germany in 1853, and came to America in 1866. He was taught the skill of engraving glass while still a teenager. In 1877, he began practicing his trade at the J. H. Hobbs, Brockunier and Company glass works in Wheeling. =Fostoria= In 1886, northwest Ohio began an economic boom period after a highly productive natural gas well was drilled in Hancock County. The community of Fostoria, straddles three counties: Hancock, Seneca, and Wood. Although gas was not found in the immediate Fostoria area, local government leaders constructed a pipeline from a nearby well in Wood County, and this enabled Fostoria to participate in the rush to lure manufacturers to the area. In addition to gas and cash incentives, Fostoria had five railroad lines running through the city. In response to incentives from Fostoria government leaders, a group of glass men from Wheeling organized a glassmaking company. During July 1887, Fostoria Glass Company was incorporated in West Virginia, but its factory was built in Fostoria, Ohio. Otto Jaeger was one of the directors of the new company. The Fostoria Glass Company was Fostoria's second (Mambourg Glass Company was first) of over a dozen glass factories to produce in the city. Fostoria's gas boom did not last long. By 1891, the supply of natural gas was becoming depleted. The Fostoria Glass Company decided to move to West Virginia—a homecoming for its management. =Cumberland= During the 1880s, a group of glassmakers (and neighbors) from the Black Forest region of Germany moved to Cumberland, Maryland, to work in the city's glass factories. These men were skilled in art glassmaking, and hoped to someday start their own business where they could fully utilize their talents. During 1891, it became known that the Fostoria Glass Company planned to move away from Fostoria. The Black Forest glassmakers held a meeting on August 10, and formed a company to buy the soon-to-be vacated Fostoria glass works. The German investor group selected another German, Otto Jaeger, to be their leader. Jaeger had been part of the Fostoria Glass Company management team, and was experienced in glass etching and engraving. The Fostoria plant and its permanent equipment were sold for $20,000 (over $500,000 in 2013 dollars) to the German investors during the Fall of 1891. Although the company's plant was in Fostoria, Ohio, it was granted its charter in West Virginia on December 4, 1891. One commonly made mistake is the assumption that Seneca Glass Company was located in Ohio's Seneca County. While most of Fostoria is in Seneca County, the Seneca Glass South Vine Street plant was located in Hancock County, a few blocks west of the Seneca County border. The shareholders of the new glass company named their firm after the Seneca Indians. Startup 1882 Ohio Railroad Map for area around Fostoria, Tiffin, and Findlay Otto Jaeger assembled an experienced and highly skilled workforce for the Seneca Glass Company. Fostoria Glass Company took only 60 employees to West Virginia, leaving over half of its workforce in Fostoria. Many of these workers sought employment with the Seneca Glass Company—where they could continue to work in the same (South Vine Street) factory. Jaeger also had the highly skilled investor/glassmen from Cumberland, Maryland. Among these men were George Trough, August Boehler, Leopold Sigwart, and Edward and Joseph Kammerer. Otto Jaeger became president, while Edward Kammerer was vice president and general manager. Trough was secretary. Thus, the company's leaders and shareholders consisted of glassworkers instead of bankers or wealthy businessmen. Jaeger, Kammerer, and Trough were also elected to the board of directors, as were Boehler and Sigwart. The new company began blowing lead glassware on December 29, 1891—before Fostoria Glass had officially moved out of the factory. Fostoria Glass \\"vacated this building officially December 31, 1891, with Seneca following on the premises January 1, 1892\\". =Fostoria operations= With its experienced workforce, production proceeded at the Seneca Glass works with no problems. The company advertised itself as a \\"manufacturer of fine lead blown table and bar goods\\", and promised \\"fine etching for advertising purposes\\". The original plant was considered large for the time, with three buildings and a furnace with a capacity of 12 pots. Despite occasional shutdowns caused by low gas pressure (gas was the fuel used in the production process), production and sales were successful enough that capacity was increased to 38 pots in 1892. The plant occupied , and was adjacent to three railroads. About 200 people were employed by the company. Because the production method used by the company emphasized handmade products, the workforce was highly skilled and well paid. Production of the glassware began around ceramic pots. Each pot contained molten glass created by melting a batch of ingredients inside the furnace. A workstation was adjacent to the pot, and manned by a glass–blower and his small production crew. The company gained a reputation for high-quality glassware, and its glass works ranked first in the country in the production of blown tumblers. =Management change= By 1895, the glass works employed over 230 people. Late in the year, production stopped as the workforce (which was non-union) went on strike because of unsatisfactory working conditions. The strike lasted from December 13 until January 17, 1896. During the work stoppage, a group of investors led by Leopold Sigwart removed Otto Jaeger as president. Jaeger resisted the change, causing the Sigwart group to install a new lock on the president's office. In protest, Edward Kamerer resigned as plant manager. Sigwart was elected president, and Kamerer was replaced as plant manager by his brother, Joseph. The new management team successfully restarted the business. Sales were excellent during 1896, as employees worked overtime to keep up with demand. Production of tumblers amounted to \\"3,000 dozen daily\\". Tumblers with an etching of presidential candidate William McKinley were especially popular. Morgantown 1896 advertisement for Seneca Glass Company In the Fall of 1896, it was announced that the company would move to Morgantown, West Virginia. Morgantown was a desirable location because of transportation, fuel, and raw materials—and a cash subsidy. River transportation between Pittsburgh and Morgantown improved during the 1890s because of a new river lock on the Monongahela River. Railroad transportation became available after the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad connected Morgantown to the nation's railroad network. Oil and gas had recently been discovered in the area, providing more options for fuel in addition to the coal that was abundant in the area. Good quality sand, used as a raw material for glassmaking, was available nearby in both the river and mountains. The Seneca Glass Company had additional reasons to move to Morgantown. It received free land, low-priced gas, and $20,000 (over $500,000 in 2013 dollars) as enticement to move. The move was temporarily delayed after a legal complaint by Otto Jaeger filed in Hancock County Court. However, a November settlement allowed the company to move. The building remained vacant until 1905, when it became the site for the Seneca Wire and Manufacturing Company. =Glass works= The company's Morgantown glass works was constructed in 1896 and 1897. Production began in January 1897. The plant, which is still standing, is located on Beechhurst Avenue, with access to the Monongahela River and Baltimore & Ohio Railroad. The furnace had 14 pots. An advertisement in the December 1896 edition of a glass trade magazine announced the move. The original facility included a furnace/blowing room, a lehr room, packing area, and warehouse. It also had smaller rooms where the glass was decorated. The furnace/blowing room is mostly brick, and contains a huge smokestack. The room measures long by wide, and is one story plus a basement. The furnace is about in diameter and high. The lehr room is one-story, and measures about long by wide. This room is where the glass was gradually cooled in ovens–a process called annealing. In 1902, the a fire damaged portions of the interior of the facility. Losses from the fire were estimated to be $50,000 ($1.3 million in 2013 dollars), and 350 people temporarily had no place to work. After the fire, the plant was repaired and additions were made to the original structure. The company also constructed a new two-story building, which was designed by prominent local architect Elmer F. Jacobs. More expansions were made during the 1920s and in 1947. =New charter= The company was granted a new West Virginia charter in 1905. Major shareholders were Leopold Sigwart, Otto Sigwart, August Boehler, and J. A. Kammerer. Each held 120 shares of stock—totaling to 480 of the 873 total shares outstanding. Among the 16 remaining shareholders were Joseph Stenger (75 shares), George Truog (30 shares), and Frances Bannister (8 shares). The company was always owned by a small group of stockholders, and the founders and their families managed the company throughout its existence. Otto Sigwart, who became president of the company in 1895, was eventually succeeded by another founder of the company, August Boehler. After Boehler became president, Sigwart worked as Vice President of the company for many years. He also managed the company's Factory B for the first few years of its existence, and was succeeded as manager of that plant by his son Charles. A third founder, Joseph A. Kammerer, became president in 1917. Kammerer served as president until his death in 1941. At that time, Charles F. Boehler (brother of August Boehler) became president. In 1959, a newspaper noted that the Seneca Glass Company \\"president, vice president, and secretary–treasurer are descendants of the men who organized the company...a Kammerer is president, a Sigwart vice president, and a Stenger secretary–treasurer\\". Among other family members in the business were Harry G. Kammerer, who was company president in 1959, and Harry's stepson John W. Weimer, who also became president. Other family members served as officers of the company. Among those family members was Louis W. Stenger, who served as \\"an official with the Seneca Glass Co. for more than 40 years\\". Another example is James Sigwart, who was Vice President of Seneca Glass Company when he died in 1950. =Star City= Seneca Glass Company opened a second plant, known as \\"Plant B\\" in 1911. This plant was located in Star City, West Virginia, about two miles from the Morgantown works. Plant B employed about 80 people. Products were mostly undecorated tumblers. Lime, instead of lead, was used to make the glass in two small tanks. The glassware was hand blown. The plant was originally managed by Otto Sigwart, who had been president of the company earlier in his career. Sigwart was well-liked by the local members of the American Flint Glass Workers union. In 1914, Otto's son Charles became manager. The plant operated until the 1930s. =Production= The Seneca Glass Company used European glass production methods learned by their founders in Germany. The glass was lead flint glass, which is made mostly from silica, potash, and oxide of lead. This type of glass has more sparkle and shine than flint glass made from lime. Using technology from the 1890s and earlier, the glassblower's assistant (the gatherer) used a hollow pipe to extract molten glass from a pot. A pot was about 40 inches in diameter, and Seneca's pots held of batch. The glass blower and his crew used air, hand tools, and molds to shape the glass into the desired form. The glass appears orange, and then yellow, while it is still being shaped. In some cases, a glazer was used to smooth edges of the glass with small jets of flame. Once the glass had the correct shape, it was then placed in a lehr, which is a long oven used for annealing, a process where the glass is gradually cooled. Without annealing, the glass would easily shatter. In the case of the glassware made at Seneca's Morgantown plant, it took almost 2 hours for the glass to move through the lehr. Some of the finished glass would be cut, engraved, and/or polished. Glass with gold or silver trim added would be reheated to fuse the trim to the glass. Although old European glass production methods were used throughout the company's existence. technology was not entirely shunned by the founders. Otto Sigwart, with Peter Momper, received a patent for a mold in 1894.US patent 527,801, \\"Glass Mold\\", issued 1894–10–23 August Stenger received a patent in 1898 for a machine that cut and smoothed tumblers.US patent 601,685, \\"Machine for Cutting and Smoothing Tumblers\\", issued 1898–4–5 Otto Sigwart received another patent in 1899. This patent was for a way to put stems on goblets.US patent 624,389, \\"Machine for Putting Stems and Feet on Goblets\\", issued 1899–5–2 Employee Anton Roemisch received a patent in 1900 for an apparatus for glazing and finishing glassware.US patent 664,058, \\"Apparatus for Glazing and Finishing Articles of Glassware\\", issued 1900–12–18 Products Glassware made by the Seneca Glass Company During its early years, Seneca Glass Company was the largest producer of Tumblers in the United States. It specialized in etched designs on its glassware, such as an advertisement for a hotel or bar. The company gradually became known for its high quality table ware. Seneca products were sold through premium outlets such as Wanamaker's, Marshall Field's, Tiffany's, and Neiman Marcus. Its dinnerware was found in the Ritz Carlton hotel, and on international steam ship lines. It was also used in American embassies throughout the world. Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, and his wife, chose Seneca's Epicure pattern for their personal table ware. Eleanor Roosevelt and one of Liberia's presidents were also purchasers of glassware made by Seneca Glass Company. A few of Seneca's stemware designs were patented. Inventors were company founders or their relatives: Truog, Stenger, Kammerer, and Weimer. The glass used for the glassware was made in a variety of colors, including a yellow and various shades of red, green, and blue. Different colors of glass were created by adding to the batch of ingredients used to make the glass. For example, adding iron to the batch causes the glass to take a shade of green. The recipes for different colors of glass were often kept secret, and sometimes only passed down from father to son. During the 1940s, colorless glass was popular. In 1953, the company started producing its Driftwood Casual dinnerware pattern, which was intended for informal dining. The decision to produce a less-formal product proved wise, as formal dinnerware became less popular during the next decade. The Driftwood pattern was popular, and produced for 30 years. The company introduced other informal dining patterns during the 1970s, although these were not as successful as Driftwood Legacy The quality of Seneca Glass Company's glassware is indisputable. Its products were sold abroad and in American's finest outlets. From a business point-of-view, the remarkable aspect of Seneca Glass Company is its longevity—especially since it continued to use 1890s technology for nearly 100 years. Similar Fostoria glass companies, such as Butler Art Glass Company and Novelty Glass Company, did not last 5 years. The Butler Art Glass Company made various types of colored glass, and described itself as \\"a manufacturer of cathedral glass and glass color tiles.\\" The company incorporated in 1887, and made glass for only 15 months. Fostoria's Novelty Glass Company produced \\"fine lead blown tumblers\\" and stemware. Incorporators included some supervisory personnel from the Fostoria Glass Company, yet it operated only during 1891 and 1892. Otto Jaeger, the ousted first president of Seneca Glass Company, eventually returned to Wheeling, West Virginia. In 1901, he founded the Bonita Art Glass Company. The Wheeling company employed 100 people, and specialized in decorating china and glass. Bonita Art Glass products were exported, and the company also imported products manufactured overseas. George Truog (1861-1932) left the Seneca Glass Company and returned to Cumberland, Maryland. He founded the Maryland Glass Etching Works in 1893. Truog, who was born in Italy, was an expert at etching glass using acid. His business decorated glassware, and it was one of the best. Not only was Truog very artistic, but his etching was permanent—unlike some other decorating methods of the time, such as painting. Truog's Cumberland home (George Truog House) was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Today, the former Seneca Glass Company plant in Morgantown still stands. It is known as Seneca Center, and is the home of over 20 businesses. The structure was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.

To the north it borders Yellabinna Regional Reserve; to the east, Pureba Conservation Park. The conservation park is outside the dog fence, which borders it in the south. Thus, it is situated in the area where dingoes are tolerated. Other animals in the conservation park include southern hairy-nosed wombats, malleefowls, sandhill dunnarts and kangaroos. The name 'Yumbarra' comes from a protruding rock hole in the area. When it rains, the rock fills with water, turning into a temporary water hole for the conservation park's wildlife. This particular feature of the rock makes it an important site for birds, and thus bird watching. The arid landscape is characterized by rolling sand dunes. The Googs Track, a long four-wheel drive road, goes through the conservation park heading to the Yellabinna Regional Reserve in the north towards Googs Lake. A few walking trails follow the Googs Track. The conservation park is an important habitat for some of Australia's most endangered wildlife species, such as the malleefowl and sandhill dunnart. The conservation park is also home to kangaroos, wombats and dingoes. A co-management agreement signed by the Far West Coast Aboriginal Corporation and the Government of South Australia in 2013 in respect to the Yumbarra Conservation Park provides for the corporation to give advice on the management of the conservation park and other reserves in the west of the state.

A member of the Zand Dynasty of Iran, Zaki Khan, though he never became the ruler of Iran, managed to exert power over the country during the three months between the death of his half-brother Karim Khan, on March 2, 1779, and his own brutal death. Origins and early years Zaki Khan was born into the Zand tribe, who had been uprooted by Nader Shah from their ancestral lands near Hamadan, in the central Iranian region of Lorestan, and settled in Northern Khorasan. At Nader's death in 1747, the Zand returned to Lorestan, and their leader Karim Khan managed to gain vast political power, taking control of Isfahan in 1750, where they installed a puppet underage shah, Ismail III. Karim Khan never took the title of shah but had himself addressed as \\"wakil\\" (deputy) even as he was the ruler over most of Central and Western Iran. Zaki Khan was doubly related to Karim Khan: he was his first cousin through their fathers, and his half-brother on the mother's side. The fortunes of Zaki Khan followed those of his half-brother and protector, and he was considered of his main generals. First rebellion and years as a general (1763-1779) However, Iranian sources note that Zaki Khan was by then already infamous for his cruelty and opportunism. In 1763, returning from the last campaign against Azad Khan Afghan in Azerbaijan, seemingly disappointed by a lack of recognition from the ruler, Zaki Khan seized the former Safavid capital of Isfahan for himself, and exploited mercilessly its population. When Karim Khan learned of these exactions, he personally marched on Isfahan. Zaki Khan fled from him to Dezful, in Khuzestan, recruiting Bakhtiari warriors on the way, and then allying himself with the rebellious governor of Dezful. After a year of unsuccessful fighting and negotiations, Zaki Khan eventually begged for the mercy of his brother, and received it. During the next fifteen years, Zaki Khan remained one of the main generals of Karim Khan. He led forces to submit principalities on the Persian Gulf coast, the main one a naval expedition against Oman in 1773, that ended in total failure and Zaki's disgrace. Two years later however, he was assigned a punitive expedition against the Qajar stronghold of Mazandaran, by the Caspian Sea. There, he succeeded, and left a reputation of brutal terror. Three months of power Zaki Khan was a major participant in the struggles for political power that followed the death of Karim Khan on March 2, 1779. Karim Khan died naturally after a long illness, so Zaki Khan, as well as many others, was not caught off guard. He had managed in the previous years to marry his daughter to Muhammad Ali Khan, Karim Khan's second son, who was still a child. By the time of Karim Khan's death, he was logically at the head of the faction pushing for Muhammad Ali to be proclaimed nominal ruler. The elder son, Abol Fath Khan, only 13 years old, also had supporters among the main members of the royal family. However, as soon as Karim Khan was dead, Zaki Khan had most of them killed, and Abol Fath imprisoned. Among Abol Fath's supporters, only Sadiq Khan Zand managed to escape the capital, Shiraz. Muhammad Ali was proclaimed nominal ruler,The young children of Karim Khan Zand were neither designated Shah nor Wakil, but called in Persian sources \\"Khan\\", in European sources \\"King\\"; cf Perry, Zand Dynasty and Zaki Khan regent with full power over the Empire. But the children's mother intervened in favor of Abol Fath, and Zaki Khan, to win her support, had to accept that both sons of Karim Khan would be invested with the supreme honor. The rule of Zadik Khan was contested from the start. First, the Qajar prince Agha Muhammad Khan, whom Karim Khan had retained as a hostage in Shiraz to prevent further rebellions from his powerful Northern clan, escaped and headed for his stronghold. To catch him, Zaki Khan sent his nephew, Ali Murad Khan. However, as soon as he reached Isfahan, Ali Murad Khan mutinied against his uncle and gave his allegiance to Abol Fath. Sadiq Khan was gathering an army in the South-East with a similar purpose. Zaki Khan decided to deal with Ali Murad Khan first, and led an army towards Isfahan. Death and legacy On his way to Isfahan, Zaki Khan committed the atrocities at the settlement of Izadkhvast. But this time, he went so far that even his own men were shocked. A group of tribal leaders among them eventually murdered him as he was resting in his tent still in the village of Izadkhwast. After his elimination, the war would carry on between Sadiq Khan and Ali Murad Khan, who would both claim the throne in the following years. His youngest son Akbar Khan Zand, that he had left in charge of Shiraz, tried to pursue his father's career and ambition after Zaki Khan's death, but was blinded and killed in 1782 by his cousin, the future shah Jafar Khan.

Career Denys was a Member of Parliament in 1555 and was knighted at some time before 16 November 1557. He was Feodary for the Devonshire estates of the Duchy of Lancaster (a crown possession) in 1556 and to 10 December 1566 and then between 7 December 1568 and 27 July 1590. He was appointed Sheriff of Devon for 1557/8 and again for 1567/8. In 1558 or 1559 he was appointed a Justice of the Peace for Devon, and was appointed to the honourable position of Recorder of Exeter from 1572; He held both positions until he died. Denys acquired the manor of Bicton, on the other side of Exeter (i.e. the eastern side) to Holcombe Burnell. Livery Dole Almshouses Stone tablet above entrance gate to Livery Dole, dedicated to Sir Robert Dennis, with Denys arms and quarterings above, inscribed: \\"These alms-houses were founded by Sir Robert Dennis, knight, in March 1591 and finished by Sir Thomas Dennis his brother (sic) in 1594\\" In March 1591 he founded the Livery Dole Almshouses in Heavitree Road, to the east of Exeter, near which site in 1531/2 his father, as Sheriff of Devon, had supervised the burning at the stake of the Protestant martyr Thomas Benet. In his will he requested that the building should be completed by his son Sir Thomas Denys (1559–1613) (erroneously stated on a stone tablet above the entrance gate to have been his brother).Harding The buildings were completed in 1594. In 1849 the almshouses were rebuilt as twin blocks on a larger scale by Lady Rolle of Bicton House, widow of John Rolle, 1st Baron Rolle (died 1842), eventual heir of the Dennis family. At that time new sculpted stone escutcheons showing the Dennis arms were affixed to the new buildings. The almshouses today occupy the central part of Livery Dole to the west of the chapel. Sir Robert Dennis stated in his will dated 25 July 1592 and proved 22 September 1592, that he had \\"designed to set aside a plot of ground and to erect an alms-house and chapel for a certain number of poor people with weekly stipends and certain yearly commodities, as would appear in a devise signed and sealed by him\\".Quoted from Harding He appointed his son Sir Thomas Dennis as sole executor, with the testator's brothers Edward Dennis and Walter Dennis as overseers together with George Cary of Cockington and four others. He requested in his will that if he should die before its completion then his son Sir Thomas Dennis should complete the building work \\"in consideration of the love he bore him and that he had not disinherited him\\". He also directed his overseers to complete the work if his son should refuse to do so. Sir Robert did indeed die before the work was finished, and his son Sir Thomas Dennis completed the work in 1594. A \\"peppercorn\\" chief rent of one penny per annum was payable by the Livery Dole Hospital to the lord of the manor of Heavitree.Harding, p.276, note 7 \\"There is not the slightest doubt of this Sir Thomas Dennis having been the testator's son\\",Harding, p.278 yet on a seemingly contemporary stone tablet erected over the entrance to the formerly existing quadrangle he was erroneously described as Sir Robert's \\"brother\\": \\"These alms-houses were founded by Sir Robert Dennis, knight, in March 1591 and finished by Sir Thomas Dennis his brother (sic) in 1594\\".

Clayoquot was of the latter design and was larger than her diesel-engined cousins. Clayoquot was long overall, had a beam of and a draught of . The minesweeper had a displacement of . She had a complement of 6 officers and 77 enlisted. Clayoquot had two vertical triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, using steam provided by two Admiralty three-drum boilers. The engines produced a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The minesweeper could carry a maximum of of fuel oil. Clayoquot was armed with a single quick-firing (QF) /40 caliber Mk IV gun mounted forward. For anti-aircraft purposes, the minesweeper was equipped with one QF 2-pounder Mark VIII and two single-mounted QF 20 mm Oerlikon guns. As a convoy escort, Clayoquot was deployed with 40 depth charges launched from two depth charge throwers and four chutes.Macpherson, p. 19 Construction and career Ordered on 23 February 1940 as Esperanza, the ship was renamed Clayoquot in 1940.Colledge, p. 81 Clayoquot was laid down on 20 June 1940 by Prince Rupert Dry Dock and Shipyards Co. at Prince Rupert, British Columbia. The minesweeper was launched on 3 October 1940 and commissioned on 22 August 1941 at Prince Rupert. She left Esquimalt, British Columbia after working up and made her way to Halifax, Nova Scotia where she arrived on 14 November 1941. Clayoquot was made part of Halifax Local Defence Force initially, though she was transferred to the Western Local Escort Force (WLEF) in March 1942. In May 1942 Clayoquot was assigned to the Gulf Escort Force. On 7 July, while responding to a U-boat attack on a convoy in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Clayoquot came upon the abandoned hulk of the merchant vessel Dinaric, which had been torpedoed during the attack. Clayoquot sank the ship with gunfire and depth charges.Sarty, p. 106 On 10 September she was returning to Gaspé, Quebec after escorting a convoy to Rimouski with the corvette nearby when Charlottetown was hit by two torpedoes. Clayoquot searched for, but was unable to find the submarine. During depth charge attacks on possible targets, Clayoquots radio was knocked out and prevented the ship from informing command of the corvette's loss.Schull, p. 119Sarty, pp. 166–170 She returned to the site of the sinking and was able to rescue 55 survivors, taking at least three and a half hours to complete.Darlington and McKee, p. 69 In October 1942 she joined Sydney Force.

The scouring or degreasing of the natural lanolin from wool requires the application of soft soap produced using fat and an alkaline potash solutionthat contains water- soluble potassium salts such as potassium carbonate and potassium hydroxide.Potash, USGS 2008 Minerals Yearbook Purpose Potash The potash pit was a basic stone lined ashery in which hardwoods such as birch wood or bracken were burned to produce ashes which were then placed in a copper cauldron manufactured from strips of copper and boiled together with water and quicklime. The alkaline solution produced by the ashes and added quicklime could be filtered to remove particles and once the required alkalinity was reached fats were added to produce a soft soap for the scouring or degreasing of the wool as a vital step in the production of wool for spinning into yarn. Location Many potash pits were built in or near areas of suitable deciduous woodlands and as such they are an important landscape features indicating both the processing of wool and the presence of a suitable hardwood woodland present at the site or nearby at the time that potash pits were in use.Muir, Pages 91 - 92. Construction A view in the Lickle Valley The often circular pits were built often into earthen banks and were lined with drystone walling. A tunnel fireplace was required to draw in the air for the burning conversion of the birch, bracken, etc. into ashes, used for heating the cauldron as well as the source of the potash.Hawksley, Page 46 Geographical location The pits are a feature found in sheep farming districts with extensive woodlands such as the Lake District in England.

'Pradines, Auguste Linstant de (“Kandjo” or “Candio”)' in ; This biographical article states that Emerante's father Candio was born in Paris, France, on 10 September 1879. Early life Emerante's mother, Amarante Jean Pierre, implored Our Lady of Mount Carmel, patroness of the Carmelite order, to give her a child, a baby girl, \\"promising that in return she would devote this child to the virgin saint.\\" Emerante was born when her mother was \\"on vacation at Rivière Froid\\". Musical and dance career De Pradines went to Washington, D.C. in 1941 as a featured singer and dancer in a troupe led by Lina Mathon-Blanchet. After her return to Haiti, de Pradines performed in a regular concert series at the Rex Theater in Port-au-Prince. She often sang renditions of traditional vodou songs, \\"then a novelty in Haitian social life\\". De Pradines sang Vodou songs in Creole on the radio when it was dangerous to do so, and was the first Haitian singer to sign a recording contract with a record company. She married Richard M. Morse, a Latin-American scholar and writer from the United States who she met while studying in New York with Martha Graham. Her albums were released internationally, including by Smithsonian Folkways in the United States. At a young age, de Pradines was a student of Martha Graham. Between 1978 and 1981 Emerante de Pradines Morse taught dance classes in the Athletic Department of Stanford University. There, her students learned modern Graham technique as well as Haitian dance. Affectionately known by her Stanford students as Emy Morse, she choreographed several dance productions such as “Carnival!” for which she designed the costumes. Emerante De Pradines Morse made the costumes herself with the assistance of one of her students, Harvetta Silvarya Strozier, whom she taught how to make her designs out of fabric, raffia, ribbon, and other materials - without using purchased patterns. At Stanford University, Emy Morse was the epitome of beauty and physical fitness. In her late fifties and early sixties, she showed her students how to do all of her warm-up dance steps and stretches as well as every choreographed step and routine whether simple or complex. She stressed the importance of elegant movement and demonstrated in minute detail how such was to be done. Whether conducting a dance class, choreographing an extracurricular dance production, or observed elsewhere around the campus of Stanford University, Emerante De Pradines Morse always carried and expressed herself with the utmost grace and elegance. Reception and later life She and her husband had one daughter, Marise, and one son, Richard Auguste. Her son, also known as Richard A. Morse, also became a musician and prominent public figure in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. De Pradines Morse was one of six women profiled in a documentary film by director Arnold Antonin entitled Six Exceptional Haitian Women (Six femmes d’exception). She was also the focus of a 2017 article in the Journal of Haitian Studies. One commentator wrote that \\"Given the time in Haitian social history when [Emerante de Pradines] chose to sang vodou songs, popular songs, she stands almost by herself in Haitian history.\\" Death She died on 4 January 2018 at Saint-Esprit Hospital (Hôpital Saint-Esprit), rue Capois, Port-au-Prince, aged 99. Her remains were cremated on 6 January after a private ceremony attended by relatives. On February 3, 2018, a thanksgiving mass was held in her honor at Holy Trinity Cathedral. At the mass, Emerante Morse's daughter in law Lunise Morse sang the traditional song \\"Carolina Caro\\", a favorite of the deceased. Emerante Morse was also remembered and celebrated for numerous philanthropic activities, including education of young people, founding the school La Ruche in Pelerin (Pétion-Ville), and supporting other institutions such as Octane Deslouches Martissant and other schools and cultural centers outside the capital.

The Aarhus River passes through Brabrand Lake and it is possible to canoe all the way to the inner city from here. The lake is oblong- shaped. Since 2003, Brabrand Lake has been steadily extended 3–4 km further west, with the new lake of Årslev Engsø (lit.: Årslev meadow-lake). In 2001–2, it was politically decided to abandon the artificial draining of the meadows and as of 2013, Årslev meadow lake has a surface area of around .

In everyday parlance, \\"Brabrand Lake\\" is a general term including the surroundings as well, indicating a total area of around with for the lake alone. A special Natura2000 protected area under the European Union, Brabrand Lake is home to a large variety of birds and an important resting place for migrating birds, with several towers built to facilitate bird-watching. A public hiking trail surrounds the lake, whose landscape varies from wide meadows and reed beds to dense woods. Privately owned pastures almost completely surround the lake and are not publicly accessible, but public paths leading to the lake are scattered in between. There are several garden allotments (\\"kolonihaver\\" in Danish) near Brabrand Lake and it is a popular recreational spot. It is a statutory goal of the Aarhus municipality to make the area publicly accessible and attractive to the public.Accessibility to urban-close nature Aarhus municipality Activities and sports Brabrandstien (1956) is a pathway running from the inner city of Aarhus and encircling both Brabrand Sø and Årslev Engsø. It is c. 26 km long. Brabrandstien (lit.: the Brabrand pathway), which runs along the Aarhus river from the inner city and around both Brabrand Sø and Årslev Engsø, was established by the City Council in 1956 as a labor project for the unemployed, to give the public better access to green space. The pathway is c. 26 km long, with 9.5 km for Brabrand Lake alone. With the addition of Årslev Engsø, the pathway grew another 8 km. A large part of Brabrandstien is asphalted and is popular for cycling, rollerskating and jogging. Some of the graveled western parts are used for horseback riding. Cars are not allowed and motor vehicles are restricted. Brabrandstien is part of the Aarhus-Silkeborg hiking trail. On the northern bank of Brabrand Lake lies the facilities of Brabrand Rostadion (Brabrand Rowing Stadium). The stadium was established in 1952 and was heavily renovated and rebuilt in the year 2010. C. F. Møller Architects was the architectural firm behind the new buildings.Brabrand Rostadion C. F.

The excessive nutrients originate from waste water and agricultural activities and pose a constant environmental threat to the surrounding ecology and the Bay of Aarhus. Eutrophication is a common problem all over the developed world. Starting in 1959 with 158 hectares, several environmental projects have aimed to alleviate the environmental burdens and at the same time maintain the aesthetic value of the lake and surrounding areas. These projects includes mud pumping of the lakebed and willow afforestations. Also, the local water company Aarhus Vand A/S began extracting phosphor from wastewater in 2013 at a water treatment plant in Åby close to the lake. Phosphor is a key element in the eutrophication process but a valuable resource on its own and the water treatment plant is among only a few in the world to engage with this. It is hoped that the rich fen ecology which formerly characterized the lake, and is a threatened nature-type in general, can be restored in the future. The groundwater beneath and adjoining Brabrand Lake is very important, as it provides drinking water to more than 100,000 people in the greater Aarhus area. Acting partly on this fact, the lake water was also included in a large water treatment project led by Aarhus Vand A/S from 2006 to 2013. The project involved the Brabrand Lake, the Aarhus River and the Aarhus harbour, budgeted at € 45 million. As a result, the waters in Brabrand Lake and the Aarhus River attained bathing quality in September 2012.Safeguarding the Bathing Water Quality of the Stream Aarhus Å State of Green  Special flora and fauna  Ospreys, and other birds of prey, are occasionally foraging, wintering or breeding around Brabrand Lake. The lake area attracts, and is home to, many species of birds that are rare or endangered in Denmark. Many species of flora and fauna at Brabrand Lake are either rare or relatively rare in Denmark and on the Danish Red List (under IUCN Red List). Some also are protected under different habitat directives of the EU. Here are a few examples: * Several Lathyrus species grow here, such as the tuberous pea, which is rare in Denmark, and the relatively rare marsh pea. * Several relatively rare rush species grow here, such as European hard rush, heath rush and slender rush. * Several orchids of the Dactylorhiza species are found growing here. Worthy of special mention is the common western marsh orchid and the relatively rare early marsh orchid, both of which are protected and mentioned in the Danish Nature Protection Law ( §3) and the Washington Convention (list II.B). Although the w.m. orchid is one of the most common orchids in Denmark, it is also included due to alarming population decline. * The white storks occasionally resting here are critically endangered (CR) and relatively rare in Denmark. * The common nightingale living here is rare in Denmark. The thrush nightingale, common in Denmark, is also found at the lake. * Årslev Engsø regularly attracts rare birds such as osprey (CR), white-tailed eagle (vulnerable VU), peregrine falcon (extinct as breeders RE), little gull (RE), mediterranean gull, black tern (endangered EN), caspian tern, spotted crake (near threatened NT), broad-billed sandpiper, red-necked phalarope and water pipit. * The green hawker dragonflies are near threatened (NT) and rare in Denmark. They have been protected here under the EU habitat directive (IV) since 1992. * The population of pond bats living at Brabrand Lake is protected under the Natura 2000 Plan 233. Pond bats are endangered (EN) in western Europe, but maybe only near threatened on a global scale. Apart from these rarer species, the Brabrand Lake area is characterized by many common species living here, mostly birds, insects and aquatic plants.  Archaeological finds  The area around Brabrand Lake has been populated for at least 6,000 years. In prehistoric times, Brabrand Lake was part of a deep brackish water fjord, offering natural protection and food in abundance. There were archaeological excavations here as early as 1903, revealing early Stone Age settlements and activities from the Ertebølle Culture. The Brabrand Lake area is still an active archaeological site today and has revealed Bronze Age settlements and Viking activities such as a large shipbuilding yard. Haugsted, E. et al.

Cryptic rabies refers to infection from unrecognized exposure to rabies virus. It is often phylogenetically traced to bats. It is most often seen in the southern United States. Silver- haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans) and tricolored bats (Perimyotis subflavus) are the two most common bat species associated with this form of infection, though both species are known to have less contact with humans than other bat species such as the big brown bat. That species is common throughout the United States and often roosts in buildings and homes where human contact is more likely.  Transmission  Cryptic rabies refers to instances where rabies occurs in an individual with no clear history of exposure to a rabies vector. Determining history of contact, usually via the bite of an infected animal, can be difficult if the patient is unconscious or incoherent by the time an attempt is made to collect patient history. Thus, friends and family are needed to fill in patient history of possible bite exposure. Additionally, bites from a vector can be overlooked, particularly for some small bat species. Bites from a bat can be so small that they are not visible without magnification equipment, for example. Outside of bites, rabies virus exposure can also occur if infected fluids come in contact with a mucous membrane or a break in the skin. Rabies virus has also been transmitted when an infected human unknowingly dies of rabies, and their organs are transplanted to others. While it has been speculated that rabies virus could be transmitted through aerosols, studies of the rabies virus have concluded that this is only feasible in limited conditions. These conditions include a very large colony of bats in a hot and humid cave with poor ventilation. While two human deaths in 1956 and 1959 had been tentatively attributed to aerosolization of the rabies virus after entering a cave with bats, \\"investigations of the 2 reported human cases revealed that both infections could be explained by means other than aerosol transmission\\".  Species specific reservoir  It is not well understood why most, but not all, cases of cryptic bat rabies can be traced to silver-haired bats and tricolored bats, but it is believed that the strain of rabies virus in these species is particularly virulent.

The rural community is situated at the intersection of State Highway 60 (SH 60) and County Road 102 a short distance north of the Matagorda County line. Founded in the first decade of the 20th Century by a land developer, the town prospered for a time but eventually lost its school, post office, railroad and businesses. Magnet is identified by road signs on SH 60 and by a tall broadcasting tower. A nearby oil field takes its name from the community. Geography Magnet is located at . The community is on the east side of SH 60 a distance of north of Bay City and southeast of Wharton. The Old Lane City Magnet Road runs parallel and east of SH 60; it goes northwest to Lane City. There are about two dozen homes clustered at Magnet and along Mauldin Road which goes to the northeast. The Magnet Baptist Church is located on County Road 102 in the community.

File:Magnet TX Baptist Church.JPGMagnet Baptist Church is on County Road 102. File:Magnet TX Broadcast Tower.JPGThe broadcasting tower is a prominent landmark. History About 1907, the Taylor-Fowler Land Company of Oklahoma and laid out a town on the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway about south of Wharton. In 1911, Frank D. and Fred Fowler began selling 12,000 acres, promoting the area's rich soil. The same year a post office was opened. According to one story, the town was named Magnet because the good soil would draw potential farmers. Another account claimed it was because saloons there would attract drinkers from Bay City, which was dry. In 1912 the new town boasted a few grocery stores plus a drugstore, gristmill, hotel, lumberyard and school. Within two years, there were forty persons living in Magnet alongside a blacksmith shop, canning factory, cotton gin, garage, two general stores, rice grower, and the Truck Growers Association. In 1925, the first producing oil well in Wharton County was drilled in the Boling Field near Iago. This started a 1920s oil drilling boom during which the Magnet Withers Field was first exploited. By the 1930s there were 50 residents of Magnet. The discovery of additional nearby oil in 1937 did not increase the population. By 1943 the post office operated out of the sole remaining commercial establishment in the community. By 1949 there were only 20 persons in Magnet and the post office closed in 1954. Between 1968 and 2000 the population was 42. In the latter year no businesses were reported in Magnet. In 2004, the BNSF Railway applied to discontinue of the line from Bay City north to Cane Junction and then northeast to Newgulf on the grounds that there had been no rail traffic for two years. This stretch of track included Magnet. In 2012 Milagro Oil and Gas, Inc. drilled three successful wells in the Magnet Withers field. Education By 1912 there was a school in Magnet. In 1926, the Magnet school employed three teachers to instruct 130 white and five black students. A 1936 map depicted two schools. The schools became part of the Wharton Independent School District in 1947.

The book won first prize in Windju Simonsen's contest for \\"Best book for boys\\", and was a bestseller. Plot The book is a story about two boys fleeing from a school institution for \\"bad children\\". The model was quite obviously the institution Toftes Gave, located at the island Helgøya in the lake Mjøsa, where Stokke had served as a teacher for several years. Everyday life at the institution is described, a strict discipline among 200 boys. They are dressed in uniforms, and march in step to and from work, mostly farm work or in workshops. The two protagonists are the good friends \\"Harald\\" and \\"Willy\\", both sixteen years old. Harald has grown up at a farm, while Willy grew up in Oslo. Both face troubles at the institution, and they decide to try to escape from the island. One night they climb out through the window, find a rowing boat and successfully reach the landside. While they flee, much happens. Eventually the two boys are caught, and brought back to the institution. Sequels  I natt rømmer vi was followed by three other books about the same characters.

Six Precovery images from April 2003 have been located. It was removed from the Sentry Risk Table on 3 January 2014. It has an observation arc of 10 years with an uncertainty parameter of 2. Perturbations by Earth, Venus, and Mercury will increase the orbital uncertainty over time. When the asteroid only had an observation arc of 52 days, virtual clones of the asteroid that fit the uncertainty region in the known trajectory showed a 1 in 588,000 chance that the asteroid could impact Earth on 11 December 2096. With a 2096 Palermo Technical Scale of −3.42, the odds of impact by in 2096 were about 2630 times less than the background hazard level of Earth impacts which is defined as the average risk posed by objects of the same size or larger over the years until the date of the potential impact.

The sanjak is attested by Leunclavius in 1588, and again in the seventh volume of Evliya Çelebi's travel books as a province of the Eyalet of the Archipelago, but in the fifth volume of the same work simply as a captaincy of the Sanjak of Gallipoli.Birken (1976), pp. 56, 106 At the time of Evliya Çelebi's visit, it comprised 12 ziamets and 235 timars and was subdivided into seven kazas. In the 18th century and the first half of the 19th century, Drama was a sanjak of the Rumeli Eyalet; its revenue was usually granted to the pasha of Salonica, who governed the sanjak through a fiscal agent (mütesellim). With the administrative reforms of 1864, the sanjak was abolished and incorporated in the Sanjak of Drama, part of the Salonica Vilayet. Drama remained the centre of a kaza in the new province.

The Hackney brothers originally formed the group in 2008 to pay tribute to the music of their father (and uncles') early 1970s proto-punk band Death. After a few tribute shows, the group began to write and record their own music. The loud screams and maximum volume of Rough Francis still echoes Death—but they also manage to crystallize a unique sound of their own, channeling live energy from 60's garage rock, Motown and 80's Hardcore. Pre- history: Death and the Original Rough Francis In 1973, three brothers, David, Bobby, and Dannis Hackney, formed the rock and roll band Death. The trio recorded several demos in a spare bedroom and in a studio in their home city of Detroit, Michigan. Inspired by the Beatles, The Who, and Alice Cooper, their music did not find a warm response in Detroit's black community, and the band's foreboding name prevented them from garnering much airplay or landing a record deal. In 1976, they pressed 500 copies of a single on their own Tryangle record label to give to friends and radio DJs. Many copies of the record remained undistributed. The Hackney brothers moved to Burlington, Vermont in the late 70s and changed their band's name to The 4th Movement, turning to Christian Rock. They released two albums under that name in the early 1980s, which were not successful. Disheartened by his band's lack of success, guitarist and band leader David Hackney returned to Detroit while Bobby and Dannis stayed in Vermont to continue playing music together, eventually finding success in the reggae band Lambsbread. David continued to make music on his own under the pseudonym Rough Francis, and with the help of his brothers, released one single before passing away in 2000. As Rough Francis Bassist and vocalist Bobby Hackney's three sons all became interested in punk rock without knowing anything about the rock group that their father had formed with their two uncles in the early 1970s. In 2006 the three younger Hackneys briefly formed a band to cover songs by seminal afropunks the Bad Brains. Meanwhile, Death's 1976 single began to resurface, falling into the hands of ex-Dead Kennedys singer Jello Biafra and many other record collectors who played it at parties and posted it on the Internet. These tracks eventually reached the younger Hackneys, who instantly recognized their father's voice. Excited to discover this music, the younger Hackneys learned the songs and formed a band to cover their father's and uncles' music. They named themselves Rough Francis in tribute to their late uncle David, who was largely responsible for Death's direction. Rough Francis's first show was in Winooski, Vermont in 2008. Having enlisted two friends to fill out the band, they played seven of Death's songs for an enthusiastic crowd that included their own father and mother. The following year, Death's original 1975 recordings of these songs were released as ...For the Whole World to See by Drag City, and Rough Francis supported the release by touring and continuing to play the songs live along with some original material. When an article in the New York Times moved Death from obscurity into the limelight, Bobby Sr. and Dannis Hackney reformed Death with Lambsbread guitarist Bobbie Duncan, and Rough Francis moved on to write, perform, and record more original music. They released a 4-song EP in March 2010, followed by their debut album, Maximum Soul Power in March 2013. The final track on the album, \\"Comm to Space,\\" features recordings of their late uncle, David Hackney, making prank phone calls in the early 1970s using homemade analog delay effects. The experience of the three younger Hackneys, in discovering their family's music and forming Rough Francis, is documented in the 2012 film A Band Called Death. In 2020 their song \\"Deathwire\\" was featured in the soundtrack for Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2.

It was released on September 17, 2009 for the Nintendo DS. The game is a spin-off of The Idolmaster series and its timeline coincides before the events in The Idolmaster 2. The gameplay in Dearly Stars is similar to previous games in the series, but with new elements and differences to the minigames. The gameplay was adjusted to allow the player the option to quickly play through the game's story, but head director Toshihiko Kujioka also wanted to add in gameplay elements that would add another layer of challenge. The story is told from the perspective of Ai Hidaka, Eri Mizutani and Ryō Akizuki—three prospective pop idols introduced in Dearly Stars as they enter the talent agency 876 Production, and deals with their training on their way to stardom. The player has access to the three idols' different scenarios when playing, and each one involves a branching plot line. Development for the game began in 2008 as the first game in the franchise's next stage called \\"2nd Vision\\". The development team wanted to introduce a new talent agency separate from 765 Production, the main agency in the series, to better suit the details of the story. When developing the game's three idols, two of them were decided to be girls, but Kujioka suggested that the third idol Ryō be male instead. The game features 10 songs the idols perform, later released on several music albums. Three manga adaptations were also published by Ichijinsha. Dearly Stars sold 30,786 copies in its first week of release in Japan, and ranked as the tenth best-selling video game in Japan that week. Reviewers have praised the game, and it has been described as suitable for beginners to The Idolmaster series. Gameplay heads-up display of the bottom screen consists of the number of heart points and the enthusiasm meter in the top-left, and the lesson's overall performance rank on the bottom. Dearly Stars is a life simulation game in which the player assumes the role of one of three pop idols at a time: Ai Hidaka, Eri Mizutani or Ryō Akizuki. An idol's statistics are divided into three categories: vocal, dance and visual image. As these increase, an idol's overall image level will also increase. The game is largely divided into two modes: a story mode which encompasses normal gameplay, and a separate stage mode for performing songs outside of the story mode. At the start of every in- game week on Monday, the player is shown current popularity trends in vocal, dance and visual image ranked first, second and third in popularity. This gives the player a guide on how to gain popularity by augmenting an idol's statistics via the choice of song they will perform and what costumes they wear during an audition. Also on Monday, the player is first given the option to choose which costume and accessories to wear for performances, and to choose one of the available songs. Each costume, accessory and song have either a vocal, dance or visual attribute. The player can also modify the choreography and camera positioning used during performances at this time. The player is given the option to check any available messages at the start of every in-game day. This is followed by deciding on the daily schedule for Monday through Saturday from four choices: taking a lesson, doing promotional work, taking an audition, or taking the day off; Sunday is always a day off. The lessons are in the form of three minigames which serve to increase or decrease an idol's statistics in either vocal, dance or visual image. For example, if the vocal lesson is chosen, it will not only increase an idol's vocal statistics, but also decrease an idol's dance and visual statistics. Each lesson is divided into six parts, and the player is given ranked with either a letter grade from A to E or simply a \\"bad\\" rank for each part depending on how well the lesson is performed. The lessons become harder over time the better they are performed. The lesson's overall performance is ranked from bad, to normal, good and finally perfect. The promotional phase of the gameplay mainly deals with the idol conversing with various other characters and doing events, some of which are necessary to progress the game. There are also times when the player is given choices that directly affect the idol. Over the course of a conversation, text progression pauses when the player is given multiple responses to choose from. Depending on which choice is made will effect how well or poorly the communication is received, which results in either bad, normal or good memories. A bad memory will decrease an idol's enthusiasm, which is displayed at certain points throughout gameplay by a horizontal bar in the top-left of the lower screen. An idol's enthusiasm ranges from blue to yellow and finally to red as enthusiasm increases. A normal memory will reward the player with a heart point, used later during auditions. A good memory will reward the player with two heart points and increased enthusiasm. If the player chooses to take the day off, an idol's enthusiasm will automatically increase. Days off also give the idol the chance to either stay at home, or go out into town and meet with other characters. The player can check on days off if there are any presents fans have sent the idols, which contain in-game items. When taking an audition, a judge evaluates the idol over a 30-second period. The judge's interest level continuously decreases in 10% increments, but this can be increased with another minigame. The heart points obtained up to the audition are used in the minigame as the number of times the player is given to successfully appeal to the judge until all the points are exhausted. For instance, three heart points indicates the player will have three chances to increase a judge's interest level. At the end of the audition, a judge's interest level determines if the idol passes or not. If an idol passes the audition, he or she is chosen to do a televised performance of the song previously chosen. A performance serves to increase an idol's number of fans, which in turn can increase an idol's rank if enough fans have been obtained for a given rank. For example, an idol starts at rank F with below 10,000 fans, and the next level up is a rank E with between 10,001 and 99,999 fans. The ranks continue from D to C, B, A and finally S. Each of the three scenarios follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and the story's divergence mainly depends on whether an idol passes or fails an audition, though this is not always the case. Some outcomes, such as failing to pass the first audition, can lead the game to end prematurely and offer an alternate ending to the plot. An audition marks the end of a chapter, after which the story will progress onto the next stage. In the game's stage mode, the player is able to freely customize a stand-alone performance, including options for the song, costume, accessories, choreography and camera positioning. Up to 16 players can participate via Wi- Fi in the stage mode by offering three types of cheers during one player's performance. If the game is played on a Nintendo DS with a camera, such as a Nintendo DSi or a later model, the camera may be used to scan QR codes found online or in magazines to obtain in-game items. Plot and characters Kana Hanazawa voices Eri Mizutani, one of the idols from 876 Production. Dearly Stars occurs prior to the events in The Idolmaster 2, and revolves around characters related to the talent agency 876 Production (876 Pro), a rising studio located in a small office. The three main characters are Ai Hidaka, Eri Mizutani and Ryō Akizuki—three prospective pop idols introduced in Dearly Stars. In Ai's story, she is an energetic girl who wants to be an idol like her mother Mai had been, but she becomes discouraged after failing to pass so many idol auditions. One of the judges at her most recent audition was 765 Production's (765 Pro) Haruka Amami, who catches up with Ai in a nearby park and decides to introduce her to 876 Pro. The president of 876 Pro, Minori Ishikawa, immediately hires Ai and wants to promote her as Mai's daughter, but Ai insists on becoming a popular idol on her own. At the beginning of Eri's story, she is a shy shut-in who has made a name for herself online as an Internet idol under the name \\"Ellie\\". This leads to her being contacted by freelance idol producer Reiko Ozaki, who wants to train her as a real-life idol. After they meet, Eri agrees to start work as an idol. Lastly, in Ryō's story, he is a soft-spoken boy who wants to be an idol so he can be seen as a \\"cool\\" guy. He consults his cousin and 765 Pro idol Ritsuko Akizuki about it, who introduces him to 876 Pro's manager Manami Okamoto. At 876 Pro, Ryō ends up covering for a female idol, much to his chagrin, and he does so well that the agency decides to hire him, but only if he debuts as a female idol. Ishikawa assures him that once he proves himself as a female idol, that she will help him make the transition into being a legitimate male idol. Manami is the manager for both Ai and Ryō in their respective scenarios. The rest of the story deals with the training Ai, Eri and Ryō go through on their way to stardom. Two other idols are introduced in Dearly Stars as supporting characters. Eri is friends with Ayane Suzuki, a high-ranking Internet idol known as \\"Cineria\\" whom she also chats with online. She is against Eri transitioning into being a real-life idol, and seeks to take her back into being an Internet idol. Ryō's story also involves Yumeko Sakurai, a talented idol and rival to Ryō. Throughout the story, other idols from 765 Pro also make appearances. Development and release Dearly Stars was primarily developed by Microvision in conjunction with Bandai Namco Games. The game was directed by Toshihiko Kujioka of Bandai Namco Games and co-directed by Yoshimasa Koyama of Microvision. In 2008, while Bandai Namco Games was in the process of developing The Idolmaster SP and downloadable content for The Idolmaster Live For You!, Kujioka and Bandai Namco Games producer Bunkei Tanaka submitted the proposal for Dearly Stars to Yōzō Sakagami, the main producer for The Idolmaster games. It was announced in May 2009 as the first game in the franchise's next stage called \\"2nd Vision\\", which was described as The Idolmasters next project that would further expand the series' world. The development team wanted to introduce a new talent agency that would be separate from 765 Pro to better suit the details of the story, such as how the idols at 876 Pro are just starting out while the idols at 765 Pro already have an establish fanbase. Tanaka would go on to say that the scenario in Dearly Stars would not have worked without having a different company president—in this case, the president of 876 Pro, Minori Ishikawa. The gameplay was adjusted to allow the player the option to quickly play through the game's story. However, Kujioka also wanted to add in gameplay elements that would add another layer of challenge, such as the introduction of the choreography panel to make adjustments to an idol's dance sequence or the positioning and manipulation of in-game cameras. The staff also altered how the lessons and auditions operate in Dearly Stars compared to previous games in the series, which also modified the game's degree of difficulty. When developing the game's three idols, the staff first decided on going with an archetypal \\"cheerful\\" girl and \\"slightly brooding and negative\\" girl. When thinking about what to do with the last idol, Kujioka suggested having the idol be male instead, and Tanaka thought this would be okay. It was also suggested that one of the 876 Pro idols be related to one of the 765 Pro idols, leading to Ritsuko Akizuki being chosen to be Ryō's cousin. When developing the idols' characters, creating one idol's details resulted in equivalent changes to the other two idols. For instance, this development technique ultimately led to the image color for the idols being decided based on the idols' surnames. The design of the characters was split between two artists: Toshiyuki Kubooka, who had been the character designer since the original arcade version of The Idolmaster, and Kiyotaka Tamiya, who designed the characters introduced in Dearly Stars. When writing the story, the staff wanted to incorporate Hibiki Ganaha and Takane Shijō, who had already been introduced in The Idolmaster SP, but because the two games were being developed simultaneously, Hibiki's and Takane's role in the main story of Dearly Stars was kept to a minimum. For the dance sequences during performances, Kujioka chose to employ talent star Fumi Sakura, as opposed to professional dancers who had been used in The Idolmaster games up to that point. Kujioka wanted the dance sequences to be closer to what he calls an \\"idol's aura\\"—a certain emotional charm that is not a part of an idol's skill at dancing, according to him. Also, because of the idols in Dearly Stars are young and are just starting out, Kujioka told Sakura to purposefully mess up some dance portions to reflect this inexperience. Despite The Idolmaster originally being targeted at a male audience, there were also advertisements and promotions for Dearly Stars geared towards young girls. Despite this, the game has a CERO rating of C (ages 15 and up) and an additional icon for \\"sexual\\" themes. The game was released in Japan on September 17, 2009. =Music= Dearly Stars features 10 songs the idols perform written and composed by a variety of songwriters. The chief music director Kōji Nakagawa told Satoru Kōsaki, the composer of the game's theme song \\"Hello!!\\", that he wanted it to be \\"similar to the opening theme of an anime.\\" It was decided beforehand who the three composers would be for the other three songs introduced in Dearly Stars—\\"Alive\\", and \\"Dazzling World\\". When discussing who would compose which song, Go Shiina said he wanted to compose the song for the game's main idol, so he was given in charge of composing Ai's song \\"Alive\\". Producer Yōzō Sakagami pointed out that as a ballad, \\"Alive\\" does not seem like a typical idol song, but as noted by Nakagawa, the song is meant to reflect the fact that Ai's mother Mai originally sang the song once she became a prominent idol. When recording Ryō's song \\"Dazzling World\\" sung by Yuuko Sanpei, Nakagawa decided on the spot to record the song used in the game in two versions: one with a female voice and the other in a male voice. Of the 10 songs in the game, Kujioka specifically wanted to include . The four songs introduced in Dearly Stars were released by Nippon Columbia on a four-part CD series titled The Idolmaster Dream Symphony in 2009. The first release was the single for \\"Hello!!\\" on September 9. This was followed by three compilation albums, one for each of the idols: Eri's album was released on October 14, Ryō's album was released on November 4, and Ai's album was released on December 2. Related media An Internet radio show to promote Dearly Stars titled broadcast four main episodes and one special episode between July 11 and August 31, 2009 on Niconico's channel Tarukitei. A 176-page guidebook of the game titled The Idolmaster Dearly Stars Delicious Album was released on November 6, 2009 by Enterbrain. The book contains five chapters that detail the plot and characters, gameplay system, data related to in-game items and game mechanics, and interviews from the cast and development staff. Three manga adaptations were serialized in Ichijinsha's Comic Rex between the September 2009 and March 2011 issues. They included: The Idolmaster Splash Red for Dearly Stars illustrated by Anri Sakano which deals with Ai's story, The Idolmaster Innocent Blue for Dearly Stars illustrated by Reiichi which covers Eri's story, and The Idolmaster Neue Green for Dearly Stars illustrated by Kōsuke Kurose which has to do with Ryō's story. Each manga was released in three tankōbon volumes between July 9, 2010 and July 27, 2011. A limited edition of each of the third manga volumes contained a different drama CD. Reception Dearly Stars sold 30,786 copies in its first week of release in Japan, and ranked as the tenth best-selling video game in Japan that week. The game received a score of 30 out of 40 from the Japanese video game magazine Famitsu. Critics have described Dearly Stars as suitable for beginners to the Idolmaster series for drawing out the series' essence and reorganizing it into a simpler and easier-to-understand form. At the same time, Famitsu reviewer Sekai Sandai Miyokawa thinks that fans of the series will feel from Dearly Stars the growth of the 765 Pro idols and the overall growth of the series. Reviewers note that despite the change in the game's details compared to previous games in the series, such as the change in perspective from the producer to the idol, Dearly Stars still plays like an Idolmaster game. However, another Famitsu reviewer stated that because other aspects of the gameplay in Dearly Stars are similar to previous Idolmaster games such as doing lessons and auditions, the sense of enjoyment is not that different from other games. A reviewer for Famitsu felt it was easier to empathize with an idol when the story was told from their perspective. Despite the technical limitations of the Nintendo DS compared to other games in the series that have been developed for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation Portable, Miyokawa described the movement of the idols during performances as \\"better than expected,\\" and welcomed shots of the audience waving glow sticks. While another reviewer for 4Gamer could not deny the lower visual quality of the performances compared to previous Idolmaster games, the unexpectedly high sound quality of the songs in combination with well-done dance sequences, albeit on a small screen, was considered by this reviewer as \\"thoroughly enjoyable.\\" Miyokawa also praised the additional gameplay that goes into minutely adjusting an idol's choreography, but described it as extremely difficult to do well. However, the game's overall degree of difficulty compared to previous Idolmaster games is described as having decreased. The songs introduced in Dearly Stars such as \\"Hello!!\\" have been called \\"wonderful\\". The introduction of Ryō as a cross-dressing idol has been praised by one reviewer who called him the cutest out of the three playable idols because of both his appearance and his personality. Miyokawa suggested that Ryō may have been created to lessen any sense of awkwardness that male players would feel from playing as female idols, but upon playing his scenario, Miyokawa noted that the player is naturally able to get into the story, in part due to the comical events surrounding Ryō's story that deal with him cross-dressing.

In its final years, it was renamed Baylands Raceway Park. The site lies in the quadrant just south of the intersection of Interstate 880 and Auto Mall Parkway. History The track was constructed on land leased from the Southern Pacific Railroad, which had acquired the land from the U.S. Navy after World War II. The Army had constructed a small airfield on the site just prior to the war, which was subsequently taken over by the Navy during the war (Naval Outlying Landing Field Heath). In 1961, after the Fremont Dragstrip was already in operation, another smaller airfield for gliders, Skyways Airport, was constructed on the southern part of the site directly adjacent to the dragstrip, becoming one of the busiest gliderports in the world prior to its closure. By the end of the 1960s and early 1970s, the Fremont Dragstrip was in its heyday. Its booming radio ads were familiar and ubiquitous on all the pop radio stations in the San Francisco Bay Area. The track was used as a location for movies in the late 1970s. More American Graffiti, a 1979 coming-of-age comedy film written and directed by Bill L. Norton, had filmed Paul Le Mat's character, John Milner, drag racing here. Hot Rod, the 1979 made-for-television directed by George Armitage and starring Gregg Henry and Pernell Roberts, filmed races here. The track held the National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) Golden Gate Nationals from 1981 to 1983. In 1983, Gary Beck ran the first Top Fuel time in the 5.3s, a 5.39 seconds, in Larry Minor's dragster. \\"Because of its dense, near-sea-level air and outstanding traction, Baylands is a fast track that has been the site of most production-bike record attempts.\\" In December 1986, Jay Gleason set the fastest quarter-mile of 9.69 seconds on a street bike, Yamaha V-Max.

Finished in the late 13th century it is the oldest church in Michalovce. Originally designed as a Gothic church, it was restored in the 18th century to Baroque style. It is widely considered to be one of Slovakia's finest examples of medieval church architecture and among the most well-known church buildings in the country and is considered a national landmark in Slovakia. History The church, dedicated to the Virgin Mary (who was also the patron saint of Hungarian kings), was constructed in the late 13th century for the lords of Michalovce (Nagymihályiovci). The church was located in what was then the town center, and then obviously stood in the middle of the square. By the 14th century the church was located near the church parish school (written mention of it is among the oldest records of the parish schools throughout Slovakia). From the 16th to 18th centuries the church changed hands several times (alternately belonging to Protestants and Roman Catholics). At the end of 17th century it was severely damaged by fire. In the 18th century it was restored by initiative and the patronage of the Hungarian Count Imre Sztáray. What was originally a gothic church now obtained Baroque architecture. To this day the Gothic church bell tower remains, and the Church has maintained a Gothic-styled interior. Other sights include an epitaph of an unknown Hungarian aristocrat, as well as a baroque altar dating from 1721 with a younger altarpiece of the Virgin Mary (the original was transferred to the Jesuit church in nearby Uzhhorod), a plaque (to commemorate the restoration of the church) in 1749, Rococo pulpit from the 19th century. Above the main entrance to the church is placed a plaque with an inscription from 1784. Curiosity is nowadays aroused by the local crypt, where the members of the families of patrons of the church is buried along with 18th-century weapons that were allegedly concealed in the bowels of the church by conspirators against the king.

It was composed between October 1889 and April 1890, but only received its first public performance in 1919, a year after Debussy's death. The work is dedicated to the pianist René Chansarel, who had been scheduled to play the solo part for the cancelled premiere in 1890.  Instrumentation  The Fantaisie is scored for: piano solo; 3 flutes, 2 oboes, cor anglais (English horn), 2 (soprano) clarinets in B, 3 bassoons, bass clarinet in B; 4 (French) (valve) horns in F, 3 trumpets in F; 2 harps; strings (1st & 2nd violins, violas, cellos, double basses).  Structure  The Fantaisie is in three movements, as in a traditional concerto, with the first movement in sonata form, a slow, calm middle movement, and an energetic finale. This despite the title, a fantasia is traditionally in a single movement with several sections of vastly different character, and contains no \\"sonata form\\". The title Fantaisie was given to this work because it is in cyclic form: it uses the same two themes in all three movements. # Andante ma non troppo (G major) # Lento e molto espressivo (F-sharp major) # Allegro molto (G major) A typical performance lasts approximately 25 minutes.  Performance and publication  The first public performance of the work, scheduled in 1890, was cancelled when Vincent d'Indy, who was chosen as conductor, claimed that he did not have enough time for rehearsals and proposed to perform only the first movement, which Debussy declined.Mark DeVoto - Debussy's Neglected Fantaisie, Tufts University, The Pendragon Review, pp. 26-45 Over the next few years the very self-critical Debussy made numerous revisions, but eventually gave up on the work and declared that the Fantaisie would never be published or performed during his lifetime.Fantasy for Piano and Orchestra, The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, kennedy-center.org It received its first public performance posthumously on November 20, 1919, in London by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra with Alfred Cortôt as soloist. It was published first in a two-piano version (2nd piano is a reduction of the orchestra score) made by Gustave Samazeuilh in 1919, with the full score in 1920, both by Eugène Fromont, one of Debussy's early publishers.

It is known commonly as the lesser mealworm and the litter beetle. It has a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring nearly worldwide. It is known widely as a pest insect of stored food grain products such as flour, and of poultry-rearing facilities. It is a vector of many kinds of animal pathogens. Description The adult lesser mealworm beetle is roughly 6 mm long and widely oval in shape. It is shiny black or brown with reddish brown elytra, the color variable among individuals and changing with age. Much of the body surface is dotted with puncture-like impressions. The antennae are paler at the tips and are covered in tiny, yellowish hairs. The elytra have shallow longitudinal grooves.Dunford, J. C. and P. E. Kaufman. Lesser mealworm, Alphitobius diaperinus. Entomology and Nematology. University of Florida, IFAS. 2006. The eggs are narrow, whitish or tan, and about 1.5 mm long. The larvae somewhat resemble other mealworms, such as the common mealworm (Tenebrio molitor), but are smaller, measuring up to 11 mm long at the final subadult stage. They are tapering and segmented, with three pairs of legs toward the front end, and whitish when newly emerged from the egg and darken to a yellow-brown. They become pale when preparing to molt between instar stages six to 11 instars occur. Distribution This species has long been known throughout the world as a common pest, so its origins are uncertain, but it may have originated in Sub-Saharan Africa. It moved into Europe long ago, and was likely introduced to North America from there. Alphitobius diaperinus in a poultry facility Biology A tropical species, the lesser mealworm thrives in warm, humid environments, both natural and established by humans. It inhabits caves, rodent nests, and the nests of birds, including kites, pigeons, hamerkop, house sparrow, and purple martin.Crook, P. G., et al. (1980). The lesser mealworm, Alphitobius diaperinus, in the scrotum of Rattus norvegicus, with notes on other vertebrate associations (Coleoptera, Tenebrionidae; Rodentia, Muridae). The Coleopterists Bulletin 393-96. It easily colonizes agricultural establishments with abundant food sources and warm conditions, such as grain processing and storage facilities and poultry housing. The beetle consumes a wide variety of materials, including litter, bird droppings and bat guano, mold, feathers, eggs, and carrion. It feeds on the eggs and larvae of other insects, such as the rice moth (Corcyra cephalonica).Dass, R., et al. (1984). Feeding potential and biology of lesser meal worm, Alphitobius diaperinus (Panz.) (Col., Tenebrionidae), preying on Corcyra cephalonica St. (Lep., Pyralidae). Zeitschrift für Angewandte Entomologie 98(1‐5), 444-47. It also engages in cannibalism. It commonly feeds on sick or weakened live animals. When it lives in bird housing it may infest and consume dying birds, especially chicks. It was also once observed inhabiting the scrotum of a rat. The adult female beetle lays usually about 200 to 400 eggs, but it has been known to produce up to 2000. It lays eggs every few days throughout its life, which is generally up to one year long, or up to two years when it is reared in captivity. It deposits the eggs in litter, droppings, grain stores, or cracks in structures. The larvae emerge within a week and take 40 to 100 days to reach maturity, depending on conditions and the food supply. The larvae grow well in high humidity. They pupate alone in secure spots. They are quite active and mobile and burrow quickly when threatened. Larvae and adults are mainly nocturnal, becoming most active at dusk. Impacts As a pest, the beetle is most damaging to the poultry industry. This is the most common beetle found in poultry litter.Dinev, I. (2013). The darkling beetle (Alphitobius diaperinus) - A health hazard for broiler chicken production. Trakia Journal of Sciences 11(1), 1-4. The larvae damage poultry housing structures when they search for suitable pupation spots, chewing through wood, fiberglass, and polystyrene insulation. This destruction can be costly to growers, especially in heating energy costs. The beetles consume the birds' feed and irritate the birds by biting them.Kozaki, T., et al. (2008). Comparison of two acetylcholinesterase gene cDNAs of the lesser mealworm, Alphitobius diaperinus, in insecticide susceptible and resistant strains. Archives of Insect Biochemistry and Physiology 67(3), 130-38. Other insect residents of poultry housing include the housefly (Musca domestica) and its predator, Carcinops pumilio, a clown beetle. The fly is a pest which can sometimes be kept under control by the beetle. The lesser mealworm interferes with this ecology by reducing the survival of clown beetle eggs and larvae. The lesser mealworm beetle is a vector of many pathogens. It spreads more than 30 bird diseases.Arunraj, C., et al. (2013). Lesser mealworm, Alphitobius diaperinus (Panzer, 1797) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) menace in poultry farms in south India. Journal of Biopesticides 6(1), 84-86. It transmits animal viruses such as rotavirus,Despins, J. L., et al. (1994). Transmission of enteric pathogens of turkeys by darkling beetle larva (Alphitobius diaperinus). The Journal of Applied Poultry Research 3(1) 61-65. the turkey coronavirus, the chicken viruses that cause Marek's disease and infectious bursal disease, and the viruses that cause Newcastle disease, avian influenza, and fowlpox.Watson, D. W., et al. (2000). Limited transmission of turkey coronavirus in young turkeys by adult Alphitobius diaperinus (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae). Journal of Medical Entomology 37(3), 480-83. It transmits bacteria such as Campylobacter jejuni,Steelman, C. D. (2008). Comparative susceptibility of adult and larval lesser mealworms, Alphitobius diaperinus (Panzer) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), collected from broiler houses in Arkansas to selected insecticides. Journal of Agricultural and Urban Entomology 25(2), 111-25. Salmonella typhimurium serovar, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus species. A single exposure of a chick to a contaminated beetle can result in bacterial colonization of the bird's gut.Hazeleger, W. C., et al. (2008). Darkling beetles (Alphitobius diaperinus) and their larvae as potential vectors for the transfer of Campylobacter jejuni and Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi B variant Java between successive broiler flocks. Applied and Environmental Microbiology 74(22), 6887-91. Chicks are more likely to be infected by eating larvae than adult beetles.Leffer, A. M., et al. (2010). Vectorial competence of larvae and adults of Alphitobius diaperinus in the transmission of Salmonella Enteritidis in poultry. Vector-Borne and Zoonotic Diseases 10(5), 481-87. The beetle can also transmit Aspergillus fungi. It is a vector for Eimeria, protozoa that cause coccidiosis in birds. It carries fowl tapeworms such as Choanotaenia infundibulum and the nematodes Subulura brumpti and Hadjelia truncata.Alborzi, A. R. and A. Rahbar. (2012). Introducing Alphitobius diaperinus, (Insecta: Tenebrionidae) as a new intermediate host of Hadjelia truncata (Nematoda). Iranian J Parasitol 7(2), 92-98. Poultry have difficulty digesting the beetle and larva, and if they eat them, they can experience intestinal obstruction and gut lesions. Broiler chickens and turkey poults have slower weight gain when they feed on the beetle. Like other darkling beetles, this species produces defensive benzoquinone compounds that can be irritating to humans, causing asthma, headaches, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, corneal ulcers, and dermatitis with erythema and papules. The benzoquinones may be carcinogenic. Before the beetle became problematic in poultry, it was better known as a pest of stored goods, including wheat, barley, rice, oatmeal, soybeans, cowpeas, peanuts, linseed, cottonseed, tobacco, and dried meat.Tomberlin, J. K., et al. (2008). Susceptibility of Alphitobius diaperinus (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) from broiler facilities in Texas to four insecticides. Journal of Economic Entomology 101(2), 480-83. This beetle can become a household pest if it ends up near human habitation in old litter to be used as compost. It emerges when it is attracted to light from homes. Management No agents of biological pest control are used against the lesser mealworm. The fungus Beauveria bassiana is an arthropod pathogen that may prove useful. Some protozoa and spider species are known natural enemies. Control is usually attempted with carbaryl insecticide in the form of powder, liquid, and bait. Thiamethoxam and 9-Tricosene used in conjunction have been shown to be successful in poultry houses. Pyrethroids and boric acid are used. True outbreaks are often uncontrollable and some populations of the beetle have shown resistance to various compounds. Resistance is more common on farms that have been chemically treated for many years. Insecticides are not ideal because they contaminate the poultry and they are not effective on the pest when it burrows out of reach.Rezende, S. R. F., et al. (2009). Control of the Alphitobius diaperinus (Panzer) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) with entomopathogenic fungi. Revista Brasileira de Ciência Avícola 11(2), 121-27. Proper maintenance of poultry housing usually keeps the beetle under control, as it propagates in accumulated litter and droppings. Uses Along with Dermestes beetles, species of this genus are used in museums to clean tissues off of carcasses during the preparation of zoological specimens. Freeze-dried larvae of the litter beetle (buffalo worms) as food, or food ingredient The larvae of the litter beetle, like certain other larvae of darkling beetles such as mealworms, are used as animal feed, e.g., fed to captive reptiles. They have been reported as a good first food for Central American wood turtle (Rhinoclemmys pulcherrima mannii) hatchlings, because they are more active than common mealworms and their movement stimulates feeding behavior.Webb, M. R. Care & Breeding of the Central American Wood Turtle, Rhinoclemmys pulcherimma manni. Tortoise Trust. 2010. The larvae are edible insects and also farmed for human consumption by specialized European insect farms, mostly in the Netherlands and Belgium. The larvae are either sold freeze-dried for consumption, or processed into food such as burger patties,Food Navigator (2018-10-12): Article on the insect burger by German start-up Bugfoundation. pasta,Yumda.com (2018-03-05): For the first time: Foodstuffs containing insect proteins on the market. or snack bars.Nutraingredients.com (2018-09-21): Danish insect-statup targets holistic nutrition with mineral-dense buffalo worm bar. As food as well as pet food, the larvae are commonly marketed under the term buffalo worms, more rarely lesser mealworm. References Further reading *Crippen, T. L. and J. F. Esquivel. (2012).

Bailey occurred on October 8, 1900, at Breakheart Hill Farm in Saugus, Massachusetts. Bailey's employee, John C. Best, was subsequently convicted of the murder and executed. George E. Bailey Bailey was born in Whitefield, Maine. He married a woman in Lynn, Massachusetts and the couple moved to Alna, Maine. They had two children before her death. Bailey later married Abbie Hilton of Wiscasset, Maine. They lived in Wiscasset, where Bailey worked as a blacksmith. The couple had four children together. In the spring of 1897, Bailey abandoned his family and ran off with Susie Young, his wife's half-sister. Abbie Bailey was unable to support herself and the family's six children. They were placed with families in Whitefield and Wiscasset and she eventually found employment as a housekeeper. Bailey and Young initially resided at the home of Henry O. Mitchell in Saugus, but the couple moved in October 1897 when Bailey leased Breakheart Hill Farm, an eighteen-acre (7 hectare) farm located on the three-hundred-acre (120 ha) Breakheart Hill Forest, from the Breakheart Hill Forestry, an association of wealthy businessmen from Lynn. Bailey was also hired to take care of their hunting camps at Breakheart Hill Forest for 20¢ per hour. About a year after moving into Breakheart Hill, Young gave birth to Bailey's child, a son. John C. Best John Courtney Best was born on April 8, 1865, in Sackville, New Brunswick. He was one of nine children. Best attended school full-time until about the age of twelve, when he moved in with an uncle. He then attended school during the winter and worked on the farm the rest of the year until the age of fifteen. During his youth, Best also became an award-winning marksman. For ten years Best worked on the farm of A. Alfred Ayer, a friend of his father. After that he worked in Sackville at a shoe factory for about a year, at a grocery store for about four months, and at a hotel until he left for Massachusetts. In 1891, Best's sister, Nettie Stiles, returned to Sackville from her home in Lynn, Massachusetts, for a visit. She requested that Best accompany her on her trip back. He remained with her in Lynn and found employment at J. B. Renton, a heel manufacturer. In September 1898, Best was arrested for assault and sentenced to serve four months in the Salem House of Correction. Upon his release he returned to Lynn and worked for another heel manufacturer, J. G. Brown. He later returned to J. B. Renton where he remained until the company's employees went on strike. During the strike, Best was hired by Bailey to work at Breakheart Hill for one month. He returned to heel manufacturing, but in May 1900 he returned to Breakheart to work full time. Best agreed to do half of the cultivating on the farm in exchange for a room to sleep in and half of the profits from the crops. Relationship between Bailey and Best Bailey, Young, and Best appeared to live harmoniously at Breakheart Hill, however Best and Bailey complained about each other outside of the farm. Best complained that Bailey was cruel to the animals and did not pay him all that he was entitled to. Bailey complained that Best was lazy and had a drinking problem. Bailey would withhold Best's pay until after the crops were sold to keep him from drinking away all of his share. Bailey would also give him less than he requested for farm equipment because Best tended to spend any money he had on him at the saloon. Susie Young described Best as a harsh man who would go on a drinking binge for one or two weeks at a time. When he was drunk, she stated that Best would act crazily and once said while intoxicated that he would just as soon kill a man as not. However, she also said that she had only once seen Best and Bailey argue. Disappearance of George E. Bailey On September 27, 1900, Young left Breakheart Hill to visit her sick mother in Wiscasset. She took her son with her. Bailey did not accompany her as he felt he could never return to Wiscasset due to the circumstances of his departure. Thus, Bailey and Best were alone at Breakheart Hill. Between 9:30 and 9:40 pm on October 8, two gunshots were heard in the area of Breakheart Hill Farm. Around 10 pm, Hannah Hawkes, an elderly woman who lived at the end of the road leading to Breakheart Hill Farm heard a carriage driving rapidly away from the farm. Later that night she was awakened by the sound of a carriage driving up the road to the farm. Around 1:30 am, Ora Beede, a woman who resided near Floating Bridge Pond (also known as Glenmere Pond) in Lynn, heard the rattle of a wagon and saw a democrat wagon pass her home. She heard the sound of the horse's hooves on the planks of the bridge until the wagon reached about the halfway point of the bridge. After five minutes of silence, she heard the horse being driven back over the bridge and heard the wagon pass her house again. The wagon had a particular sound, as if one of its wheels was loose. The next day, Best went to the homes of his neighbors, Sarah Rowe, Simon McKenna, and Annie Dwyer to ask if they had seen Bailey. He told them that he had not seen Bailey since 8 o'clock the previous evening. Also that day, James W. Thomas noticed a bonfire in the yard at Breakheart Hill Farm. Among the items being burned was what Thomas took to be a piece of horse blanket. Johnnie Mitchell and Win Rowe, two area boys who assisted on the farm from time to time, both noticed the absence of two horse blankets. Investigators believed that Best dismembered Bailey's body on top of these blankets. Rowe also noticed that one of the farm's axes was missing. Although no formal report was filed, word about Bailey's disappearance spread. Micajah Clough, one of the owners of the property, heard of Bailey's disappearance and that Best was constantly drunk and left the livestock unattended. He went to the farm to talk with Best, who told him that he thought Bailey had left because he was fleeing officers from Maine and that there was a $500 bounty on him for running out on his wife. Discovery of the body On October 17, the trunk of a man's body was found in a bag at Floating Bridge Pond. There were two bullet holes in the breast of the body. Police believed that the body was Bailey's and visited Breakheart. They asked Best to come identify the body, however before they left he pulled out a half-full pint of whiskey and downed it. Best identified the clothing on the body as belonging to Bailey. Later that afternoon, the legs were found. Saugus Police Chief Charles O. Thompson corroborated Best's identification of the body parts, stating that the height, color of hair on the body, and shoe size matched that of Bailey. Shoemaker Darius W. Brewer also identified the shoes on the body as belonging to Bailey. Found on the body was a small chamois watch bag which Young would later identify as the one she made for Bailey. The bags containing Bailey's body were labeled \\"I. H. Estes & Sons, Hay & Grain\\", the name of Bailey's grain supplier. A number of similar bags would be found on Breakheart Hill Farm. Investigation The investigation was led by George C. Neal of the Massachusetts State Police. Officers from the Lynn and Saugus police departments were involved as well. After the body was identified, police asked Best if they could search the house. Best said yes and provided them with lanterns. One of the two bullets found in the body fit inside of the barrel of a rifle found at the farmhouse. Examination of the weapon showed that it had fired recently. Best claimed that it had gone off accidentally about a week earlier. An examination of the house revealed blood stains on the carpet, wallpaper, and window sill of Best's bedroom, which Best claimed had been there ever since he moved in. After the search, Best was placed in custody for suspicion of murder. The next day, the police returned to the property and noticed that several stones had been removed from a wall on the property. These stones were of the same color and geological composition as the ones used to weigh down the bags containing Bailey's body. Also on October 18, medical examiner Dr. Joseph G. Pinkham said that based on the body's stomach contents, he believed that the murder was committed on the night of October 8. Also, due to the trajectory of the bullets, the murderer held the gun at a 45 degree angle and was standing above Bailey when the shots were fired. Bailey may have been sitting down when he was killed. Due to the fact that Bailey bled internally after he was shot, it was possible that there would be no traces of blood where Bailey was shot. However, the area where his legs, head, and arms were cut off would be completely saturated. Therefore, police focused their efforts on finding the location where Bailey was mutilated instead of where he was shot. A Saugus police officer found an empty 38 caliber cartridge in the ground below a small barn window. This along with Pinkham's findings led investigators to believe that Bailey was shot as he was seated in his democrat wagon as he drew rein in front of the barn door. Later, police discovered Bailey's overcoat hanging on a nail in his bedroom, which led them to change their theory to Bailey being shot as he was seated in his kitchen or sitting room. Young told police that after his day's work, Bailey would rest with his elbows on his knees and his head slumped way over due to his height. This would explain the trajectory of the bullets. However, by the time the case went to trial, the theory had changed again. During his opening statements District Attorney W. Scott Peters stated that Best had shot Bailey as he climbed up the barn cellar stairs. On October 22, Young returned from Maine to look over the house with detectives. She told them that the stains on the floor and the wallpaper in the storeroom were not there when she left, and that it appeared that someone had scrubbed the floor recently. This is where police believed Bailey's body was dismembered. Pre-trial On January 25, 1901, Best was indicted for the murder of George E. Bailey. On January 30 he was arraigned and pleaded not guilty. Jury selection occurred on the morning of March 18. Trial Massachusetts Attorney General Hosea M. Knowlton was one of the prosecutors on the case. Best was tried in Massachusetts Superior Court in Salem, Massachusetts Best's prosecutors were Massachusetts Attorney General Hosea M. Knowlton, Essex County District Attorney W. Scott Peters, and Assistant District Attorney Roland H. Sherman. James H. Sisk and Nathan D. A. Clarke were appointed by the court to represent him. Massachusetts Superior Court Justices Jabez Fox and Edgar J. Sherman presided over the trial. The trial began on the afternoon of March 18. On the fifth day of the trial, William H. Stiles, Best's brother-in-law, revealed that Best had told him that some property, including a watch, was hidden in the basement of the barn. Best wanted Stiles to go to the barn and take the watch and \\"fling it away as far as [he] could at low water mark\\". Although Best did not say whose watch it was, he told his brother-in-law \\"if that watch is found, I am lost\\". After the revelation, police hurried to Breakheart Hill farm. Hidden over a rafter was a package made up in newspaper. It contained a gold watch, $75 in cash, a pocket knife, and part of a leather coat that resembled the one Bailey was wearing the day he was killed. Oakes M. Palmer, a watchmaker from Pittston, Maine, testified that the serial number on the watch matched that of a watch Bailey had him repair twice in 1891. Best claimed that he had taken these items after Bailey disappeared, because Bailey owed him money and he wanted to secure himself. Massachusetts Superior Court Justice Edgar J. Sherman was one of two justices who presided over the case. The trial concluded on March 28. After six hours of deliberation, the jury returned a verdict of murder in the first degree. Appeals Exceptions filed by the defense during the trial were argued before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court on January 6, 1902. The exceptions were overruled on February 27. On March 13, Best's attorneys requested that the verdict be set aside and that he be given a new trial on the grounds that the verdict was against the evidence and that one of the jurors was unqualified to serve due to deafness. On March 15 the motion was overruled by Sherman and Fox. On August 6, Governor Winthrop M. Crane and the Executive Council heard Best's plea for commutation of his sentence. His request was rejected. Sentencing On June 14, 1902, Best was sentenced to death in the electric chair. His execution was to take place on the week of September 7, 1902 at the Charlestown State Prison. Best was the first prisoner in Essex County, Massachusetts, to be sentenced to the electric chair. Execution Best was executed on September 9, 1902 at Charlestown State Prison. On August 28, 1902, Best was transported from the Salem jail to Charlestown State Prison. He was executed at 12:22 am on September 9. He was completely composed during his execution and did not utter any final words. The witnesses were prison physician Dr. Joseph McLaughlin, Surgeon General of Massachusetts Robert A. Blood, associate district medical examiner Dr. George Stedman, and Deputy Sheriff William Cronin, whose presence was required by law. Rev. I. Murray Mellish and a representative from the Associated Press were also in attendance. He was pronounced dead by the attending physicians at 12:27 am. Aftermath On October 23, 1900, Bailey's body was transported from Boston to Richmond, Maine, by boat. It was then taken to Whitefield for burial. After the trial, Young returned to Wiscasset. William H. Stiles was persecuted and ostracized in his hometown of Lynn. He was called a \\"Judas\\", \\"traitor\\", and \\"informer\\" for testifying against his brother-in-law. His ten- year-old son was verbally and physically attacked at school. District Attorney Peters wrote a letter to the Lynn Police Department suggesting that they give the Stiles family protection. Best's father expected that his son's body would be returned to Sackville for burial, but it was instead interred at the Concord Reformatory Cemetery in Concord, Massachusetts. On September 20, a letter Best wrote to his parents shortly before his execution was made public. In it he wrote of the status of his personal affairs, expressed his innocence, and requested that his burial be paid for by the state. Bailey was succeeded as caretaker of Breakheart Hill by Henry Cole. On April 12, 1901, Cole left home and was never seen again. Cole took some money with him and sold a horse prior to his departure. He and his wife had an argument before he left and she believed that he had not returned because he had tired of his family situation. In 1934, the Breakheart Hill property was sold to the Metropolitan District Commission, which turned it into a state park known as Breakheart Reservation. The farm was later destroyed by a fire.

Chedabucto was armed with a single quick-firing (QF) /40 caliber Mk IV gun mounted forward. For anti-aircraft purposes, the minesweeper was equipped with one QF 2-pounder Mark VIII and two single-mounted QF 20 mm Oerlikon guns. As a convoy escort, Chedabucto was deployed with 40 depth charges launched from two depth charge throwers and four chutes.Macpherson, p. 19 Construction and career Chedabucto was ordered on 23 February 1940 and her keel was laid down on 24 January 1941 by Burrard Dry Dock Co. Ltd. in Vancouver, British Columbia. The minesweeper was launched on 14 April 1941 and commissioned later that year on 27 September at Vancouver.Macpherson and Barrie, p. 169 The vessel was named for Chedabucto Bay, Nova Scotia.Darlington and McKee, pp. 106–109 After working up Chedabucto left Esquimalt, British Columbia on 11 November 1941 and arrived at Halifax, Nova Scotia on 17 December. On 12 January 1942, Chedabucto rescued the crew of the merchant Independence Hall which had run aground on Sable Island. On 8 April, Chedabucto attacked a surfaced U-boat off Halifax. However, the ship's steering gear jammed and the U-boat was able to evade the minesweeper. On 10 April SS Trongate caught fire in Halifax harbour. Among the contents of her cargo were explosives. Chedabucto sank Trongate with non-explosive practice shells fired into the hull to scuttle the ship.Naftel, p. 237 Assigned to the Western Local Escort Force (WLEF) briefly, she was transferred to the Gulf Escort Force in June 1942. On 20 July 1942, convoy QS 19, escorted by Chedabucto and the corvette , came under attack by in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. One merchant vessel was sunk.Rohwer, p. 178 At the end of September convoy QS 38, which the minesweeper was escorting, came under attack by . One merchant was hit but no contact was made between the escorts and the submarine.Sarty, pp. 190–192 In September she was re-assigned to Sydney Force before returning to the WLEF in January 1943. Chedabucto then went for a refit at Lunenburg, Nova Scotia which were completed in June 1943. She was then assigned to the Gaspé Force in July. In October, Chedabucto was detailed to escort the cable ship through the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The minesweeper screened the cable layer until Father Point and then detached to patrol duties. =Sinking= Lord Kelvin, the vessel that rammed Chedabucto On 31 October 1943, Chedabucto was sailing down the Saint Lawrence River to rendezvous with the fire tugboat Citadelle when the minesweeper collided with the cable ship Lord Kelvin near Rimouski, Quebec. Lord Kelvin rammed the minesweeper on the port side, just aft of the wardroom. Lord Kelvin reversed, leaving a hole in the side of the ship and a 10° list to port. The United States Coast Guard vessel was hailed and attempted to tow the stricken minesweeper closer to shore. However, the minesweeper grounded from shore and the list increased to 40°. The tow attempts were ceased and the crew of Chedabucto was transferred to Lord Kelvin and Chedabuctos sister ship which had also arrived on the scene. The minesweeper later rolled onto her side and sank. There was one casualty aboard Chedabucto, suffered during the collision. The ship sank from Rimouski.Colledge, p. 77Rohwer, p. 282 References =Notes= =Citations= =Sources=   * * External links * * Category:Ships of the Royal Canadian Navy Category:Bangor-class minesweepers of the Royal Canadian Navy Category:Ships built in British Columbia Category:1941 ships Category:World War II minesweepers of Canada Category:Maritime incidents in October 1943 Category:Minesweepers of the Royal Canadian Navy Category:Ships sunk in collisions ","title":"HMCS Chedabucto"},{"id":"40097412","text":"Helena is the Latin form of Helen.

The work was exhibited at the Salon de la Société Normande de Peinture Moderne, Rouen, 1912 (titled Passy); the Salon de la Section d'Or, Galerie La Boétie, Paris, 1912 (titled Passy); Manes Moderni Umeni, Vystava, Prague, 1914 (titled Paysage à Passy); and Galerie Der Sturm, Berlin, July, 1914. Passy was one of a small group of works chosen to be reproduced in the seminal treatise Du \\"Cubisme\\", written by Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger in 1912 and published by Eugène Figuière the same year. Executed in a highly personal Cubist style with multiple viewpoints and planar faceting, this is one of a number of paintings from 1912-13 involving the theme of the bridge in an urban landscape. In opposition to classical perspective as a mode of representation, Gleizes employed a new spatial model based in part on the pictorial space of the mathematician Henri Poincaré. This painting, in the collection of the Museum Moderner Kunst (mumok),Museum Moderner Kunst (mumok), Albert Gleizes, Les Ponts de Paris (Passy) Vienna, probably refers to the spirit of solidarity among the newly formed \\"Artists of Passy\\", during a time when factions had begun to develop within Cubism. Description Passy (Bridges of Paris) is an oil painting on canvas with dimensions 60.5 x 73.2 cm (23.8 by 28.8 inches), signed and dated Alb Gleizes, 1914, lower left. Panorama of Paris, View of la Seine and Passy seen from downstream of the Eiffel Tower. In the foreground, the former Champ de Mars train station, followed by the Pont de Passy. Postcard image taken from the 2nd level of the Eiffel Tower The works represents an upscale cartier de Paris known as Passy located in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, one of the most wealthy districts of the French capital, and traditionally the home of well-known personalities, including Honoré de Balzac, Benjamin Franklin during the nine years that he lived in France, William Kissam Vanderbilt, and the artist Jacques-Emile Blanche. Les Artistes de Passy was a divers grouping of avant-garde artistes (painters, sculptors and poets), including several who previously held meetings in 1910 at the rue Visconti studio of Henri Le Fauconnier. Their first diner (Premier dîner des Artistes de Passy) presided over by Paul Fort was held at the house of Balzac, rue Raynouard, in the presence of Guillaume Apollinaire, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, Marie Laurencin, Henri Le Fauconnier, Fernand Léger, André Mare, Francis Picabia, Henry Valensi, and Jacques Villon.Cubisme, 1912\\", Archives, Grande Encyclopédie Larousse Albert Gleizes chose to Passy as the subject of this painting. Instead of depicting a bowl of fruit or a man playing a guitar under the influence of African art, Gleizes turns toward a non-Euclidean model of geometry as a source of inspiration for Passy. This work signified the rejection of Euclidean geometry and its correlate; the quantitative measurement of spatial depth governing perspective invented during the Renaissance, an unquestioned principle of academic painting that had persisted to date.Alex Mittelmann, State of the Modern Art World, The Essence of Cubism and its Evolution in Time, 2011 Panorama of Paris, view from the Trocadéro towards Passy (postcard early 1900s) Vanishing points have been abolished. A perspectival grid is gone. Forms are not clearly delineated. Colors are synthetic and limited, not overpowering. Light and reflected light do not come from a consistent unidirectional source. There is no precisely clear relationship between structures (e.g., buildings, bridges) based on overlapping or on diminished scale with distance to show depth of field as objects recede from the foreground. Here Gleizes brakes all the rules. Perhaps for this reason Passy was chosen as an example of new painting for publication in their manifesto; Du \\"Cubisme\\".Mark Antliff, Patricia Dee Leighten, Cubism and Culture, Thames & Hudson, 2001, Albert Gleizes, Passy (Ponts de Paris), reproduced Fig. 59Peter Brooke, Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1881-1953 Background Antliff and Leighten write of Passy (Ponts de Paris) in Cubism and Culture: > Instead of this [academic] spatial model, Cubists turned to new models of > geometry and the 'fourth dimension' as inspiration for the works like > Gleizes's Passy (Ponts de Paris) of 1912, which he and Metzinger reproduced > in their tract Du Cubisme as exemplary of art expressing their ideas. This > urban landscape synthesized the river, trees, clouds, buildings, steel > bridges and smoke of the modern city. Partially geometrized forms—such as > the green arc of tree on the upper left or arched doors and windows on the > rectangular buildings in the center—are subjectively evoked through limited > colour range; shifting perspectives, signified by long vertical and diagonal > bands cutting off the edges of objects contained within them; and shifting > relative scales of objects, such as the two steel bridge spans. [...] the > Cubists justified this novel approach to pictorial space in part on the > basis of the mathematician Henri Poincaré's theory of 'conventionalism'. The existence of a fourth dimension, according to Poincaré, could not be ruled out by observation alone. \\"If the number of dimensions comes from the way in which we are made\\", Poincaré hypothesized, \\"there might be thinking beings living in our world, but made differently from us, who would think that space has more or less than three dimensions.\\" > Thus the characteristic property of space, that of having three dimensions, > is only a property of our distribution board, a property residing, so to > speak, in the human intelligence. The destruction of some of these > connections that is to say of these associations of ideas, would be > sufficient to give us a different distribution board, and that might be > enough to endow space with a fourth dimension. (Poincaré, 1897)Henri > Poincaré, The Relativity of Space, from Science & Method, 1897 Poincaré stressed the importance of understanding the relativity of space. Space is in reality amorphous, according to Poincaré, only things that occupy space give it a form: > One part of space is not by itself and in the absolute sense of the word > equal to another part of space, for if it is so for us, it will not be so > for the inhabitants of the universe B, and they have precisely as much right > to reject our opinion as we have to condemn theirs. > > I have shown elsewhere what are the consequences of these facts from the > point of view of the idea that we should construct non-Euclidean and other > analogous geometries. (Poincaré, 1897) Consistent with the view of Poincaré, Euclidean geometry represented one configuration among many equally valid geometric models that Gleizes could have chosen. With this newfound liberty, he was free to transform Passy in accord with his own subjectivity. This radical break from classical conventions was not without its parallel in Nietzschean free will and freedom of expression. In an essay on the Cubism of Metzinger published September 1911, Gleizes wrote of his compatriot as a disciple of the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche who 'invents his own truth' by destroying 'old values'.Albert Gleizes, L'Art et ses représentants. Jean Metzinger, Revue Indépendante, Paris, September, 1911, pp. 161–172 Since the classical Euclidean notion of 'fixed' absolute space explicitly informed the fictive 'moment' of absolute time, the Cubists jettisoned the idea of placing the observer at a privileged spatial position at a fixed moment in time. Now, according to the theoretical deliberations of Gleizes and Metzinger, artists were free to move around the subject matter, depicting multiple views 'simultaneously', whereby several successive moments in time could be captured and projected onto the canvas at once. In the process, the 'total image' produced over a period of time was more complete than a single instantaneous view.

Reproduced in Du \\"Cubisme\\" The intervention of memory in the process of representation was an important criterion for Henri Poincaré (as it would be too for the philosopher Henri Bergson, post-Symbolist writers and Gleizes himself): :Besides, we have to make a representation, not of a complexus of simultaneous sensations, but of a complexus of successive sensations, following one another in a determined order, and it is for this reason that I said just now that the intervention of memory is necessary. (Poincaré, 1897) \\"Absolute space exists no longer\\" writes Poincaré; \\"there is only space relative to a certain initial position of the body\\". > We define a point by the succession of movements we require to make to reach > it, starting from a certain initial position of the body. The axes are > accordingly attached to this initial position of the body. > > But the position I call initial may be arbitrarily chosen from among all > the positions my body has successively occupied. If a more or less > unconscious memory of these successive positions is necessary for the > genesis of the notion of space, this memory can go back more or less into > the past. Hence results a certain indeterminateness in the very definition > of space, and it is precisely this indeterminateness which constitutes its > relativity. Memory would play an important role in Les Ponts de Paris (Passy), as it did in Gleizes' Le Chemin (Paysage à Meudon), Portrait of Jacques Nayral, painted in 1911, Man on a Balcony of 1912, and Portrait de l’éditeur Eugène Figuière, of 1913: Both the content and form in these paintings were the result of mind associations as he completed the works from memory; something that would play a crucial role in the works of other Cubists, such as Fernand Léger, Robert Delaunay and Francis Picabia. Cubist factions Disparate inspirations during a proto-Cubist phase had already yielded several related methods of expressing the geometric experience (what Gleizes and Metzinger would soon attribute to mobile perspective). Cubism was in the eye of the beholder; it could be seen as a process, a system, a state of mind, an inspired attitude that would develop a new symbolic structure, a reflection of the changing world. Despite their similarities, works produced by divers artists were neither homogeneous nor isotropic. This venture was essentially nonlinear. Cubism was omnidirectional, growing like a tree with many branches. The progression of each artist was unique. Even when paths would cross, artists would not necessarily fall under one another's influence. Despite a growing awareness, a 'collective consciousness' based on a nonacademic passion for structure and mobility, and despite the sense of group unity that would attain a maxima circa 1912, deep-seated differences arose sporadically, often fueled by critics and dealers. In Albert Gleizes, 1881-1953, A Retrospective Exhibition, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum curator and art historian Daniel Robbins writes of Passy: > A synthesis of the modern city with its smoke, river and steel bridges, this > work probably refers also to the spirit of solidarity among the newly formed > \\"Artists of Passy\\". In this sense it indicates an awareness of factions > within Cubism. (Robbins, 1964)Daniel Robbins, 1964, Albert Gleizes 1881 – > 1953, A Retrospective Exhibition, Published by The Solomon R. Guggenheim > Foundation, New York, in collaboration with Musée National d'Art Moderne, > Paris, Museum am Ostwall, Dortmund Georges Braque, Violin: \\"Mozart Kubelick\\", 1912, oil on canvas, 45.7 x 61 cm, Metropolitan Museum of Art The participation of many artists, in addition to Metzinger, Gleizes and the Duchamp brothers, in the formation of the association Les Artistes de Passy in October 1912 was an attempt to transform the Passy district of Paris into yet another art-centre; a further sign of a growing emphasis on communal activity that would culminate in the Section d'Or exhibition. Les Artistes de Passy was a further sign too, as Robbins points out, of the growing rift that separated the Salon Cubists (Metzinger, Gleizes, Le Fauconnier, Delaunay, Léger and others) from the Gallery Cubists (Picasso and Braque). There was a distinct difference between the Salon Cubists and Kahnweiler’s Cubists. The latter had mostly been seen by a small group of artists and connoisseurs in a small private gallery, generating only modest reviews in the press, while the impact of the Salon group in the printed press and general public was enormous. Kahnweiler had exclusivity contracts with his artists and sold only to a small circle of collectors from his small \\"boutique\\" (Gleizes' term) comparatively hidden behind La Madeleine. Works of the Salon Cubists were seen by tens of thousands of spectators during well- publicized, conspicuous and prominent events such as the Salon d'Automne and Salon des Indépendants. Picasso and Barque were kept away from the Salons by Kahnweiler for fear of ridicule and for financial reasons (exclusivity guaranteed commission).Michael Taylor, 2010, Philadelphia Museum of Art, Tea Time (Woman with a Teaspoon), 1 Audio Stop 439, Podcast :Metzinger's Le goûter (Tea Time) \\"was far more famous than any painting that Picasso and Braque had made up until this time; because Picasso and Braque, by not showing at the Salons, have actually removed themselves from the public... For most people, the idea of Cubism was actually associated with an artist like Metzinger, far more than Picasso.\\" (Michael Taylor, 2010, Curator Philadelphia Museum of Art) Pablo Picasso, 1913, Bouteille, clarinette, violon, journal, verre, 55 x 45 cm. This painting from the collection of Wilhelm Uhde was confiscated by the French state and sold at the Hôtel Drouot in 1921 While financial support from Kahnweiler's gallery sales gave Picasso and Braque the freedom to experiment in relative privacy,Christopher Green, 2009, Cubism, MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press the highly publicized Salon Cubists were free to experiment in public and sell works directly from their studios and Salons. The immense Cubist manifestation called Salon de la Section d'Or of 1912 (an exhibition organized by Metzinger, Gleizes and the Duchamp brothers) took place at the centrally located Galerie de la Boétie in a prominent gallery district of Paris. This gallery showing by Salon Cubists may have been seen as a threat by Kahnweiler, since it marked the beginning of decades of personal attacks targeting artists not associated with his gallery. At stake, beyond commercial speculation and financial profit, were the questions of when Cubism began, who led the way in its development, what distinguishes Cubist art, how it can be defined and who can be called Cubist. By marginalizing the contribution of the artists who exhibited at the Salon des Indépendants and Salon d'Automne, Kahnweiler's attempted to focus attention on Picasso and Braque, those who played a leading if independent role in the development of this new mode of expression. To some extent Kahnweiler had succeeded in his endeavor, prompting historians such as Douglas Cooper to coin the term ‘true’ Cubism to describe the work of Picasso and Braque. The implied value judgement was intentional. This restricted view of Cubism has since been replaced by more contemporary alternative interpretations of Cubism, more complex and heteroclite; formed to some degree in response to the more publicized Salon Cubists, whose methods were too distinct from those of the Gallery Cubists to be considered merely secondary to them.Daniel Robbins, Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism, 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, The University of Iowa Museum of Art, p. 22 Albert Gleizes, 1911, Paysage (Landscape), oil on canvas, 71 x 91.5 cm. Reproduced frontispiece catalogue Galeries Dalmau, Barcelona, 1912 Salon Cubists produced a different kinds of Cubism. It is not clear to what extent these Cubists depended on Picasso and Braque for their development of such techniques as faceting, ‘passage’ and multiple perspective. They could well have arrived at such practices with little knowledge of Picasso and Braque, guided by their own understanding of Cézanne. The works produced by these other Cubists exhibited at the 1911 and 1912 Salons extended beyond the conventional Cézannian range of subjects chosen by Picasso and Braque to include large-scale allegoric and modern-life subjects. \\"Aimed at a large Salon public\\", writes art historian Christopher Green, \\"these works made clear use of Cubist techniques of faceting and multiple perspective for expressive effect in order to preserve the eloquence of subjects that were richly endowed with literary and philosophical connotations\\". The Salon Cubists were attuned to the philosopher Henri Bergson's notion of ‘duration’, according to which life is subjectively experienced as a continuous forward movement in time, with the past flowing into the present and the present merging into the future. In Du \\"Cubisme\\" Gleizes and Metzinger explicitly related this sense of time to multiple perspective. \\"The one major innovation that one can be sure was made independently by the Salon Cubists, that of ‘simultaneity’, came of a conviction also rooted in their understanding of Bergson that the divisions of space and time should be comprehensively challenged.\\" Green continues: \\"The conjunction of such subject-matter with simultaneity aligns Salon Cubism with early Futurist paintings by Umberto Boccioni, Gino Severini and Carlo Carrà; these Italian works, though themselves made in response to early Cubism, led the way in the application of techniques of simultaneity in 1911–12\\". > 'What is necessary', writes Gleizes, 'is to take everything up again from > the foundations and to start out from the unquestionable reality of two > currents which, unaware of each other, were finally enfolded under a single > heading, the movement that was called 'Cubism'.

Her philosophical achievements are oftentimes overlooked. She translated Karl Rosenkranz's Pedagogics as a System and wrote The Education of American Girls, a response to arguments against the coeducation of males and females. Life Born to Samuel and Caroline Brackett, she was the oldest of five children. Her father was a dry goods merchant on Milk Street in Boston, Massachusetts, and the family lived in Somerville. Brackett attended private and public schools in Boston and Somerville and Abbot Academy. In 1856 she graduated from the state teaching school in Framingham, Massachusetts, now known at Framingham State University. She served as a teacher in East Brookfield, Massachusetts, and then as an assistant principal in the teaching school in Framingham. In 1861, Anna became vice principal in Charleston, South Carolina. At the start of the Civil War, she was forced to leave for New Orleans and then St. Louis where she met with the St. Louis Hegelians and later published the first English translation of several philosophical works. After briefly returning to Cambridge, Massachusetts, and teaching at the high school there, she then went back to St. Louis. One of her biggest accomplishments came in 1863 when she was appointed principal of the St. Louis Normal School (Harris-Stowe State College), the first female principal of secondary school in the United States. During her tenure, Brackett worked to ensure female students had access to higher education and liberal studies as preparation for professional teaching. She made two proposals to the Board of Education that were eventually adopted. The first proposal was an age requirement for entrance to the school. Second, there should be an entrance exam for admission to the St. Louis Normal School. In 1872 Anna Brackett resigned as principal after there were changes in the curriculum that went against her beliefs. She moved to New York City with her domestic partner, Ida M. Eliot, the daughter of Congressman Thomas D. Eliot. The pair adopted their first daughter, Hope, in 1873 and their second daughter, Bertha, in 1875. In New York, Brackett started The Brackett School for Girls, located at 9 West 39th Street, and she hired notable female teachers such as Mary Mitchell Birchall, the first woman to receive a bachelor's degree from a New England college.The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine, Volume 44, edited by Richard Watson Gilder, p.980 Among Brackett's pupils was Ruth Sawyer, in whose Newbery Award-winning semi-autobiographical children's novel, Roller Skates, Brackett is remembered fondly as an imposing but beloved educator. Anna Brackett retired from teaching in 1894 and died in 1911. Brackett's brother, George, a Harvard graduate, and her two sisters ran a school in Brooklyn, New York. A biography of Brackett was published upon her death, entitled: Anna C. Brackett, in Memoriam, MDCCCXXXVI-MDCCCCXI: An Appreciation (1915). Works In 1874, Brackett published The Education of American Girls, an essay that applied Rosenkranz's theory of education to girls. In this essay, Brackett observes that a young woman must be guided through two steps of the learning process, the \\"perceptive stage\\" and \\"conceptual stage.\\" In her opinion, no girl can excel in life without attaining both of these steps. Her thoughts were that an education which merely stops at the conceptual stage is not adequate. If undereducated and untrained in abstract thinking, women are at risk to becoming arbitrary if they were to become active in public affairs. Brackett made the point that if women are confined only to the family circle and taking care of the home, they will not be able to fully develop morally and intellectually. This would cause girls to lose their chance at asserting their independence or compete with others and gain the confidence needed to be successful in the public realm. Men, however, automatically enter into the public realm where they become independent persons, separate from the family. Brackett makes the argument that without being able to grow outside their homes, women face two dangers. The first danger is they grow to be ineffective in the public realm and perpetuate the stereotype of the \\"incompetent woman.\\" The second danger is to a woman's well-being, risking becoming vulnerable to exploitation by men. This essay was the foundation to Brackett's belief that coeducation is important and necessary in the American education system. Brackett wrote extensively regarding education and philosophy and published writings in Harper's Magazine and other well known publications. She also published The Education of American Girls and served as an editor of New England Journal of Education.

Štajner was born in Vienna, where he joined the Communist Youth of Austria, but emigrated to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in 1922 on the order of the Young Communist International to help the newly established Communist Party of Yugoslavia. After an illegal communist printing house in Zagreb where Štajner worked was searched by the police in 1931, he fled Yugoslavia, visiting Paris, Vienna, and Berlin before finally settling in the Soviet Union in 1932 where he worked in the Comintern publishing house in Moscow. During the Great Purge in 1936, Štajner was arrested and spent the next 17 years in prisons and gulagsŠtajner 1985, p. 97. and three more years in exile in Siberia. He was released in 1956 after being rehabilitated, and returned to Yugoslavia. He spent the rest of his life in Zagreb with his wife Sonya whom he married in Moscow in the 1930s. In 1971, Štajner published a book titled \\"Seven Thousand Days in Siberia\\" about his experiences.Štajner 1988 The book was a bestseller in Yugoslavia and was named the \\"book of the year 1972\\" by the Vjesnik newspaper. Biography Štajner was born Karl Steiner in Vienna, Austria-Hungary on 15 January 1902. He worked as printing worker when he joined the communist movement in the First Austrian Republic in 1919. He became a member of the Communist Youth of Austria and later became a member of the organization's Central Committee. The Communist Party of Yugoslavia (CPY) was banned in December 1920 and all communist activities were prohibited by the regime of Alexander I of Yugoslavia. In December 1921, Štajner was sent to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes by the Young Communist International to help the CPY. From January 1922 until 1931, he lived in Zagreb, where he ran an illegal communist printing house, and was helping local CPY cell.Štajner 1985, p. 208. During this time, he became a citizen of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. In 1931, Yugoslav police found out about the printing house, so Štajner fled the country to avoid arrest. He initially traveled to Paris where the Central Committee of CPY had its side-base. He lived in Paris for almost a year, but was arrested for his communist activity and expelled from France. He moved to Vienna, where he tried to establish an illegal printing house in order to distribute communist literature all over the Balkans. There, Štajner was arrested again, and expelled from Austria, as he was no longer a citizen of that country. Georgi Dimitrov helped him travel to Berlin to avoid being extradited to Yugoslavia, and to help the Communist Party of Germany. Facing arrest once again, he fled Germany and traveled to the Soviet Union in July 1932. Štajner settled in Moscow, where he was appointed manager of the Comintern publishing house. While in Moscow, he met and married Russian girl Sofya \\"Sonya\\" Yefimovna MoiseevaMatvejević 2004, p. 26. in 1935.Štajner 1985, p. 209. During the Great Purge, Štajner was arrested on 4 November 1936Štajner 1988, p. 11. by the NKVD agents and accused of being a \\"counterrevolutionary, Gestapo agent, and accomplice in the murder of Sergey Kirov\\". He was tried together with Yugoslavian communist leaders Filip Filipović and Antun Mavrak, both of whom died during the Great Purge.Štajner 1985, p.40. From November 1936 til May 1937, Štajner was confined in the NKVD prisons Lubyanka and Butyrka, and then submitted to the military court and confined in the Lefortovo Prison. In June 1937 he was found guilty by the military court and sentenced to ten years in prison. He was then transferred to the Solovki prison camp on the Solovetsky Islands, where he was held until August 1939. He was then transferred to the Nadezhda work camp near Dudinka in northern Siberia. There, he took part in the building of the railwayŠtajner 1985, p. 78. and then in the building of the city of Norilsk. In 1943, Štajner was sentenced to ten more years in prison, plus five years of loss of rights. In 1948, after the Tito–Stalin split and the expulsion of the CPY from the Comintern, the NKVD asked him to testify against the Yugoslavian leadership, which he refused. Shortly afterwards, he was transferred to Irkutsk, where he was held until 1949, and then to Bratsk, where he was held until September 1953. His 17-year prison term ended on 22 September 1953, six months after the death of Stalin. After being released from prison, Štajner was not allowed to return to Moscow, but was forced to live in exile in Siberia according to the 101st kilometre Law. While in exile, Štajner lived in Krasnoyarsk, Yeniseysk and Maklakovo between 1953 and 1956. There, he worked as a stonemason, and then as a factory worker. In 1955, Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union resumed diplomatic relations. In June 1956, during an official visit to Soviet Union, Tito handed Khrushchev a list of 113 Yugoslav communists who had disappeared during the Great Purge, and asked about their fate. Khrushchev promised he would answer in two days, when he found out. Two days later, Khrushchev informed Tito that exactly one hundred of the persons on the list were dead by then.Kiš 1988, p. 1. Then, the remaining thirteen were located by the KGB in Siberia, and eleven of them returned to Yugoslavia.Štajner 1985, p. 168. Štajner was among them. Shortly before that, the Supreme Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR rehabilitated him. He traveled from Maklakovo to Moscow to meet his wife. Soon afterwards, he returned to Yugoslavia, which he considered his home country. He was issued an exit permit to leave the Soviet Union on 30 July 1956. After return to Yugoslavia he was awarded a state pension, and he spent the rest of his life living in Zagreb.Matvejević 2004, p. 208. He visited Soviet Union once more in 1966.Štajner 1985, p. 94. Štajner died on 1 March 1992, and was buried in Zagreb. =Family= Štajner married Russian girl Sonya Yefimovna in Moscow in 1935. At the time of his arrest, she was 20 years old, and in the ninth month of pregnancy. She gave birth to a girl named Lida, but the baby died when she was two years oldŠtajner 1985, p. 167. of cold and illness. During Štajner's time in prison, Sonya was humiliated, mocked, and tortured by the authorities and was labeled \\"wife of an enemy of the people\\".Kiš 1988, p. 2. She never repudiated her husband, and spent most of her time trying to help him. She was able to exchange a few letters with Štajner until 1940, but then did not hear about him for the next five years. Although she suspected that her husband was dead, she never remarried. In 1945, Štajner managed to reestablish contact with his wife through a woman who worked in the prison camp. The two met for the first time after almost 19 years in March 1955 when she visited him in Maklakovo, where he lived in exile. In 1956 she emigrated with her husband to Yugoslavia and lived with him in Zagreb. She was still alive as of 2002. Literary work After his return to Yugoslavia, Štajner became an author and published three booksMatvejević 2004, p. 209. about his arrest, trial, and experiences in Siberian gulags. The books are titled: *\\"Seven Thousand Days in Siberia\\" (1971, ) *\\"Return from the Gulag\\" (1981, ) *\\"A Hand from the Grave \\" (1985, ) – a collection of interviews with Štajner, and texts about Štajner written by others. His first book, \\"Seven Thousand Days in Siberia\\" was very popular in Yugoslavia, and was translated to German, French, English, Slovene and Czech, Esperanto (S.A.T., 1983). It was named \\"the book of the year\\" in 1972 by the Vjesnik newspapers, and Štajner was awarded the Ivan Goran Kovačić prize as the author of the book of the year.Štajner 1985, p. 204-205. Štajner finished the manuscript for \\"Seven Thousand Days in Siberia\\" in 1958, but no publisher was able to publish it until 1971 because of political controversy.Kiš 1988, p. 3. The copies of the manuscript he sent to the publishers in Zagreb and Belgrade disappeared without trace, but Štajner had already sent the original manuscript to his brother living in Lyon, France. Štajner's life and work was a major inspiration for Danilo Kiš' book of stories A Tomb for Boris Davidovich, published in 1976. Kiš befriended Štajner and wrote an introduction to \\"Seven Thousand Days in Siberia\\".Kiš 1988, p. 4. Kiš also wrote about Karlo and Sonya Štajner in his 1983 book of essays and interviews \\"Homo poeticus\\". Title of Štajner's book \\"A Hand from the Grave \\" comes from Miroslav Krleža who mentions Štajner in his \\"Diaries\\" and compares him to the biblical Lazarus who rises from the grave.Štajner 1985, the book sleeve See also *Moscow Trials *NKVD troika * Varlam Shalamov Notes References  * Category:1902 births Category:1992 deaths Category:Yugoslav communists Category:Austrian communists Category:Yugoslav non-fiction writers Category:Stalinism-era scholars and writers Category:Great Purge victims from Yugoslavia Category:Foreign Gulag detainees Category:20th-century historians Category:Croatian people of Austrian descent Category:Burials in Croatia Category:20th-century non-fiction writers ","title":"Karlo Štajner"},{"id":"40098235","text":"The Dual Role of Bob Brookmeyer is an album by jazz trombonist and pianist Bob Brookmeyer recorded in 1954 and 1955 for the Prestige label.Prestige Records discography accessed July 29, 2013Cohen, N.

Biography Wolff graduated from a trade school after teaching in Paris . This was followed by a degree in Bonn before he settled in Paris in 1857. There he worked as a secretary for Alexandre Dumas. From 1859 he was editor of Le Charivari under the pseudonym Charles Brassac. He moved to Le Figaro where he became a leading art critic and was later promoted to editor of the newspaper. His discussions of the Paris Salon had a great impact of the success of contemporary artists. Wolff supported academic painting, with Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier as one of his favourite artists. Moreover he was intensively connected with contemporary French artists, a. o. the painters of the Barbizon School who he visited and interviewed frequently. In his publication of 1886: 'Notes upon certain Masters of the XIX century' Wolff described the French painters whose pictures were exhibited on the exhibition 'Cent Chefs-d'Oeuvres: the Choiche of the French Private Galleries', in Paris, 1883. Wolff opposed Impressionism, although occasionally he praised individual works from this school. He also published detailed observations of Paris in several books and wrote several novels and stage plays. Politically, he opposed antisemitism. He is buried in cimetière du Père-Lachaise (96th division).

Its test transmission started on 14 August 2002 on the PAS 10 digital satellite whereas on 1 October 2002 the regular transmission of Geo Entertainment was started. Currently, GEO stands at the top position in Pakistan for entertainment channels.  History  GEO has been one of the oldest Pakistani networks, and regularly has received good TRPs on various daily soaps, reality series, and drama serials since inception. Geo used to show a lot of daily soaps when it was in its initial years and the soaps got popular too. Some shows from the 2000s that aired on the network which are still recognized include Tere Pehlu Main, Meri Zaat Zarra-e-Benishan, Kaash Main Teri Beti Na Hoti, Tum Ho Kay Chup, Doraha, and various more. The channel continued to do well in ratings but in 2014 the network was banned in the country for promoting blasphemy on its morning show Utho Jago Pakistan. The channel was eventually unbanned but the ratings took a hit and the channel was panned for making below average content, and it took a while for the channel to get back onto the charts with well ratings. In 2017, GEO launched Khaani and the series went on to become a huge success for the network with worldwide success and was later added on Netflix due to its major popularity. Similarly around the same time Ghar Titli Ka Par also was a big success for the network domestically and garnered many views on YouTube as well. The two drama serials helped GEO break ground just like it did before its ban and become the most viewed channel in Pakistan. Since that time, Geo joined hands with 7th Sky Entertainment and has produced various shows that have been record-breaking on television and social media platforms. In 2019, the network created two records for the most watched show in the 9:00 pm slot with the beginning of Bharosa Pyar Tera and ending of Dil- e-Gumshuda , both the series garnered 17.0 TRP In 2020, Munafiq created a record for the most watched show in the 7:00 pm slot with 22.75 TRP, and is also the second highest rated serial in the history of Pakistani television, as well as being in the top trending list in India on YouTube. In recent times, criticism of Geo Entertainment includes the flak for its low picture quality on television compared to HUM HD and ARY Digital which are in higher quality, and making very Indian-ized dramas by copying daily soaps from Indian networks and turning them into weekly drama serials or daily soaps as well in order to get ratings. Popular programming which have gotten ratings as well as international popularity in recent years includes , Mohabbat Tumse Nafrat Hai, Piya Naam Ka Diya, Ramz-e-Ishq, Yaariyan, Meharposh, Aye Dil Tu Bata, Deewangi, Kahin Deep Jalay and many more. The network also has various series on Prime Video such as Hiddat and Yaar-e-Bewafa. Programming  Controversy  In May 2014, Geo Entertainment was banned by PEMRA for airing blasphemous content in its morning show Utho Jago Pakistan. Protest was also done in Lahore as people said it is an unlawful ban. While on other hand countrywide protest was done against Geo for airing controversial content.

Director Dana Lustig was the one who asked for the film's title to be changed from The Veil of Maya to Harmony and eventually A Thousand Kisses Deep. \\"It was originally called The Veil of Maya, but my daughter is called Maya..... so we changed the name to Mia. But people said the title didn’t mean anything, so we changed it to Harmony, because of the music element and the idea of having harmony between yourself and your past and your future, but nobody got that either! So the producers came up with the idea of A Thousand Kisses Deep, and adding the [ Leonard Cohen ] poem at the beginning and end.\\" Actor Dougray Scott took up playing trumpet for the film.

The correct information which she gave him was, he said, taken from letters to which she had access, or from works of references like Who's Who. In one case, which made a great impression, she gave some remarkably abstruse and correct information. It was afterwards found that the facts were stated in an old diary which had belonged to her husband.\\" The medium Leonora Piper was described as an American counterpart to Thompson.Bonnie G. Smith.

Plot In 1928, a globally famous illusionist, Wei Ling Soo, performs in front of a crowd in Berlin with his world-class magic act. As he walks off stage the film audience sees that he is actually a British man named Stanley (Colin Firth). He berates his employees and is generally curmudgeonly towards his well- wishers. In his dressing-room, he is greeted by old friend and fellow illusionist Howard Burkan (Simon McBurney). Howard enlists Stanley to go with him to the Côte d'Azur where a rich American family, the Catledges, has apparently been taken in by a clairvoyant and mystic, Sophie (Emma Stone). In fact, the son of the family, Brice (Hamish Linklater), is smitten with Sophie, and his sister Caroline (Erica Leerhsen) and brother-in-law George (Jeremy Shamos) are concerned Brice is considering proposing marriage. Howard says that he has been unable to uncover the secrets behind her tricks and he admits that the more he watched her the more he believed she really has supernatural powers. So he would like Stanley, who has debunked charlatan mystics in the past, to help him prove she is a fraud. Howard and Stanley travel to the French Riviera, but Stanley is soon astonished by Sophie's ability to go into a fugue state and apparently pull out highly personal details about him and his family. Stanley witnesses a seance in which Sophie communicates with the deceased patriarch of the American family. A candle floats up from the table and Howard grabs it to try to discern what trickery is at play, but is astounded to find no apparent subterfuge. Stanley begins spending time with Sophie. He takes her to visit his aunt and they drive a convertible along the picturesque rocky corniches. When Stanley and Sophie visit his aunt Vanessa (Eileen Atkins), Sophie is seemingly able, after holding aunt Vanessa's pearls, to somehow relate secret details of Vanessa's one great love affair. This finally convinces Stanley of Sophie's authenticity and he has an emotional epiphany, feeling that his lifelong rationalism and cynicism have been misguided. When caught in a rain storm, they end up at an observatory that Stanley had visited as a child. After the rain subsides, they open the roof up and view the stars. At a Gatsby-esque party, Stanley and Sophie dance. As they walk together later that night, Sophie asks him if he has felt any feelings for her \\"as a woman\\". Stanley, who has admired her talents as a mystic and is grateful to her for opening his eyes to a new worldview, is taken aback and admits that he has not thought of her that way. She leaves upset. The next day Stanley holds a press conference to tell the world that he, who spent his life debunking charlatan mystics, has finally come to find one who is the real deal. The reporters drill him with questions, but the grilling is interrupted when he receives news his aunt Vanessa has been in a car accident. Stanley rushes to the hospital, and in an emotional scene in a waiting room considers turning to prayer for solace. That is, if he now has come to believe in divination and mysticism, perhaps he should believe in God and prayer. He begins to pray for a miracle to save his aunt, but is unable to go through with it. The rationality that has been his whole life comes back and he rejects prayer, the supernatural and by extension, Sophie and her powers. He decides once more to prove she is a fraud. Using a trick seen earlier in his stage act, Stanley appears to leave the room but stays to overhear Sophie and Howard discuss their collusion in what has been an elaborate ruse. He discovers that Sophie was able to know so much about him and his aunt because she and Howard collaborated to fool Stanley. Sophie was indeed a charlatan tricking the rich American family and was quickly discovered by Howard. Rather than unmask her and stop the ruse, he enlisted Sophie to help him one-up his best friend and rival, Stanley. Stanley is initially angry at Howard and Sophie but decides to forgive them. In a conversation with his aunt Vanessa, who has recovered from her car accident, Stanley admits and fully realizes that he is in love with Sophie. He finds her and asks her not to marry Brice, but marry him instead. Sophie is taken aback and finds his haughty, awkward proposal unsuitable. She tells him she still plans to marry the wealthy Brice. Returning dejected to his aunt Vanessa's, Stanley further admits that he fell in love with Sophie at first sight, and, saddened, is then surprised when Sophie, who had arrived before him, knocks a spirit knock. He proposes, she accepts with a spirit knock, and they kiss as the film ends. Cast Production In April 2013, Colin Firth and Emma Stone joined the cast of the film. In July, they were joined by Jacki Weaver, Marcia Gay Harden, and Hamish Linklater, and director Woody Allen began shooting in Nice, France. Allen revealed the film's title to be Magic in the Moonlight on October 15, 2013. =Music= Soundtrack\\"Magic in the Moonlight Soundtrack Released\\", filmmusicreporter.com, August 20, 2014 # \\"You Do Something to Me\\" by Cole Porter, performed by Leo Reisman and His Orchestra # \\"It's All a Swindle\\" (\\"Alles Schwindel\\") by Mischa Spoliansky and Marcellus Schiffer, performed by Ute Lemper # \\"Moritat\\" from The Threepenny Opera by Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht, performed by Conal Fowkes # \\"Dancing With Tears in My Eyes\\" by Joseph A.

Rex Reed, writing for The New York Observer, gave the film a largely positive review, calling it \\"a masterstroke of enchantment\\" and praising Colin Firth's acting.

However, in Vanity Fair, Richard Lawson criticized Emma Stone's acting, arguing, \\"her line delivery is too modern to really work convincingly in the period, and like many other nonetheless talented actors, she has trouble with Allen’s stilted, formal cadence.\\" He added that the age gap between Stone and Firth was \\"a little gross\\" and \\"icky\\".Richard Lawson, The Romance in Magic in the Moonlight Distracts from the Comedy, Vanity Fair, July 22, 2014 Alan Scherstuhl of the Village Voice disliked the film, criticizing its familiarity from Allen's previous work and believing the writing was uninspired. Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly gave the movie a \\"B-\\" grade (from A+ to F), remarking that it was funny and \\"pleasant\\" but also forgettable. Salon's Andrew O'Hehir felt that the characters were not drawn out enough because of poor writing. The New York Times' A. O. Scott wrote: \\"Mr. Allen has had his ups and downs over the years. Rarely, though, has he put a story on screen that manifests so little energy, so little curiosity about its own ideas and situations.\\" In 2016 film critics Robbie Collin and Tim Robey ranked it as one of the worst movies by Woody Allen. =Box office= The film opened in limited release in North America on July 25, 2014.

Originally a solo project for founder Sadie Dupuis, from 2011 a full band incarnation has released three EPs and three LPs mostly on Carpark Records.  History  =Early years (2011-2012)= The band originated in 2011 as Sadie Dupuis' solo project shortly after she moved to Northampton to work on her MFA. While Dupuis was teaching songwriting at a summer camp, she would also record her own material on a laptop in her spare time. Two releases resulted from this solo endeavor, the Cop Kicker EP, and the album, The Death of Speedy Ortiz. The band was named after a character from the comic book series Love & Rockets who committed suicide. Dupuis explained that when she began making demos for this project, her “roommate had passed away of a heart attack super young...And [her] childhood best friend had overdosed.” She found the storyline relatable and named the band “Speedy Ortiz” in reference “to how everybody else deals with his loss. And that is sort of what the songs were for me in the beginning.” The project expanded into a full band in late 2011. The group independently released \\"Taylor Swift\\" b/w \\"Swim Fan,\\" recorded by Paul Q Kolderie, which was followed by 2012's Sports, released on Exploding in Sound Records. The Phoenix named Speedy Ortiz the “Best New Band in MA” in 2012. =Major Arcana and Real Hair (2013-14)= Prior to the release of their debut studio album, the band released “Ka-Prow!” b/w “Hexxy” on April 30, 2013 via Inflated Records. Major Arcana, was released on Carpark Records on July 9, 2013. Recorded by Justin Pizzoferrato (engineer for Dinosaur Jr and Thurston Moore), the album was recorded over 4 days at Sonelab. Inspired by a history of the occult book that Dupuis read, “the lyrics reference occult staples like sulfur and salt”. The song \\"No Below\\" was used in the soundtrack of the Square Enix game Life is Strange: Before the Storm. The album received critical acclaim upon release. Pitchfork's Lindsay Zoladz gave the album 8.4 and deemed it \\"Best New Music”, writing that “Speedy Ortiz join a small club of young indie rock bands writing lyrics that are actually worth poring over”. Meanwhile, The A.V. Club David Brusie wrote “Major Arcana is a markedly assured debut, one that makes Speedy Ortiz an act to watch. Like its songs, the band’s detonation is inevitable.” In support of the album, the band booked and self-organized a 6-week US tour, in addition to a 17-date tour in all-ages venues and DIY spaces as well as opening for The Breeders and Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks for a run of dates. Additional stops included appearances at Primavera, Bonnaroo, and Pitchfork Festival. On February 11, 2014, the band released the Real Hair EP on Carpark Records reuniting with Paul Q Kolderie and Justin Pizzoferrato. The EP was written during a lull period between tours over four days, “before we left on our summer tour before the album came out.\\" In support of the release, the band embarked on a UK/EU tour with Joanna Gruesome. In 2014, guitarist Matt Robidoux was replaced by fellow Massachusetts musician Devin McKnight of Grass is Green. On July 11, 2014, the band shared the song “Bigger Party” via the Adult Swim Singles Program 2014. In the fall, the band released another song, “Doomsday,” via Famous Class’ LAMC series in which all digital proceeds went to the Ariel Panero Memorial Fund at VH1 Save the Music. =Foil Deer (2015-2017)= On January 21, 2015, Dupuis announced their second studio album, Foil Deer, which was released on April 21, 2015.[12] Written over a month-long retreat in the woods of Connecticut and recorded over three weeks at producer Nicolas Vernhes’ Rare Book Room studio in Brooklyn, Dupuis described the album as \\"a more textured and calculated record than its volcanic predecessor, the writing more measured and less reactionary\\". The album's title and cover art were inspired by the sculpture \\"Le Cerf\\" by Ossip Zadkine. Dupuis noted in an interview with Pitchfork that as a “stay-at-home talking-to-no one kind of person”, she identified with the \\"image of this gilded, shiny deer, which is naturally sort of a skittish, reclusive animal\\". 2015 was a breakout year for Speedy Ortiz, as Foil Deer was met with critical praise. NPR described Dupuis \\"as one of rock's most compelling young voices and lyricists\\". Pitchfork noted in their review of the album, 'The album is ferocious and visceral, the lyrics gleaming with threads involving sharp blades both literal and figurative...As Dupuis grows more self-possessed, she and her bandmates veer into their most ambitious compositions to date.\\" The New York Times praised the album and compared it“As if Fiona Apple joined a punk band, with...even more vocal confidence”. Also in 2015, Speedy Ortiz cleaned up in the top three categories of The Boston Music Awards, including artist, album/EP (Foil Deer), and song of the year (\\"Raising the Skate\\"). They also won for best charitable effort for donating net proceeds from their latest tour to the Girls Rock Camp Foundation.The Boston Globe 12/10/15 Foil Deer also earned the band the title of Noisey's Artist of the Year for 2015. On the band, Noisey said: \\"They exist to give back to their community. They exist to empower you. They exist to make you put your fist in the air. The band embodies what the genre of punk rock started out as—powerful guitars and a dominant stage presence—but have also brought along the bold message that no matter who you are or what you’re feeling, you’re OK.\\" In support of the record, the band toured extensively in North America and Europe tours supported by artists including Mitski, Alex G, Downtown Boys, Palehound, Krill, and Trust Fund as well as embarking on co- headline dates with Ex Hex, The Good Life, and Hop Along. The band also made appearances at Outside Lands, Forecastle Festival, and Riot Fest. In December 2015, the band embarked on an all-ages benefit tour with 100% of net proceeds to the Girls Rock Camp Foundation, \\"a non-profit that generates funding for camps designed to help girls develop real-world skills and artistic expression through musical collaboration\\". On May 9, 2016, the band announced the Foiled Again EP featuring remixes from Lizzo, Lazerbeak, and Open Mike Eagle and outtakes from Foil Deer. The EP included the track \\"Death Note\\", which took its name from the eponymous manga/anime series. On February 20, 2017, the band released the track \\"In My Way\\" as part of the Our First 100 Days compilation, benefiting organizations that support causes endangered by the Trump administration. On July 7, 2017, the band released the song “Screen Gem” to coincide with the announcement of Devin McKnight's departure. Proceeds from the track sales benefited the criminal justice reform nonprofit CLOSErikers at McKnight's request. =Twerp Verse (2018-Present)= On February 21, 2018, the band released the lead single “Lucky 88” from their third album, ‘Twerp Verse’, set to be released on April 27. Recorded at Silent Barn and mixed by Mike Mogis, the album is actually the band's second attempt at a new record as a previous attempt was scrapped following the election. Dupuis said that “The songs on the [scrapped] album that were strictly personal or lovey dovey just didn’t mean anything to me anymore”. Twerp Verse is also the first album to feature the Philadelphia guitarist Andy Molholt of Laser Background. “Lean In When I Suffer”, the second single from the album, was released on March 21, 2018, accompanied by a video premiered by The Fader. \\"Villain\\", the third single from the album, was released on April 11, 2018.

It serves as the administrative center of Teplyk Raion. Population:  History  The first written mention of Teplik is from the 15th century. Historical records show that the settlement emerged as a fortified border crossing of the Duchy of Lithuania. Tunnels and caves that were dug in those days still remain. In the 15th and 16th centuries, Teplik was a small town which suffered frequent damage during enemy attacks. In 1582, Ivan and Andriy Kishki shared ownership of the town and it became the property of the Ostrogski family. In 1645 Teplik went to Zhabokrytskyi. Then came Samuel Kalinowski, who annexed the land to Uman. The population of Teplyk engages mainly in agriculture and handicrafts: mainly leatherworking, shoemaking and smithing. There were also merchants. Historians, researchers, and multiple other sources, explain the origin of the name of Teplyk. The most widespread and ancient belief is that Teplyk got its name from the natural conditions of the region (warm in Ukrainian is теплий - tepliy). This is according to a number of written sources in Polish and Russian. Another version of the name origin is that it comes from the small river the village sits on: Teplychka. There were times when Teplik had a second name - Smilhorod. It is believed that this name came from the courage and resilience of the residence residents who defended their village from enemies and attackers. The ancient settlement of Teplik was small, it occupied only a triangular piece of land formed by the surrounding streams. They merge in the valley 300 meters from the hill on which the center of Teplik sits. Located at the crossroads of trade routes, Teplik from the 17th to 19th centuries became a significant commercial and manufacturing point. The 300th anniversary of Teplyk was already met in the Russian Empire. The unfading glory of the Teplyk residents continued when they defended themselves in the fight against the Nazi invaders. Over 600 residents and natives went to the front. Over 5000 of them gave their lives in the name of victory and more than 7000 soldiers were later awarded military honors. During the post-war renewal of the city, new enterprises (particularly specializing in agriculture) built new factory buildings, consumer services, the District Council, the Department of the Interior, a city newspaper, a district print shop, hospital, school, State Tax Inspectorate, Palace of Culture and libraries. Over the past 20 years, more factories and commercial shops have appeared.

Screenings is an international television (TV) market that developed independently. Over the years it was adapted to the needs of the TV industry without the benefit of central organization. Nowadays it attracts some 1,500 top-level TV program buyers from 70 countries who travel to Los Angeles in the month of May to screen (mostly at the major studios) the U.S. TV networks’ new season. In terms of business, the blue Christmas L.A. Screenings represent an estimated 60% of the studios' annual revenues. The name “L.A. Screenings” was given by VideoAge’s Dom (Domenico) Serafini. Before that, they were called “The May Screenings” and, earlier, simply “the screenings”. History The Screenings are a byproduct of a unique blue Christmas development in the U.S. TV industry. In 1962, ABC — then the weakest network — came up with the idea of premiering all of its programs in a single week following the Labor Day holiday (the first Monday in September). CBS and NBC followed suit and by the mid ’60s, the new TV season's screenings were a major national event, marking the end of summer. The fall debut of new season programs helped to create the Upfronts in New York City by requiring advertiser commitments by the spring. Therefore the pilots had to be produced in L.A. by February. In 1963, Canadian broadcasters began traveling to Los Angeles yearly every February to view, and possibly purchase, the Canadian broadcast rights for new American shows. Canadians decided to screen the U.S. TV networks’ new programs after privately owned CTV was established in 1961. Previously, public network CBC had been the only broadcaster, and distributors went to them and not the other way around. CTV went to L.A. with its top executives and representatives of affiliate stations. The total party numbered 10 people, who all stayed at the Beverly Hills Hotel. Representatives of both CBC and CTV stayed in L.A. for up to 10 days. ABC's Management present at the screenings 1968 In February 1964, Jack Singer, at ABC International and Michael J. Solomon of MCA (Now NBCUniversal) invited Latin American distributors to the still informal \\"screenings\\". Singer was responsible for programming the many TV stations that ABC owned overseas and reported to Don Coyle, president of ABC International. Solomon asked Singer if he could invite the managers of the 10 or so TV stations that ABC owned in Latin America to the MCA studios in Los Angeles to screen and buy, on the spot, the new shows that MCA was producing mainly for ABC, but also for other U.S. TV networks. The ABC delegation to the 1970 screenings British broadcasters BBC and ITV participated at the screenings for the first time in 1967. Soon, Australians followed, and Japan participated for the first time in 1972. In 1978 it was moved to the month of May. The reason for this was due to the December 1978 AFTRA and SAG union strikes that delayed the new season. However, prior to 1978 the Screenings moved around the months of February, March (1968, 1970, 1971), March–April (1972, 1973) and April (1974). The screening dates were set when the pilots were ready to screen. At one point, it lasted four weeks, with the Canadians and Europeans the first groups to go (as early as May 28 in 1991), followed by the Latins (May 31), the Pan-Pacific territories (June 3) and South Africa ending on June 27. International buyers at the MCA studios at the 1972 screenings The event would only begin to be called the L.A. Screenings in 1983, when the trade publication VideoAge International began calling it that, and the name is now accepted worldwide. Present screenings As of 2013, the L.A. Screenings is an annual television industry event that takes place yearly from May 16 to May 22. Over the course of the Screenings, American television broadcasters show (\\"screen\\") the pilot episodes of the shows that will premiere next season in front of international television distributors, with the aim of selling the international broadcast and/or distribution rights for these shows. The event takes place over the course of several days in the Century Plaza Hotel in Century City, a neighborhood of Los Angeles. The L.A. Screenings are the most important event for the global television industry. See also * References * VideoAge International LA Screenings * L.A.

Netter M.D. School of Medicine at Quinnipiac University, also known colloquially as Quinnipiac Medical School, or simply \\"Netter,\\" is a medical school located in North Haven, Connecticut. Established in 2010 (and welcoming its first class in 2013), it is one of the newest medical schools in the United States. Establishment The Frank H. Netter M.D. School of Medicine was established in 2010 with a $100 million investment from the family of Frank H. Netter, the renowned surgeon and medical illustrator. It received preliminary accreditation from the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), preliminary accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME), and full accreditation from the Connecticut State Board of Education in 2012. It welcomed its first class in 2013. As of February 2017, the school of medicine received full accreditation from the LCME. Netter is one of about a dozen new medical schools established in anticipation of increased demand for medical professionals following the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the aging of the baby boomer generation. It is notable for its commitment to primary care, stating that it hopes 50% of its graduates will go into primary care positions. By contrast, other medical schools graduate an average of 20% of their doctors into primary care positions. It has even been called a \\"magnet school for primary care\\". For the class of 2019, there were 7,556 applicants for 91 spots. For matriculants, the mean MCAT score was 32.48, the mean total GPA was 3.62, and the mean age was 24. The estimated annual budget for a student is $73,141, which is comparable to other medical schools. The school currently offers a Primary Care Fellowship provided that the student commits to four years of primary care practice following residency. There is also a Prematriculation Program during the summer for students who may need some extra preparation before beginning medical school. The school does not currently offer a Joint Admissions program for incoming QU Freshman classes. Curriculum Students participate in the longitudinal Medical Student Home (MeSH) program starting in their first semester, working one half-day each week in the offices of primary care doctors throughout their first three years of medical school. Students spend their third and fourth years rotating through internships in various departments at St. Vincent's and other affiliated hospitals (such as MidState Medical Center and Middlesex Hospital Connecticut). Quinnipiac completed its own 145,000 square foot medical facility on March 1, 2013. The Medical School facility is located adjacent to the facilities for the Schools of Health Sciences and Nursing, and students of all three schools are expected to interact frequently with each other through classes and the Center for Interprofessional Healthcare Education. Throughout the entire medical school experience, each student pursues a capstone project in one of the following fields: # Global, public, and community health # Health policy and advocacy # Health management and leadership # Health communication # Medical education # Translational, clinical, and basic science research # Medical humanities # Interdisciplinary Medicine # Self-designed References Category:Hamden, Connecticut Category:Universities and colleges in New Haven County, Connecticut Category:Quinnipiac University Category:Medical schools in Connecticut ","title":"Frank H.

Genevieve Township in Ste. Genevieve County, Missouri, United States. New Bourbon is located approximately two and one-half miles south of Ste. Genevieve. Etymology New Bourbon, originally called Nouvelle Bourbon, was named in honor of the sovereign of Spain, Charles IV (1788-1819), of the Spanish branch of the House of Bourbon, State Historical Society of Missouri http://shs.umsystem.edu/manuscripts/ramsay/ramsay_sainte_genevieve.html and would memorialize the executed Bourbon king of France, Louis XVI.  History  The village of Nouvelle Bourbon was established in 1793 by order of Baron Carondelet, Governor of the colony of Upper Louisiana \\"to put the new settlement under the special protection of the august sovereign who governs Spain, and also that the descendants of the new colonists may imitate the fidelity and firmness of their of their fathers toward their king.\\" The sovereign who reigned over Spain, and thus Upper Louisiana, in 1793 was Charles IV, House of Bourbon. The purpose of the settlement was to establish a number of French royalist families who had settled at Gallipolis in southeastern Ohio, but had become dissatisfied there. Pierre de Hault de Lassus de Luzière, belonging to a rich landed aristocracy in Hainault in Flanders, was appointed the first civil and military commandant when he arrived there in August, 1793. The village was originally known as the \\"Village des Petites Cotes\\" (French: village of little hills or slopes), because of the bluffs rolled back from the river rather than rising abruptly from it. Later the English form of Nouvelle Bourbon, New Bourbon, was used. New Bourbon also became home to French nobility who had fled France following the French Revolution. Among the distinguished residents was Jean Rene Guiho, lord of Klegand, a native of Nantes, Brittany. He was invited by Chevalier de Luzière to take up his residence in the village, and was given a grant of 500 arpents on the Saline river. The colony of Upper Louisiana on the west bank of the Mississippi River was divided into two districts: the Ste. Genevieve District and New Bourbon District, with each headed by its own commandant. The village of New Bourbon served as the seat of the New Bourbon District. In 1793 François Vallé erected a mill on the creek now called Dodge’s Creek. Today little remains of the community that once played such an important role in the French colony of Upper Louisiana. Layout New Bourbon was a planned tripartite (three-part) French village, divided into three sections, with the village at the core of the settlement containing square lots called a terrain or an emplacement which typically contained a residence, a household garden, a small orchard and barnyard animals, a barn (grange) for grain, a cabin (cabane) or shed (appenti) for corn, and perhaps a slave cabin and a horse and cow milking stable. This lot would usually be closed off with a stone or wooden fence. At the core of the village was a Catholic church and an open public space place for assembly. The village would have been surrounded by a commons referred to as a parc or parque, common fields referred to as champs or terres cultivées, and the royal domains or domaine royale beyond these areas. The commons (parc) served as a multi-use piece of land, and would be used to provide herbage for cattle, wood for fuel and fencing, and berries and fruit. The common fields were divided into long, narrow strips champs en long (long lots) which were a few arpents wide and roughly 40 arpents long, and were used to raise wheat, corn and oats. After the harvest, these champs would be used to graze cattle and horses, with their manure acting as a means to fertilize the fields. The royal domains functioned as a commons for general use as the inhabitants deemed fit.  Population  New Bourbon had a population of 270 in the year 1800, but the population began to shrink shortly afterwards, with 210 residents in 1804, roughly 100 inhabitants in 1807, and only around 40 being recorded in the years between 1815 and 1830.

He also won the university amateur middleweight boxing championship. Career Following his graduation from Oxford, Cobbett was admitted as a student at Gray's Inn on 4 May 1875. On 18 November 1878, he was called to the bar; but, instead of practising law and despite having chambers at 4 King's Bench Walk Temple, Cobbett tutored at Oxford and in London. On 3 February 1890, Cobbett was appointed the inaugural Challis Chair of Law of the University of Sydney Faculty of Law. From September, he was an ex officio member of the University of Sydney Senate. He also became the Chairman of the Professorial Board of the University of Sydney. =Sydney Law School= In 1891, Cobbett became the first University of Sydney Faculty of Law Dean of Law. Cobbett lectured extensively, in jurisprudence, Roman law, constitutional law, and international law. Following the University's cost-cutting after financial difficulties in 1893, Cobbett also lectured in property law. =Later career= After his retirement from the University of Sydney Faculty of Law, Cobbett relocated to Hobart, where he worked on a book, to be titled The Government of Australia, dealing with the Constitution of Australia. Before it was ready for publication, however, Cobbett died of cancer at his home in Holebrook Place (now Davey Street) on 17 October 1919, and was buried in the Anglican section of Cornelian Bay cemetery.

A graduate of Yale University, Peter founded a shipping business that traded with the West Indies, served in the Revolutionary War, served as Connecticut State Treasurer from 1790 to 1794, and went on to help found Paterson, New Jersey. In 1793, he became the superintendent of the S.U.M., replacing Pierre L'Enfant, and later settled in Paterson. Roswell Colt was born on July 20, 1779. In 1811, Roswell married Margaret Oliver (1790-1856), herself the heiress to a shipping fortune. In 1814, he took the post that was once his father's -- governor of the S.U.M. -- a job he would hold until 1850. He was a director of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and, after he bought 3,000 shares of the Baltimore and Port Deposit Railroad in 1835, a director of the B&PD; as well. In 1838, the B&PD; merged with three other railroads to create the first rail link from Philadelphia to Baltimore. (This main line survives today as part of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor.) Colt's service as a railroad executive is noted on the 1839 Newkirk Viaduct Monument in Philadelphia. Roswell and Margaret had 13 children: Robert Oliver Colt (1812-1885), John Oliver Colt (1813-1858), James Craig Colt (1815-1865), Elizabeth Sarah Colt (1816-1823), Mary Devereux Colt (1817-1884), Roswell Lyman Colt (1821-Unknown), John Craig Colt (1822-1848), Emily Oliver Colt (1825-Unknown), Morgan G.

It contains a single species, Titaniloricus inexpectatovus, described by Gunnar Gad in 2005. It has been collected from the abyssal plain in Angolan waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Etymology The generic name is derived from the Latin words titanis (meaning giant) and titanes (rare), in reference to the relatively large size of the larvae in this genus compared to other Loricifera, and their rarity (the taxon is not known from elsewhere than its type locality). The specific name is derived from the Latin inexspectatus (surprise) and ovum (egg), as the larvae are like chocolate eggs that contain small surprises. Description The type series consists mostly of sixth instar Higgins-larvae. These have are relatively large and have a stubby body. The introvert is retracted, the thorax is long and extendable, with many foldable cuticular plates. The lorica is rounded and barrel-like. When the body is fully extended, the animal is expected to measure more than 800 μm. First instar Higgins-larvae, resembling sixth instar Higgins-larvae but smaller, were found inside the holotype. Also a paedogenetic seventh instar larva, with simplified body, was found inside a sixth instar Higgins-larva. One adult specimen is tentatively ascribed to this species. The lorica is 140 μm in length and 80 μm in width. The total length is assumed to be about 230 μm, that is, less than the sixth instar Higgins-larva. Habitat The type series was collected with a multi-corer from stations at depth. The samples represent the upper 5 cm of the bottom substrate, well-oxygenated mud.

Ra called it, \\"a movie that captures young people's dreams through music.\\" Ji Hyun-woo, Jay Park, Jang Seo-won and Randy Kim play four young men who come from different walks of life to form an idol band, united by their love of music. Though musically talented, they are far from mass-produced pop material, and the movie portrays their rigorous training process under a producer (Park Ye-jin). But a powerful figure in the music industry (Kim Su- ro) tries to interfere with their rise to superstardom. Plot Oh Goo-joo was once a famous producer, but she left the music industry after one of her idol group members died in an accident. One day, she encounters Lee Yoo-jin who was kicked out of an agency called Star Music after years of training to become a singer. Goo-joo believes Yoo-jin could be a star and produces an idol group called Mr. Children. Its members include: the leader Yoo-jin who cares only about singing; dancer Ji-oh who is the one and only person possessing an idol-like air in the band; vocalist Hyun who used to run a karaoke; and rapper Ricky who learned Korean through rapping. They go through intense training under Oh Goo-joo. Soon, the band attracts public attention, and their fans increase exponentially. They become the most famous rookies in K-pop in 2011. But Sa Hee-moon, the Korean music industry tycoon who heads Star Music, regards Mr. Children as a real pain in the neck, and tries everything to make the band break up. Just seven days before the K-pop Festival, Star Music uploads an old video of Yoo-jin in which he shared his disparaging view of K-pop music. The video spreads and rumblings of disbanding are heard. Can Mr. Children survive in this cutthroat music industry and become the idols of the nation?

Direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians began on 29 July 2013 following an attempt by United States Secretary of State John Kerry to restart the peace process. Martin Indyk of the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. was appointed by the US to oversee the negotiations. Indyk served as U.S. ambassador to Israel and assistant secretary of state for Near East affairs during the Clinton administration. Hamas, the Palestinian government in Gaza, rejected Kerry's announcement, stating that Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas has no legitimacy to negotiate in the name of the Palestinian people. The negotiations were scheduled to last up to nine months to reach a final status to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict by mid-2014. The Israeli negotiating team was led by veteran negotiator Justice Minister Tzipi Livni, while the Palestinian delegation was led by Saeb Erekat, also a former negotiator. Negotiations started in Washington, DC and were slated to move to the King David Hotel in Jerusalem and finally to Hebron.Berman, Lazar. (7 August 2013) US peace envoy to come to Israel next week. The Times of Israel. Retrieved on 14 August 2013. A deadline was set for establishing a broad outline for an agreement by 29 April 2014. On the expiry of the deadline, negotiations collapsed, with the US Special Envoy Indyk reportedly assigning blame mainly to Israel, while the US State Department insisting no one side was to blame but that \\"both sides did things that were incredibly unhelpful.\\"AFP, 'US denies dismantling peace negotiators team,' Ynet, 6 May 2014. Pre-peace talk compromises Before the peace talks began, both sides offered concessions. The Palestinian Authority offered to put on hold international recognition as a state by applying to international organizations while Israel offered the release of 104 Palestinian prisoners, 14 of whom are Arab-Israelis and all of whom had been in Israeli jails since before the 1993 Oslo I Accord. The prisoners were responsible for killing, in all, 55 Israeli civilians, 15 Israeli security forces personnel, one French tourist and dozens of suspected Palestinian collaborators. Commenters have however pointed out that Israel had already promised to release these same 104 Palestinians, back in 1999 under the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum, but never did. Critics also worry that Israel will simply quietly re-arrest the potentially released Palestinians, and state that Israel is using the slow release to hold the negotiations hostage and that the main goal of the release is to bolster Israel's image. According to the Sharm el-Sheikh Fact-Finding Committee Report, Israel's decision not to release the prisoners at the time was due to significantly increased violence against Israel by their partner in the memorandum, the PLO, leading up to the Second Intifada. In the time leading up to the planned release, Israel perceived \\"institutionalized anti-Israel, anti-Jewish incitement; the release from detention of terrorists; the failure to control illegal weapons; and the actual conduct of violent operations\\" as a sign that \\"the PLO has explicitly violated its renunciation of terrorism and other acts of violence, thereby significantly eroding trust between the parties.\\" Discussions Over the 9 months period, John Kerry met with the Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas on 34 occasions, and Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu roughly twice as many times.Jodi Rudoren, Isabel Kerschner, ',' The New York Times, 28 April 2014. On 29 July 2013, as Israeli and Palestinian negotiators met for a second day in Washington to discuss renewing peace talks, Mahmoud Abbas said \\"in a final resolution, we would not see the presence of a single Israeli – civilian or soldier – on our lands.\\" His comments drew immediate condemnation from Israeli officials, who accused him for discriminating against Jews. On 13 August, the first day, the Palestinian team leaders were Saeb Erekat and Muhammed Shtayyeh while their Israeli counterparts were Tzipi Livni and Yitzhak Molcho. The US mediators were Martin Indyk and Frank Lowenstein. On 13 August, Israel released the first batch of 26 Palestinian prisoners. On 19 August, Mahmoud Abbas called for the US to step up its involvement in the talks, saying its role should be proactive and not merely supervisory. On 20 August, Israel urged the United States to back Egypt's military government, saying failure to do so would risk derailing the peace talks. On 22 August, Mahmoud Abbas said that no progress had been made in the first four talks. He also said that the Palestinian right of return would likely have to be waived in the event of any peace agreement. He also walked back his earlier statement that he wanted a Palestinian state without a single Israeli; he said that what he meant was no Israelis who were \\"part of the occupation\\", but that he wouldn't have a problem with Jews or Israelis coming to Palestine for business or tourism reasons, as long as they were not an occupying force. On 5 September 2013, Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath said that Israel has yet to put any new offers on the table, that Israel has only allowed Martin Indyk to attend one of the six talks so far, and that the Palestinian leadership would not accept \\"temporary solutions\\", only a permanent peace deal. On 8 September, Israel accused the Palestinians of leaking information about the talks, which are supposed to be kept secret, to the press. An Israeli official also stated that some of the information leaked by Palestinians was not true. On 25 September, both Israel and the Palestinians agreed to intensify peace talks with an increased United States role. On 26 September, Mahmoud Abbas spoke in front of the UN Security Council, and welcomed the resumption of peace talks while at the same time criticizing Israel's settlement building. The Israeli delegation was not present for Abbas' speech, because they were observing the holiday of Sukkot. Hamas and the Islamic Jihad called for a third intifada, and a spokesman for Hamas' armed wing said that the current peace talks were \\"futile\\". On 17 October 2013, Abbas reiterated his view that he would not accept any Israeli military presence on Palestinian territory. On 22 October, Israel and the Palestinians are reported to have discussed the issue of water. On 27 October, Israel prepared to release another round of Palestinian prisoners to create a positive climate for the ongoing peace talks. On 28 October, Netanyahu categorically rejected the Palestinian right of return and said that Jerusalem must remain undivided. On 29 October, the second stage of the Palestinian prisoners' release was completed as 26 prisoners were released. On 6 November, Israeli negotiators said there will not be a state based on the 1967 borders and that the Separation Wall will be a boundary. On 14 November, the Palestinian team quit the negotiations blaming the \\"escalation of settlement-building.\\" On 4 December 2013, Saeb Erekat told John Kerry that the peace talks with Israel were faltering and urged Kerry to salvage them. Also, an Israeli newspaper reported that Israel was prepared to hand 2000 hectares (5000 acres, or 7 sq. mi.) of land to the Palestinians to show that it was prepared to allow Palestinian projects on these lands. The land had been privately owned by Palestinians but militarily occupied by Israel. On 26 December, Likud ministers led by Miri Regev began pushing a bill to annex the Jordan Valley, which would prevent Netanyahu from accepting the American proposal for the Jordan Valley and border crossings into Jordan to be placed under Palestinian control, with border security provided by IDF soldiers and the US. On 30 December, Saeb Erekat said that the peace talks had failed, citing the aforementioned Israeli bill to annex the Jordan Valley. Erekat said that denying the Palestinian state a border with Jordan would be a clear step toward apartheid, and that the PA should instead unilaterally seek international recognition and membership in organizations. Erekat also said that \\"Israel wants to destroy the two-state solution through its daily practices.\\" The PLO senior official also rejected the idea of extending the peace talks beyond their nine-month deadline. On 30 December, Israel released its third set of prisoners, consisting of 26 Palestinian security prisoners. On 1 January 2014, Maariv reported that Israeli and American leaders had been discussing, and seriously considering, the possibility of ceding parts of the Arab Triangle to the Palestinians in exchange for Jewish settlements in the West Bank. The residents of the Triangle would automatically become Palestinian citizens if this happened. This idea is similar to the Lieberman Plan. Rami Hamdallah also said that despite Erekat's insistence that the talks had failed, the Palestinians would continue participating in the talks until the April deadline. On 5 January, hardliners in Netanyahu's coalition threatened to withdraw from the government if he accepted the 1967 borders as a baseline for talks. Dovish opposition parties, such as Labor, said they would join if this occurred, in order to prevent the coalition from breaking up completely. On 9 January, according to insiders, support for a two-state agreement within the Knesset stood at 85 in favor to 35 opposed. In addition to the Labor Party, American negotiators were also attempting to persuade Haredi parties Shas and United Torah Judaism, both of which are generally supportive of the peace process, to join the government to keep negotiations alive. On 10 January 2014, Israel approved plans for 1,400 settler homes. Saeb Erekat responded by saying \\"The recent announcement shows Israel's clear commitment to the destruction of peace efforts and the imposition of an apartheid regime\\". Tzipi Livni, who also opposed new settler homes, was responded by Israeli politician Ze'ev Elkin, who suggested the settlements were vital for Israel's security: \\"The path that Livni recommends means we will have to say goodbye to our security,\\" he said. On 14 January, Israel's defense minister Moshe Ya'alon rejected the negotiations and insulted John Kerry, saying he was acting based upon \\"messianic feeling\\", and that \\"The only thing that can 'save' us is that John Kerry will get a Nobel Peace Prize and leave us alone.\\" Yuval Steinitz, another members of the Likud, expressed general agreement with Ya'alon's views, but disagreed with the personal insult. However, Yaalon later issued an official apology in a written statement sent to media from the Defense Ministry. On 18 January, Israel's finance minister Yair Lapid threatened to take his party, Yesh Atid, out of the coalition if peace talks did not advance. This would have toppled the government and forced either the formation of a new coalition, or early elections. On 21 January 2014, Israel announced plans for 381 new settler homes in the West Bank. The Palestinians condemned this move, and also ruled out the possibility of the peace talks extending beyond the nine-month deadline. On 22 January, Abbas said he would like Russia to take a more active role in the negotiations. On 27 January, the Palestinians said they would not allow \\"a single settler\\" to remain in a Palestinian state, but that this did not stem from anti-Jewish attitudes. Rather, Jews living in the West Bank would have the option of remaining if they renounced their Israeli citizenship and applied to be citizens of Palestine. A poll has shown that 4.5% of Jewish settlers would consider becoming Palestinian citizens under such an arrangement. On 31 January, according to Martin Indyk, the framework for the US-backed Middle East peace deal will allow up to 80 per cent of Jewish settlers to remain in the West Bank. The deal would redraw borders so that some 80 per cent of settlers' homes would be redesignated as being in Israel, while other parcels land would be handed back to Palestinian control in a proposed land-swap deal. Another key point of the framework would be that Israel would be allowed to retain a role in maintaining security along the West Bank's border with neighbouring Jordan. The new security arrangements would see a zone created with hi-tech fences equipped with sensors and drone surveillance planes flying overhead. Also the final peace treaty could also provide compensation for victims on both sides of the historic conflict. On 3 February 2014, Abbas suggests that US-led NATO troops patrol a future Palestinian state instead of Israeli troops having a presence in Jordan Valley, but Israeli settlers and soldiers have five years to leave Palestine once the state is formed. On 6 February, Israel reportedly sought to annex 10 percent of the West Bank, but Palestinian negotiators insisted that they keep at least 97 percent.:'that Israel is seeking to annex about 10 percent of the West Bank’s land area in a final deal. Meanwhile, the Palestinians are seeking to have Israel annex only around 3% of the West Bank.' On 9 February, ministers voted down a proposal by Likud legislator Miri Regev to annex certain West Bank settlements and the roads leading to them. During the course of negotiations, Netanyahu followed the precedent of Israel's former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and made recognition of Israel as a Jewish state a requirement for peace. Some news sources falsely reported that Netanyahu was the first Israeli Prime Minister to make such a requirement.'Arab League, Abbas reject recognizing Israel as 'Jewish state,' Reuters, 9 March 2014. Urging Abbas to recognize Israel as the Jewish-nation state, he reportedly said: > 'it's time for the Palestinians to stop denying history. Just as Israel is > prepared to recognize a Palestinian state, the Palestinian leadership must > be prepared to recognize the Jewish state. In doing so you will tell your > people that, though we have a territorial dispute, Israel's right to exist > is beyond dispute. You would finally make it clear that you are truly > prepared to end the conflict.\\"Netanyahu: Israel prepared to make peace, but > Abbas must recognize Jewish state Haaretz 4 March 2014 To that end, he announced his intention to introduce such a definition of Israel in a Basic Law. The proposed law would be in addition to Israel's declaration of independence of May 1948 which defines Israel as a Jewish state. Justice Minister Tzipi Livni expressed concern over the proposal. Although she was in favor of defining Israel more clearly in law as \\"the national home of the Jewish people and a democratic state\\", she has expressed opposition to \\"any law that gives superiority\\" to the Jewish nature of state over the country's democratic values.

The Israeli proposal conditioned the release of the fourth tranche of 26 Palestinian prisoners on an extension of the negotiations beyond the current deadline of 29 April and included the release about 400 low-profile Palestinian prisoners, as well as the 26 high- profile prisoners, including 14 Israeli Arabs. It excluded the high-profile prisoners Marwan Barghouti and Ahmad Saadat who Israel categorically refused to release. Israel also offered to put an unofficial freeze on most settlement construction outside of East Jerusalem for the next eight months. Israel said it would resolve the status of family reunification requests submitted by some 5,000 families in the West Bank and Gaza. According to Israeli officials, the United States would release Jonathan Pollard as a concession to Israel. On 23 April 2014, The Jerusalem Post reported that Abbas listed 3 conditions for extending peace talks beyond the 29 April deadline; that the borders of a future Palestinian state be dealt with during the first three months of the extended talks, a complete freeze on all settlement construction, and the release without deportation of the fourth batch of Palestinian prisoners, including Israeli-Arabs. 2014 Fatah–Hamas Reconciliation Israel reacted angrily to the Fatah–Hamas Gaza Agreement of 23 April 2014 whose main purpose was reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas, the formation of a Palestinian unity government and the holding of new elections.

Translated by Miriam Argaman Break-down of the talks and post- mortem assessments On 2 May 2014, the Hebrew daily Yedioth Ahronoth, cited an anonymous senior American official as placing the blame for the break-down in talks mainly on Israel's settlement stance, directly quoting the remark: 'Netanyahu did not move more than an inch.\\" Israeli sources in Jerusalem later reported that the remarks came from the US Special Envoy Indyk himself, who was reportedly preparing to hand in his resignation.Barak Ravid, 'U.S. envoy Indyk likely to resign amid talks blowup,' Haaretz, 4 May 2014 Whoever the source of the comment, the White House cleared the interview in which the remarks were made.Mark Landler, 'Mideast Peace Effort Pauses to Let Failure Sink In,' The New York Times 15, May 2014. In this the officials appeared to be referring to the Israeli government announcement of a record 14,000 new settlement housing units.\\"Israel Authorizes Record Amount of West Bank Land for Settlement Construction,\\" Haaretz, 29 April 2014'Inside the Talks' Failure: US Officials Open up,' Ynet 2 May 2014. Mark Landler has written that the remark attributed to Indyk reflected the President's own views: > Publicly, Mr. Obama has said that both sides bear responsibility for the > latest collapse. But the president believes that more than any other factor, > Israel’s drumbeat of settlement announcements in the West Bank and East > Jerusalem poisoned the atmosphere and doomed any chance of a breakthrough > with the Palestinians. In a talk later given at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, Indyk stated that Netanyahu had shown enough flexibility to come within the zone of an agreement. However, Indyk also stated that Netanyahu was undermined by members of his coalition, who kept making announcements of new settlements. Although Israeli sources insisted that Netanyahu negotiated in good faith.Countering US narrative, some Israeli sources insist PM negotiated sincerely Times of Israel 6 May 2014. In an interview with The New York Times, Indyk further added that his impression was that, 'For Israelis . .(t)The Palestinians have become ghosts,' citing what he felt was the most meaningful personal moment in the talks, when the Palestinian Director of Intelligence, Majid Faraj, told his Israeli counterparts across the table, \\"You just don't see us.\\" He also said that \\"there is so much water under the bridge... the difficulties we faced were far more because of the 20 years of distrust that built up\\".'Indyk: Talks failed due to 'skepticism' between Israelis, Palestinians,' Ynet 4 July 2014. Pope Francis during his three-day pilgrimage to the Middle East, intervened in the collapsed peace process, endorsing the State of Palestine, calling the situation \\"increasingly unacceptable\\" and issuing an invitation to both the Israeli and Palestinian presidents to join in a prayer summit at his home in the Vatican. A meeting was scheduled to that effect for 6 June.Jodi Rudoren, Isabel Kershner, Jim Yardley,'Israeli and Palestinian Leaders to Meet With Pope at Vatican,' The New York Times 25 May 2014. In June 2014, a leaked recording from an unknown date showed that chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat believed the reason Netanyahu entered the peace talks was to build more settlements and disliked how President Mahmoud Abbas had committed to not go to international bodies. However, Israeli national security adviser Joseph Cohen revealed a 65-page document that chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat submitted to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas on 9 March, three weeks before Israel was to release the final batch of Palestinian prisoners. In it, Erekat proposed a strategy for the PA during the final month of negotiations and after 29 April, when the talks were originally scheduled to end before their premature collapse. Erekat recommended applying to join various international conventions, informing the U.S. and Europe that the Palestinians wouldn't extend the talks beyond 29 April, demanding that Israel nevertheless release the final batch of prisoners, intensifying efforts to reconcile with Hamas to thwart what he termed an Israeli effort to sever the West Bank from Gaza politically, and various other diplomatic and public relations moves. Cohen concludes that even while the Palestinians were talking with Washington about the possibility of extending the peace talks, they were actually planning to blow them up, and had been planning to do so even before Abbas met with U.S. President Barack Obama on 17 March.Israel to U.S. and EU: Palestinians deceived Kerry Haaretz 7 May 2014.Letter by Joseph Cohen 22 April 2014. According to Peace Now, during the nine months of peace talks Israel set a new record for settlement expansion at nearly 14,000 newly approved settler homes. Despite freezing settlements was not a precondition to restart peace talks, Palestinian official Nabil Shaath condemned settlement construction, saying \\"the settlement activities have made negotiations worthless.\\" For its part, Israeli spokesman Mark Regev condemned sporadic Palestinian incitement, saying \\"the terrorist attacks against Israelis over the last few days are a direct result of the incitement and hatred propagated in Palestinian schools and media.\\" According to B'Tselem, during this same period forty-five Palestinians and six Israelis were killed.Fatalities after operation Cast Lead B'Tselem Reactions US Secretary of State John Kerry said that if the peace talks failed, there would likely be a third intifada. Despite all efforts of John Kerry, Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas blamed Israel for the lack of progress, saying \\"the problem is with the Israeli side and not with us,\\" In January, a PLO member reported that the US implied a threat to cut all aid to the Palestinian Authority and a future inability to control Israeli settlement expansion if a peace agreement was not reached. EU Ambassador to Israel, Lars Faaborg-Andersen said if peace talks fail, Israel will likely be blamed for the break down. Yair Lapid said that the country could be targeted by an economically costly boycott if peace talks with the Palestinians fail, signalling that concerns about growing international isolation have moved centre stage in Israel's public discourse. Some critics believe that Israel is only trying to \\"put on a show,\\" claiming the Israelis do not seek a peace agreement, but are using these peace talks to further other goals, including improving their image, strengthening their occupation of the West Bank, and decreasing the viability of Palestine as a state free of Israeli occupation. Henry Siegman faults the United States, arguing that it is 'widely seen as the leading obstacle for peace' for its repeated failure to use leverage against Israel, and for failing to impose red lines for an agreement, and leading Israeli leaders to believe no consequences would ensue were Israel to reject American proposals.Henry Siegman Why America is irrelevant to Middle East peacemaking, Haaretz 8 April 2014. Danny Danon stated that the Palestinians failed to make concessions during the negotiations period and that they were only interested in seeing militants released from prison. Netanyahu told Kerry \\"I want peace, but the Palestinians continue to incite, create imaginary crises and avoid the historical decisions necessary for a real peace.\\" Reactions to Israeli settlements approvals Israel was accused by Palestinian officials of trying to sabotage the peace talks by approving nearly 1200 new settlement homes shortly before the negotiations were due to start. Israeli settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev stated that these settlements would \\"remain part of Israel in any possible peace agreements.\\" The British Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt said: \\"We condemn the recent decisions taken by the Israeli authorities to advance plans for 1096 settlement units in the West Bank, and to approve the construction of 63 new units in East Jerusalem. Israeli settlements are illegal under international law, undermine trust and threaten the viability of the two-state solution.\\" On 13 August, Israel approved another 900 settler homes in East Jerusalem in addition to the 1,200 settlements announced on the 10th. On 30 October, Israel stated it would go ahead with plans to build 3,500 more homes for settlers. Netanyahu then said \\"any further settlement construction may stir unnecessary clashes with the international community\\".

History The estate was held by the Bishops of Aberdeen in the 13th century, and passed to the Gordons during the Reformation. The original L-plan tower was constructed in the 16th century, with a round tower added in the 17th century. In 1681 it was purchased by the Rev James Horne, vicar of Elgin. Further extensions were added around 1838. By the mid 19th century it was the property of Sir James Elphinstone, who invested in both the Aberdeen Canal Company and the Great North of Scotland Railway. Elphinstone, who lived at nearby Logie House, represented Portsmouth in the House of Commons between 1857 and 1880. Westhall was later used as an agricultural school, and as a hotel which closed in the 1990s. A period of neglect followed, during which the house was sold several times and was placed on the Buildings at Risk Register for Scotland.

Formation Classically trained pianist Luke Worle is the primary songwriter, and the band began as an arty Dream-Pop bedroom project called \\"Starry Eyed Wonder\\" but quickly changed gears. They recorded their debut EP with producer Sylvia Massy, who has produced records for such bands as Tool, System of a Down, Johnny Cash, Red Hot Chili Peppers and others. The resulting EP, \\"Circle of Wolves\\", was released in the summer of 2011 by the experimental German label Surrism- Phonoethics. In late 2011, the band relocated to Los Angeles and played a series of shows in Hollywood including The Whiskey A Go Go, broadening their appeal and shaping their sound from industrial noise to the 90's alternative rock of Smashing Pumpkins and My Bloody Valentine. Zeros and Kings EP In 2012, Distortion Mirrors finished recording their second EP in Los Angeles. The first single from the \\"Zeros and Kings\\" EP, \\"Death by Love\\" was released by Under the Radar (magazine) to enthusiastic buzz with the band favorably compared to Smashing Pumpkins and Nine Inch Nails. Impose Magazine praised the track, writing \\"Luke Worle and Josiah Brooks further live up to their moniker reflective fuzziness as they prepare their follow up to 2011's suRRism Phonoethics release, Circle of Wolves with precision guided dissonance applied to the infectious vernacular.\\" Shortly thereafter Beats Per Minute (website) premiered the second single, \\"Streets of Fire, Heart of Ice\\" to glowing praise, with writer Joshua Pickard saying \\"Bands like The Smashing Pumpkins and Weezer lay battered alongside the wayside as the duo rushes through their collective influences at a marathon pace.\\". The press has favorably compared the duo, consisting of Worle on synthesizers and lead vocals and Brooks on guitar, to the edgier and grittier alternative rock movement of the 1990s. Spin Magazine gave the 3rd and final single \\"Prom Queen\\" a positive review, with writer Kyle McGovern calling the song \\"a fuzzy hip-shaker that lines quiet-loud dynamics with New Wave glee\\". Impose Magazine's Sjimon Gompers wrote \\"'Prom Queen' takes you back to those awkward dances, where the tiaras are discarded for the superficiality of the pomp and circumstance that most are forced to go and grow through during the so-called, 'time of your life'.\\" Poptimes Magazine has featured \\"Death by Love\\" trending in their popular section for the summer. Beats Per Minute said of Distortion Mirrors that \\"They concoct a dense, viscous amalgamation of their influences and let the sounds bounce off one another in a spiraling display of studio wizardry.\\" Alan Cross wrote that the band \\"showcase their appreciation for such seminal acts as My Bloody Valentine and even Sonic Youth with Brooks’ carefree guitar in the mix\\". Distortion Mirrors digitally released their proper debut LP \\"Zeros and Kings\\" on 13 August via Phoebe Records, LTD and will do a series of mini UK show dates in the Winter of 2014. Jay Abbondanza of Violent Success magazine praised the album, awarding it an 8.8. out of 10 and concluding that \\"I can't wait to see their next reflection\\". Matt Crosslin of Down the Line Zine wrote that the record \\"explores a very interesting tension between dark themes and hope, between dealing with demons and finding redemption\\" The band was nominated for Los Angeles's Deli Magazine's \\"Artist of the Month\\" and won in September 2013. Expanding to a 4 piece in 2015, Distortion Mirrors finished a tour of the United Kingdom. The band released the Lost Tapes EP produced by Elliott Randall in 2016. The band recruited producer Jack Shirley who has produced for Deafheaven among other eclectic wall of sound bands, to produce, engineer and mix their debut LP Silvergirl. The band is preparing for a fall 2019 tour. As of 2019, the band has officially changed their name to Sea Of Orchids with Worle remaining the sole member. Influences The band cite Smashing Pumpkins, Peter Gabriel, My Bloody Valentine, Mogwai, Keith Green, The Beatles, The Ronettes, Phil Spector and Black Sabbath as strong influences in their sound, creative aesthetic and approach to music, both sonically and psychologically. They are strong proponents of synthesizing art and faith. In August 2013, they were featured in BPM Magazine's Q and A \\"On Deck\\" in which they discussed the records that shaped their art, faith and music making perspective.

Early life  Mam was born in Battambang, Cambodia during the Khmer Rouge regime, to Vann Theth Mam and Sok Sann Mam. She is the fifth of seven children and the fourth of four girls. Mam's family was living in Pailin Province when the Khmer Rouge came to power in April 1975. They were evacuated to Battambang Province and her family members immediately divided and forced to labor in separate work camps. Mam and her family attempted to escape the Khmer Rouge camps twelve times, each time failing until the Khmer Rouge fell from power in January 1979, when she and her family finally escaped through forests and landmines to Kao-I-Dang, a refugee camp at the Thai-Cambodian border. Through the passage of the Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act and with the assistance of the International Rescue Committee, Mam and her family resettled in Houston, TX in 1981 before finally relocating to Stockton, CA a city in northern San Joaquin Valley known for its large Cambodian population. In Stockton, Mam's father worked as a caseworker assisting South East Asian refugee youth within the juvenile justice system. Mam's mother continued to support her family as a homemaker, raising seven children. Mam received a full scholarship to attend Yale University. Inspired by her family's history and motivated to learn more about her Cambodian identity, Mam volunteered at the Yale Cambodian Genocide Program with Professor Ben Kiernan, who became her senior thesis advisor. In summer 1998, Mam returned to Cambodia for the first time since she and her family fled the country seventeen years earlier. Mam spent the summer as a research intern at the Documentation Center of Cambodia, led by Executive Director Youk Chhang, and interviewed subjects throughout Cambodia for her senior thesis on \\"The Endurance of the Cambodian Family Under the Khmer Rouge Regime.\\" The paper was published in an anthology Genocide in Cambodia and Rwanda: New Perspectives. After graduating from Yale, Mam received a Charles P. Howland Fellowship to conduct research on \\"Crimes Committed Against Women During the Khmer Rouge Regime\\". Interviews gathered from her research are currently being used in the Cambodian Tribunal to try the most responsible leaders of the Khmer Rouge.Legal career Mam went on to study law at UCLA School of Law, with a special focus on immigration and refugee law. During law school, Mam worked with International Bridges to Justice at the National Legal Aid Center in Beijing, China, the Refugee Law Clinic at the University of Witswatersand in Johannesburg, South Africa, and the Asian Pacific American Legal Center, where she assisted immigrant victims of domestic violence file for permanent residence status in the United States under the Violence Against Women Act. After graduating from law school, she worked for two years with a legal consulting firm in Maputo, Mozambique and then spent six months working with USAID and the Ministry of Justice (Iraq). While working in Iraq, Mam secretly conducted interviews of her Iraqi colleagues in her bedroom and documented their life stories under the Saddam Hussein regime, the Sanctions against Iraq.  Film career  Inspired by her work in Iraq and the plight of her Iraqi colleagues who were seeking refugee status abroad, Mam partnered with David Mendez to produce a documentary short about the dreams and struggles of three young Iraqi refugee artists living in Syria, Jordan, and Egypt. The documentary won Best Directing-Short Documentary at the Los Angeles International Film Festival and a prize for Artistic Merit at the Montana CINE International Film Festival, and was an official selection at the St. Louis International Film Festival. However, Kalyanee Mam is best known for directing and producing award-winning documentary A River Changes Course, which explores the damage rapid development has wrought in her native Cambodia on both a human and environmental level. Mam was first inspired to make the film when traveling to Cambodia in October 2008, exactly ten years after her first trip to Cambodia. She noticed a dramatic change in the country's landscape – many of the forests she had traveled to before had been cut down and replaced with rubber plantations, huge lakes in Phnom Penh were dredged and filled with sand to accommodate condominiums and business infrastructure projects, and hundreds of garment factories sprouted outside the city where once were rice fields and towering palm trees. On this trip, Mam also first met Sari Math, who recounted the story of his family and their struggle to survive in a fishing village on the Tonle Sap. During this first meeting, Mam knew she wanted to tell Sari's story and the story of other Cambodians impacted by development. A River Changes Course premiered at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival on January 21, 2013. The film is currently screening at top festivals including The San Francisco International Film Festival, Full Frame Documentary Film Festivall, Seattle International Film Festival, The Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival, Environmental Film Festival in the Nation's Capital, Environmental Film Festival at Yale, RiverRun International Film Festival, Atlanta Film Festival, Nashville Film Festival, Green Film Festival in Seoul, Docville International Documentary Film Festival, Lincoln Film Society - Season Of Cambodia, The Museum of Modern Art ContlmporAsian Film Program, Sydney Film Festival, Biografilm Festival, Jerusalem Film Festival, DocFest Munich, and many more prior to theatrical release in October 2013 and broadcasts worldwide. Mam is also known for her work with director Charles Ferguson as Cinematographer, Associate Producer, and Researcher for 2011 Academy Award-winning documentary Inside Job, a Sony Pictures Classics release about the global financial crisis, hailed as a \\"masterpiece of investigative non-fiction moviemaking\\" and which premiered at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival..

Léon Bakst designed the sets and costumes. The ballet was a failure at the premiere in Paris, on 13 May 1912 at the Théâtre du Châtelet. Le Dieu bleu was staged three times in Paris in 1912, three times in London in 1913, and revived in London in April 2011 with music cobbled together from the works of Scriabin and with choreography by Wayne Eagling. The revival was not a success.  Background  Ballet impresario and producer Sergei Diaghilev staged two exotic ballets for the Ballets Russes: Cléopâtre in 1909 and Scheherazade in 1910, both great successes with the Parisian public. He hoped that Le Dieu bleu (another exotic ballet) would be equally successful. It was one of six new ballets for the 1911 Ballets Russes season. The others were Narcisse, La Peri, Le Spectre de la rose, Sadko, and Petrushka. Michel Fokine choreographed all of them, while Léon Bakst designed the sets and costumes for the first four. When Fokine and Bakst started work on Ida Rubinstein's ballet, Le Martyre de Saint Sébastien, Diaghilev felt betrayed. He pushed Dieu forward to 1912 although he lost interest in the ballet and spent huge amounts of money on the production in the hope that Dieu would make Vaslav Nijinsky a great international star. Fokine started work on Dieu in St. Petersburg in the winter of 1911–1912. He based some of his ideas for the ballet on the dances of the Royal Siamese Court ballet. This company had danced in St. Petersburg in 1900. Fokine also studied the arts of India, but in the end his dances for Dieu were uninspired and dull. Hahn's music could have been the reason, as it was not very good. Prince Lieven, a critic and historian of the Ballets Russes, said the music had no interest or importance but only that it was \\"sweet and insipid.\\" Bakst based his ideas for the sets and costumes on the posters and printed materials for the Cambodian Ballet's 1906 productions in France.  Premiere  The ballet was first presented by Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in Paris at the Théâtre du Châtelet on 13 May 1912, coupled with another ballet, Thamar. Both ballets were failures. Diaghilev was shocked by the failure of Thamar. He thought it would be another success like Scheherazade. He was not surprised that Dieu was a failure and privately blamed Hahn's music for it. He was forced to use it because Hahn had rich friends in Paris, who would have cut their support of the Ballets Russes if the music had been rejected. The ballet was created for Nijinsky, who had yet to dance an important part for the Ballets Russes. He was cast in the lead role. Other dancers in the ballet were Max Frohman as The Young Man, Tamara Karsavina as The Young Girl, Lydia Nelidova as The Goddess, and Michel Federov as The High Priest. Nijinsky's sister Bronislava Nijinska was cast as The Drunken Temple Dancer.  Plot  Bakst The curtain rises on a warm evening in India, centuries in the past. In front of a rock temple, a pool is seen with a lotus on the surface of the water. Snakes, tortoises, and other animals rest near the pool. The temple walls are covered with masses of flowering plants. A crowd is waiting for a ceremony to begin. The Young Man is about to become a priest of the temple. The Young Girl runs in and kneels at his feet. She does not want him to desert her for the priesthood and dances before him. The priests are shocked and lead The Young Man away while The Young Girl is prepared for death. The gates are shut. The Young Girl tries to escape, but monsters rise from a place beneath a trap door. The Goddess rises from the lotus. The Blue God rises from the pool, and calms the monsters with his flute. The monsters are trapped by the masses of plants. The Blue God's work is done. The priests enter. They are surprised to see The Young Girl still alive and fall on their knees before her. The Young Man rejoins The Young Girl. The Goddess orders a golden staircase to descend from the heavens. The Blue God flies up the staircase and disappears into the clouds.  Reception  Bakst's costume design for The Blue God Diaghilev hoped that Dieu would be a great success. Critics thought Nijinsky posed more than he danced. What they liked the most about the ballet was Bakst's sets and costumes. Valery Svetlov wrote in the Mercure de France on 15 May 1912 that Dieu was \\"a failure in every sense of the word.\\"Quoted in  Notes   References   *  Further reading   * Category:Ballets by Michel Fokine Category:Ballets designed by Léon Bakst Category:Ballets Russes productions Category:1912 ballet premieres ","title":"Le Dieu bleu"},{"id":"40100302","text":"Front page of Urana Independent and Clear Hills Standard on 14 March 1913 The Urana Independent and Clear Hills Standard was a weekly newspaper published in Urana, New South Wales, Australia from 1906 until 1921.

Background Aresti was in a metal band called Demonax before joining Fates Warning. His first appearance was during the tour of 1985, promoting the album The Spectre Within. The following year, he became an official member of the band. He co-wrote \\"Giant's Lore (Heart of Winter)\\" along with John Arch. During the following albums, Aresti wrote lyrics to various songs on Fates Warning's albums. On the No Exit album, he was the primary lyricist for three songs: \\"Anarchy Divine\\", \\"In a Word\\" and \\"Shades of Heavenly Death\\". On the Perfect Symmetry album, he wrote lyrics to three songs: \\"Static Acts\\", \\"A World Apart\\" and \\"The Arena\\". He also co-wrote \\"At Fate's Hands\\" along with Matheos and bassist Joe DiBiase. Between 1991–1994, Aresti only wrote one song which was \\"The Strand\\" on the Inside Out (1994) album. After a year and a half from the release of the album and the compilation Chasing Time, Aresti left the band. Aresti has kept a very low profile throughout the years since his departure. During this time, Aresti began experimenting with other genres such as industrial music and electronic. During the early 2000s, Aresti began recording and producing material for a band he would create under a program called audio computing. His creation would be Dragonspoon, which he released as an album in 2002, the instruments in the album are all by the programming software except the guitar parts. Since 2003, Aresti came back to Fates Warning but as a touring guitarist only, not an official member of the band. In 2005, he played guitar on one song from Icarus Witch's album Capture the Magic. In 2011, Aresti along with Fates' members Matheos and Joey Vera would reunite with John Arch to form the band Arch/Matheos. They released their self-titled album the same year. Aresti would become a full-time member once more of Fates Warning in 2005 and remained so until 2016. Fates Warning released their eleventh studio album Darkness in a Different Light in September 2013, and was their first one with Aresti on guitar since Inside Out (1994). For the 2014 tour, Aresti would not participate until an unknown date due to personal activities which would not permit him to tour. He left the band in 2016 though he remains \\"part of the Fates Warning extended family\\", and is still expected to contribute as a session member on future albums.

A Plaquemine culture platform mound is located there, once known as the Selsertown Mound but currently known as Emerald Mound. The mound is in height, with two secondary mounds at either end of its summit that rise even higher. It once had a total of six to eight mounds on its summit but only the two on the ends have survived. It covers . It was described as being of \\"extraordinary size\\" in the 1848 book Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley and it is the second-largest Pre-Columbian earthwork in the United States, after Monk's Mound at Cahokia, Illinois. The mound dates from the period between 1200 and 1730 CE and is the type site for the Emerald Phase (1500 to 1680 CE) of the Natchez Bluffs Plaquemine culture chronology. It was still in use by their descendants, the historic era Natchez people, as their main ceremonial center. Emerald was abandoned by the time of the French colonial period, and the hereditary chief of the Natchez had his capital at the nearby Grand Village Site.http://www.natchezbelle.org/adams- ind/emerald.htm This settlement was one of the last active expressions of the platform mound building culture along the Mississippi River. Selsertown was the third stop on the Old Natchez Road. Beginning in Natchez, the road traveled northeast through Washington, Selsertown, Uniontown, and many other communities until it ended in Nashville, Tennessee. The United States required jurisdictions through which the Trace passed to commit to development of a tavern or inn every six miles on the trace. George Selser built an inn at this site, which opened in 1780. John McCullum eventually became the owner of the inn. A sign outside of the inn, while owned by McCullum, read \\"Intertainment for Man and Baste.\\" The inn caught fire and was destroyed during the American Civil War.

An enrolled member of the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma, Baldwin has served as a member of the cultural resource advisory committee of the Miami Tribe.  Education  Baldwin received a B.S in 1996 and a M.A in 1999 from the University of Montana with a master's degree in arts with emphasis in Native American linguistics and is now the director of the Myaamia Center at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. The center works to revitalize endangered languages. His devotion to the work of language revitalization led to the creation of the Myaamia Center at Miami University and his appointment as the director and was chosen in 2016 as a MacArthur Foundation Fellow. Baldwin seeks to revitalize languages for the people of the community, language and cultural revitalization. After reading a draft of David Costa's thesis on the Miami-Illinois language, Baldwin realized he would need training in linguistics to not only understand Costa's work but also work to revitalize his own language and to teach it to others. The realization led Baldwin to apply for a graduate degree at the University of Montana. Since 1996, Baldwin began to teach himself and his family and four children the Miami language. Baldwin also learned through studies held by the Smithsonian's National Anthropological Archives.  Linguistic work  Baldwin works with Myaamia people developing culture and language-based educational materials and programs for the community. Baldwin has taught and raised his four children as native speakers of Myaamia and continues to teach others as assistant educational leadership professor. Much of Baldwin's work has been collaborative, contributing to edited collections and journal articles, and he also works with other linguists such as Leanne Hinton's National Breath of Life project, a two-week biennial gathering of linguists sharing, finding and utilizing linguistic archival sources.

It opened in 1925 with seating for approximately 3,500. It was built to hold the entire university population and was once the location of major university assemblies.http://www.lsu.edu/visitors/images/thingstodo.pdf History The theatre was built into a hill as a natural amphitheater and used for convocations, rallies, pageants and commencement exercises. In the early 1930s, the area behind the theatre was cleared and gardens were installed. The area was named the \\"Sunken Gardens\\" and was landscaped with shrubs and used existing trees for cover. A reflecting pool was also installed. The pool was 150 ft. long, 30 ft. wide and 2 ft. deep with an 8 ft. high statue of Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto located at the far end of the pool.http://batonrougetimetravel.wordpress.com/2011/04/11/greek-amphitheater- with-sunken-garden-lsu-campus/ During Huey P. Long's reign as Governor of Louisiana, if he had an announcement for the entire student body, a large gong on campus would signal everyone on campus to rush to the Greek Theatre to hear the governor. One such announcement in 1934 was to inform the student body that he had secured several trains at a reduced fare to carry the entire student body to the Tigers away football game at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. He gave $7 to any student in need and accepted IOU's for the amount. Eventually, Governor Long ran out of money and he asked LSU President Jimmie Smith to pay for the remaining students.http://www.hueylong.com/programs/louisiana-state-university.php Initially, the Illinois Central Railroad did not agree to the reduced fare. Governor Long then used his influence to \\"entice\\" the passenger agents of the railroad to give the students a reduced fare. He did this by threatening to reassess the value of the railroad bridges in the state from $100,000 to $4 million and the railroad agreed to the new fare.(2013), LSU Tigers Football media guide In 1960 the theatre was still in use, but the reflecting pool was filled-in and replaced with a \\"formal garden\\". Ironically, the statue of de Soto was destroyed and thrown into the Mississippi River; the same fate as the Spanish discoverer. Over time, the side entrances to the \\"formal garden\\" were blocked, so in the 1970s the area became known as the \\"Enchanted Forest\\" as it became more secluded due to its lack of access.http://batonrougetimetravel.wordpress.com/2011/04/11/greek- amphitheater-with-sunken-garden-lsu-campus/ Current usage During the late 1990s and early 2000s the area where the \\"sunken gardens\\", \\"formal garden\\" and \\"enchanted forest\\" were located was cleared of excess trees, overgrowth and obstructions and is now an open, tree shaded area. The theatre is still used today for outdoor concerts, performances, religious ceremonies and a place for students and people to congregate. In the fall of 2020, the LSU Greek Theater received a new tenant, in the form of the LSU Tiger Marching Band. Due to the Coronavirus pandemic, music rehearsals have been required to be outdoors. In August of 2020, the Tiger Marching Band moved into the Greek Theater full time, where they will hold music rehearsals throughout the semester. The Tiger Band's residency at the Greek Theater is set to run for the entirety of the 2020 season. Rehearsals are currently split between the Greek Theater and the Band's outdoor practice field, located on the same property as their main band hall. http://batonrougetimetravel.wordpress.com/2011/04/11/greek-amphitheater- with-sunken-garden-lsu-campus/ Gallery Image:Greek Theatre (Baton Rouge, LA).jpgGreek Theatre (Baton Rouge) Image:Greek Theatre (Baton Rouge) - Stage View.jpgGreek Theatre (Baton Rouge) - Front Stage View Image:Greek Theatre (Baton Rouge, LA) - Side Stage View.jpgGreek Theatre (Baton Rouge) - Side Stage View Image:Greek Theatre (Baton Rouge) - Side View.jpgGreek Theatre (Baton Rouge) - Side View See also *List of music venues *Theater in Louisiana References External links *LSU Greek Theatre and Sunken Gardens Category:Louisiana State University buildings and structures Category:Music venues in Louisiana Category:Theatres in Louisiana Category:Tourist attractions in Baton Rouge, Louisiana Category:University and college theatres in the United States ","title":"Greek Theatre (Baton Rouge)"},{"id":"40100776","text":"Partha Pratim Chakrabarti (Chakraborty) is an Indian computer scientist.

It constitutes a fundamental concept and tool in software visualization, software analytics, and software diagnosis. Its primary applications include risk analysis for and monitoring of code quality, team activity, or software development progress and, generally, improving effectiveness of software engineering with respect to all related artifacts, processes, and stakeholders throughout the software engineering process and software maintenance.  Motivation and concepts  Software maps are applied in the context of software engineering: Complex, long-term software development projects are commonly faced by manifold difficulties such as the friction between completing system features and, at the same time, obtaining a high degree of code quality and software quality to ensure software maintenance of the system in the future. In particular, \\"Maintaining complex software systems tends to be costly because developers spend a significant part of their time with trying to understand the system’s structure and behavior.\\" The key idea of software maps is to cope with that challenge and optimization problems by providing effective communication means to close the communication gap among the various stakeholders and information domains within software development projects and obtaining insights in the sense of information visualization. Software maps take advantage of well- defined cartographic map techniques using the virtual 3D city model metaphor to express the underlying complex, abstract information space. The metaphor is required \\"since software has no physical shape, there is no natural mapping of software to a two-dimensional space\\". Software maps are non-spatial maps that have to convert the hierarchy data and its attributes into a spatial representation.  Applications  Software maps generally allow for comprehensible and effective communication of course, risks, and costs of software development projects to various stakeholders such as management and development teams. They communicate the status of applications and systems currently being developed or further developed to project leaders and management at a glance. \\"A key aspect for this decision making is that software maps provide the structural context required for correct interpretation of these performance indicators\\". As an instrument of communication, software maps act as open, transparent information spaces which enable priorities of code quality and the creation of new functions to be balanced against one another and to decide upon and implement necessary measures to improve the software development process. For example, they facilitate decisions as to where in the code an increase of quality would be beneficial both for speeding up current development activities and for reducing risks of future maintenance problems. Due to their high degree of expressiveness (e.g., information density) and their instantaneous, automated generation, the maps additionally serve to reflect the current status of system and development processes, bridging an essential information gap between management and development teams, improve awareness about the status, and serve as early risk detection instrument.  Contents  Software maps are based on objective information as determined by the KPI driven code analysis as well as by imported information from software repository systems, information from the source codes, or software development tools and programming tools. In particular, software maps are not bound to a specific programming language, modeling language, or software development process model. Software maps use the hierarchy of the software implementation artifacts such as source code files as base to build a tree mapping, i.e., a rectangular area that represents the whole hierarchy, subdividing the area into rectangular sub-areas. A software map, informally speaking, looks similar to a virtual 3D city model, whereby artifacts of the software system appear as virtual, rectangular 3D buildings or towers, which are placed according to their position in the software implementation hierarchy. Software maps can express and combine information about software development, software quality, and system dynamics by mapping that information onto visual variables of the tree map elements such as footprint size, height, color or texture. They can systematically be specified, automatically generated, and organized by templates.  Mapping software system example  Software maps \\"combine thematic information about software development processes (evolution), software quality, structure, and dynamics and display that information in a cartographic manner\\". For example: * The height of a virtual building can be proportional to the complexity of the code unit (e.g., single or combined software metrics). * The ground area of a virtual 3D building can be proportional to the number of lines of code in the module or (e.g., non- comment lines-of-code NCLOC). * The color can express the current development status, i.e., how many developers are changing/editing the code unit. With this exemplary configuration, the software map shows crucial points in the source code with relations to aspects of the software development process. For example, it becomes obvious at a glance what to change in order to: * implement changes quickly; * evaluate quickly the impact of changes in one place on functionality elsewhere; * reduce entanglements that lead to uncontrolled processes in the application; * find errors faster; * discover and eliminate bad programming style. Software maps represent key tools in the scope of automated software diagnosis software diagnostics.  As business intelligence tools and recommendation systems  Software maps can be used, in particular, as analysis and presentation tool of business intelligence systems, specialized in the analysis of software related data. Furthermore, software maps \\"serve as recommendation systems for software engineering\\". Software maps are not limited by software-related information: They can include any hierarchical system information as well, for example, maintenance information about complex technical artifacts.  Visualization techniques  Software maps are investigated in the domain of software visualization. The visualization of software maps is commonly based on tree mapping, \\"a space- filling approach to the visualization of hierarchical information structures\\" or other hierarchy mapping approaches. = Layout algorithms = To construct software maps, different layout approaches are used to generate the basic spatial mapping of components such as: * Tree-map algorithms that initially map the software hierarchy into a recursively nested rectangular area. * Voronoi-map algorithms that initially map the software hierarchy by generating a Voronoi map. = Layout stability = The spatial arrangement computed by layouts such as defined by tree maps strictly depends on the hierarchy. If software maps have to be generated frequently for an evolving or changing system, the usability of software maps is affected by non-stable layouts, that is, minor changes to the hierarchy may cause significant changes to the layout. In contrast to regular Voronoi treemap algorithms, which do not provide deterministic layouts, layout algorithm for Voronoi treemaps can be extended to provides a high degree of layout similarity for varying hierarchies. Similar approaches exist for the tree-map based case.  History  Software maps methods and techniques belong the scientific displine of Software visualization and information visualization. They form a key concept and technique within the fields of software diagnosis. They have applications also in software mining and software analytics. Software maps have been extensively developed and researched by, e.g., at the Hasso Plattner Institute for IT systems engineering, in particular for large-scale, complex IT systems and applications.

In 2013, he was appointed the National Vice President of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha, the youth wing of the Bharatiya Janata Party at 25, making him the youngest Vice President in the history of the party. He was re appointed National Vice President for a second consecutive term in 2017 at 29, retaining his distinction as the youngest Vice President. Madhukeshwar set up the Mumbai Centre for International Arbitration in 2016 and currently serves as its CEO. He was named one of the 50 most influential young Indians for the year 2017 by GQ Magazine. In 2018, Madhukeshwar was named one of the Worlds 100 most influential young Leaders by Apolitical, a global policy platform based in London. His journey was captured in a biographical account along with eight political leaders in the book, 'The Young And the Restless' by author, Gurmehar Kaur, and subsequently in the book, 'India Tomorrow: Conversations with the Next Generation of Political Leaders' by authors, Prof. Pradeep Chhibber and Harsh Shah.

American historian Stephen Cohen describes several political constants in Pakistan's conservatism: respect for tradition, the rule of law and the Islamic religion which is an integral in the idea of Pakistan. The conservative philosophy, principles, ideas, and traditions were first adopted by the Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan as part of his internal policies in 1950. The conservative tradition has played a major role in Pakistani politics, culture, and organized conservative movement has played a key role in politics only since the 1950s. According to the CIA database, approximately ≈95–97% of the Pakistani people are the followers of Islam while the remaining believing in Christianity, Hinduism, and others. The conservatism in Pakistan has been normally associated with the Pakistan Muslim League (PML)– the successor party to the one which was responsible for the founding of Pakistan. Dominant and influential section of the PML is led by its extended PML(N), which is currently led by its leader and the former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, elected in general elections held in 2013. Nonetheless, the conservative vote bank of the country partitioned equally between the PML(N) and the centrist PTI of Imran Khan on the topics mainly concerning the foreign policy, national, and social issues. However, on 28 July 2017, Nawaz Sharif, the current Prime Minister, was in court for corruption and had been disqualified.  Idea of Pakistan, conception, and conservatism  Lord Minto met with the Muslim delegation in June 1906. The Minto-Morley Reforms of 1909 called for separate Muslim electorates. Since the 1930s, the Muslim League had been lobbying and pushing its politics for a separate homeland for the Muslims of India, known as Pakistan. The constitution and principles of the Muslim League were contained in the Green Book, written by conservative thinker and cleric, Maulana Muhammad Ali. Its goals at this stage did not include establishing an independent Muslim state, but rather concentrated on protecting Muslim liberties and rights, promoting understanding between the Muslim community and other Indians, educating the Muslim and Indian community at large on the actions of the government, and discouraging violence. However, several factors over the next thirty years, including sectarian violence, led to a re-evaluation of the Muslim League's aims. With Muhammad Ali Jinnah becoming the President of the Muslim League, the party gradually became the leading representative body of Indian Muslims. A fresh call for a separate state was then made by the famous writer, poet, and philosopher Allama Muhammad Iqbal, who in his presidential address to the 1930 convention of the Muslim League said that he felt that a separate Muslim state was essential in an otherwise Hindu-dominated South Asia. The name was coined by Cambridge student and Muslim nationalist Choudhary Rahmat Ali, and was published on 28 January 1933 in the pamphlet Now or Never. After a long political struggle and party meetings with the people of the North-West India, the British Empire granted the establishment of Pakistan and independence of India; both countries joined the British Commonwealth organization. The Muslim League was not the only conservative movement in the erstwhile region of British India that became Pakistan. Others included the Congress Nationalist Party, the Punjab Unionist Party the Hindu Mahasabha and the Akali Dal. In addition, a number of figures within the Indian National Congress, such as Sardar Vallabhai Patel were conservative. After Jinnah died in 1948, Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan's constitutional policies were directed to work on constitution. On 12 March 1949, Prime Minister Ali Khan had the State parliament passing and promulgating the Objectives Resolution, which ultimately declared Islam as state religion of the country. The main objective of Resolution was the \\"declaration of State's submitting to the democratic faith of Islam and to the sovereignty of God\\". Such resolution was met with great resistance in the state parliament when Law minister J.N. Mandal resigned from his ministry and gave great criticism to Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan. Politicization of Islam in the country further tighten its support when ultra-conservative Clerics passed a \\"demand draft\\", called 22 Points which called for the preparation of constitution according to Objectives Resolution, in 1950. In 1977, the government of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto outlawed alcohol and drugs and changed the weekend from Sunday to Friday, but no substantive Islamic reform program was implemented prior to General Zia-ul- Haq's Islamization program. Starting in February 1979, new penal measures based on Islamic principles of justice went into effect. These carried considerably greater implications for women than for men. A welfare and taxation system based on Zakat and a profit-and-loss banking system were also established in accordance with Islamic prohibitions against usury but were inadequate. =Early foundation of conservatism= 1947–59: Independence and power struggle After the death of Jinnah, Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan successfully authored and passed the Objectives Resolution from the state parliament, roughly declaring Islam as state religion. The idea of Conservatism in Pakistan identifies several constants including the \\"respect for tradition, the rule of law and the Islamic religion.\\" Proponents of right- wing conservatism and nationalist agenda was supported by Prime Minister Ali Khan as part of his internal policies. His conservative policies were met with resistance from the left-wing which was accused of hatching the conspiracy against Ali Khan. In 1979, the religious conservatism and the state-sponsored Islamization became a primary policy of military government of President General Zia-ul-Haq. As an aftermath of 1954 general elections, the conservatism lost its edge in East-Pakistan when communism deeply asserted itself following the victory of Communist Party. The military dictatorships of Ayub Khan and Yahya Khan further limited the conservative platform. During the 1970 general elections, the religious conservative and right-wing conservative parties participated in the election with a direct competition with left- oriented PPP. The Islamic conservative parties successfully pressed PPP's Bhutto to declare Ahmadiyya sect as Non-Muslim domination. The right-wing mass made its notable comeback in a response to nationalization program of Bhutto, and called for right-wing alliance, PNA, against PPP. = National building = 1960–78: Religious right and nationalism In the 1960s, the conservative movements in the country had emphasized Islamic roots and values in the society but ultimately it did not have any lasting effects in an opposition to President Ayub Khan aggressive policies to put the agrarian country into the roads of industrialization. In 1965, the conservative movements prudently went out to gather their support for Fatima Jinnah, sister of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, had initially campaigned on Islamic tradition and promotion of nationalistic society. During the 1965 presidential election, President Ayub Khan used the hard-line Islamic conservative groups to get Fatima Jinnah disqualified from the elections; nonetheless, this scheme failed when the huge public voted for Fatima Jinnah's bid for presidency. It is noted by historians that without the usage of state machinery, President Ayub Khan had almost lost the elections. The religious right was dismayed when President Ayub Khan abrogated his deal with the orthodoxy religious parties, the JeI, in 1966. Its right-wing populism was one of many factor that made the party popular, though it was short-lived. In 1967, the leftist ideas dominated by PPP gained much support from the public. The conservative parties produced a performed poor electoral performance during the general elections held in 1970. Only Pakistan Muslim League (PML) led by Nurul Amin had gained considerable votes from all over the country; the JeI faced with an embarrassing election result winning only 4 out of the 300 seats. After a bitter war with India and the loss of East Pakistan, the conservative movements were seen as the last blow to their vision at that time. The left- oriented PPP initiated a nationalization process to hamper the private- ownership of the industries in the country. In 1973, a violent disturbances instigated by JeI forced the PPP to pass the Second Amendment law to declare Ahmadiyya domination as Non-Muslim. Much of the Constitution was philosophically leaning towards conservative roots and foundations. The JeI lost all of its support during this time, and a new conservative party, Pakistan Muslim League had found its own support provided by influential capitalist thinkers, investors, and wealthy donors who resisted the nationalization program. Although, the JeI was the major contributory of right-wing Pakistan National Alliance (PNA), it was the Pakistan Muslim League who was the most resource party of all. Despite populism and mass financial capital spent in favor of Pakistan National Alliance (PNA), the alliance performed poorly during the general elections held in 1977. A massive civil disobedience acts, right-wing violence and calls for martial law led up to be dismissal of PPP's government in 1977 after a martial law took advance. =Activism and authoritarianism= 1979-1980s: Conservatism ascent President Zia meeting with conservative US president, Ronald Reagan, and his NSA William Clark in 1982. With the successful coup d'état against the left- wing government of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), the modern conservatism movement took over the control of state's affairs under President Zia-ul-Haq. The conservative principles dominated Zia's economic and foreign policies, including the interest-free system and strict opposition to Soviet Communism defining his military administration's political philosophy. President Zia-ul- Haq largely depended on the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) for work and political recommendation for policy guidance issue. On legal philosophical issues, the Federal Shariat Court was greatly espoused and extended its activities at federal level judiciary. President Zia is credited with the success of modern conservatism movement in the country, by his supporters; some galvanizing the Zia's directives prevented the wider Soviet incursions into the region as well as economic prosperity. President Zia's military administration brought a fury of conservative economists; conservative foreign policy practitioners; and social conservatives, who identified with his religious and social ideals. Zia was attacked by left-wing personalities at the time as being a \\"source of fundamentalism\\", but conservative historians asserted that he decisively limited Soviet Union to Afghanistan. In defining the conservatism, President Zia once described to British journalist Ian Stephen that: \\"The basis of Pakistan was Islam. The basis of Pakistan were Muslims in South Asia are a separate culture. It was the Two-Nation Theory that lead to the independence of Pakistan.\\" The university curriculum in the country was upgraded by President Zia-ul-Haq, that includes the teaching of Islamic Studies and Arabic languages courses, which were made compulsory for students to get their degrees in arts and social sciences. The Pakistan Studies were made compulsorily for engineering, medical education, commerce, law and nursing education. Extra educational certificates and diplomas were given to people who were Hafiz. On national priorities, the atomic bomb project was aggressively put forwarded by President Zia-ul-Haq to counter Indian threat on East and Soviet threat on West.

During his eleven years in office, President Zia's conservative reforms and economic policies pushed the country's national economic GDP percent rate reached to 5.88%, surpassing the economic record of President Ayub Khan in the 1960s. The GNP was rated at 6.8%; both rates, the GDP and the GNP, were highest in the world at that time. His policies had hard-hitting impact on Pakistan and some of his economic policies were continued by the successive governments. According to the historians, his policies were directed towards making Pakistan the citadel of Islam so that it could play an honorable and prominent role for the Islamic world. Leftist historians maintained that his legacy remains a most toxic, enduring, and tamper-proof legacy, but to point of view of conservative thinkers, Zia credited by some for preventing wider Soviet incursions into the region as well as economic prosperity. Despite Zia's tough rhetoric and his authoritarianism, the country's society continued to move forward towards the enlightenment, and the sense of moderation. According to the critic of Zia and leftist cultural writer, Nadeem Paracha, further wrote that in 2013 that it was the \\"conservative regime of Zia when the Western 1980's fashion wear and hairstyle was popularized, and the rock music bands that were gaining momentum under his regime. Paracha further wrote that: \\"Ironically, it was these political and economic tensions and pretensions, heavy metal, rock music power plays and the economic prosperity that also propelled the gradual expansion of the country's urban middle and lower-middle-classes. According to the leftist cultural critic, Nadeem F. Paracha: \\"The youth culture at that emerged from these classes that launched the first shots of the kind of pop culture, scene and music we now call modern Pakistani pop and rock.\\" =Moderation and Competition= 1990s–2000s: The New Right and conservative democracy Ahsan Ekbal. After Zia's death in 1988, the left-oriented Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) came in national power through general elections held in 1988. The 1990–2000s is a period of intense and fierce competition between leftist sphere led by Benazir Bhutto and conservative circle led by Nawaz Sharif. Less than two years, the PPP government was dismissed in by the usage of Eighth Amendment in mere two years. In 1990, the conservative mass led by Nawaz Sharif won the general elections; the elections were controversial with judicial inquiries revealing the role of intelligence community playing a vital role in support for Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML(N)) during the 1990 general elections. The Conservatives led by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif came in national prominence for the first time in the history, under a democratic transition. Immediately, the PML(N) government launched privatization and reforms towards the economic liberalization in the country. Key proponents of Sharia was made part of Penal Code in 1993. Islamic values were emphasized as a part of the social conservative reforms by the PML(N) government which support at a mainstream level. In 1997, the PML(N) came back to power with an exclusive mandate during the general election which saw PML(N) struck its overwhelming two-third majority in the parliament for the first time in the history of Pakistan. Despite the confrontation with leftist president Farooq Leghari and liberal Chief Justice, Sajjad Ali in 1997, PML(N) decisively consolidated its authoritative position by appointing the national conservative jurist, Saeeduzzaman Siddiqui, as Chief Justice, and religiously conservative, Rafiq Tarrar, as President in 1997. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in 1998. Upon resolving the authority issue, the PML(N) made notable constitutional reforms towards the constitutional conservatism when the PML(N) government oversaw the passages of thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth amendment in the national assembly, a lower house. Though, the fifteenth amendment failed to passed from the Senate as Prime Minister Sharif never brought the bill to senate. A projection of strong military defence was supported at the mainstream media, finally the conservative PML(N) ordered the activation of country's nuclear testing program in 1998 for the first time in the history of the country. The nuclear testing program authorized by Prime Minister Sharif was used as \\"tit for tat\\" policy in a direct response to Indian nuclear tests in 1998. The nuclear tests in competition with India was highly popular in the country at that time, the conservative PML(N) government had an uttermost public support over that issue. The PML(N) further used its political position after Prime Minister Sharif dismissed the Chairman joint chiefs and chief of army staff, General Jehangir Karamat, marking the perception of civilian control of the military in 1998. The same year, the PML(N) government cancelled the Friday holidays, despite exacerbated concerns of the conservatives. Major education reforms were carried out by PML(N) government, emphasizing on scientific research and religious studies. In 1999, Prime Minister Sharif struck another political achievement after holding the Lahore Summit, in which, his Indian counterpart, Atal Bihari Vajpayee was delegated to Lahore, Punjab, via a Bus service. Despite peace initiatives with India, the PML(N) government lost all its prestige after becoming militarily involved with India in Kargil sector. Despite his authoritative actions, his economic programmes were failed during the period of worldwide economic growth, especially his attempts to exert intense control over the military ultimately led to his undoing. In 1999, the PML(N) government was dismissed by the Chairman joint chiefs General Pervez Musharraf in a bloodless, rather self coup d'état. At the time of staging of coup d'état, the conservatism was at its low support from the public and the support for the PML(N) government and its conservatives programs were largely disapproved by the public. 2010s: Re-defining of New Right and escalations PMLN rally in 2008. By 2000, the conservatism had been its low since the 1960s. Financial problems, economic stagflation, and social tensions had been a contributory factors in lowering of the conservatism and its opposite, the socialism at once. Searching for a new political philosophy, President Pervez Musharraf called for a \\"the Third Way\\" after forming the PML(Q) group, totally hostile towards the Pakistan Muslim League. President Musharraf brought a new generation of liberal thinkers to power in Islamabad. Musharraf pioneered the liberal idea of \\"Enlightened Moderation\\" and launched a successful liberalization programs in the country. After the 9/11 attacks in the United States and launch of the Afghanistan war in 2001 resulted in re-defining moments for the left-wing politics as well as right-wing politics. The 2002 general elections held in 2002 marked the liberals coming into the power, with PML(Q) and MQM forming the government. The religious orthodoxies, under a massive MMA alliance, struck its notable victory in the parliament, securing a considerable number of seats in the parliaments. In 2002, a massive communist party demonstration against the United States and the fierce joint-opposition of PPP and PMLN had politically weakened the government. Historians of Pakistan also noted that the fact that the atomic proliferation debriefings had enraged and outraged the leftists and conservatives alike of their \\"national hero\\", dr. Qadeer Khan. Overall, the social conservatism and hard leftist ideas grew in an opposition against President Pervez Musharraf, including a far-right insurgency in the country. Influence in popular culture, literary, arts and science The religious identities, nationalism, and rightist ideas has greatly influenced the literature, theatre, architecture, and popular culture.

Angie tells Rose (Beth Broderick) about her captivity by Junior and asks for her help, but they are accosted by the Dundee brothers who loot the diner, killing Rose and knocking Angie unconscious. Barbie intervenes to rescue Angie and a miraculous rainstorm occurs and ends the chaos. Big Jim trades with Ollie Dinsmore (Leon Rippy) for the town's use of Ollie's well in exchange for propane. After Julia and Dodee speculate that the source of the radio signal jam could be the answer to the dome's origin, Dodee fashions a radio direction finding device that leads them to Joe and Norrie, who are on a search to find insulin to save Alice. The teenagers shock Julia and Dodee when they show them the video of their simultaneous seizure and end the signal jam by touching the dome together. Julia convinces Dodee to keep what they saw a secret in order to protect the children. Angie wakes up in Big Jim's home.

Andrea Reiher of Zap2it gave the episode a mixed review, especially regarding the rain scene. She said \\"the rain starting was a little cheesy. It's fine that the dome is a \\"micro- climate,\\" as Dodee calls it, but the moment it happened was a little clichéd. We're also not really ready for Julia and Barbie to be hooking up. We get it—intense circumstances, husband appears to be a philandering creep, etc. etc. But it still feels awfully quick.\\" She did compliment the episode's \\"Lost island feel going on,\\" saying \\"[it] opens up lots of interesting ideas about the origin of the dome. We already knew it was going to veer away from the book's explanation and we actually prefer this to the book ending, even if we don't know exactly what the show explanation is yet.\\" Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode an 8.0 out of 10, saying \\"Sure, this episode involved yet another accident, and the mystical rainy resolution managed to squash things just as they were about to get interesting - with Linda pulling her gun, about to put down, or threaten to put down a citizen - but it all still crackled nicely and showed us just how ill-prepared the town's law brigade was for an uprising of any kind.\\" Scott Von Doviak of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B rating, giving it a moderate review, saying \\"[The] middle part of the episode is the closest Under The Dome has come to matching King’s vision of Chester’s Mill: It’s all tight-knit and neighborly until the shit hits the fan, and then it’s every man for himself. Of course, a handful of people are still trying to do the right thing, including Julia and Dodee, who set out to find the source of a signal that’s jamming all radio frequencies, only to find it’s Joe and Norrie. And since there’s no way the show can maintain this ratcheting up of intensity, there’s a convenient deus ex machina that solves all the episode’s problems: a rainstorm inside the dome...\\"The Endless Thirst\\" is a decent episode, but not necessarily an encouraging one. I expect we'll soon be finding out about a miracle source of food inside the dome, as well as an endlessly regenerating electric power grid and a secret sub-basement in the hospital full of non-expiring medications. Les Moonves has spoken, and the message is clear: This is television.\\" Ted Kindig of BuddyTV gave the episode a negative review, saying \\"This week's episode, in which the people of Chester's Mill finally graduate from static grumpiness to an all-out riot, once again establishes a major threat and improbably wipes it out without a trace by the end of the hour. The characters are once again bound by insane plot conveniences rather than believable motivations, and the questions that arise from new information about the dome are still a long way from justifying all the dumb stuff that keeps happening.\\" References Category:2013 American television episodes Category:Under the Dome episodes ","title":"The Endless Thirst"},{"id":"40101201","text":"Faculty building in Zagreb The Faculty of Architecture (, abbr: Af) is one of the faculties of the University of Zagreb.

In 1775, the association voted to support disestablishment of the Anglican church in Virginia. After the American Revolutionary War, at its 1797 annual meeting, the association recommended the gradual emancipation of slaves, which proved controversial within the denomination.

In the 1890s the Ketocton Association renamed itself the Primitive Baptist Association, without any significant change in doctrine.
