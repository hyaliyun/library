A reserve squadron, it could be called upon for combat duties if necessary. History =World War I= The squadron was formed on 1 September 1915, as a fighter-reconnaissance unit of the Royal Flying Corps, and became arguably the highest scoring and possibly most decorated British squadron on the Western Front with 613 combat victories, a posthumous Victoria Cross won by Thomas Mottershead, four Distinguished Conduct Medals, and over sixty Military Crosses and Military Medals awarded to its members. Its ranks included over forty flying aces. The squadron transferred from the Royal Flying Corps to the newly formed Royal Air Force in April 1918. Post World War I, unlike most of its contemporaries, the squadron was not disbanded and was transferred in Jun 1919 to the North-West Frontier Province, India for policing duties, in the Army Co-operation role, equipped with Bristol Fighters, then Wapitis and Audaxes for the whole of the inter-war period. =World War II= A 20 Squadron sergeant at Monywa, Burma, 1945. At the outbreak of World War II, the squadron was still equipped with Audaxes, which were replaced with Lysanders in December 1941, re-equipping with Hurricanes in March 1943. During the Second World War the squadron's Hawker Hurricane IIDs and IVs saw action against the Japanese. After the war, the squadron re-equipped with Spitfires in September 1945, and Tempest FBIIs in May 1946, retaining these until it disbanded on 1 August 1947, whilst based in India. =Cold War= 20 Squadron reformed from No. 631 Sqn at RAF Llanbedr on 11 February 1949 as an Anti-Aircraft Co-operation (AAC) squadron, moving to RAF Valley on 19 July 1949, equipped with miscellaneous aircraft. The squadron disbanded at Valley on 16 September 1951. In June 1952 the squadron reformed at RAF Jever, Germany, operating the de Havilland Vampire and moved to RAF Oldenburg a month later. The Vampires were replaced in 1953 by Canadair Sabres which were themselves replaced with Hawker Hunters. The squadron was disbanded in 1960, only to be reformed again at RAF Tengah, Singapore, again operating Hunters. Following the withdrawal of the RAF from the Far East the squadron disbanded in 1970. 20 Squadron reformed again in late 1970 at RAF Wildenrath, Germany, operating the Hawker Siddeley Harrier. In 1977 at RAF Bruggen the squadron re-equipped with twelve SEPECAT Jaguar strike aircraft, various weapons for the squadron's conventional strike role of support for ground forces in repelling a Soviet attack in Europe, and eight WE.177 tactical nuclear bombs for use if a conflict escalated to the nuclear phase. The apparent mismatch between eight nuclear bombs and twelve aircraft was because RAF staff planners expected up to one third attrition in the conventional phase, with sufficient aircraft held back in reserve to deliver the full stock of nuclear weapons to targets beyond the forward edge of the battlefield, deep into the enemy's rear areas. The squadron was assigned to SACEUR for operational and targeting purposes, although political control over release of the British-owned WE.177 weapons was retained by the British government in London. The squadron re-equipped again with twelve Tornado GR1 aircraft at RAF Laarbruch in 1984, while its stock of WE.177 weapons increased to eighteen because of the Tornado's greater capacity. The squadron's war-role and assignment to SACEUR remained unchanged. =Operational Conversion Unit= In May 1992 the Options for Change defence review called for the disbanding of 20 Squadron as a front line unit, and it disbanded on 31 July 1992. On 1 September 1992 the squadron numberplate was assigned to the Harrier Operational Conversion Unit at RAF Wittering as No. 20 (Reserve) Squadron. With the formation of Joint Force Harrier and the decision to withdraw the FAA's Sea Harriers, the personnel of the RAF's No. 1 and 4 Squadrons, and the RN's 800 Naval Air Squadron and 801 Naval Air Squadron, later known as Naval Strike Wing, were absorbed with 20(R) Squadron into a joint RAF/RN unit, manned 50/50 by each service. On 9 February 2009, a 20(R) Squadron Harrier T12, ZH656, crashed at RAF Akrotiri while on training operations there. Both crew ejected safely and were treated in hospital for minor injuries. As a result of 2010 defence cuts, 20 Squadron disbanded on 31 March 2010, with its tasks taken over by the retitled 4 (Reserve) Squadron.

Eleanor Roosevelt established Val-Kill Industries in 1927 with Nancy Cook, Marion Dickerman, and Caroline O'Day, three friends she met through her activities in the Women's Division of the New York State Democratic Party. Val-Kill was located on the banks of a stream that flowed through the Roosevelt family estate in Hyde Park, New York. Eleanor and her business partners financed the construction of a small factory to provide supplemental income for local farming families who would make furniture, pewter, and homespun cloth using traditional craft methods. Capitalizing on the popularity of the Colonial Revival, most Val-Kill products were modelled on eighteenth-century forms. Nancy Cook, a trained artisan and teacher, designed most of the furniture and managed the factory which employed anywhere from three to eight men during its decade-long operation. Eleanor promoted Val-Kill through interviews and public appearances. Dickerman and O'Day were financial investors, but not actively involved in the business. The principal craftsmen at Val-Kill were immigrants, among them Frank Landolfa, Otto Berge, Arnold Berge, and Nelly Johannesen and her son, Karl.

They were both executed at 9 am on 23 May 1905 at HM Prison Wandsworth. The case, otherwise known as the Mask Murders (due to the black stocking-top masks that had been left at the scene of the crime), the Deptford Murders (due to the location) or the Farrow Murders (the last name of the victims), was one of the earliest convictions using forensic science. The crime On Monday 27 March 1905, at 8:30 am, William Jones went to Chapman's Oil and Colour Shop in the High Street in Deptford where he worked. When he arrived at the shop he found it closed and shuttered, which he found very unusual. The manager of the paint shop Thomas Farrow, aged 71, lived with his wife, Ann, aged 65, in the flat above the shop and he was not in the habit of having the shop still closed at such a late hour. Unable to open the door, Jones tried knocking but since he did not get any response from either Mr or Mrs Farrow he peeked through a window and saw that there were chairs knocked over. Alarmed at what he saw, he ran for help and found Louis Kidman, a local resident who worked in a nearby store, and the two men forced their way into the shop. It was not long before they found the body of Mr Farrow on the ground dead, while Mrs Farrow was found barely alive but unconscious in the couple's bed in the upstairs flat. Both bore the signs of having been repeatedly beaten. A doctor and the police were called and Mrs Farrow was taken to hospital. The investigation Despite the disarray within the shop, the police found no signs of forced entry. It was shortly determined that robbery was the motive: Jones told the police that Mr Farrow would collect the week's earnings and deposit them to a local bank every Monday, and an empty cash box was found on the floor, which was estimated to have contained about ¬£13, a decent amount of money at that time. To ensure the doctor would not trip over it, Sergeant Albert Atkinson pushed it aside with his bare hands. It was at this point that Chief Inspector Frederick Fox and Melville MacNaghten, the Assistant Commissioner (Crime) of the Metropolitan Police and head of the Criminal Investigation Department took over the case. Aside from the lack of forced entry as well as the empty cash box, it was clear that Mr and Mrs Farrow had been attacked separately and the discovery of two black masks fashioned from stockings that were left at the scene indicated that there were two men involved. Since the victims were in their night clothes, the police had speculated that Mr Farrow was deceived into opening the door while he was still half asleep. He was immediately attacked, but was still conscious enough to go after the robbers, and was hit again. His assailants went up to the upstairs flat, attacked Mrs Farrow, located the cash box, and fled with the money. However, based on the separate pools of blood at the scene, it was determined that Mr Farrow had again regained consciousness, and this time the men killed him and afterwards washed their hands in a nearby basin. =A greasy smudge on the cash box= When MacNaghten was told of the empty cash box, he chose to examine it. He noticed that on the underside of the box's inner tray, there was a greasy smudge which appeared to be a fingerprint. As a member of the Belper Committee which had recommended the use of fingerprints as a method for identification five years before, he wondered if this might be a case to test out this new technique. He used his handkerchief to carefully pick up the cash box, had it wrapped in paper and took it into the fledgling Fingerprinting Bureau at Scotland Yard. Established on 1 July 1901, the Fingerprint Bureau had proven its worth with the conviction a year later of Harry Jackson for burglary, thanks to fingerprint evidence. It was now headed by Detective Inspector Charles Stockley Collins who was regarded as the foremost English fingerprint expert of his time. Despite its earlier successes, especially in identifying previously convicted criminals who tried to pass themselves off pseudonymously, the technique was still considered unwieldy and both men knew that they were risking public ridicule with the intense scrutiny that a murder case would generate. Furthermore, even if they succeeded in identifying the owner of the fingerprint, they still needed to convince a potential jury sufficiently to convict. Detective Inspector Collins examined the print thoroughly and determined that the print was made through perspiration and appeared to have been left by the thumb, probably from the right hand. He compared it with those of the Farrows and that of Detective Sergeant Atkinson and was satisfied that the print did not belong to any of those people. Although the Bureau had 80,000-90,000 sets of prints on file, there was no match on any of them as well, which meant that they would need to find a suspect to compare it with. The initial hope of the police was that Mrs Farrow would give a description of her assailants, but she died in hospital on 31 March without regaining consciousness. =Positive identification and arrest= In an effort to identify the robbers, the police resorted to the usual practice of interviewing potential witnesses to the crime. Fortunately there was no shortage of them, for many saw two men ‚Äî one of them dressed in a dark brown suit and cap, the other in a dark blue serge suit and bowler hat ‚Äî leave the paint shop at around 7:30 in the morning of 27 March. Two of these witnesses ‚Äî a professional boxer named Henry John Littlefield and a local girl named Ellen Stanton ‚Äî positively identified the one in the dark brown suit as Alfred Stratton. Although he did not have a criminal record, Alfred Stratton was known to the police as being a \\"vagabond\\" and was known to have contacts in the criminal underworld. Alfred's brother Albert was also a known police character, and the description of the other man given by the witnesses matched him. The identification of Alfred was apparently confirmed when Alfred's girlfriend Annie Cromarty told the police that he had disposed of his dark brown coat and changed his shoes the day after the murder; she also recalled him asking for a pair of old stockings. Based on this lead, warrants for the arrest of the pair were issued, and they were taken into custody on 2 April and fingerprinted. Based on a tip by Annie Cromarty, police were able to recover ¬£4 that was buried near a local waterworks. When Detective Inspector Collins received the two sets of fingerprints taken from the Stratton brothers, he compared them to the print on the cash box, and he concluded that it exactly matched with the right thumbprint of Alfred Stratton. The brothers were charged with murder and the trial set on 5 May 1905 at the Old Bailey. Trial When the Stratton brothers were brought to trial, MacNaghten, Collins, and Richard Muir, the prosecutor for the Crown, knew that they would face an uphill battle. Since the fingerprint was the only tangible evidence that they had, the case would stand or fall on that evidence, and the defence would try their best to undermine it. Fingerprinting pioneer Henry Faulds was a vocal detractor, because he had the mistaken notion that one fingerprint match was unreliable; thus the defence retained him as a witness. Also set to testify for the defence was Dr John George Garson, who advocated anthropometry over fingerprinting as a means of identification. Both men were professional rivals of Edward Henry, the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, who established the Fingerprint Bureau and was responsible for the acceptance of fingerprinting in the English legal system; he was also in attendance. The prosecution called over 40 witnesses to the stand. Muir and his team wanted to place the two defendants at the scene of the crime, and despite Muir's inherent distrust of eyewitness testimony, he was counting on their consistency to reinforce the fingerprint evidence. Although some of them like Henry Alfred Jennings, a local milkman, were not able to make a positive identification of the defendants despite being consistent in their general appearance, others like Henry Littlefield and Ellen Stanton were positive in their identification of Alfred Stratton. The Home Office pathologist who did the post-mortem on the Farrows told the court that the injuries on the Farrows were consistent with being inflicted by weapons similar to the tools that the brothers had in their possession. Kate Wade, Albert Stratton's girlfriend, testified that Albert was not with her during the night of the murder, and he usually stayed with her. In addition, Annie Cromarty, Alfred's girlfriend, testified that Alfred had come home on the morning of 27 March with a good amount of money without explaining where he obtained it; she also added that he threw out the clothes that he wore that day when he saw the newspaper accounts of the murder, and that Alfred asked her to tell the police, or anyone else who asked, that he was with her the night of the murder. However, the defense counsel, H.G. Rooth, Curtis Bennett and Harold Morris, were able to give plausible alternative explanations, which would tend to cast doubt on the prosecution's witnesses, so much so that they were confident enough to have Alfred Stratton take the stand. He testified that at about 2:30 in the morning of the 27th, he was awakened by his brother Albert who was tapping on the window and wanted to borrow money from him for a night's lodging. He replied that he would check if he had some, and when Alfred came back to tell his brother that he had none, Albert was gone. He went out and found his brother some distance away, in Regent Street. It was there that they were seen by several witnesses who testified having seen them at around that time. He told his brother that he had no money and offered to let him stay for the night. Albert agreed and slept on the floor, and the brothers stayed until 9 in the morning. He explained the ¬£4 that was recovered by the police as money which he won over a boxing contest a couple of months before. He buried the money three weeks prior to the murders and he intended to give the money to Annie Cromarty. Muir had anticipated this tactic by the defence, and before calling Inspector Collins, he summoned William Gittings, who worked in the jail where the Stratton brothers were confined awaiting trial. Gittings related a conversation that he had with Albert Stratton, who said, \\"I reckon he (Alfred) will get strung up and I shall get about ten years‚Ä¶He has led me into this.\\" Muir hoped to impress the jury into thinking that that statement would be counted as a confession. Then he called Inspector Collins to the stand. =Expert testimony= It was Muir's intention to first establish Inspector Collins' credentials as an expert in the field of fingerprinting before the jury, then explain, in layman's terms, how fingerprinting worked as a means of identification. Collins was then made to discuss the fingerprint involved in the case. He showed the jury the cash box that was recovered from the scene, the fingerprint that he was able to obtain from the box, and demonstrated how it matched with the right thumb print of Alfred Stratton, for up to twelve points of agreement. At the request of a member of the jury Collins also demonstrated the difference in a print caused by various levels of pressure. After Collins took the stand, the defence called Dr John Garson to the stand. They were hoping to discredit Collins' testimony by establishing his credentials as one of Inspector Collins' mentors, thus giving to the jury the impression that he was more of an expert than Collins in the study of fingerprinting. As expected, he testified that upon examination of the print taken from the cash box and that of Alfred Stratton, he would say with certainty that they were not in agreement. However, the defence failed to reckon with the fact that Garson was not an expert of fingerprinting but of anthropometry, its rival field in identification. As a matter of fact, he had spoken against fingerprinting in the Belper Committee. And there was one more thing of which they were unaware, which Muir intended to use to his advantage. In cross-examination, Muir called into evidence two letters, each written by Garson. One letter was to the Director of Public Prosecutions, the other was to the solicitor for the defence. Each letter said that Garson would be willing to testify for either side in the trial, depending on who would pay him more. :MR. MUIR. ‚Äî How can you reconcile the writing of these two letters in the same day? :The witness (Dr Garson). ‚Äî I am an independent witness. The judge, Mr Justice Channell, remarked that after writing two such letters he would opine that Dr. Garson was an \\"absolutely untrustworthy\\" witness. Having seen the credibility of Dr Garson as a witness shattered, the defence decided not to call Dr Faulds as a witness, fearing that Prosecutor Muir would have something to discredit him as well. Conviction and execution After both sides had given their summations and the jury had been given their final instructions, it took them a little more than two hours of deliberation to find the Stratton brothers guilty of murder, and on 6 May 1905 they were sentenced to death by hanging. The sentence was carried out on 23 May the same year. References Further reading *Beavan, Colin. Fingerprints: The Origins of Crime Detection and the Murder Case That Launched Forensic Science.

It was released on July 6, 1993 for the Philips CD-i. making it the first interactive album in history. Its music was heavily influenced by electronica and rap. Interactive release This CD-only recording was available in an interactive version on Philips' short-lived CD-i format, as well as the Macintosh and Windows operating systems. The interactive version included the ability to alter the playback of the music by selecting a pre- determined sequence by either Rundgren or one of his four guest producers - Don Was, Jerry Harrison, Hal Wilner and Bob Clearmountain. The interface allowed the listener to control various aspects of music playback. If the user did nothing, the Rundgren mix would start and play through to the end. The interactive interface presented standard playback controls and the following major functions, plus a help function: * Program :(TR-i, Hal Wilner, Bob Clearmountain, Jerry Harrison, Don Was) * Direction :(Very Fast Forward, Fast Forward, Forward, Hold, Reverse) * Form :(Creative, Standard, Conservative) * Tempo :(Fastest 132 BPM, Faster 126 BPM, Fast 120 BPM, Medium 110 BPM, Slow 100 BPM, Slower 92 BPM, Slowest 96 BPM) * Mood :(Bright, Happy, Thoughtful, Sad, Dark) * Mix :(Karaoke, Thick, Natural, Spacious, Sparse) * Video :(Blank, Warp, Swarm, Title, Editor) The material on the disc was 933 4-bar musical segments. Each was a portion of one of the songs, accompanied by metadata describing the character of the segment - tempo in BPM, mood, chorus or verse, etc. Each segment was available in multiple mixes as well, from instrumental to a cappella. As the listener adjusted parameters, the currently playing segment would finish before starting a new segment, ensuring a seamless listening experience. The interface had the unique (at the time) property of allowing the user to select a range rather than a single value when adjusting a parameter. One could select a fast tempo, reducing the range so only that fast tempo segments were played, or increase the range so medium to fast were played, weighting towards fast. Rundgren demonstrated No World Order and the Philips CD-i system at record stores and electronics retailers after the release of the disc, and can be found on YouTube: Part 1 and Part 2. The tour for the album was designed to maximize interactivity with the audience, allowing members to dance on a raised portion of the stage, and even to guest solo on guitar. Rundgren was the only performer on this tour apart from three female dancers. The interactive program received \\"Best Composition/Arrangement\\" from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences, and the \\"Best Interactive Disc of the Year\\" Award from Video magazine. The editors of Electronic Entertainment presented it with their 1993 \\"Breakthrough Multimedia Title\\" award, and praised it as \\"a preview of a new kind of musical medium.\\" Standard CD release A non-interactive, audio-only CD was released simultaneously with Rundgren's preferred sequence. Even this version, however, played on the theme of interactivity and lack of order: its nearly continuous flow supported random play, and its paper insert could be refolded and reinserted so as to display any of 16 alternate versions of the cover art. Another version of the album, No World Order Lite, was released the following year, presenting the same material in a more song-oriented format. In Japan a promotional disc, NWO (Version 1.01), was released that contains alternate versions of \\"Fascist Christ,\\" \\"Property,\\" \\"Day Job,\\" and \\"Fever Broke.\\" An \\"expanded edition\\" reissue compiling all of the previous versions, plus four bonus tracks, was released by Esoteric/Cherry Red Records on November 8, 2011. On digital platforms such as Apple Music and Spotify, \\"Day Job [Club Version]\\" is missing from this reissue even though its title is included in the track listing; ten tracks on \\"disc two\\" are mislabeled, starting with \\"Proactivity,\\" which is actually \\"Time Stood Still,\\" and ending with \\"Day Job [Club Version],\\" which is \\"Property [Lost Version].\\" A limited-edition DVD of the 1993-'94 \\"World (No Order) Tour\\" was issued by Toddstore in 2014. It includes a range of bonus video from the era, including footage of a CD-i demonstration by Rundgren at Tower Records in Chicago and two interviews from the period with Indianapolis TV journalist Ken Owen.

He was a goaltender for HC Dynamo Moscow and the Soviet Union national ice hockey team in the 1970s and 1980s. Life and career Myshkin was born in Kirovo-Chepetsk, Soviet Union. During his career in the Soviet Championship League, Myshkin was consistently among the top goaltenders in the league and his Dynamo Moscow club was always among the best. However, rival Moscow club HC CSKA Moscow won the championship almost every year he played, including an amazing 13-year run from 1977 to 1989, preventing Myshkin from winning a domestic championship until his very last year. Myshkin came to prominence in the late 1970s when he earned a spot of the Soviet national team as a backup to the legendary Vladislav Tretiak. On February 11, 1979, he was the surprise choice of coach Viktor Tikhonov to start in the deciding game in the Challenge Cup tournament against the National Hockey League all stars. Myshkin responded with a sterling effort, shutting out the NHL stars 6-0 to win the Challenge Cup for the Soviets. A couple of months later, he won his first of six World and European championships, the others coming in 1981, 1982, 1983, 1986, and 1990. After Tretiak gave up two goals in the first period of the famous \\"Miracle on Ice\\" game versus the USA in the medal round of the 1980 Winter Olympics, Tikhonov replaced him with Myshkin. He faced only 2 shots in the second period, and stopped them both, but gave up 2 goals in the third scored by Americans Mark Johnson and Mike Eruzione. Team USA won the game 4-3 and went on to capture the gold medal with the Soviets taking the silver. In 1981, Myshkin was a member of the Soviet team that won the Canada Cup, the only time Canada failed to win the tournament. He played in one game and backed up Tretiak for the 8-1 victory in the final. In 1984, he won his only Olympic gold medal, backing up Tretiak for the last time. Tretiak retired after the tournament. In his first major event as starting goaltender of the Soviet national team, he led the Soviets to a perfect 5-0 record in the round robin of the 1984 Canada Cup by going 3-0 in his three starts before being defeated by Canada 3-2 in overtime in the semifinals. Nonetheless, Myshkin played spectacularly that game in a losing cause, being named the USSR's player of the game, and was named to the tournament all-star team for his heroics. As the starting goaltender of the national team, he backstopped them to a bronze medal at the 1985 World Championships and a gold in 1986 on home ice in Moscow. The following year, the 31-year-old Myshkin was replaced by younger goaltenders Evgeny Belosheikin and Sergei Mylnikov. After 1986, he appeared only once more at the World Championships, that being in 1990 as the team's third-string goaltender in a largely token gesture, as Myshkin had already announced he would retire following the season. Myshkin's final season would be a memorable one. First, he won the Soviet League championship for the only time in his career, as his Dynamo club ended CSKA's long championship reign and won its first title since 1954. Then at the World Championships, after watching his team's first nine games, he was given the start in the very last game. He finished his career in style, shutting out Czechoslovakia 5-0 and clinched the gold medal.

The Peebles, Ohio native served as head men's basketball coach at the University of Dayton in Dayton, Ohio, from 1947 until his death in 1964. He led the Dayton Flyers to a championship at the 1962 National Invitation Tournament. Early life Blackburn was born in 1906. He was employed as a steelworker for two years before enrolling at Wilmington College where he played football, basketball and baseball. After graduation, he coached high school basketball for four years at West Carrollton, Ohio and eight seasons at Xenia, Ohio Central High School, where six of his eight teams won championships, including the state title in 1942. In World War II, Blackburn joined the Navy physical education program at Chapel Hill, North Carolina. After the war, he became a golf pro in North Carolina. Head coaching career Blackburn became Dayton's first full-time basketball coach in 1947, inheriting a moribund team that had won seven total games over the previous two seasons. Blackburn's insistence on strict discipline within his program helped lift Dayton to national prominence in the following years. Blackburn's second team finished with a winning record and was invited to the National Catholic Invitational post-season tournament. Two years later, Blackburn's Flyers would receive the first of 10 NIT invitations. Blackburn established Dayton as a national college basketball powerhouse through the 1950s and early 1960s, advancing to the NIT Finals six times in what at the time was regarded as the more prestigious post season college basketball tournament.http://www.collegesports.com/auto_pdf/p_hotos/s_chools/dayt/sports/m-baskbl/auto_pdf/postseason Blackburn had a 352‚Äì141 record (.714) in 17 seasons as the Flyers head coach, held a 22-12 record (.647) in postseason play, and won an NIT championship in 1962. Blackburn fell ill with cancer during the 1963-64 season, but coached the Flyers through all but the final three games before stepping down. Assistant coach Don Donoher served as interim coach for the rest of the season, though Dayton credits the entire season to Blackburn. Blackburn died on March 6, 1964, eight days after his last game on the Flyers bench.\\"Tom Blackburn is Dead at 58; Coached Basketball at Dayton\\", The New York Times, March 7, 1964, page 23. Awards and recognition The University of Dayton inducted Blackburn into its Athletics Hall of Fame in 1969, and named the playing court at the University of Dayton Arena after their former coach. The winner of the annual Dayton-Xavier basketball game is awarded the Blackburn/McCafferty Trophy, named for the two former basketball coaches at each university.

It is manufactured by Republic of Fritz Hansen. The Egg was designed in a typical Jacobsen style, using state-of-the-art material. It is believed to be inspired by Eero Saarinen's \\"Womb chair\\", from which it borrows some traits. Related to the Egg is the Swan chair and, to some degree, many of Jacobsen's plywood chairs such as \\"7\\", the Ant, the Cigar, the Grand Prix-chair, the Pot, the Drop and the Giraffe.. The Egg (like the Swan) was also designed as a couch. While the Swan couch is still in production, only a handful of Egg couches have ever been made. A few were made for the Radisson Hotel, and a few years back, some were made as a \\"special edition\\" couch. The price was quite high‚Äîabout 400,000 DKK, the equivalent of roughly US$75,000. The reason for the limited production of the Egg couch, besides the wish for exclusivity, is the difficulty involved in making it, plus a design flaw: the couch is too big to be covered by two entire cow- hides, which is only just possible with the Egg-chair. This leaves a very visible stitching down the middle of the couch. This problem can, however, be solved by making the upholstery in fabric rather than leather. According to an article in The New York Times,. the Egg chair has also been used by McDonald's as part of a high-concept redesign of one of its restaurants in London. Furthermore, The Egg is in a McDonald's restaurant in N√∏rrebrogade, Copenhagen, among other furniture by Arne Jacobsen, although some are imitations..

The term is widely used in the United Kingdom. Playgroups are less formal than the preschool education of nursery schools. They do not provide full-time care, operating for only a few hours a day during school term time, often in the mornings only. They are staffed by nursery nurses or volunteers, not by nursery teachers, and are run by private individuals or charities, rather than by the state or companies. In the United Kingdom, since around the 1980s, the traditional territory of the playgroup has been encroached on by the expansion of more formal nursery education, and playgroups often now cater only for two- and three-year-olds before they move onto a nursery school. Over the same period there has been an increase in the state supervision of playgroups. Playgroups in the United States In the United States, a playgroup is an organization of parents with the expressed intent to have the children come together and play. There are playgroups that cater to specific categories of parents, particularly including stay at home dads, stay at home moms, and working moms. In areas of the US where homeschooling is popular, it is not unusual to see groups especially for homeschooling families. These can be part of local or even national playgroups. Churches, rec centers, and other community organizations sometimes sponsor weekly or monthly playgroups. Age limits are determined by the individual group. Some groups have upper age limits and some do not. It is not unusual to see groups where, in addition to activities for the children, there are social events for the whole family or for parents only. In highly mobile communities, playgroups can be an important tool for building the social network of young families who have recently relocated to the area. There are a number of resources online for parents to find playgroups in their area - including Playgroups USA and Social Toddler - both directories and social networks for parents in playgroups. International Playgroups in the Netherlands In The Netherlands, international or expatriate parents form small groups, local to their area, for the purpose of providing a play space for babies and toddlers up to the age of 4-5, as well as offering a support network for the parents themselves. Meetings are usually held weekly in a hall or other public venue, and the groups usually organize other social activities such as Ladies Nights Out, visits to local parks and zoos, summer barbecues etc. In Maastricht, for example, the Maastricht International Playgroup was established more than 10 years ago as a way to cater to the needs of expatriate families living in and around the area. Another International Playgroup is First Friends in Voorhout (in the Leiden area). Playgroups in Australia Playgroup Australia is the national peak and administrative body for playgroups in Australia. Playgroup is an informal session where mums, dads, grand parents, caregivers, children and babies meet together in a relaxed environment. Playgroups are set up and run by parents and caregivers, with children choosing from a range of activities set up to meet their varying needs. Activities at playgroup are either free or low cost, and may include Music and singing, Imaginative play, Outdoor and free play, Art and craft activities or Outings. Playgroup can be held anywhere that is safe for children and where groups of people can meet - community and neighbourhood centres, health clinics, women's centres, preschools and kindergartens, church halls and even in someone's house. In a playgroup, parents and caregivers stay to interact with the other adults; and to play with the children. No child is too young for playgroup. All children from 0‚Äì5 years, including babies, love new experiences and benefit from developing sensory, social and communication skills through activities at playgroup. March 2003 saw a dramatic increase in the number of mothers attending playgroup. Playgroups in Hong Kong In Hong Kong, pre-school children (0 ‚Äì 3 years) join playgroups to study (mostly foreign languages) in an interactive environment before they go on to kindergartens.

Life After Judas Maccabeus's forces defeated the Seleucid army at the Battle of Beth Horon, they were determined to send a stronger force against him. According to 1 Maccabees iii. 38, which Josephus follows (\\"The Antiquities of the Jews\\" xii. 7, ¬ß 3), it was the governor Lysias, who had been left as regent during the absence of Antiochus in Persia, who commissioned the generals Nicanor and Gorgias, sending them with a large army to Judea; but according to 2 Maccabees viii. 8, it was Ptolemy, governor of Coele-Syria and Phoenicia, who sent them. Nicanor seems to have been the commander-in-chief, although 2 Maccabees viii. 9 describes Gorgias as \\"a general and a man of experience in military service\\". The Battle of Emmaus The Syrians were so sure of victory that they took with them a number of merchants, to whom they intended to sell the Jewish prisoners as slaves. The Syrians camped at Emmaus; and Gorgias was sent thence with 5,000 infantry and 1,000 Cavalry to attack Judas by night (1 Macc 4:1-24), his guides being treacherous Jews. Judas had been informed of the expedition, and attacked the main Syrian army at Emmaus, completely routing it. Gorgias, not finding the enemy in camp, concluded they had retired into the mountains, and went in pursuit of them. Judas sagaciously kept his men from touching the booty, preparing them for the impending battle with Gorgias. When the latter returned to the main camp, he found it in flames, and the Jews ready for battle. The Syrians, seized with panic, fled into the Philistine territory, and only then did the Jews seize the rich spoils (166 BC). The victory was all the more striking as the force of Judas was considerably smaller in number and had \\"not armor nor swords to their minds\\" (1 Macc 4:6). Gorgias did not again dare to enter Judea. Once when Judas and Simon Maccabeus were carrying the war outside of that country, two subordinate generals, Joseph and Azariah, in violation of orders undertook an expedition against Jamnia, but were severely beaten by Gorgias (1 Maccabees v. 18, 19, 55-62), who is designated in \\"Ant.\\" xii. 8, ¬ß 6, \\"general of the forces of Jamnia.\\" 1 Maccabees does not mention this expedition, but refers to another, and calls Gorgias \\"governor of Idumaea\\" (xii. 32), which seems to be more correct than \\"of Jamnia.\\" He set out with 3,000 infantry and 400 cavalry, and killed a number of Jews; whereupon a certain Dositheus of Tobiene (so the correct reading of the Syrian translation), one of those whom Judas had protected against the pagans, threw himself upon Gorgias and seized his mantle, intending to take him prisoner; but a Thracian horseman cut off Dositheus' arm and so saved Gorgias. The last-named then retired to Marissa (ib. verse 35; comp. \\"Ant.\\" xii. 8, ¬ß 6), after which he is lost to view. Willrich assumes (\\"Judaica,\\" p. 33) from the description of the booty in 1 Maccabees iv. 23 that Holofernes in the Book of Judith represents Gorgias. Later on 164 BC he held a garrison in Jamnia, and gained a victory over the forces of Joseph and Azarias who, envying the glory of Judas and Jonathan, in direct disobedience of the orders of Judas, attacked Gorgias and were defeated. Jamnia as given in Josephus, Ant, XII, viii, 6, is probably the correct reading for Idumaea in 2 Macc 12:32. The actions of Gorgias in 2 Macc are recorded with some confusion. He was regarded with special hostility by the Jews. In 2 Macc 12:35 he is described as \\"the accursed man.\\" References Hutchinson, J. (1915). Gorgias. International Standard Bible Encyclopedia.

The black spot is Io's shadow. Jupiter and the Great Red Spot (visible on the lower right), with Ganymede (immediately on the upper right) casting its shadow on Jupiter. The other moons are Europa (further right), Io (first on left), and Callisto (furthest on left). Photo taken with Nikon P900 on 24 July 2020, ten days after opposition. Solar eclipses on Jupiter occur when any of the natural satellites of Jupiter pass in front of the Sun as seen from the planet Jupiter. For bodies which appear smaller in angular diameter than the Sun, the proper term would be a transit. For bodies which are larger than the apparent size of the Sun, the proper term would be an occultation. There are five satellites capable of completely occulting the Sun: Amalthea, Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. All of the others are too small or too distant to be able to completely occult the Sun, so can only transit the Sun. Most of the more distant satellites also have orbits that are strongly inclined to the plane of Jupiter's orbit, and would rarely be seen to transit. When the four largest satellites of Jupiter, the Galilean satellites, occult the Sun, a shadow transit can be seen on the surface of Jupiter which can be observed from Earth in telescopes. Eclipses of the Sun from Jupiter are not particularly rare, since Jupiter is very large and its axial tilt (which is related to the plane of the orbits of its satellites) is relatively small‚Äîindeed, the vast majority of the orbits of all five of the objects capable of occulting the Sun will result in a solar occultation visible from somewhere on Jupiter. The related phenomenon of satellite eclipses in the shadow of Jupiter has been observed since the time of Giovanni Cassini and Ole R√∏mer in the mid Seventeenth Century. It was soon noticed that predicted times differed from observed times in a regular way, varying from up to ten minutes early to up to ten minutes late. R√∏mer used these errors to make the first accurate determination of the speed of light, correctly realizing that the variations were caused by the varying distance between Earth and Jupiter as the two planets moved in their orbits around the Sun. Spacecraft can be used to observe the solar eclipses on Jupiter; these include Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 (1973 and 1974), Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 (1979), Galileo orbiter (1995‚Äì2003), Cassini‚ÄìHuygens (2000) and New Horizons (2007) observed the transits of their moons and its shadows. Visibility from Jupiter The mean angular diameter of the Sun as viewed from Jupiter is 372 arc-seconds, or 6' 12\\" (about that of the Sun as viewed from Earth), varying slightly from 381\\" at perihelion to 357\\" at aphelion. Unlike the near coincidence of the apparent sizes of the Moon and Sun as viewed from Earth, this perspective exaggerates the apparent diameters of all the Galilean moons in comparison to the Sun. Even distant Callisto is over 50% larger, and Io is nearly six times as large. This disparity in angular size makes the moons' shadows on Jupiter more defined than the lunar shadow on Earth during a total solar eclipse, as it narrows the penumbra for a given distance.

He was in full- time ministry from 1973 until his death. The Berean Call, which highlights Hunt's material, was started in 1992. From 1999 to 2010, he also hosted Search the Scriptures Daily radio ministry alongside T.A. McMahon. Hunt traveled to the Near East, lived in Egypt, and wrote numerous books on theology, prophecy, cults, and other religions, including critiques of Catholicism, Islam, Mormonism, and Calvinism, among others. Hunt's Christian theology was evangelical dispensational and he was associated with the Plymouth Brethren movement. Early life David Charles Haddon Hunt was born on September 30, 1926, in Riverside, California, to Lillie and Albert Hunt. He was raised in a Christian family, with two other siblings. As a young man, he also spent time in the military, at the end of World War II. He was an alumnus of UCLA. From June 24, 1950, until his death, Hunt was married to his college sweetheart, Ruth Klaussen (1926-2013), who together raised four children: David Jr., Janna, Karen and Jon. He worked as a CPA before his entry into full-time ministry. Positions Hunt believed occult or pagan influences are pervasive in modern culture - this includes evolution, as well as all forms of psychology, some forms of entertainment, yoga, and some forms of medicine. His book Occult Invasion is dedicated to this area, while several other books mention it in part.Chapter One Hunt, Dave (2010). Occult Invasion The Berean Call. =Creationism= Hunt was a strict Biblical Creationist - refutations of evolution and theistic evolution were a frequent topic of his radio programs, Search the Scriptures Daily and According to God's Word. =Calvinism= Hunt addressed Calvinism in a book called What Love is This? Calvinism's Misrepresentation of God, published in 2002 and revised in 2004 and 2006. He sought to refute many alleged misconceptions of Calvinism without taking an Arminian stance. He outlined a theological middle ground between Calvinism and Arminianism, where, according to Hunt, one can believe in eternal security but reject Calvinistic teaching. Also published in 2004 was Debating Calvinism: Five Points, Two Views, co-written in a point-counterpoint debate format by Hunt and Calvinist apologist James White. =Catholicism= In A Woman Rides the Beast, he identified the Roman Catholic Church as the Whore of Babylon from the prophecies in chapters 17 and 18 of the Book of Revelation. =Mormonism= The book The Godmakers (1984), which Dave Hunt co- wrote with Ed Decker, and the accompanying film The God Makers (1982) by Jeremiah Films were an expos√© of Mormonism, highlighting the Mormon belief that Jesus is the spirit brother of Lucifer and many other disturbing facts. The book and film have been criticized not only by Mormons themselves as inaccurate portrayals of their religion but also as inaccurate by other non- Mormon groups that are critical of Mormonism. =Prophecy= Dave Hunt regularly spoke on Bible prophecy, including his book A Cup of Trembling which warned against the then-current peace process. =Other= In 1973 he wrote the screenplay for Time to Run, a Christian film produced for the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (Hunt later criticized Graham's ministry for its open ecumenism). The Seduction of Christianity (co-written with Tom A. McMahon), which categorized Word of Faith teachings, meditation, and psychology-based counseling as New Age heresies, generated much debate in the 1980s. Responses from meditation proponents and from Calvinist re-constructionist writers include Seduction?? A Biblical Response and The Reduction of Christianity. Hunt has written a rejoinder to the latter critics in his Whatever Happened to Heaven? Hunt wrote about Y2K with the intent of refuting the fearful predictions being made by other Christian fundamentalist writers (Y2K: A Reasoned Response To Mass Hysteria). In his final book, \\"Cosmos, Creator and Human Destiny\\", Hunt supported the Creationist viewpoint and alleged that there were deficiencies in both the Big Bang theory and the theory of evolution.

Astrology software is a type of computer programs designed to calculate horoscopes. Many of them also assemble interpretive text into narrative reports. History Astro Computing Services (ACS) in San Diego, founded by Neil Michelsen in 1973, published a computer-generated astrological ephemeris in 1976, The American Ephemeris. When personal computers generally became available, astrologers and astrology hobbyists were able to purchase them and use astrological or astronomical calculation software or make such programs themselves. Astrologer and computer programmer Michael Erlewine was involved early in making astrological software for microcomputers available to the general public in the late 1970s. In 1978, Erlewine founded Matrix Software, and in 1980 he published a book with all the algorithms and data required for owners of microcomputers to make their own complete astrological programs. At first, astrology software was opposed by American astrologers who did not approve of computers in their field. However, acceptance grew as it became clear how more efficient and profitable such software could be. A few hundred fixed-purpose astrology computers were made, one of which was used by Nancy Reagan's astrologer beginning in about 1981.Daniel Dern, \\"Does Your Beloved Tech Artifact Belong in a Museum? What museums do and don‚Äôt want\\" IEEE Spectrum July, 2012. Astrology software has been made available in the open- source model, starting with the release of Astrolog in 1991.

Features  Computer astrology programs today typically make accurate planet position calculations, display and print these positions using astrological glyph symbols in graphic charts, save and retrieve individuals' data to and from database files, compare the planet positions of different charts to find the astrological aspects between them (e.g. for compatibility), calculate the dates of important events in the future for a chart, and research the saved chart database. Some generate colorful geographical maps with lines showing where the planets rise and culminate at a significant time, usually the time of birth or the time of inception of an organization (called astrocartography). Astrology programs usually come bundled with an electronic atlas, allowing the review of the longitudes, latitudes, and time zone observance histories for cities and towns. Many assemble interpretive text about the various element combinations in a chart into comprehensive printed reports.Nine of the ten software programs reviewed by TopTenReviews.com in 2011 provide interpretive reports.

Belhaven takes its name from its situation at the mouth of the Biel Water. The village is home to Belhaven Hill School, an independent co-educational prep school for children between the ages of 7‚Äì13. History Belhaven originated as a subsidiary settlement of the burgh of Dunbar and was first mentioned in the 12th century as the site of the port of Dunbar and that the village had been divided into crofts and tenements. Its continued to be the port of Dunbar into the sixteenth century, when new works at Dunbar replaced it. The physical traces of Belhaven's once substantial breakwater and pier were removed by quarrying and recycling. The location of Belhaven and its distance from Dunbar, with the now drained Belhaven Loch giving a plentiful supply of water, meant that a leather tanning industry developed. In addition, many of the villagers grew enough fruit and vegetables to trade in Dunbar. The readily available water also allowed brewing to develop. The first brewers in the area were said to be the monks from the monastery on the Isle of May who had been granted land in the area. In 1901 a hospital, the Dunbar Combination Hospital, was opened to the south of Belhaven and it continues as a community hospital and a nursing home today, on the same site. The outline of Belhaven has remained largely unchanged for the last 200 years and its street plan is still similar to what it was two centuries ago, although some streets are longer. Six sizeable houses on the edge of the village defined its perimeters and these large properties, set in their own grounds, prevented Dunbar from expanding to join Belhaven, except for a small area in the south eastern corner. Most of the village is within a Conservation Area and many of the older buildings are listed. Winterfiled was the home of Captain R. Anderson of the Royal Navy. Industry In 1806 a spinning mill was erected at Belhaven but closed after a relatively short time of operations. In 1815 a factory for cotton goods was established in the former artillery barracks opposite Winterfield Park, which had been purchased from the government. It gave employment to 250 looms and 550 people, many of whom were Irish immigrants. This industry also closed following the collapse of the East Lothian Bank (1823). Brewery Belhaven Brewery is owned by Greene King. The brewery produces the well known Belhaven Best ale. Several other beers are produced by the brewery which are sold widely throughout Scotland and exported to the USA.

The surveys are most often made of nearby stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. One of the interests of astronomy is to determine how many stars there are of each of several types that stars can be categorized into, and how these stars are distributed in space. Reasons for star counts When performing star counts, astronomers consider many different categories that have been created to classify a few stars that have been well studied. One of the hopes of studying the results of star counts is to discover new categories. Different counts typically seek to categorize stars for only a few of the qualities listed below, and determine how common each considered quality is and how stars of that kind are distributed. * Temperature: In astronomy, temperature is usually shown using the letter codes O B A F G K M running from 'blue' (type O, actually bluish white) through white (type F) to 'red' (type M, actually ruddy orange). Types L and T are used for brown dwarfs, whose 'colors' are in the infrared. * Size: Size is usually designated by Roman numerals I (supergiants) through V (dwarfs). * Age: Stars are usually grouped into Population I (young) and Population II (old). * Location: In the Milky Way Galaxy the groups are described as thin disk, thick disk, central bulge, and halo. * Multiplicity: Most stars are members of double star, or triple star, or even double-double star systems. Our own sun appears to be unusual for not having a companion star. There are many finer subdivisions in all of the above categories. Bias There are many unavoidable problems in counting stars for the purpose of getting an accurate picture of the distribution of stars in space. The effects of our point of view in the galaxy, the obscuring clouds of gas and dust in the galaxy, and especially the extreme range of inherent brightness, create a biased view of stars. * Stars vary far more in intrinsic brightness than they do in distance. * Our line of sight through the Milky Way Galaxy is interrupted by great clouds of gas and dust, which block our view of stars more than a few thousand light-years away. * The Sun is located in the disk of the Milky Way Galaxy, in the northern edge of the thin disk and on the inner edge of a spiral arm called the Orion‚ÄìCygnus Arm. There is good reason to believe that stars in the galaxy's thin disk are different from thicker part of the disk, and from the bulge and the halo. Some stars are obviously more common in spiral arms than in the disk in between the arms. Knowing that these effects create bias, astronomers analyzing star counts attempt to find how much bias each effect has caused and then compensate for it as well as they can. Inherent luminosity complications The greatest problem biasing star counts is the extreme differences in inherent brightness of different sizes. Heavy, bright stars (both giants and blue dwarfs) are the most common stars listed in general star catalogs, even though on average they are rare in space. Small dim stars (red dwarfs) seem to be the most common stars in space, at least locally, but can only be seen with large telescopes, and then only when they are within a few tens of light-years from Earth. For example, the blue giant Œ∂ Puppis is 400 million times more luminous than the nearest star, a red dwarf named Proxima, or Œ± Centauri C. Even though Proxima is only 4.2 light-years away from us, it is so dim that it cannot be seen with the naked eye (one of its companions, Œ± Centauri A, is visible). The star Œ∂ Puppis is one of the brightest of the visible extreme blue supergiants. It is so bright that it appears to be a second magnitude star, even though Œ∂ Puppis is 1,399 light-years away.

The previous official versions were the Codes of 1819, 1849, 1887, and 1919, though other compilations had been printed privately as early as 1733, and other editions have been issued that were not designated full revisions of the code.

Volumes are also periodically recompiled and reissued, which has occurred over a hundred times; each of the original volumes of the Code of 1950 has been split at least once into separate parts. Since 1953, the General Assembly has revised the code on a title-by-title basis rather than enacting entirely new revisions of the code as it had in the past. The Commission has the responsibility for drafting title revision and recodification bills. More than 50 titles have been repealed and replaced by successor titles, and nine of those have been replaced a second time.

Legal supremacy of code provisions The laws published in the Code of Virginia are supreme over local ordinances passed by the counties and independent cities of Virginia. In turn, the Code's provisions must comply and be consistent with the Virginia Constitution, as well as the Constitution of the United States and federal law generally, and so its provisions are subject to invalidation by Virginia state or U.S. federal courts upon a finding that they are unconstitutional or preempted by federal legislation. Otherwise, Code provisions remain in effect until amended or repealed by the General Assembly. Changes are added through regular supplements and replacement volumes, rather than the issuance of a completely new code, which has only occurred five times. The Code and the Virginia Constitution The Virginia Constitution, Article IV, ¬ß 12, which states that \\"No law shall embrace more than one object, which shall be expressed in its title\\", has periodically been used to attack the constitutionality of particular provisions of the Virginia Code on the basis that disparate subjects were codified under too broad or vague a topic. The Virginia Supreme Court has repeatedly rejected these arguments, ruling that ¬ß 12 does not prevent the Code from being organized around general subject matter, or require the Code to be a literal and detailed index of its contents. Instead, the purpose of this provision was to prevent the General Assembly and the public from being misled as to the nature of a law, such that \\"vicious legislation\\" was hidden by a \\"deceptive title.\\"See Commonwealth v. Brown, 21 S.E. 357, 360 (Va. 1895), for the first interpretation of that constitutional provision by the Virginia Supreme Court. History Though compilations of Virginia legislation were published before the Code of 1819, these were organized by their date of enactment rather than by subject matter, and so lacked the integration of modern codes. The legislation of the Colony of Virginia was not even officially published for the first 175 years of its lawmaking history. Aside from original manuscript copies that were commonly misplaced or left to rot in county courthouses, information on new legislation was largely spread by word of mouth. Aside from a few collections printed in London, the first unofficial publication of Virginia laws was in 1733, when Virginia newspaper pioneer William Parks published A collection of all the acts of Assembly of Virginia. Official action was not taken until 1808, after Virginia became part of the United States, when the Virginia General Assembly tasked William Waller Hening with the publication of the state's laws. His thirteen volume Statutes at Large (1809‚Äì23) was not comprehensive due to the loss of many records, but included all the session laws Hening could find dating from 1619 to 1792, as well as royal charters.Hening's Statutes at Large --an ongoing project to post the complete work online. Many of these came from the personal collection of Thomas Jefferson, who had preserved manuscript copies of legislation as early as 1734, and had offered to take on the task of publishing himself decades prior to Hening's work. =The Code of 1819= The Code of 1819 was the first codification in Virginia that organized the statutory law by subject matter. On March 12, 1819, the Virginia General Assembly passed \\"An Act Providing for the re-publication of the Laws of this Commonwealth,\\" and the resulting Code of 1819 entered into force on January 1, 1820. The Revised Code of the Laws of Virginia: Being A Collection of all such Acts of the General Assembly, of a Public and Permanent Nature as are now in Force contained 262 chapters arranged in 23 subject titles, and was published in two volumes by Thomas Ritchie, Printer to the Commonwealth.Ritchie was also the editor of the Richmond Enquirer, and a highly prominent spokesperson for the Democratic Party. See bio at the Library of Virginia . Benjamin Watkins Leigh, member of the Virginia House of Delegates member and later reporter for the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals, was appointed superintendent over the publication by the March 12 Act. The General Assembly, which provided him with an eight-page list of which laws to codify and expressly told him to ignore the date of enactment and categorize them instead by subject. Leigh was assisted by Hening. Several other states had already organized their codes by subject, but conservative jurists, such as those that composed Virginia's bar, preferred the tradition of dating public acts from the year of independence. Leigh accordingly wrote an apologetic note in his preface to the Code on this issue and retained the dates in the side margin. The Code of 1819 mistakenly included the proposed Titles of Nobility Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which would have been the Thirteenth Amendment had it been ratified. Modern- day proponents of TONA's enactment incorrectly point to its inclusion as evidence that Virginia had ratified it, but it was merely an editorial error due to incorrect information.The General Assembly actually never took action over the amendment, which the act of March 12, 1819 did not mention, nor did the act give any independent legal effect to subsequent decisions of the editors and publishers of the code. =The Code of 1849= The Code of 1849 has been considered the most thorough revision ever of Virginia law. The General Assembly approved it in 1849, and it entered into force on July 1, 1850. The Code of 1849 contained 216 chapters in 56 titles, with individually numbered sections in each chapter. It also included annotations, in the form of footnotes that traced the development of institutions and legal doctrines back to the 17th century. It was nonetheless fewer than 1000 pages, something its compilers were proud of. The Code of 1849 was principally the work of former U.S. Congressman and acting governor of Virginia, John M. Patton, and legal scholar and Virginia Supreme Court reporter Conway Robinson. They had been asked by the General Assembly in 1846 to \\"suggest such contradictions, omissions or imperfections, as they may perceive in the statutes\\" and to revise the code \\"in such as manner as in their opinion will render the said general statutes most concise, plain and intelligible.\\"Act of Feb. 20, 1846, ch. 33, 1845-46 Va. Acts 26, 26-27. Patton and Robinson submitted five reports to the General Assembly between 1847 and 1849, and their work was finally adopted and passed by the General Assembly with only minor modifications. The 1849 revision was generally accepted as a modernization of Virginia statutory law and remained in force for almost 40 years, including during the temporary secession of Virginia from the United States during the American Civil War. It also became the first statutory law of West Virginia, when it broke off from Virginia in 1863 to be admitted as a separate state. The code was updated in 1860 and 1873, but neither edition was adopted by the General Assembly as a revision. By the 1870s, the code had expanded to more than 1,500 pages and contained numerous redundancies. =The Code of 1887= In 1884, the General Assembly authorized a new code and appointed three revisors--two former and one future Supreme Court of Appeals judges--to correct contradictions, omissions, and other errors in the statutes \\"without producing a radical change in the present system.\\" The General Assembly also required the sections of the new code to be numbered in one sequence, following the system adopted in 1873 by the Revised Statutes of the United States, which simplified citation to Virginia statutes. The revisors submitted the manuscript of their proposed code without having made any written progress reports, which the General Assembly passed without amendment with \\"An act to revise, arrange, and consolidate into a Code the general statutes of the Commonwealth,\\" approved on May 16, 1887. The Code of 1887 went into effect on May 1, 1888. The flaws of the Code of 1887 included its lack of provision for supplementation and an outdated index, and the only annotations were citations in the margins that lacked the names of the cases as well as a description of the rulings. John Garland Pollard, a private Richmond attorney who was later to serve as Virginia's attorney general and governor, corrected these errors in a series of privately published editions. His 1894 Amendments to the Code of Virginia was printed on slips of paper intended to be pasted over the amended sections. Four years later, Pollard published the Supplement to the Code of Virginia, which only printed amended sections and new laws, with new case annotations. In 1904, Pollard published the two volume Code of Virginia as Amended to Adjournment of General Assembly, which was the first printed Virginia code to be updated regularly, by biennials and supplements. It was also the first to include full case annotations that included summaries of the decisions, which more than half of those of other states had already published. =The Code of 1919= After nearly 30 years without an official revision, the General Assembly passed an act of March 21, 1914, that empowered the governor to appoint a revision committee. The appointed revisors--a private attorney, the dean of the Washington & Lee University law school, and a retired judge-- drafted a proposed code that contained laws enacted through 1916, which was passed by the General Assembly with few amendments in March 1918. The Code of 1919 went into effect on January 13, 1920. The code contained 63 titles, with 6,571 consecutively numbered sections, and was published in an oversized, unannotated single volume and a two volume annotated edition. Neither version of the Code of 1919 had any provision for supplementation, and so the Code of 1919 quickly became outdated, so that as soon as 1923, the director of the State Legislative Reference Bureau published General Laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia to incorporate amendments and assign section numbers to new statutes. In 1924, the Michie Company published The Code of Virginia as Amended to Adjournment of General Assembly 1924, which was prepared by company founder and Supreme Court of Appeals reporter Thomas Johnson Michie. The Michie Code, as it became known, was supplemented after each session of the General Assembly, and a new edition was published in 1930, 1936, and 1942, by which time the one-volume code had grown to more than 3000 pages, and preparers had an increasingly difficult time squeezing new laws into the 1919 section numbering. =The Code of 1950= In 1944, the General Assembly appointed the Virginia Advisory Legislative Council to update the Code of Virginia with a view to emulating the multivolume, annotated codes that more than thirty other states had published by that time. The Council recommended a four volume code, with provision for pocket part supplementation. The Commission on Code Recodification was created in 1946, and its proposed code was enacted by the General Assembly on April 6, 1948, with few amendments, and published in 1949 in ten volumes by the Michie Company. The Code of 1950 became effective on February 1, 1950. In 1953, the Virginia Code Commission recommended that the General Assembly revise the law on a title-by-title basis (which was the method followed by the U.S. Congress when it revised the United States Code) rather than a complete revision, and the General Assembly in turn gave the Code Commission the responsibility for drafting recodification bills. More than 50 titles have been repealed and replaced by successor titles, and thirteen of those have been replaced a second time. With change thus occurring step-by-step, the Code of 1950 continues to remain in force. =Proposed Code of 2007= In 2005, the General Assembly authorized a complete revision of the Code, to become effective in 2007. Each section of the Code, like that of Georgia, would be designated by three numbers, separated by hyphens. There was considerable outcry from practicing attorneys that they would have to relearn the designations of Code sections. In response, the General Assembly did not authorize any money in 2006 to pay for the recodification. This effectively put the recodification on hold, and it did not occur.

The village is located on the L4202 road at the junction with the Ballyduff Road, close to the N75 and from Thurles town centre. It is also situated 1.5 km from junction 5 of the M8 motorway. Its population was 502 at the 2006 census.Irish census 2006 It is situated in the townland of Borris which is part of the civil parish of Twomileborris in the ancient barony of Eliogarty.Placenames database of Ireland - Twomileborris civil parish History In the 1830s, the village was the property of Hugh Nugent O'Reilly.Samuel Lewis, Topographical Dictionary of Ireland, 1837 =History of the placename= The name Borris is generally believed to have come from the Norman word for a borough, district or stronghold. The Irish name Buir√≠os L√©ith was historically anglicised as Borrisleigh or Borris Leigh.Placenames Database of Ireland (see archival records) The use of Leigh in the placename would seem to be related to the monastic settlement of Liathmore-Mochoem√≥g in Leigh, about a mile and a half to the north-east of the village. Those who prefer the Irish name of Buirgheas Dh√° Mh√≠le say that the name refers to King Mile, ancestor of Niall of the Nine Hostages and numerous Irish Kings and heroes. Amenities and facilities Village amenities It has a primary school, Catholic church, two pubs and two shops. There are a number of housing estates. The village is located right at the edge of the Golden Vale and the Bog of Allen and so the quality of the land varies around the area, with most of the best farming land located to the west of the village. Parts of the land to the east are too boggy to be used, even for extracting turf. The village proper is bounded on the west by the Black River, a tributary of River Drish, which goes on to join River Suir. The approach to the village is dominated by a Norman tower-house. In June 2011 planning permission was given by An Bord Plean√°la for a casino, hotel with 500 rooms and a racetrack, known as the Tipperary Venue. An Taisce opposed the project, telling a planning tribunal that it had concerns about the impact on local water and other ecological factors as well as the commercial impact on Limerick and Tipperary. In September 2011 then Minister for Justice Alan Shatter said that the casino project was \\"out\\" based on a decision made at Cabinet on 21 September 2011.

Early life and education Horowitz was born on 31 Jan. 1942 in Shreveport, Louisiana, to Rabbi David Lefkowitz, Jr. and Leona Atlas Lefkowitz. Rabbi David served as rabbi at Temple B'nai Zion in Shreveport and Leona was a tutor in math, informal college counselor, civic worker, community board member, and housewife. Horowitz was educated in Shreveport, and graduated from C. E. Byrd High School in 1959. Horowitz earned a B.A. from Wellesley College in 1963 and earned a Ph.D. in American studies from Harvard University in 1969. David Lefkowitz is her paternal grandfather.  Career  Horowitz taught at MIT, Union College, Scripps College, and the University of Southern California, Carleton College, and University of Michigan. She is currently teaching at Smith College, where she is the Sydenham Clark Parsons Professor of History. A cultural historian of the United States, Horowitz's research ranges over a number of areas, including cultural philanthropy, women, higher education, landscape studies, sexuality, sexual representation, censorship, understandings of mental health and illness, intimate life, tourism, and biography. Culture and the City (1974) examined the cultural institutions of Chicago in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. A series of articles on zoological gardens looked at the changing conceptions of wild animals in relation to humans as expressed in the manner in which the zoo animals were exhibited. Alma Mater (1984) probed the ways in which founders of the Seven Sister Colleges expressed their hopes and fears about women offered the liberal arts in the colleges' buildings and landscapes; the book explored, as well, the lives of female collegians and their female professors as lived within college gates. Campus Life (1987) looked at the history of undergraduate cultures from the 18th century to the present, with attention to college men (and later, women), outsiders, and rebels. The Power and Passion of M. Carey Thomas, president of Bryn Mawr College and feminist, 1857-1935, appeared in 1984. The designated literary executor of John Brinckerhoff Jackson, she wrote the introductions and edited, Landscape in Sight: J. B. Jackson‚Äôs America (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1997). Rereading Sex (2002), explored sexual representations and the campaign to censor them that led to the landmark Comstock Law of 1873 that barred obscene materials, contraceptive information and devices, and abortion advertisements from the US mails. The Flash Press (2008), co-authored with Patricia Cline Cohen and Timothy Gilfoyle, inquired into the sporting weeklies of New York City in the 1840s. Wild Unrest (2010) focused on Charlotte Perkins Gilman, the understanding of mental health and illness in the 19th century, and the writing of \\"The Yellow Wall-Paper.\\" A Taste for Provence (2016) tells the story of the re-invention of Provence for American travelers from a place of Roman ruins to a new Eden of earthly delights. Traces of J. B. Jackson: The Man Who Taught Us to See Everyday America (2020) offers the biography in the form of essays of the important writer on the landscape.

The band is best known for their debut album Self Help Serenade, released in 2004 on Capitol Records. Marjorie Fair's melodic psychedelia has been compared to Mercury Rev, Pernice Brothers, The Beach Boys, Grandaddy, Elliott Smith and the solo works of Jon Brion, who contributed minor parts to Self Help Serenade. The only consistent member of the band has been songwriter/vocalist Evan Slamka (vocals, guitar). Other members have included Wayne Faler (guitar), Dain Luscombe (keyboards), Chris Tristram (bass guitar), Scott Lord (bass guitar), Mike Delisa (drums), and Jayson Larson (drums). Following the release of Self Help Serenade in the UK on May 31, 2004, Marjorie Fair toured Europe and opened for indie acts including Modest Mouse and The Bees. Marjorie Fair played a series of West Coast residencies in the fall, while awaiting Capitol to release their album stateside. The album did not end up being released in the United States until July 19, 2005 and was supported by a very short U.S. tour. The group promoted the album with small bursts of touring, playing with Tegan and Sara and Mellowdrone that fall. In summer 2006, Marjorie Fair was recruited to open for John Mayer and Sheryl Crow on a massive stadium tour, but were suddenly dropped by Capitol thereafter. In October 2007, a post on the band's official site stated that a sophomore album was nearly complete: \\"We've been putting the finishing touches on the next record. If you know anyone who would like to put it out without having heard a single note of it, please let us know.\\" The post also announced that Scott Lord and Wayne Faler had left the band. Square On Square Slamka formed a new recording project called Square on Square in 2009. A 5-song EP, Spectrum Of Love, was released digitally on iTunes in August 2010. The EP was produced by Joey Waronker, with cover art provided by Birmingham, Alabama artist Merillee Challis. The EP included five songs: \\"Black Holes,\\" \\"Northstar,\\" \\"Fear Of Flying,\\" \\"Found,\\" and \\"Songbird.\\" Three of these songs would later be remixed for a Marjorie Fair release. The band members were Slamka, Gerry Porter (Sturgeon), Nic Johns (Ben Lee, The Silver Lake Chorus), Ashley Dzerigian and Adam Zimmon (Iggy Pop, Shakira). The EP is no longer available on iTunes as of 2016. Three tracks remain available for streaming on the band's now-abandoned MySpace page. Mighty Forces In May 2012, Evan began playing shows under the band name Mighty Forces and posting recordings on a Facebook page with enigmatic titles such as \\"Wandering Song\\" and \\"Trapper.\\" The songs were accompanied by VHS-like psychedelic videos featuring Slamka and various found footage. Though hissy and lo-fi in quality, the songs were unmistakably the work of the Marjorie Fair singer and songwriter, with some nods to contemporaries like Midlake and Blitzen Trapper. A Joey-Waronker-produced Mighty Forces album was hyped on Laurel Canon's music licensing website with the blurb \\"as good as anything Evan has ever done ‚Äì perfect chamber-pop-folk.\\" A Mighty Forces track called \\"Northstar\\" was posted to SoundCloud, though it was apparently a remix of a 2010 Square On Square song and not a new recording. The Mighty Forces album described on the site was never released. Fire At Sea In October 2013, Slamka released a self-titled EP under the name Fire At Sea digitally on Bandcamp. The EP featured songs performed with Wendy Wang of The Sweet Hurt. Nic Johns, Joachim Cooder, Lem Jay Ignacio, and John Rausch all played on the EP. Marjorie Fair reformed In November 2013, Slamka posted a photo to the Marjorie Fair Facebook page with an image of a Macintosh desktop folder labeled FINAL MIXES MASTERED. A week later, Slamka posted a montage of unreleased Marjorie Fair recordings to SoundCloud (now deleted) under the pseudonym oleofontana. Another performance video by Slamka, \\"Let Love Be Free,\\" was posted on Facebook in May 2014. In August, Slamka posted a photo of a digital audio workstation with the caption \\"Hell freezes over as the uber talented Mark Chalecki puts the final mastering touch on....the 'record'\\" Chalecki, a former Capitol mastering engineer, counts albums by Grandaddy, Silversun Pickups and Mazzy Star among his many projects. Subsequent posts teased a new release with a photo of a CD-R labeled \\"MF 8-15-14\\" and hinting at the formation of a label, Psychic Bully Records. I Am My Own Rainbow In a series of posts in early 2015, Slamka teased cover art for a new Marjorie Fair album to be titled I Am My Own Rainbow. That April, Marjorie Fair contributed two new songs to the indie film The Last Treasure Hunt. In October 2015, a redesigned website appeared which featured a brand new Marjorie Fair recording, \\"Fields.\\" The track list includes ten songs: \\"Brothers and Sisters,\\" \\"Black Holes,\\" \\"Wandering Star,\\" \\"14th Century Man,\\" \\"Avalanche,\\" \\"Save Time,\\" \\"Northstar,\\" \\"Fields,\\" \\"Haven't You Heard?\\" and \\"Songbird.\\" Slamka confirmed in a forum post that three of the new Marjorie Fair songs were remixed from the 2010 Square On Square EP. \\"Northstar\\" is the most radically remixed of the three songs, with numerous additional keyboards, drum machine patterns and effects throughout.

He was born in Madrid, Kingdom of Spain. President of Real Madrid Mendoza became President of Real Madrid on 24 May 1985 when he was the only candidate at the elections for chairman of the club. He once again had no opponent in the next elections on 23 July 1988. Mendoza beat opposing candidate Alfonso Uss√≠a by 20% of the votes (15,005 to 10,531) in January 1991 to secure his third term. He won a fourth term in 1994. In the elections which were dominated by accusations of fraud, corruption and mismanagement of the club, he nevertheless managed to beat Florentino P√©rez by 700 votes. His first years leading the club were very successful and saw the rise of the La Quinta del Buitre. Real Madrid won a record 5 consecutive league titles and was considered one of the best teams in Europe at the time. However, the club never managed to win the European Cup during those years, losing memorable ties to clubs as Bayern Munich, PSV Eindhoven and Arrigo Sacchi's Milan. The second half of Mendoza's presidency was marked by a slow decline in the successes of the club, a fact that was highlighted by a very strong Barcelona team. In 1995, he was forced to give up the presidency after admitting that the club had a debt of 14. million pesetas. He was succeeded by Lorenzo Sanz, who had been vice-president during his last term. Mendoza's ten years at the helm of the club make his presidency the third longest in the history of Real Madrid after the presidency of Santiago Bernab√©u (1943‚Äì1978) and Florentino P√©rez (2009‚Äìpresent). Bernab√©u and P√©rez aer also the only presidents to accumulate more trophies than Mendoza with Real Madrid. In total with Mendoza as president, the club won 6 league titles, 2 cups, 1 UEFA Cup and 3 Super Cups. Death Mendoza died at the age of 73 on 4 April 2001 while on holidays in Nassau, the Bahamas.

Tymbou is under the de facto control of Northern Cyprus. After 1960, the village was inhabited exclusively by Greek Cypriots; in 1973, they numbered 1,288. The original population fled the village in 1974, following the Turkish Invasion of Cyprus. As of 2011, Tymbou had a population of 384. The primary civilian airport of Northern Cyprus, Ercan International Airport, is located directly north of the village.  Location  Tymbou is located to the east of Nicosia, off the old Nicosia ‚Äì Famagusta road. It lies in the Mesaoria plain, next to Yialias river, at an altitude of . To the south of the village lie the now-uninhabited villages of Margo and Pyrogi, while Louroujina, south of Tymbou, is still inhabited by Turkish Cypriots.  Nearby airport  Tymbou Airport, the precursor of Ercan International Airport, was constructed by the British in World War II as a military airport, during their colonial rule of the island. It was abandoned after the independence of Cyprus. Following the Turkish invasion, it was expanded and today it is used as the main civilian airport of Northern Cyprus.  History  The name Tymbou is believed to come from the tombs (Greek ) located in caves and caverns to the north of the present village near the airport. First written records of the name Tymbou can be found on a document from the Frankish (Lusignian) occupation of the island during the reign of the Frankish king Jacob II (1460-1473 AD). The document granted feudal rights of the area to Pierre Coul. During the Ottoman period it was a large √ßiflik (farming area which included the entire village) belonging to wealthy Greek landowner in 1813 named Demetris Pavlides. From 1821 it became the property of a local Turkish administrator Halil Shindar (?). After the end of Turkish rule it returned to Greek hands. The Greek population of the village grew from 278 in 1881 to 1133 in 1960 and 1288 in 1973. The village church dedicated to Ayios Yeorgios (Saint George) was built in 1875. However some of the icons in the church date back to the 17th and 18th centuries. A cave - turned church near the village dedicated to the Forty Martyrs (Œ£Œ±œÅŒ¨ŒΩŒ±œÑŒ± ŒúŒ¨œÅœÑœÖœÅŒµœÇ) was later turned into a mosque named Kirklar, the name used by the occupying power for the village of Tymbou.

Around Lake Pontchartrain, for example, these few factors produce wetlands including bottomland hardwoods, cypress swamp, freshwater marsh and brackish marsh.

Vegetation, Water and Soil Characteristics of the Louisiana Coastal Region. Louisiana State University, Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin No. 664 Although these areas make up a very small percentage of the total land found in the United States, southern Louisiana contains 40 to 45 percent of the wetlands found in the lower states. This is because Louisiana is the drainage gateway to the Gulf of Mexico for the Lower Mississippi Regional Watershed. The Lower Mississippi Regional Watershed drains more than 24 million acres (97,000 km2) in seven states from southern Illinois to the Gulf of Mexico. Hence the wetlands of this area are important at the national scale.Gosselink, J. G., J. M. Coleman, and R. E. Stewart, Jr. 1998. Coastal Louisiana. pp. 385‚Äì436. In M. J. Mac, P. A. Opler, C. E. Puckett Haecker, and P. D. Doran 1998. Status and Trends of the Nation's Biological Resources, 2 Vols. Reston: U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey. On the east side of Louisiana, coastal wetlands intergrade with long leaf pine savannas, which support many rare and unusual species such as pitcher plants and gopher tortoises.Keddy, P.A. 2008. Water, Earth, Fire: Louisiana's Natural Heritage. Xlibris, Philadelphia. 229 p. On the western side, they intergrade with wet prairies, an ecosystem type that was once vast, and now has been all but eliminated. The larger vertebrate fauna such as wolves and bison was exterminated. The eastern coastline of Louisiana is much more susceptible to erosion than the western coastline because much of the eastern coastline was created by silt deposits from the Mississippi River. This natural process of sediment deposition has been blocked by an extensive levee system that directs flood water past wetlands.Keddy, P.A. 2010. Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation (2nd edition). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. 497 p. Figure 2.25, p. 73. The western coastline is marshy, but the marshes only extend inland by at the most, then the elevation begins to increase and the marshes fade into solid grounded prairies. Therefore, rising sea levels due to global warming and coastal erosion, may not affect the western coastline as profoundly as it will the eastern half, which may be replaced in open water over substantial areas. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) enacted the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (CZMA) amended by 16 U.S.C. 1451 et seq. that includes Louisiana, to develop plans providing assessment priorities for land conservation needs. The agency provides guidance in selecting conservation projects in the state. In 2002 the Secretary of Commerce was directed by Congress to establish the Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program (CELCP), \\"for the purpose of protecting important coastal and estuarine areas that have significant conservation, recreation, ecological, historical, or aesthetic values, or that are threatened by conversion from their natural or recreational state to other uses\\", through the Department of Commerce, Justice, and State Appropriations Act of 2002 by Public Law 107-77. This was re-authorized in 2009 by the Omnibus Public Land Management Act (P.L. 111-11). In 2002, Congress directed the Secretary of Commerce to establish a Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program (CELCP) \\"for the purpose of protecting important coastal and estuarine areas that have significant conservation, recreation, ecological, historical, or aesthetic values, or that are threatened by conversion from their natural or recreational state to other uses\\" (The Department of Commerce, Justice, and State Appropriations Act of 2002, Public Law 107-77). CELCP was re-authorized in 2009 as part of the Omnibus Public Land Management Act (P.L. 111-11). The Louisiana Department of Natural Resources, Office of Coastal Management, Inter-agency Affairs and Field Service Division (LDNR/OCM/IAFSD) became the lead agency for implementing a state coastal management program, or CELCP program, based on federal guidelines. Louisiana chose the conditionally approved Coastal Nonpoint Pollution Control Program (CNPCP) boundaries. On January 23, 2008, the Governor of Louisiana signed Executive Order No. BJ 2008-7, creating the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA), that implemented the Integrated Ecosystem Restoration and Hurricane Protection plan, becoming known as the \\"Master Plan.\\" Wetlands The Louisiana coastal zone stretches from the border of Texas to the Mississippi lineLA Department of Natural Resources, Coastal Zone Boundary and comprises two wetland-dominated ecosystems, the Deltaic Plain of the Mississippi River (unit 1, 2, and 3) and the closely linked Chenier Plain (unit 4).JSTOR: Relative Sea-Level Rise in Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico: 1908-1988: Authors; Shea Penland and Karen E.

Wetlands provide vital ecological services including flood control, fisheries production, carbon storage, water filtration and enhanced disagreement over the relative importance of these factors, although it is probably safe to say that the two major factors now acting are subsidence, mostly from lack of sediment, and salt water intrusion from canals dredged to service oil and gas wells and facilitate oil and gas exploration. Further wetland loss is attributed to the construction of the now-closed Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, which introduced salt water into freshwater and intermediate marshes and facilitated significant erosion.\\"Closing the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet: Environmental and Economic Considerations.\\" Coastal Wetlands Planning Protection and Restoration Act. Louisiana State Government. Web. 27 Feb 2013. http://lacoast.gov/new/Data/Reports/ITS/MRGO.pdf A brief explanation of various causes follows. Subsidence of the coast is certainly occurring. Some people blame the direct effects of oil and gas extraction. The logic is that as billions of barrels of oil and saltwater and as trillions of cubic feet of gas were removed from the reservoirs in which they had accumulated over millions of years, these reservoirs lost their ability to support the weight of the rocks above.E.P. Mallman and M.D. Zoback (2007), Subsidence in the Louisiana coastal zone due to hydrocarbon production. In: Lemckert, C. (ed.), International Coastal Symposium (ICS) 2007 Proceedings (Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia). Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 50, pp. 443‚Äì448. As these structures slowly collapsed, the soil above gradually subsided. The wetlands on the surface began to sink into the gulf waters. Others argue that subsidence is a natural process in deltas, as sediments compress, and that the real problem is the lack of flood waters that would normally deposit new layers of sediment.Boesch, D. F., Josselyn, M. N., Mehta, A. J., Morris, J. T., Nuttle, W. K., Simenstad, C. A., and Swift, D. P. J. (1994). Scientific assessment of coastal wetland loss, restoration and management in Louisiana. Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 20. The role of hurricanes is also a matter of disagreement; some studies show that hurricanes actually build elevation in marshes.Liu, K. and Fearn, M. L. (2000). Holocene history of catastrophic hurricane landfalls along the Gulf of Mexico coast reconstructed from coastal lake and marsh sediments. In Current Stresses and Potential Vulnerabilities: Implications of Global Change for the Gulf Coast Region of the United States, eds. Z. H. Ning and K. K. Abdollhai, pp. 38‚Äì47. Baton Rouge, LA: Franklin Press for Gulf Coast Regional Climate Change Council. Another factor is rising sea levels estimated to be about 2mm per yearhttp://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/globalregional.htm associated with global warming.Ricardo A. Olea and James L Coleman., Jr. (2014), A synoptic examination of causes of land loss in southern Louisiana as they relate to the exploitation of subsurface geologic resources. Journal of Coastal Research, v. 30, no. 5, p. 1025‚àí1044. Sediment compaction is also a significant source of wetland loss. Compaction rates have been conservatively estimated at 5mm to 10mm or more per year for the organic-rich Holocene sediment (peat) that predominates the Mississippi River Delta environment. Given the ubiquity of this compaction-prone sediment in southern Louisiana, coastal restoration project managers (see: Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority) must consider the underlying geology of their regions prior to development as to not exacerbate rates of compaction.T√∂rnqvist, Torbj√∂rn E., et al. \\"Mississippi Delta subsidence primarily caused by compaction of Holocene strata.\\" Nature Geoscience 1.3 (2008): 173-176. An extensive levee system aided by locks and dams has been developed in the waterways of the lower Mississippi River.Reuss, M. (1998). Designing the Bayous: The Control of Water in the Atchafalaya Basin 1800‚Äì1995. Alexandria, VA: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Office of History. The levees (designed to prevent flooding along the waterways) prevent needed sediment from being distributed into the marshes downriver. With no new accretion and with steady subsidence, the wetlands slowly are replaced by encroaching saltwater from the Gulf. As a result of this apparent engineering dilemma, large areas of marsh are being lost to the ocean. Since 1930 water has consumed more than 1,900 square miles (4,900 km2) of the state's land. This loss equates to the disappearance of 25 square miles (65 km2) of wetlands each year, or a football field sized area every 30 minutes. This loss can be reversed (at least in some areas) but, only with large scale restoration, including the removal of levees to allow the Mississippi River to carry sediment into these areas.Turner, R. E. and Streever, B. 2002. Approaches to Coastal Wetland Restoration: Northern Gulf of Mexico. The Hague, the Netherlands: SPB Academic Publishing. Another factor that damaged wetlands was large scale logging, particularly the extensive logging of cypress forests in the early 1900s. One early logger described it this way: \\"We just use the old method of going in and cutting down the swamp and tearing it up and bringing the cypress out. When a man's in here with all the heavy equipment, he might as well cut everything he can make a board foot out of; we're not ever coming back in here again\\".Keddy, P.A. 2008. Water, Earth, Fire: Louisiana's Natural Heritage. Xlibris, Philadelphia. 229 p. P. 122. This logging often required construction of canals, which, once the logging was finished, allowed salt water to enter the wetlands and prevent regeneration of the cypress. As if these problems were not enough, the introduction of nutria from South America in the 1930s provided an entirely new species of grazing mammal. Although only a few escaped, there are now millions.Keddy, P.A. 2008. Water, Earth, Fire: Louisiana's Natural Heritage. Xlibris, Philadelphia. 229 p. P. 148-150. Natural grazing by muskrat was now accelerated by grazing from nutria. By removing plants, nutria both cause loss of vegetation, and, perhaps more seriously, a loss of dead organic matter which would otherwise accumulate as peat and raise the level of the marshKeddy, P.A. 2000. Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. 614 p. P. 163-165. One of the most important natural controls on nutria is large alligators, which may provide a useful tool for biological control of nutria, and therefore for reduced impacts of grazing.Keddy, P.A., L.

Grosholz, and M.D. Bertness (eds.) Human Impacts on Salt Marshes. A Global Perspective. University of California Press, Berkeley, CA. Southern Louisiana's disappearing wetlands have a broad impact ranging from cultural to economic. Commercial fishing in Louisiana accounts for more than 300 million dollars of the state's economy. More than 70% of that amount stems from species such as shrimp, oysters and blue crabs that count on the coastal wetlands as a nursery for their young. Annually Louisiana sells more than 330,000 hunting licenses and 900,000 fishing licenses to men and women who depend on the wetlands as a habitat for their game. Additional recreational activities such as boating, swimming, camping, hiking, birding, photography and painting are abundant in wetland areas. Wetlands host a variety of trees such as the bald cypress, tupelo gum and cottonwood. Other plants such as the dwarf palmetto and wax myrtle and submerged aquatic plants such as Vallisneria and Ruppia are native to Louisiana wetlands. Wetland plants act as natural filters, helping to remove heavy metals, sewage, and pesticides from polluted water before reaching the Gulf of Mexico. Animal species native to these areas include osprey, anhinga, ibis, herons, egrets, manatees, alligators, and beavers. Although there are several naturally occurring forces that adversely affect the wetland regions of Louisiana, many believe it is human intervention that has caused the majority of the decline.Tidwell, Mike. The Ravaging Tide: Strange Weather, Future Katrinas, and the Coming Death of America's Coastal Cities, Free Press, 2006. Prior to the building of levees on the Mississippi River, the wetlands were kept in balance by occasional floods, which fill the area with sediment, and subsidence, the sinking of land. After the levees were built, however, flood sediment flowed directly into the Gulf of Mexico. This subsidence along with the recent sea level rise tipped the balance toward subsidence rather than marsh growth. This, along with the canals built in the area, caused decline of the wetlands and also caused less weakening of and less protection from recent hurricanes such as Hurricane Katrina. The Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation has developed a comprehensive management planhttp://www.saveourlake.org/management-plan.php for the eastern regions of the Louisiana coast, placing emphasis upon restoration of river habitats, cypress swamps and fringing marsh. This could be a model applied to other coastal regions. = Oil company canals = The dredging of access canals by oil companies has long been considered to be a cause of coastal erosion. These concerns were raised in 1925 and continued with a 2013 lawsuit against many oil companies.Tulane Environmental Law Journal The Reckoning: Oil and Gas Development in the Louisiana Coastal Zone (pp. 192-198)- Retrieved 2017-11-12  See also  *Atchafalaya Basin *Coastal management *Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection and Restoration Act *Hurricane Rita *Hurricane Katrina *Mississippi River Delta *National Wetlands Research Center *Swamp People *Hurricane on the Bayou *Chemistry of wetland dredging References External links * \\"Louisiana Wetlands\\", National Geographic * \\"Lessons on the Lake - Why Worry About Wetlands?\\", U.S. Geological Survey * \\"Louisiana's Wetlands Are Sinking Under Pressure\\", LaCoast.gov * \\"Louisiana Coastal Wetlands: A Resource At Risk\\", U.S. Geological Survey - Marine and Coastal Geology Program * \\"Trends and Causes of Historical Wetland Loss In Coastal Louisiana\\", U.S. Geological Survey * Wetland Challenge Quiz Answer Key * Hurricane on the Bayou movie ","title":"Wetlands of Louisiana"},{"id":"3023990","text":"Kim Kardashian in Shapewear-dress A foundation garment (also known as shapewear or shaping underwear) is an undergarment designed to impermanently alter the wearer's body shape, to achieve what some view as a more fashionable figure. The function of a foundation garment is not to enhance a bodily feature (as would, for example, a padded bra) but to make it look more presentable. Specific styles of foundation garments have been essential to some fashion movements, and were required in some social situations during various fashion periods. History Women have worn foundation garments, such as corsets and brassieres, for a very long time.Valerie Steele, The Corset: a cultural history, Yale University Press, 2001, . Foundation garments were patented by Marion M Chubby in 1965 (categorized in elastic corsets). Debenhams recorded a 75% increase in shapewear sales between 2009 and 2013.Irish Examiner, 18 August 2013  Description  Foundation garments are worn to emphasize body shape. They usually require technological advances in garment design and light-weight fabrics to create different body figures. A foundation garment may be worn for a specific outfit. Being underwear, the foundation garment should not be visible under the outerwear. A general purpose \\"all the way\\" shaper with clear straps that starts at the bust and ends at the knee or mid-calf is also available. Foundation garments may come with a built-in strapless bra for dresses and halters. In a broader definition, a foundation garment is a piece of garment that provides body- redefining shapes such as a bra. Garments may be categorized according to level or shape control offered, for instance, light, medium or firm. The simplest foundation is a body-liner or bodysuit, which is an ultra-light- weight leotard and offers a light touch of smoothing. These are available in a unitard style (shortened legs) or a camisole-leotard style. The leotard is better and is available in boy-leg and Capri-leg lengths, with spaghetti straps, low cut necklines, and even scoop backs, to cater to the outerwear under which the garments will be worn. These softly smooth the figure and provide light support. Micro-fiber camisoles and boy-leg briefs or \\"hot pants\\" are also available. Girdles are often called \\"body shapers\\" or \\"contour garments\\". These garments are made with more Lycra spandex as compared to the 10% Lycra / 90% cotton blend of most leotards, and they offer the highest level of shaping and support.

Passing through downtown Bakersfield, SR 204 also connects Bakersfield's three major freeways together (SR 99, SR 58, and SR 178). Only the northern has been built to freeway standards; the rest is a six-lane arterial road. All of SR 204 is a part of State Route 99 Business (SR 99 Bus.). The business route also continues south, where it meets with SR 99. Route description SR 204 begins as a six-lane arterial at SR 58 as Union Avenue. From there, the route travels north on Union Avenue. After intersecting California Avenue, SR 204 crosses underneath the Truxtun Avenue interchange. At the Union Avenue wye intersection, the route turns northwest as Golden State Avenue. It then crosses SR 178 and Garces Circle, which provides access to Downtown Bakersfield. The route then crosses F Street, at which point it becomes a four-lane freeway. The route crosses its only numbered interchange at Airport Drive, and then terminates at SR 99. SR 204 is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. History Before the 1964 renumbering, State Route 204 was known as Legislative Route 141. It was created in 1933 as a western bypass to Bakersfield via Brundage Lane and Oak Street. At that time, US 99 (defined by the State as Legislative Route 4) ran through Bakersfield via Chester Avenue, and through Oildale (north of Bakersfield) via Roberts Lane. LRN 141 started at the intersection of US 99 (Chester Avenue) and Brundage Lane, where it traveled west to Oak Street. At Oak Street, the route turned north, crossed the Kern River, and terminated at US 99 (Roberts Lane) near Beardsley School in Oildale.Routes 137-144. CAHighway.org. Accessed: 2009-10-18. In the mid-1930s, US 99 was moved from Chester Avenue/Roberts Lane to Union Avenue/Golden State Avenue. During the late 1950s, the Union Avenue wye, Truxtun Avenue interchange, and Chester Avenue interchange (with the bridge over Garces Circle) were constructed to improve traffic flow. However, when the US 99 freeway bypass was constructed in 1963, Caltrans decided to use the Oak Street route around the city instead of the Union Avenue route through the city. As a result, the route designations were swapped. The freeway parallel to Oak Street would become US 99. LRN 141 would become the US 99 bypass via Brundage Lane, Union Avenue, and Golden State Avenue. That designation never took effect because in 1963 all of the state highways were renumbered. As a result, LRN 141 became SR 204. Its definition was also simplified to bypass SR 99 via Union Avenue and Golden State Avenue, although that change lengthened the route. In 1978, the route was shortened to connect SR 58 to SR 99 via Union Avenue and Golden State Avenue, which was close to the original 1963 definition. Future Bakersfield has considered several times to convert all or part of SR 204 to a freeway. In 1986, part of the route was considered as the western extension of SR 178.Route 178 Corridor Study . KernCOG. December 1986. Pages 28-29. Accessed: 2009-10-18. However, that study (which was not a formal route adoption study) recommended another alignment for the freeway.

It has been replaced by FM 2-22.3 Human Intelligence Collector Operations.  Interrogations during the 'global war on terror'  Release of the replacement manual in 2006 During the American War on Terror, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld issued a set of so-called \\"enhanced interrogation techniques\\" that authorized conduct widely considered to be torture. This authorization was based on a series of controversial legal memos authored by the Office of Legal Counsel that sought to define torture far more narrowly than before. These authorizations were highly controversial, particularly in the wake of the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse scandal. Various revisions of the extended techniques were issued. Rumsfeld intended the extended techniques to be used only on the captives the United States classified as \\"illegal combatants\\". However, extended interrogation techniques were adopted in Iraq, even though captives there were entitled to protection under the Geneva Conventions. General Geoffrey Miller, who was then the director of interrogation of detainees held in Guantanamo Bay, and some of his staff were sent to Iraq to help transfer their interrogation experience. Military intelligence troops had been using extended techniques in Afghanistan, notably Captain Carolyn Wood. General Ricardo Sanchez, the commander of American ground forces in Iraq, issued his own set of extended techniques after input from Miller and his team, and from Captain Wood.  Detainee Treatment Act  On July 25, 2005, Senator John McCaina POW and torture victim during the Vietnam Warsubmitted an amendment to a military spending bill, intended to restrict all US government interrogators from using interrogation techniques not authorized in the Army Field Manual. On October 20, 2005, Vice President Dick Cheney met with McCain to try to convince him to agree that his amendment should only apply to military interrogators. Cheney wanted to continue to allow civilian interrogators, working for US intelligence agencies, to use more extended interrogation techniques. McCain did not agree. McCain's amendment passed, and is now called the Detainee Treatment Act.  Plans to revise the manual to allow extended techniques  On April 28, 2005, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld announced that the Army would be revising the manual. The revised manual would have spelled out more clearly which interrogation techniques were prohibited. On December 14, 2005, The New York Times reported that the Army Field Manual had been rewritten by the Pentagon. Previously, the manual's interrogation techniques section could be read freely on the internet; the new edition included 10 classified pages in the interrogation technique section, leaving the public no indication about what the government considered not to be torture.New Army Rules May Snarl Talks With McCain on Detainee Issue, The New York Times, December 14, 2005 - mirror On June 5, 2006, the Los Angeles Times reported that the Pentagon's revisions would remove the proscription against \\"humiliating and degrading treatment\\", and other proscriptions from article 3 of the third Geneva Convention.Geneva references omitted from revised Army interrogation manual , JURIST, June 5, 2006 Army Manual to Skip Geneva Detainee Rule, Los Angeles Times, June 5, 2006 The LA Times reported that the State Department had argued against the revisions because of the effect it would have on the world's opinion of the United States. In 2006, there was an ongoing debate over whether the interrogation section should be classified. The New York Times reported that the Pentagon was considering making the interrogation section public once again, but the Pentagon made no formal announcement of its intentions. On September 6, 2006, the U.S. Army announced the publication of Field Manual (FM) 2-22.3, \\"Human Intelligence Collector Operations\\". The Army's news release stated that Field Manual 2-22.3 replaced Field Manual 34-52 (published in 1992).

Background He was born 6 May 1729. Murray was the eldest son of Lord George Murray, fifth son of John Murray, 1st Duke of Atholl. James Murray and George Murray were his younger brothers. Political career For some time he was captain in a company of Lord Loudoun's regiment of foot, afterwards the 54th. Murray sat as Member of Parliament for Perthshire from 1761 to 1764. On 8 January 1764, his uncle and father-in-law, the 2nd Duke of Atholl, died. Murray should have been heir to the dukedom, which was only able to descend through the male line; but he was ineligible since his father had fought in the Jacobite Rising of 1745 and had consequently been attainted in the blood. However, on 7 February 1764, the House of Lords deemed Murray the rightful heir to his uncle's title (notwithstanding the attainder of his father) and he succeeded him as 3rd Duke of Atholl. He was elected a Scottish Representative Peer in 1766. His wife, on the death of her father, the second duke, succeeded to the sovereignty of the Isle of Man, and to the ancient English barony of Strange, of Knockyn, Wotton, Mohun, Burnel, Basset, and Lacy. For some time negotiations had been in progress with the English government for the union of the sovereignty with the English crown; and in 1765 an act of parliament was passed to give effect to a contract between the lords of the treasury and the Duke and Duchess of Atholl for the purchase of the sovereignty of Man and its dependencies for ¬£70,000, the duke and duchess retaining their manorial rights, the patronage of the bishopric and other ecclesiastical benefices, the fisheries, minerals, &c.; The arrangement rendered them very unpopular in Man, and the 42nd Regiment of Foot, or Black Watch, under Lord John Murray, had to be stationed in the island to maintain order. The money received by the duke and duchess was directed to be laid out and invested in the purchase of lands of inheritance in Scotland, to be inalienably entailed on a certain series of heirs. The duke and duchess had also a grant of an annuity of ¬£2,000 for their lives. Atholl was chosen a representative peer in succession to the Earl of Sutherland, who died 21 August 1764, and he was reelected in 1768. In 1767, he was invested with the Order of the Thistle. He was Grand Master of the Ancient Grand Lodge of England from 1771 until 1774, and Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Scotland from 1773 to 1774. He died at Dunkeld on 5 November 1774. Family Atholl married his first cousin, Lady Charlotte, daughter of James Murray, 2nd Duke of Atholl, at Dunkeld, on 23 October 1753. They had nine children: * Lady Charlotte Murray (1754-1808) * John Murray, 4th Duke of Atholl (1755-1830) * The Right Reverend Lord George Murray (1761-1803) * Lord William Murray (1762-1796); married Mary Ann Hodges, granddaughter if Sir James Hodges, Town Clerk of the City of London. They had a son, and daughter. * Lady Amelia Murray (1763-1818); unmarried. * Lady Jane Murray (1764-1846); married John Grosset Muirhead.

Kashk is made from drained yogurt (in particular, drained qatiq) or drained sour milk by forming it and letting it dry. It can be made in a variety of forms, including rolled into balls, sliced into strips, and formed into chunks. There are three main kinds of food products with this name: foods based on curdled milk products like yogurt or cheese; foods based on barley broth, bread, or flour; and foods based on cereals combined with curdled milk. Background Balls of kashk at Chorsu Bazaar, Tashkent, Uzbekistan Kashk is a fermented food that is made from grain mixed with sour milk or yogurt, but in modern times is also used for a separate dish of dried buttermilk that can be crumbled and turned into a paste with water. Fermented milk products are affected by numerous factors including the species of milk-producing animal, heat treatment processes for raw milk, fat content of milk, fermentation temperature, and inoculation percentage. Drying allows a longer shelf life for the product. This coarse powder can be used to thicken soups and stews and improve their flavor, or as an ingredient in various meat, rice or vegetable dishes such as the Persian eggplant dish kashk e bademjan. The ancient form of the dish was a porridge of grains fermented with whey and dried in the sun. The long shelf-life and nutritional value of kashk made it a useful item for peasants during the winter months, or soldiers and travelers. Kashk in different languages and cultures Kashk is found in the cuisines of Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Egypt, the Caucasus, and Turkey. This expansive geographic area contains different language groups contributing to the complexity of pinpointing the development and usage of this term. In some languages it is called kashk or kishkh, (, , , ), qurut in others (, , , , , , , ). There are many varied names for this class of dishes including jameed (), chortan () and aaruul (). According to Francoise Aubaile-Sallenave, the first known literary use of the term comes from the Armenian historian Yeghishe. Chortan is mentioned in the Armenian epic poem Daredevils of Sassoun. First put into written form in the 19th century, the poem is said to be based an 8th century oral tradition. In the 10th-century Persian Shahnameh (\\"Book of Kings\\") by Firdausi the term is used in the sense of \\"barley flour\\", but it's also used for a mixture of cracked wheat and cracked barley. Aubaile-Sallenave argues that the original Persian kashk known from early Persian literature was made with barley that contained either a mix of leaven with water or some fermented milk. To answer questions about the modern meaning in Iran for a dried dairy dish she argued \\"Iranian speaking pastorialists, for whom dried sour milk was a staple, and who had no easy access to barley, applied the word kashk by analogy to dry sour milk\\". Charles Perry offers an alternate explanation based on the 13th century Arabic cookbook Wasf al-Atimah al- Mutadah which says dried yogurt was a Turkomen style \\"kashk\\". By the Middle Ages the word had two meanings, one referring to barley flour or a mix of barley and cracked wheat, and another to mean a meat or fowl dish cooked overnight (kashak or kashba). A 10th century Arabic cookbook describes two types of kashk, one made of wheat and leaven and another of sour milk. Kashk is the origin of tarhana found in the moderns cuisines of Turkey and Greece, where it is called trachanas (). Preparation Kyrgyzstan To make the dried yogurt qurut a traditional or modern method can be used. For the modern method sour yogurt is blended until smooth, then boiled and strained. It is left to ferment in a warm oven for several days, then the moisture is strained and blended with salt to make the kashk. The drained liquid can be used to make qaraqorut (\\"dried black whey\\"). For traditionally prepared qurut water is added to full fat yogurt and poured into a goatskin \\"churn\\" - a sack hung from a tripod that is swung back and forth until the milk separates into a type of butter and buttermilk. The buttermilk is boiled and drained to obtain curd which is dried in the sun over a period of weeks to make qurut. While traveling in the Baluchistan English explorer Ernest Ayscoghe Floyer encountered this form of kashk: Kurdish women preparing kashk in a village in Turkey > ...from the butter manufacture is left the buttermilk called \\"d≈çgh.\\" This is > boiled, and the remainder is \\"luch\\"; this is pressed and dried, and becomes > \\"shilanch\\", or in Persian, \\"kashk,\\" a hard, white biscuit of very sour > cheese. This is powdered, and, boiled with savory herbs, is very palatable. When kashk is made with grain in the Armenian, Arab and Turkish cuisines strained yogurt is added to grain and stored until it begins to ferment. After being left to dry in the sun for over a week it is turned into a coarse powder by rubbing and sifting. Regional cuisines = Caucasus = Matzoon in Armenia and mats'oni in Georgia, is a commonly used ingredient in Caucasian cuisine. One of the ways matzoon is used is for the production of butter. When matsun is churned it separates from the buttermilk. By boiling and churning the buttermilk one obtains ricotta cheese. The product obtained by drying the ricotta clots is called chortan; chor means \\"dry\\" and tan means \\"buttermilk\\" in the Armenian language. In Azerbaijan, qurut is made in a similar way from strained yogurt. Yogurt (qatiq) is made from fresh milk and strained to make suzma qatiq. When the buttermilk \\"whey\\" has been separated from the butter using traditional methods the buttermilk curds are formed into small balls and dried in the sun. In western parts of Azerbaijan boiled flat dough is layered with a qurut white sauce and chicken to make Azerbaijani x…ông…ôl. = Central Asia = Qurutob from Tajik cuisine Qurut dissolved in water is a primary ingredient of qurutob, which is thought of by some as the national dish of Tajikistan. One of the main dishes in Afghanistan is kichree qurut, made with mung beans, rice and qurut dissolved in water. It is sometimes salted, and in Mongolia can be flavoured and distributed as candy. =Iran= Iranian kashk In modern Iran, kashk is a thick whitish liquid similar to whey or sour cream, used in traditional Persian and Kurdish cuisine, like ash reshteh, kashk e badamjan, kale joush. It is available as a liquid or in a dried form, which needs to be soaked and softened before it can be used in cooking. Kashk was traditionally produced from the leftovers of cheese-making (more specifically, the milk used to make it). The procedure is, subtracting butter from milk, the remainder is doogh which can be used as the base for kashk. The water is subtracted from this whitish beverage and what remains is kashk which can be dried. Iranian kashk has made an appearance in US markets in the past half- century by several Iranian grocers starting with Kashk Hendessi. =Turkey= In Turkey, kashk is a dried yoghurt product also known as ke≈ü peyniri, kurut, ta≈ü yoƒüurt, kuru yoƒüurt, or katƒ±k ke≈üi./ Its contents and production vary by region. In western and northern Turkey, especially in Bolu, the product is categorized as a cheese owing to its shape and white color. In eastern Turkey, especially Erzincan, Erzurum, and Kars, kurut is produced from skimmed yoghurt made from the whey left over from production of butter by the yayƒ±k method,Karabulut I, Hayaloƒülu AA, Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m H. 2007.

In parts of southeastern Turkey with a significant Kurdish population, it is called ke≈ük. All versions of this dairy product are salty. It is used as an ingredient in soups, ke≈ükek, eri≈üte, etc. There is also a closely related dried food product called tarhana which is based on a fermented mixture of grain and yoghurt or fermented milk. It is very similar to kishk of the Levantine cuisine described below. =Levant and Arabian Peninsula= In Lebanon, Palestine, Arabian Peninsula and Syria, kishk is a powdery cereal of burghul (cracked wheat) fermented with milk and laban (yogurt), usually from goat milk. It is easily stored and is valuable to the winter diet of isolated villagers or country people. Kishk is prepared in early autumn following the preparation of burghul. Milk, laban and burghul are mixed well together and allowed to ferment for nine days. Each morning the mixture is thoroughly kneaded with the hands. When fermentation is complete the kishk is spread on a clean cloth to dry. Finally it is rubbed well between the hands until it is reduced to a powder and then stored in a dry place. In Jordan a dried yogurt similar to kashk called jameed is commonly used. Elsewhere in the Levant, similar products are referred to as drained labneh (labneh malboudeh). A 10th-century recipe for kishk recorded in the Kitab al-Tabikh was made by par-boiling dehulled wheat, milling it and blending it with chickpea flour. Yeast, salt and water were added to make a dough from the flour, which was left in the sun for around 2 weeks, and re- moistened with sour yogurt (or sour grape juice) as needed. After 15 days the dough would be seasoned with mint, purslane, cilantro, rue, parsley, garlic and the leafy tops of leeks, shaped into disks, and allowed to dry in the sun.

Thomson, Faraday usually discusses lines of force as chains of polarized particles in a dielectric, yet sometimes Faraday discusses them as having an existence all their own as in stretching across a vacuum.Notes on Recent Researches in Electricity and Magnetism, Joseph John Thomson, James Clerk Maxwell, 1883 In addition to lines of force, J.J. Thomson‚Äîsimilar to Maxwell‚Äîalso calls them tubes of electrostatic inductance, or simply Faraday tubes. From the 20th century perspective, lines of force are energy linkages embedded in a 19th- century unified field theory that led to more mathematically and experimentally sophisticated concepts and theories, including Maxwell's equations, electromagnetic waves, and Einstein's relativity. Lines of force originated with Michael Faraday, whose theory holds that all of reality is made up of force itself. His theory predicts that electricity, light, and gravity have finite propagation delays. The theories and experimental data of later scientific figures such as Maxwell, Hertz, Einstein, and others are in agreement with the ramifications of Faraday's theory. Nevertheless, Faraday's theory remains distinct. Unlike Faraday, Maxwell and others (e.g., J.J. Thomson) thought that light and electricity must propagate through an ether. In Einstein's relativity, there is no ether, yet the physical reality of force is much weaker than in the theories of Faraday.Fields of Force, William Berkson, 1974Forces and Fields, Mary B. Hesse, 1961 Historian Nancy J. Nersessian in her paper \\"Faraday's Field Concept\\" distinguishes between the ideas of Maxwell and Faraday:Faraday Rediscovered: Essays on the Life and Work of Michael Faraday, 1791-1867, David Gooding, Frank A. J. L. James, Stockton Press, 1985, , , 258 pages, page 183- > The specific features of Faraday's field concept, in its 'favourite' and > most complete form, are that force is a substance, that it is the only > substance and that all forces are interconvertible through various motions > of the lines of force. These features of Faraday's 'favourite notion' were > not carried on. Maxwell, in his approach to the problem of finding a > mathematical representation for the continuous transmission of electric and > magnetic forces, considered these to be states of stress and strain in a > mechanical aether. This was part of the quite different network of beliefs > and problems with which Maxwell was working. Views of Faraday At first Faraday considered the physical reality of the lines of force as a possibility, yet several scholars agree that for Faraday their physical reality became a conviction. One scholar dates this change in the year 1838.The Origins of Field Theory, L. Pearce Williams (Cornell University), 1966, Random House, p. 88 (a) , p.124 (b) Another scholar dates this final strengthening of his belief in 1852.Energy, Force, and Matter, P.M. Harman, 1982, Cambridge University Press, p. 80 Faraday experimentally studied lines of magnetic force and lines of electrostatic force, showing them not to fit action at a distance models. In 1852 Faraday wrote the paper \\"On the Physical Character of the Lines of Magnetic Force\\" which examined gravity, radiation, and electricity, and their possible relationships with the transmission medium, transmission propagation, and the receiving entity. Views of Maxwell Initially, Maxwell took an agnostic approach in his mathematization of Faraday's theories. This is seen in Maxwell's 1855 and 1856 papers: \\"On Faraday's Lines of Force\\" and \\"On Faraday's Electrotontic State\\". In the 1864 paper \\"A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field\\" Maxwell gives scientific priority of the electromagnetic theory of light to Faraday and his 1846 paper \\"Thoughts on Ray Vibrations\\". Maxwell wrote: > Faraday discovered that when a plane polarized ray traverses a transparent > diamagnetic medium in the direction of the lines of magnetic force produced > by magnets or currents in the neighborhood, the plane of polarization is > caused to rotate. > The conception of the propagation of transverse magnetic disturbances to the > exclusion of normal ones is distinctly set forth by Professor Faraday in his > \\"Thoughts on Ray Vibrations.\\" The electromagnetic theory of light, as > proposed by him, is the same in substance as that which I have begun to > develop in this paper, except that in 1846 there was no data to calculate > the velocity of propagation. Tube of force Maxwell changed Faraday's phrase lines of force to tubes of force, when expressing his fluidic assumptions involved in his mathematization of Faraday's theories. A tube of force, also called a tube of electrostatic induction or field tube, are the lines of electric force which moves so that its beginning traces a closed curve on a positive surface, its end will trace a corresponding closed curve on the negative surface, and the line of force itself will generate an inductive tubular surface. Such a tube is called a \\"Solenoid\\". There is a pressure at right angles to a tube of force of one half the product of the dielectric and magnetic density. If through the growth of a field the tubes of force are spread sideways or in width there is a magnetic reaction to that growth in intensity of electric current. However, if a tube of force is caused to move endwise there is little or no drag to limit velocity. Tubes of force are absorbed by bodies imparting momentum and gravitational mass. Tubes of force are a group of electric lines of force. Magnetic curves Early on in his research (circa 1831), Faraday calls the patterns of apparently continuous curves traced out in metallic filings near a magnet magnetic curves. Later on he refers to them as just an instance of magnetic lines of force or simply lines of force.Faraday's Experimental Researches in Electricity: The First Series, Howard J. Fisher, 2004, Green Lion Press, p. 22 et al. Eventually Faraday would also begin to use the phrase \\"magnetic field\\".Colin A.

He has also spent several years as a member of Beck's backing band, contributed to several recordings by the band Air, and toured or recorded with acts such as Jay-Z, Blink 182, and Johnny Cash. In 2005, he released his first solo record, Solid State Warrior, followed with Robo- Sapiens (as \\"Mailibu\\", 2007), Catnip Dynamite (2008), and Glamping (2018). He is usually credited by his full name to avoid confusion with the folk musician Roger Manning. Early life Roger Joseph Manning Jr. was born May 27, 1966, the first child of Roger Manning, a businessman for Monroe Calculators, and Jane DeLara, a schoolteacher. He has two brothers: Chris (born October 6, 1968) and Tim (born September 10, 1970). The family later moved from Valencia, California to Pleasanton. As a child, Roger was enamored with ragtime music and took piano lessons; later he taught himself to play the drums. The first records he bought with his own money were Kiss' Alive! (1975) and the Beach Boys' Endless Summer (1974). Jellyfish Manning attended Amador Valley High School in Pleasanton in the 1970s. There, he met drummer Andy Sturmer. After graduating, Manning moved to Los Angeles and enrolled at USC to study musical composition. He involved himself with the local scene and began auditioning for various bands. He later joined Sturmer in the San Francisco band Beatnik Beatch. Sturmer was the group's drummer, singer, and songwriter, while Manning was keyboardist. The duo soon began collaborating with one another, writing compositions that were stylistically different from the songs the band was producing at the time.. In August 1989, a year after Atlantic Records released Beatnik Beatch's eponymous debut album, Manning and Sturmer left the group to continue songwriting with one another and formed the band Jellyfish. Jellyfish released two albums: Bellybutton (1990) and Spilt Milk (1993), whose combined sales totaled over 269,000 copies. During this era, Sturmer and Manning worked with Ringo Starr, for his 1992 solo album Time Takes Time, and Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys. Wilson and Jellyfish had one songwriting session and it was unproductive; Manning described the experience as \\"utterly surreal\\". By 1994, Manning and Sturmer were drifting apart musically, and in May, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that Jellyfish had disintegrated due to \\"creative differences\\". Afterward, Manning formed the short-lived glam outfit Imperial Drag with ex-Jellyfish guitarist Eric Dover. The Moog Cookbook Manning formed the Moog Cookbook with sound engineer Brian Kehew shortly after the demise of Jellyfish. It was conceived as both a parody of and tribute to the novelty Moog records of the late 1960s and early 1970s, which featured cover versions of popular songs using the then-new Moog synthesizer. Manning recalled that \\"When Brian and I finally met, we knew we had to do this, because we knew we could do it right, and we knew we had the resources ‚Äî before someone else did it, and did it wrong.\\" On stage and in their promotional materials, the band donned space-suit disguises that were similar to outfits worn by another emerging electronic duo, Daft Punk. This was reportedly only a coincidence. Moog Cookbook released two records, The Moog Cookbook (1996) and Ye Olde Space Bande (1997), before disbanding in 1998. According to Manning: \\"As creatively fulfilling as it was, Moog Cookbook was not financially viable. We weren't coming out of rave culture and house music like Daft Punk.\\" Music journalist Brian Chidester commented that the band \\"yielded solid overseas sales amidst the retro-obsessed landscape of Pulp Fiction, the Swing revival and thrift shop mania. The duo even ... found a small domestic audience attuned to similar electronic psych-pop coming out of Europe by bands like Stereolab, Mouse on Mars and the High Llamas.\\" Solo career In early 2006, Manning released his first solo album in Japan only: Solid State Warrior. He credited it under his full name to avoid confusion with the folk musician Roger Manning. It was subsequently issued in the U.S. under a different title, The Land of Pure Imagination, along with an altered song content.Prefix Mag. Review of The Land of Pure Imagination. Retrieved on 13 February 2016. The album included one of the songs Manning wrote with Brian Wilson, \\"Wish it Would Rain\\", albeit with Wilson's contributions omitted. In March 2008, Manning released his second solo album, Catnip Dynamite, in Japan only. It was released in the U.S. on February 3, 2009 with the addition of three bonus tracks that were recorded during a live performance at Fujifest in Japan. In 2019 Manning co-wrote and performed background vocals on the song \\"You'll Never Guess What Happened Today\\" with internet pioneer Jaye Muller, aka \\"Count Jaye\\" for his 2019 album release.

The aircraft is in the Canada Aviation and Space Museum. Zenair CH 601 HDS Zodiac Zenair CH 701 STOL Zenair Ltd is a Canadian kit aircraft producer founded by aeronautical engineer Chris Heintz and based in Midland, Ontario. History The company was founded in 1974 when Heintz started to manufacture Zenith kits from his two-car garage. Heintz has introduced more than twelve kit aircraft designs. In 1992, Heintz licensed the kit manufacturing and marketing rights to Zenith Aircraft Company for the STOL CH 701 and the ZODIAC CH 601 designs, and has developed the new STOL CH 801 and the new ZODIAC XL for Zenith Aircraft Company. In 1996, Chris Heintz and Zenair Ltd. obtained FAA type-certification for the Zenith CH 2000, a two- seat low-wing aircraft based on his kit aircraft designs. Aircraft Manufacturing and Design (AMD) manufactures this aircraft as the AMD Alarus CH 2000. AMD also produces the CH 601 XL as a Light-sport aircraft (LSA). In October 2012, four French universities selected the Zodiac CH 650B as their instructional aircraft. In France, where the CH 650 is semi-certified in the CNSK category, the kit aircraft can be assembled by amateurs and still be used by Aeroclubs and schools for flight training and banner-towing purposes. Zenair Limited on November 15, 2012 announced that its FAA type-certificated CH 2000 trainer will be assembled in Peru, South America by a joint venture involving the Peruvian armed services, the University of Perunas and SEMAN, a local aeronautical facility. Negotiations to structure the long-term program have been ongoing for the past year, with Zenair staff traveling to Lima and a contingent of Peruvian decision-makers visiting the Ontario-based factory.

The resort opened on December 15, 2010, and is located just south of the Bellagio on the west side of Las Vegas Boulevard. It consists of two highrise towers, the Boulevard Tower and the Chelsea Tower, both of which are 184 meters (603 ft) tall. The $3.9 billion project features 3,027 rooms, a casino, of retail and restaurant space, a spa and fitness facility, a 3,200-seat theater, and of meeting and convention space. In 2013, the hotel was rated \\"The Best Hotel in the World\\" by Gogobot. In 2015, the resort was named to the Cond√© Nast Traveller Gold List as one of the \\"Top Hotels in the World\\". Amenities Cosmopolitan features 3,027 hotel rooms, many of which feature their own private terrace; a casino; of retail and restaurant space; a spa and fitness facility; a 3,200-seat theater; and of meeting and convention space. The Cosmopolitan's casino features views of the Las Vegas Strip. The Pools at the Cosmopolitan features three different types: a relaxing pool, day club pool and nightclub pool. The Cosmopolitan is also home to the Marquee Nightclub & Dayclub, which was the top grossing nightclub in the United States in 2012. In January 2014, the Cosmopolitan added a new nightclub concept, Rose. Rabbit. Lie. History Cosmopolitan lobby Plans for the property were first announced in April 2004. The developer, 3700 Associates, was a joint venture formed by David Friedman (a former Las Vegas Sands executive), Ian Bruce Eichner (a real estate developer), and Soros Fund Management. The developers purchased the site, an 8.5-acre U-shaped parcel surrounding the Jockey Club timeshare building, for $90 million from a company controlled by New Frontier owner Margaret Elardi. Further details about the project, including the Cosmopolitan name, were released in November 2004. The Cosmopolitan's design team was led by Friedmutter Group as executive architect, with Arquitectonica as the design architect for the building's themed exterior. The building was engineered by DeSimone Consulting Engineers. The interior design team included Digital Kitchen, Prophet, the Friedmutter Group, The Rockwell Group, Jeffrey Beers, Adam Tihany, and Bentel & Bentel. The resort was built on what used to be the parking lot for the Jockey Club. Because the Cosmopolitan occupies much of the parking lot, it was agreed that the Club residents could use part of the Cosmopolitan's parking garage. The Cosmopolitan was the second Las Vegas hotel, after The Palazzo, to feature an underground parking garage underneath the hotel. As a result, the parking garage was built first. In December 2007, work finished on the hole for the parking structure, while other foundation work remained in progress. The hotel was originally planned to open and be operated by Hyatt as the Grand Hyatt Las Vegas. Original plans called for the casino to be on the second floor, but this was later changed and the casino was built on ground level, like most other Las Vegas hotel-casinos. Planned condo units were cancelled and replaced with studios and other hotel rooms. In January 2008, it was reported that the $3.9 billion project faced financial complications, as Eichner's company defaulted on a $760 million construction loan from Deutsche Bank when the developer missed a payment after failing to secure refinancing for the project. Construction moved forward as the developers searched for new financing. In late February 2008, Global Hyatt Corporation and New York-based Marathon Asset Management agreed to recapitalize the condominium-hotel project. However, one month later the developer said Deutsche Bank AG would begin foreclosure proceedings. They bought the hotel for $1 billion during the summer and hired The Related Cos., developers of Time Warner Center in New York, to re-position the asset, manage the development process and assist in leasing the retail and restaurant collection. Related recommended many revisions, including bringing the casino entrance onto the strip. In June 2008, Hearst filed a trademark suit against the owners of the casino. Hearst owns the trademark to Cosmopolitan magazine. In March 2010, the suit was settled, and the resort was renamed Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas. In August 2008, it was announced that MGM Mirage, Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Hyatt and Hilton were in talks to acquire the property. It was speculated that MGM Mirage would integrate the project into Bellagio and CityCenter; Starwood were to establish its W and St. Regis brands; and Hyatt would have continued with its plans to operate a Grand Hyatt. In April 2009, the Sun reported that the hotel would be managed by Hilton and would become the Hilton's first in their new Denizen hotel line. Later that month, however, those plans changed; Starwood sued Hilton, claiming trade-secret theft and essentially killing the Denizen brand. In June 2009, 400 homeowners filed a lawsuit against the developers, claiming breach of contract and seeking refunds for their deposits. They believed that the projected finish date of June 2010 was unrealistic and expressed fear that the developers might turn the condo rooms into hotel rooms only or \\"finish the building as a shell and not do any interior work.\\" In April 2010, it was announced that the Cosmopolitan would open in stages, beginning in December and ending in July 2011. It was the only hotel-casino to open on the Strip in 2010. The project officially opened on December 15, 2010, and became part of Marriott International's Autograph Collection, a collection of independent hotels with access to Marriott's reservation and rewards system. In January 2014, the Cosmopolitan announced that points through their Identity rewards program could be redeemed at 3,800 of Marriott's properties. In May 2014, the Cosmopolitan was sold by Deutsche Bank to Blackstone Group for $1.73 billion. The July 2015 fire at the Cosmopolitan, seen from the rooftop terrace of Marriott's Grand Chateau. The picture was taken twenty minutes after the fire was reported. On July 25, 2015, a fire broke out on the pool deck of the resort, burning trees and cabanas, and sending plumes of smoke into the air. Two people were treated for smoke inhalation as a result of the blaze, including one person who was transported to a local hospital. The cause of the fire was not immediately known. Restaurants In March 2010, the casino announced several celebrity chefs and restaurants that would open there. Included were Bruce and Eric Bromberg's Blue Ribbon, Costas Spiliadis' Estiatorio Milos, Scott Conant's Scarpetta, and David Myers' Comme √áa, which has been shuttered and replaced with other dining options. On May 2, the resort announced that Jos√© Andr√©s would be joining the resort with three restaurants, creating his namesake restaurant, \\"√© by Jos√© Andr√©s\\", and one based on his tapas restaurant, Jaleo. Another restaurant, China Poblano, is a new concept combining Mexican and Chinese cuisine. Additional restaurants include: D.O.C.G. a restaurant and wine bar by Scott Conant; Holstein's, a specialty burger restaurant. Also, STK, a steakhouse by Todd Mark Miller; along with The Henry, Va Bene Caff√®, and Wicked Spoon. The Cosmopolitan also gained the restaurant Eggslut in 2011, following success in their Grand Central Market location in Los Angeles. Starbucks also opened a location in the hotel in 2015 with direct access to the strip. The addition of a modern supper club called Rose, Rabbit, Lie was added in 2015. The club offers chic meals, live entertainment and specialty drinks. In 2018 several new restaurants were added at the hotel at Block 16 Urban Food Hall, a collection of grab and go or counter style speciality restaurants. Hattie B's family restaurant based in Nashville, TN opened a casual, counter service style serving a southern flair called Hattie B's Hot Chicken. Pok Pok Wing Chef Andy Ricker comes via the Portland site serving Asian style foods. Chef and owner Christina Tosi added a Milk Bar serving desserts and stacks and follow the same format as her stores in New York City, Toronto and Washington, D.C. Resident productions Currently the production troop Spiegelworld is performing the show Opium. This is an adults-only show that takes place on a spaceship called OPM 73 with a destination of Uranus. The crew performs several acts of unique feats and super human abilities loosely tied together while on the journey. The audience sits around a stage that elevates and falls throughout the performance and solicits participation from select members of the audience. There is a bar available prior to the start of the show and there are no intermissions during the performance. Spiegelworld also performs the show Absinthe at Caesars Palace. Controversies In April 2011, Cosmopolitan security staff allegedly removed a transgender guest named Stephanie from a women's restroom, photographed her, and said that she would be banned for life if she did not leave the premises. Shortly after the incident, the hotel-casino was flooded with complaints on its Facebook page, which prompted the hotel-casino to issue an apology to the transgender community and to Stephanie that they would \\"welcome her back to the resort anytime.\\" The incident also prompted the hotel-casino to train its staff on awareness initiatives involving the sensitive issue. In May 2019, the tabloid news website TMZ reported an incident between Meek Mill and the hotel claiming he was racially discriminated against while trying to enter the hotel's nightclub. Mr. Mill's lawyer sent a demand letter stating in part, \\"... we have learned that the Cosmopolitan maintains a list of African American recording artists who should be denied access for no other reason than their culture and skin color. Such course of conduct constitutes discrimination per se, in violation of state and federal law, and exposes you to significant monetary damages.\\" The letter goes on -- \\"...we urge you to promptly issue an apology to Mr. Williams and grant him immediate access. In the event you fail to heed this one and only warning, we intend to pursue all legal recourse against you.\\" The hotel later apologized stating \\"we (the hotel) did not act in a respectful manner and were wrong\\" and confirmed a zero tolerance for discrimination.

D. Salinger, first published in the May 1952 edition of World Review (London). Declined by The New Yorker on November 14, 1951, the piece was judged too short to contain the complex religious concepts that Salinger attempted to present.Slawenski, 2010, pp. 222, 227, 240. It is the only work he is known to have produced in 1951 after struggling with it for over five months.Slawenski, 2010, p. 221. The last Salinger story to appear outside the pages of The New Yorker,Slawenski, 2010, p. 222. it was included in his collection Nine Stories (1953). Summary The point of view is that of first-person narrator John Smith who, as an adult, is reassessing an episode in his life when he was nineteen. He dedicates the story to his late (fictional) stepfather. The events unfold shortly after the death of Smith's mother in 1939, when he and his stepfather return to Manhattan from Paris, where the family had spent the Great Depression years. As housemates, the \\"exceptionally unpleasant\\" Smith and his \\"live-and-let-live\\" widower stepfather are incompatible developing an Alphonse and Gaston relationship. Seeking escape, Smith applies for, and is accepted, as an instructor at a Montreal correspondence art academy, \\"Les Amis des Vieux Ma√Ætres\\" (\\"Friends of the Old [Art] Masters\\") operated by Monsieur I. Yoshoto.Slawenski, 2010, p. 223. Smith's r√©sum√© overstates his artistic credentials and, further, he falsely claims to be a descendant of Honor√© Daumier and a confidant of Pablo Picasso. He adopts the inflated moniker \\"Jean de Daumier-Smith\\" and increasingly internalizes his own contrived persona. \\"Les Amis des Vieux Ma√Ætres\\" turns out to be Yoshoto's tiny apartment, located in Verdun, a rundown section of Montreal. Mr. Yoshoto, his wife and Smith are the only \\"instructors\\" at the correspondence art \\"academy\\". Mr. Yoshoto assigns his new employee the task of reviewing and correcting the work of three correspondence students, two of whose crude and inept artwork dismays Smith. The work of the third student, a nun, Sister Irma, intrigues and delights Smith. In his enthusiasm, he pens an officious and patronizing letter of encouragement to the woman. Smith's intervention on the sister's behalf leads to the convent banning further communications with Sister Irma, ending her enrollment at the academy.Slawenski, 2010, p. 224 f. This rebuff stuns the young man and deepens his egotistical isolation. He summarily dismisses his four remaining students from the school, disparaging their work. To Sister Irma he writes a letter warning that her artistic talent will never flourish without proper schooling but never sends it. In this alienated state, Smith experiences a transcendental revelation while looking into a display window of an orthopedic appliances store. In an instant, he grasps the intrinsic beauty of the prosaic objects he beholds.Slawenski, 2010, p. 226. Smith begins to emerge from his disturbed existence. He writes a note in his diary, ceding to Sister Irma the power to pursue her destiny. He declares that \\"'Everyone is a nun' (tout le monde est une nonne.)\\" He finally reinstates his four pupils, establishing a long term relationship with them.Slawenski, 2010, p. 226 f. Analysis \\"De Daumier-Smith's Blue Period\\" marks a shift in Salinger's fiction towards subjects that contrast religious or mystical experiences with the spiritual emptiness of American society. John Smith is described as an extremely lonely and alienated young man whose narcissism (he admits to painting seventeen self-portraits) and pretentiousness serve to insulate himself from his own suffering.Slawenski, 2010, p. 222 f. The protagonist ultimately transcends his self-absorption and misanthropy through epiphanies that reveal to him the presence of God. In his new job as instructor, Smith finds the artwork of two of his students, Bambi Kramer and R. Howard Ridgefield (each described with great humor by Salinger)Slawenski, 2010, p. 224. demoralizing to the point of despondency. His third student, a devout nun from the order of the Sisters of St. Joseph, offers hope. She submits a painting depicting the burial of Christ. Astonished by her talent, Smith writes a gushing and intrusive letter to her that is as inept as the crude artistic offerings of his other pupils. Commencing with this encounter between the nun and the young man, Salinger introduces the central theme in the story: intuitive understanding of life versus intellectual knowledge. This marks the beginning of the young man's advance towards self-enlightenment.Slawenski, 2010, p. 227. = The Two Epiphanies = After posting his letter to Sister Irma, Smith experiences the first of his two \\"near-mystical experiences\\".Slawenski, 2010, p. 225. Biographer Kenneth Slawenski describes the first of these episodes: Smith reacts to this epiphany by indulging in adolescent romantic fantasies involving Sister Irma. He clings to the illusions of his superiority.Slawenski, 2010, pp. 223, 225. Smith's second epiphany occurs at the same display window, but Salinger presents a tableau that includes a young woman who is rearranging the objects on display. Absorbed in dressing the display mannequin, she becomes momentarily flustered when she notices Smith observing her intently, then slips and falls. She picks herself up and resumes her humble task with dignity. The girl corresponds to Sister Irma and her simple occupation is equated with the nun's genuine dedication to God. Salinger describes the moment of the narrator's epiphany: Slawenski regards this as the key passage in the story, revealing \\"the presence of God\\", and the emergence of Zen Buddhist topics in Salinger's writing.

It has since been the subject of an ongoing urban legend (sometimes being called Petition 2493). Origin In 1974, Jeremy Lansman and Lorenzo Milam submitted a request to the FCC to amend the rules concerning educational broadcasts. They requested a review be made to determine if any religious groups were filing for licenses on channels that had been reserved for general educational purposes with the intent of making religious broadcasts. The FCC reviewed this request and denied it in 1975, citing it did not have a policy on restricting broadcasts based on possible religious content. Thereafter, the matter was officially ended. During the time the matter was being considered, the FCC received numerous letters concerning this proposal. Many of the correspondents were under the incorrect impression that the proposal was seeking a complete ban on all religious broadcasting. The FCC explained that that possibility had never been suggested and was not being considered. Following the denial of RM-2493, the FCC went on to explain that there now was no longer any proposal being considered. Variations These statements did not stop the concern of some citizens. Messages were circulating on the Internet as late as September 2012 stating that a ban on religious broadcasting was either being actively considered or has been recently enacted. Variations of this message state that atheists are circulating a petition in support of the ban; that religious people are circulating a petition to oppose the ban; that Madalyn Murray O'Hair is responsible for the ban (O'Hair had no association with RM-2493 and died in 1995); that Dr. James Dobson is leading opposition to the ban (Dobson has stated he is aware there is no proposed ban and has not led any efforts in regard to it); and that the ban was responsible for the cancellation of the television series Touched by an Angel. The FCC states that it has received over 30,000,000 pieces of mail regarding this issue since 1975. A 2009 variation of Petition 2493 (without the RM- prefix) claims O'Hair's organization, American Atheists, wants the \\"Removal of Joel Osteen, Joyce Meyer, Charles Stanley, David Jeremiah and other pastors from the air waves,\\" and Dr. James Dobson asks petitioners to send responses and donations to \\"Lisa Norman\\". Once again, Dr. Dobson denies any involvement.

A notable survivor is Labassa owned by the National Trust. The mansion was originally built in 1862 and extended in 1873. In 1889 further extensions and lavish refurbishment commissioned by William Alexander Robertson created the present mansion which is of national significance. The house is sometimes used for filming of the ABC's lady detective series Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries and was one of the filming locations for the 2002 film Queen of the Damned. Many streets in the suburb were named in the late 1850s after Crimea War locations and people, for example, Cardigan, Canrobert, Inkerman, Alma, Raglan, Redan and Balaclava. The Caulfield North Post Office was opened on 26 March 1915. Public transport Trams service Caulfield North extensively, with a major tram interchange at Balaclava Junction.

He was born in Ivanƒçice, Moravia (then part of Austria-Hungary, later in his childhood Czechoslovakia) and moved to the United States at the age of eight. Weisgall studied at the Peabody Institute, privately with Roger Sessions, and at the Curtis Institute of Music with conductor Fritz Reiner and composer Rosario Scalero. He later earned a Ph.D. in German literature at Johns Hopkins University. During World War II he was an aide-de-camp to General George S. Patton. After the war he became a professor, and taught at Queens College, the Juilliard School, and the Jewish Theological Seminary, all in New York City. His notable students include composers Dominick Argento, Bruce Saylor and the accordionist/composer William Schimmel. Weisgall came from a family of several generations of cantors, and maintained a lifelong interest in both sacred and secular Jewish music. In 1992 he was commissioned by the Friends of the Library of the Jewish Theological Seminary to write a song cycle, Psalm of the Distant Dove, commemorating the 500th anniversary of the expulsion of the Jews from Spain. Other major works include his most ambitious opera, Athaliah (libretto: Richard Frank Goldman, after Jean Racine), and his often-performed Six Characters in Search of an Author (libretto: Denis Johnston, after Luigi Pirandello).

In addition, the steepness and related geotechnical challenges of the coastal mountains made this stretch of coastline too costly for state highway or county road builders to establish routes through the area, leaving it the most undeveloped and remote portion of the California coast. Without any major highways, communities in the Lost Coast region such as Petrolia, Shelter Cove, and Whitethorn are isolated from the rest of California. The region lies roughly between Rockport and Ferndale. At the south end, State Route 1, which runs very close along the coast for most of its length, suddenly turns inland at Rockport before merging with U.S. Route 101 at Leggett. At the north end, State Route 211 begins its journey at Ferndale, heading towards Highway 101 in Fernbridge. Section 511 of the California Streets and Highways Code still says that \\"Route 211 is from Route 1 near Rockport to Route 101 near Fernbridge\\", but it is unlikely that the portion south of Ferndale will be built. Most of the region's coastline is now part of either Sinkyone Wilderness State Park or King Range National Conservation Area. Geology and climate The Lost Coast consists of undivided Cretaceous marine metasedimentary and sedimentary rocks of the North American Plate steeply uplifted by Mendocino Triple Junction interactions with the Pacific Plate and Gorda Plate. The Lost Coast includes Tertiary marine sedimentary formations north of the Mattole River and a portion of the Franciscan Assemblage called Point Delgada at Shelter Cove.Strand, Rudolph G. Geologic Map of California:Redding Sheet (1962) State of California Resources Agency The steepness of uplift has created a coastal ridge forming a drainage divide parallel to the coast. The drainage pattern between Usal Creek and the Mattole River is a series of short streams with steep channel gradients.Jennings, Charles W. and Strand, Rudolph G. Geologic Map of California:Ukiah Sheet (1960) State of California Resources Agency Like the surrounding coast, the Lost Coast experiences a wet season and a dry season. The wet season ranges from October to April. The King Range mountains collect significant moisture from storms coming in from the Pacific Ocean, making it one of the wettest sections of the California coastline. Local weather stations typically record over annually of rainfall, and during wet years, over can fall along the Lost Coast. Snow can blanket the higher peaks after storms, but will melt quickly. From May to September, the mountain areas are mostly warm and dry with temperatures reaching 80‚Äì90 ¬∞F in mid-summer, but the weather is still highly variable, with some days of fog and light rain. Humboldt County Coastline near Shelter Cove Much of the land in the area is owned by the federal government, and in 1970, more than were designated the King Range National Conservation Area. Because of the rugged and remote location, the small towns of Shelter Cove, Whitethorn and Petrolia are popular with those looking for quiet respite. The area is known for its black sand beaches, which get their color from dark colored sandstone called greywacke and an older compressed shale produced by tectonic activity of one continental and two oceanic plates meeting just offshore.Lost Coast Black Sands information sign at Black Sands beach head parking lot, northernmost set of two information panels near Shelter Cove, California, published by the Bureau of Land Management ‚Äì Kings Range National Conservation Area, seen September 3, 2012 Mendocino County Usal Creek on the Lost Coast in Mendocino County. Early European settlers of this area began harvesting bark of the tanoak tree for tanning hides into leather. Bark collectors formed the small community of Kenny around springs at the headwaters of the north fork of Usal Creek. A wharf was built at Bear Harbor in 1884 for loading bark onto ships. The Bear Harbor and Eel River Railroad incorporated in 1896 to connect the wharf to a sawmill being built on the South Fork Eel River at Andersonia, California. The location of the railroad shops was named Moody for the proprietor (Louis Alton Moody) of a nearby hotel and saloon. The community of Andersonia, Anderson Gulch, and the Anderson Cliffs of the Lost Coast are named for sawmill owner Henry Neff Anderson, who was killed in a construction accident in 1905. Sawmill and railroad operation languished after Anderson's death, and the facilities were dismantled in 1921. Usal Redwood Company built a sawmill and wharf at the mouth of Usal Creek in 1889. The company town of Usal was built around the mill and a railroad for transporting logs extended three miles up Usal Creek. A fire in 1902 destroyed the sawmill, schoolhouse, warehouse, and county bridge over Usal Creek. The railroad was dismantled; but a few structures, including a hotel, survived until destroyed by fire in 1969. Steep terrain and unfavorable coastal mooring conditions delayed timber harvesting of Jackass Creek drainage until internal combustion machinery was available for transport. The company town of Wheeler, California, was built for logging operations from 1948 to 1959. Sinkyone Wilderness State Park began acquisition of Lost Coast property in 1975.Sinkyone Wilderness State Park Preliminary Impact Plan and Draft EIR, California Department of Parks and Recreation, June 2006. Backpackers taking-in the views of California's coastline Transportation The geology of the Lost Coast makes it very difficult to establish routes through the area. State Route 1, California's Pacific Coast Highway, was originally planned to continue up the coast through the region. In 1984, admitting that such construction was not feasible, Caltrans re-routed the northern segment of Highway 1 from Rockport to Leggett and renumbered the portion that was built from Ferndale to Fernbridge as State Route 211. Without any major highways or county thoroughfares in the area, the secluded communities within the Lost Coast are only accessible by land via small mountain roads. Mattole Road runs south from Ferndale to Petrolia, while Shelter Cove Rd. and Briceland Thorn Rd. form the main route connecting Shelter Cove with US 101 to the east. Shelter Cove Airport in Shelter Cove is a small public airport with only one runway, making it possible to fly in when weather permits. Communities right on the coast are also accessible by boat.

Walker (May 22, 1896 in Chicago, Illinois ‚Äì January 19, 1993 in Tucson, Arizona) was an industrial and automotive designer. His most notable work was the original Ford Thunderbird. Life His father worked for the Erie Railroad and the family moved several times, settling in Cleveland, Ohio when Walker was in his teens. He played semi-professional football and held down odd jobs, but his interest in art led to art school in Los Angeles. He began his professional career as an illustrator for department store advertising, initially as a student in LA and then as an independent in Cleveland. He broke into the auto business doing illustration work for the failing Peerless automobile company in the late 1920s. He went on to a brief stint working for Harley Earl and John Tjaarda at General Motors, then to Graham-Paige. In 1929 the stock market crash spelled the end for many companies, including Graham-Paige, and Walker went looking for work. He found it with a hardware supplier, Dura. This company supplied several automakers with parts. This job led to contact with J√≥zsef Galamb, the primary designer for Ford Motor Company. Walker's firm did substantial design work for Ford parts, then in the late 1940s began styling work for some Ford cars. In the early 1950s he joined Ford at the behest of Ford executive Ernie Breech, bringing colleagues Elwood Engel and Joe Oros (later a primary designer on the Mustang). Walker became corporate vice-president of Ford Motor Company for design in 1955. He stepped down from all his positions at Ford in 1961 after reaching the company's mandatory retirement age of 65. Walker appeared on the November 4, 1957 cover of TIME Magazine. On October 15, 1959, he appeared as a guest challenger on the TV panel show To Tell the Truth. Walker's career also included industrial design for clocks, bread boxes, chemistry sets, bicycles, and roller skates, among other products. He moved to Gulf Stream, Florida, where he became mayor in 1976. He died on January 19, 1993 in Tucson, Arizona at the age of 96.

Effect of the maxim  Some legal causes of action can survive the death of the claimant or plaintiff, for example actions founded in contract law. However, some actions are personal to the plaintiff, defamation of character being one notable example. Therefore, such an action, where it relates to the private character of the plaintiff, comes to an end on his death, whereas an action for the publication of a false and malicious statement which causes damage to the plaintiff's personal estate will survive to the benefit of his or her personal representatives. The principle also exists to protect the estate and executors from liability for strictly personal acts of the deceased, such as charges for fraud. Origins of the maxim It has been argued by academicsGoudy Two Ancient Brocards in Essays in Legal History Vinogradoff (ed.) and Winfield Textbook of the Law of Tort 2nd edn. p.201 and acknowledged by the courtscf. the remarks of Viscount Simon in Stewart v. London, Midland and Scottish Railway Co. 1943 SC (HL) 19 at 26 that notwithstanding the Latinate form in which the proposition is expressed its origins are less antiquated. It has been described by one Lord Chancellor (Viscount Simon) as: > ...not in fact the source from which a body of law has been deduced, but a > confusing expression, framed in the solemnity of the Latin tongue, in which > the effect of death upon certain personal torts was inaccurately > generalised. The maxim is first quoted in a case from 1496, where a woman against whom a defamation judgment was issued died before paying the damages to the tortfeasor.YB12Hen.VII T f22 pl2. The Kings Bench first used the maxim in Cleymond v Vincent (1523) but it was popularized by Edward Coke,Alfred William Brian Simpson, A History of the Common Law of Contract, Volume 1 (Clarendon Press, 1987) p572. with cases like Pinchons Case (1616), Alfred William Brian Simpson, A History of the Common Law of Contract, Volume 1 (Clarendon Press, 1987) p564. and Bane's Case,Alfred William Brian Simpson, A History of the Common Law of Contract, Volume 1 (Clarendon Press, 1987) p443. and to some extent with Slades Case.

The film is based on the Shaolin Monastery in China and depicts Shaolin Kung Fu. The film was among the first major co-productions between Hong Kong and mainland China, and the first to be filmed in mainland China with a mostly mainland cast. The film has a generally episodic storytelling structure, and is an action-comedy film in the first half. It was the first martial arts film to be made in mainland China; up until then, kung fu films were made in Hong Kong. It was also the first film to be shot at the Shaolin Monastery. It is estimated to have sold over 300million tickets at the Chinese box office, and is considered one of China's highest-grossing films ever when adjusted for inflation. The film's success established Jet Li as the first Mainland Chinese star of Hong Kong, and later Hollywood. It was also largely responsible for turning the Shaolin Monastery into a major tourist destination, both within China and internationally. A remake of the film was released in 2011 titled Shaolin and starred Andy Lau, Nicholas Tse and Jackie Chan. Plot The film is set in Medieval China during the transition period between the Sui Dynasty (581‚Äì618) and the Tang Dynasty (618‚Äì907). It opens with various shots of the Shaolin Temple, including the wall paintings, the many beautiful trees, gardens, shrines, gates, and statues of Buddha and the Gods. The temple bells toll as the monks kneel in the pillared inner sanctum and bow before the great altar of the Golden Buddha, before which sits the Abbot of Shaolin. A shaven-headed, blue-robed novice (Jet Li) stands with his palms pressed together and his head bowed. He is about to be accepted into the Shaolin Temple. The Abbot speaks to him of ceremony, purification, and learning to respect one's self and others. Then the Abbot asks for his name. \\"Jue Yuan\\", he answers. The Abbot tells him that to be accepted into the Shaolin Temple, he must vow to not commit murder. He asks if he can obey this, but Jue Yuan is silent, staring downward. The Abbot repeats the question, and Jue Yuan slowly raises his eyes, gazing intensely at him. The Abbot asks the question a third time... The film flashes back to the warlord and deadly fighter Wang Shichong killing an old man with a throat lock and throwing him off a high brick wall into a muddy river, then abusively ordering the rest of his slaves back to work. They're at a labor camp by the great river, toiling in the mud among corpses that hang from gallows as the soldiers whip them. It is during the rebellions at the end of the Sui Dynasty, when China became divided between various factions. Wang Shichong, who ruled from Luoyang, has treacherously installed himself as Emperor of the East Capitol, and is overseeing the bolstering of his riverfront defenses against the rival warlords on the opposite bank. They are near the Shaolin Temple. He forces even the old, crippled, and sick to work, but still the work isn't progressing fast enough for him. He orders an officer to bring all his prisoners, who are opposing rebels, to join the slaves. These rebels include an older kung fu master, famous for his kicking skill, and his long-haired son, Jue Yuan. The soldiers whip the slaves, and one old slave collapses and drops a wooden beam, which causes an officer's horse to rear and throw the officer. The officer begins to beat the slave to death, but Jue Yuan's father attacks him, though his ankles and wrists are chained together. The officer proves to be a kung fu fighter, and they fight, but Jue Yuan's father still manages to defeat him. This draws the attention of the Emperor, who attacks Jue Yuan's father himself and rips his throat out with his bare hand. Jue Yuan rushes in and unleashes the kicking skills that his father taught him, scattering the guards and fighting the officers, but then the Emperor beats him up and deals him a deadly Dim Mak palm strike to the chest. Jue Yuan is thrown into the river, and he manages to swim away and escape. He staggers through the wild, dying of his wounds, but finally he manages to reach the Shaolin Temple. The Sifu (Yu Hai) is teaching the monks staff kung fu when Jue Yuan arrives and falls unconscious. Throngs of refugees from the war-torn countryside are flocking to the Shaolin Temple every day. The Abbot proclaims that it is their holy duty as Buddhist monks to pray for the refugees and do all they can to help them. They nurse Jue Yuan back to health. When he has recovered, he joins them in carrying water from the river to the Temple, which they use as kung fu conditioning. He struggles, but is helped by a beautiful girl named Bai Wu Xia (Ding Lan), who sings and herds rams in the beautiful wildlife-filled forested hills that surround the Shaolin Temple. Jue Yuan spies on the monks' kung fu training and gets himself into various other comedic misadventures around the Shaolin Temple, befriending the light- hearted, fun-loving, mischievous Sifu and his equally mischievous kung fu students in the process. One night they all sneak out to eat and party around a fire in the woods. There he learns more about the Sifu and his former family in the North. He learns that the Sifu is Bai Wu Xia's father, that she was one of the main ones who nursed him back to health, and that she is skilled at kung fu. The Sifu says that nine years ago, he and his wife were being chased by the Emperor and his soldiers, and he left his wife with a farmer to hide while he fled on, eventually hiding in the Shaolin Temple. The farmer, who had no children, spoiled Bai Wu Xia when she was young. Jue Yuan declares that he will kill the Emperor, and he asks the Sifu to train him in his Northern Shaolin kung fu. The Sifu tells him that Shaolin kung fu is for defense, not killing, and besides, Jue Yuan isn't a monk. Jue Yuan drops to his knees, presses his palms together, and says that he wants to become a monk. Jue Yuan‚Äôs head is shaven, and he bows before the Abbot of Shaolin on the great altar of the golden Buddha. The assembled monks sing mystic hymns, ring bells, and strike gongs. A mosquito bites Jue Yuan as he kneels there, and he kills it, but the Abbot blesses and accepts him, and he is ordained as a junior monk. Jue Yuan joins his fellow monks in Northern Shaolin kung fu training. After a time of at least several months he has gained impressive fighting abilities, but while sparring, his enemy flashes with the visage of the Emperor in his mind, and he almost kills his partner. He is banned from practicing kung fu. His emotions flare quickly out of control, and he runs away from the Shaolin Temple. Jue Yuan attempts to assassinate the Emperor, but fails and is forced to flee. Ashamed, he returns to the Shaolin Temple. His Sifu admonishes him, but welcomes him home and allows him to resume his Northern Shaolin kung fu training. Jue Yuan trains for at least another year, as seen in a ‚Äòfour seasons‚Äô training sequence, and becomes highly adept at Northern Shaolin kung fu. Then another refugee comes fleeing to Shaolin, this one pursued by the Emperor and his men. This refugee is Li Shimin, son of a great leader who founded the Tang Dynasty, Li Yuan. The Shaolin monks keep peace with the Emperor and his men, and make a show of helping them hunt for Li Shimin. But Jue Yuan helps Li Shimin escape through the mountains, and Jue Yuan and Li Shimin end up hiding together in an abandoned ancient mountainous cave temple with many giant statues of Buddha and the Gods. Bai Wu Xia stealthily brings them food and water. Li Shimin must escape, though, so Jue Yuan and Bai Wu Xia help him, sneaking and bribing their way past the Emperor‚Äôs patrols in disguise. Throughout this time, a forbidden romance builds between Jue Yuan and Bai Wu Xia. But they fail in their clean escape, and Li Shimin and Bai Wu Xia flee on a raft down a river, Li Shimin with an arrow in his leg, while Jue Yuan sacrifices himself to slow down the Emperor‚Äôs outriders. However, his Sifu from Shaolin and a group of Shaolin warrior monks come to his aid and massacre the outriders. They save Jue Yuan‚Äôs life, but his Sifu excommunicates him from Shaolin for his acts and banishes him. He desperately follows them back to the Shaolin Temple anyway, but they throw him out and drive him away. The Emperor learns what the Shaolin monks did, and marches on the Shaolin Temple with his army to destroy it. Jue Yuan comes back yet again, and this time his Sifu sends him away along with Ba Wu Xia, to take her to safety and never return. The Abbot of Shaolin orders the monks not to fight, even while the Emperor‚Äôs army surrounds the Shaolin Temple. The Abbot pleads with the Emperor. He appeals that the Temple has a very long history, and a crime should not merit the destruction of the buildings, or any of the monks. As the Abbot, he accepts the blame. The Emperor has him placed on a great pyre, which is set aflame. He tells the monks that if they reveal the traitors‚Äô whereabouts, he‚Äôll spare the Temple and the Abbot‚Äôs life. When no one talks, he has his men kill several of the other top monks, and threatens that if no one talks, they‚Äôll all be killed. Then the Sifu and the warrior monks reveal themselves. The Sifu cries that they must fight. The Abbot, as he is immersed in fire, tells the Sifu to release the souls of the Emperor and his men and send them to Heaven. And so the battle is joined. Many monks are killed. Jue Yuan and Ba Wu Xia return to the embattled Shaolin Temple. The Emperor‚Äôs army takes the outer walls and outer grounds, and kills all the monks therein. The surviving monks fall back within the inner walls. The Sifu is shot full of arrows. He entreats Jue Yuan to protect Shaolin and uphold justice, and dies. The Emperor and his men break open the inner gate with a battering ram, and they‚Äôre about to massacre the rest of the monks, but then the Emperor receives word that Li Shimin and his army are approaching his own East Capital, and they abandon the siege of the Shaolin Temple and ride for the East Capital with all speed. Jue Yuan and the warrior monks ride after the Emperor and his men and join the battle at the ravaged East Capital, at the very site where the Emperor killed Jue Yuan‚Äôs father. Jue Yuan and the Emperor duel with swords and empty hands and feet on the shores of the great river. Their battle climbs up a great wooden structure, falls off the top into the river, and returns to the shore. Finally Jue Yuan uses his Northern Shaolin kung fu to kill the Emperor, and the battle for the East Capital is won. The film returns to its beginning, with Jue Yuan in the sanctum of the Shaolin Temple, kneeling before the high altar, as the new Abbot asks him if he can obey the vow to do no murder. Jue Yuan vows that he shall not kill save to uphold righteousness, and the Abbot accepts this. Jue Yuan continues to swear his vows, but when he reaches the vow of celibacy, he is again conflicted. He opens his folded palms to look at a jade amulet. He flashes back again. He and Bai Wu Xia kneel and bow before the shrine of the fallen previous Abbot, to whom they have offered many baskets of fruit and other foods. Jue Yuan speaks aloud to the Abbot of how he is determined to enter Buddha. Bai Wu Xia gazes at him with tears in her eyes, knowing what this means. Jue Yuan vows to defend Shaolin and uphold justice, quoting the last words of his fallen Sifu, Bai Wu Xia‚Äôs father. Bai Wu Xia gives him the jade amulet, a token of her love, and departs. Now, in the present, he looks up from the jade amulet to see Bai Wu Xia, who has sneaked into the side wing of the sanctum and is staring at him from behind a great pillar. He hesitates, then vows to remain celibate, and she leaves. The great bell of Shaolin tolls, and the gongs and drums are beaten as Jue Yuan is ordained as a true monk of Shaolin. The film‚Äôs closing scene is of Jue Yuan, now the new kung fu Sifu of the Shaolin Temple, leading the monks in their training.

The film was produced by Joseph McGinty Nichol, and released on March 24, 2006 in the United States. It was the first film in five years released by Hollywood Pictures, and also Disney's only slasher film to date (not counting any from Dimension Films before 2005, nor those inherited from the 20th Century Fox catalog). Plot After playing a video game titled Stay Alive, Loomis Crowley, his roommate Rex, and Rex's girlfriend Sarah are killed in the same way as their characters were killed in the game. At Loomis' funeral, his friend Hutch meets Abigail ‚Äì a friend of Sarah ‚Äì and receives some of Loomis' possessions, including Stay Alive. Hutch, his girlfriend October, and her brother Phineus decide to play the game as a group. They are joined by Abigail and another friend, Swink, while Hutch's boss Miller plays online from his office. The game is set in a derelict mansion on Gerouge Plantation, but it only starts when the six players recite \\"The Prayer of Elizabeth,\\" a request for \\"all who resist\\" to perish so that their blood can keep the Countess Elizabeth Bathory young. The players then fight through a cemetery of evil ghost children, heading toward a mausoleum and tower. Miller is directed by the game to pick up a rose. October, a reader of occult literature, explains that undead spirits cannot move across wild roses. Separated from the others, Miller throws the rose to dispel the spirits of undead girls. Now out of roses, a woman in a red dress, the Countess, stabs and kills Miller's unprotected character. The group decides to stop playing for the night. Minutes later, the Countess appears in Miller's office and kills him by stabbing him in the neck with conjoined scissor blades like the ones in the game. Two detectives, Thibodeaux and King, question Hutch about the homicides. Hutch realizes that Loomis and Miller played Stay Alive right before they died, and that they died the same way as their game characters did. Later, October researches Bathory and learns she would drain young women of blood, bathing in it to maintain her youth. Her weakness was mirrors, because she could not stand to see herself growing old. Elsewhere, Phineus decides to play alone, and despite quitting the game before his character can die, he is killed in real life when he is run over by a horse-drawn carriage. The survivors agree to stop playing Stay Alive until they can learn more about it. However, Detective King ignores Swink's warning and plays until his character dies. Undaunted, King looks for Stay Alive at a gaming store, but the clerk has never heard of it; King is later killed in his car after leaving the store. Hutch and Abigail search Loomis' house and learn of the game developer's location: the real Gerouge Plantation. October has discovered that the real Countess Bathory was locked in the tower of her estate as punishment for her gruesome acts and vowed to return one day for revenge, which she is now able to do, as The Prayer of Elizabeth has resurrected her. October reveals that the Countess can only be killed by driving three nails into her body to trap her evil soul. October sees the Countess in a house under construction and tries to kill her to avenge Phineas, but realizes that she is a ghost, hung upside down, with her throat slit by the Countess. The three survivors realize that once the game has begun, it can play by itself. Swink stays in a van and plays the game on his laptop to distract Bathory, while Hutch and Abigail search Gerouge Plantation. The Countess begins cheating, arriving in her carriage to kill Swink in real life, even though his character is still alive. Swink decides to run for it until he falls over into a bush of roses and is seemingly killed by the Countess with her shears. Hutch and Abigail return to the van to find Swink's character dead. They take the laptop and some wild roses, which they drop to deter undead children as they cross the cemetery toward the tower. When Hutch and Abigail become separated, he continues without her to perform the ritual on Bathory's body. Bathory's phantom attacks Abigail, who has one rose left. At the top of the tower, Hutch finds the preserved, inert body of Elizabeth Bathory and hammers three nails into it, after which the spirit stops attacking Abigail. When Bathory's body reanimates, Hutch retreats and knocks over an oil lamp, spilling oil across the floor. Recalling that the Countess hates mirrors, Hutch uses the reflective laptop to repel her before setting the room ablaze. Swink, still alive due to being surrounded by roses earlier and carrying more roses, bursts in with Abigail and rescues Hutch. As Bathory's body burns, the three leave the tower. Meanwhile, the gaming store from earlier is now selling copies of Stay Alive. Cast Box office Stay Alive was released in U.S. theaters on March 24, 2006. The film opened at #3 in the U.S. box office with $10.7 million that first weekend. It ultimately grossed a total of $23.08 million in the United States.Stay Alive (2006). Box Office Mojo. Retrieved 2010-11-01. The movie grossed a total of over $27.1 million worldwide. Critical reception Stay Alive received negative critical reviews. Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 24 out of 100, based on 17 reviews. Rotten Tomatoes holds this film with a 10% \\"rotten\\" rating based on 59 reviews. The site's consensus states: \\"A by-the- numbers teen horror flick, Stay Alive fails to exploit its premise for any real scares.\\" Writing for Newsday, John Anderson commented that \\"'Stay Alive' spends a lot of time inside the video game system, and what will terrify the audience very early on is the realization that there's better acting in the video game than on the big screen.\\" Meanwhile, writing for Variety, Anderson concluded: \\"Seldom is there anything close to real passion or panic on display here from cast members.\\" Gregory Kirschling of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a D‚àí and commented, \\"this dopey movie keeps flouting its own rules, so that one character who dies in the game gets to live, while poor suckers get offed for real even though we never saw their Game Overs.\\" Entertainment Weekly gave the \\"Unrated Director's Cut\\" version a C+. DVD release The DVD was released in the United States on September 19, 2006. It was made available in an unrated edition (100 minutes) and a \\"13\\" edition (85 minutes). The 15 minutes of new unrated footage include a new character and subplot. The unrated edition features more adult material.

Retrieved 2007-06-08. Though more expensive to produce, requiring a $0.33/litre Federal subsidy, a 2006 report found it would likely save at least $27 million per year when the social and health costs of petrol-sniffing were taken into account. A 2010 senate report showed that the introduction of Opal in 106 communities across remote and regional Australia had led to a 70% drop in petrol sniffing in those communities. Typical unleaded petrol contains 25% aromatics, such as toluene, ortho-xylene and para-xylene. In contrast, Opal contains only 5% aromatics, which means that it has less of the toluene and other solvents which produce the intoxication (or \\"high\\") that inhalant users are seeking. The Australian Government subsidises Opal's provision and restricts traditional unleaded petrol in some remote communities. According to BP, the lower volatile component in Opal means that cars using it are less prone to vapour lock. Prior to the introduction of Opal, Comgas (a brand of the aviation fuel avgas) was used in many communities to discourage use of fuel as an inhalant. Unlike Opal, however, Comgas contains tetraethyllead (TEL), a poisonous substance that inhibits catalytic converters and is therefore banned for automobile use in most parts of the world especially after the discovery that it increased concentrations of lead particles over the entire earth, including the poles.Opal fuel BP p.l.c.

Volenti applies only to the risk which a reasonable person would consider them as having assumed by their actions; thus a boxer consents to being hit, and to the injuries that might be expected from being hit, but does not consent to (for example) his opponent striking him with an iron bar, or punching him outside the usual terms of boxing. Volenti is also known as a \\"voluntary assumption of risk\\". Volenti is sometimes described as the plaintiff \\"consenting to run a risk\\". In this context, volenti can be distinguished from legal consent in that the latter can prevent some torts arising in the first place. For example, consent to a medical procedure prevents the procedure from being a trespass to the person, or consenting to a person visiting one's land prevents them from being a trespasser. History Volenti non fit injuria is an often-quoted form of the legal maxim formulated by the Roman jurist Ulpian which reads in original: Nulla iniuria est, qu√¶ in volentem fiat. English law In English tort law, volenti is a full defence, i.e. it fully exonerates the defendant who succeeds in proving it. The defence has two main elements: *The claimant was fully aware of all the risks involved, including both the nature and the extent of the risk; and *The claimant expressly (by statement) or implicitly (by actions) consented to waive all claims for damages. Knowledge of the risk is not sufficient: sciens non est volens (\\"knowing is not volunteering\\"). Consent must be free and voluntary, i.e. not brought about by duress. If the relationship between the claimant and defendant is such that there is doubt as to whether the consent was truly voluntary, such as the relationship between workers and employers, the courts are unlikely to find volenti. It is not easy for a defendant to show both elements and therefore comparative negligence usually constitutes a better defence in many cases. Note however that comparative negligence is a partial defence, i.e. it usually leads to a reduction of payable damages rather than a full exclusion of liability. Also, the person consenting to an act may not always be negligent: a bungee jumper may take the greatest possible care not to be injured, and if he is, the defence available to the organiser of the event will be volenti, not comparative negligence. Consent to medical treatmentSee Sidaway v Board of Governors of the Bethlem Royal Hospital [1985] A.C. 871 which deals with the difficult issue of \\"informed consent\\" or consent to risky sportsSee Condon v Basi [1985] 1 W.L.R. 866 on the part of the claimant excludes liability in tort where that consent is informed consent. Scots Law The Scots law of delict similarly recognises the principle and defence of volenti non fit injuria. United States The similar principle in US law is known as assumption of risk. Canada In Canada, the \\"volentio\\" principles applies in much the same way as under English law. The leading Canadian cases on point are Dube v. Labar, [1986] 1 SCR 649 and Hall v. Hebert, [1993] 2 SCR 159.Volenti Cases =Trespassers= The Occupiers' Liability Act 1984 (and in Scotland the Occupiers' Liability (Scotland) Act 1960) requires all owners of property to take reasonable steps to make their premises safe for anyone who enters them, even those who enter as trespassers, if they are aware of a risk on the premises. However, the doctrine of volenti has been applied to cases where a trespasser exposed themselves deliberately to risk: * Titchener v British Railways Board [1983] 1 WLR 1427 * Ratcliff v McConnell [1997] EWCA Civ 2679 * Tomlinson v Congleton Borough Council [2003] UKHL 47 In the first case (decided before the Occupier's Liability Act was passed), a girl who had trespassed on the railway was hit by a train. The House of Lords ruled that the fencing around the railway was adequate, and the girl had voluntarily accepted the risk by breaking through it. In the second case, a student who had broken into a closed swimming-pool and injured himself by diving into the shallow end was similarly held responsible for his own injuries. The third case involved a man who dived into a shallow lake, despite the presence of \\"No Swimming\\" signs; the signs were held to be an adequate warning. =Drunk drivers= The defence of volenti is now excluded by statute where a passenger was injured as a result of agreeing to take a lift from a drunk car driver. However, in a well-known case of Morris v Murray [1990] 3 All ER 801 (Court of Appeal), volenti was held to apply to a drunk passenger, who accepted a lift from a drunk pilot. The pilot died in the resulting crash and the passenger who was injured, sued his estate. Although he drove the pilot to the airfield (which was closed at the time) and helped him start the engine and tune the radio, he argued that he did not freely and voluntarily consent to the risk involved in flying. The Court of Appeal held that there was consent: the passenger was not so drunk as to fail to realise the risks of taking a lift from a drunk pilot, and his actions leading up to the flight demonstrated that he voluntarily accepted those risks. =Rescuers= For reasons of policy, the courts are reluctant to criticise the behaviour of rescuers. A rescuer would not be considered volens if: #He was acting to rescue persons or property endangered by the defendant‚Äôs negligence; #He was acting under a compelling legal, social or moral duty; and #His conduct in all circumstances was reasonable and a natural consequence of the defendant‚Äôs negligence. An example of such a case is Haynes v. Harwood [1935] 1 KB 146, in which a policeman was able to recover damages after being injured restraining a bolting horse: he had a legal and moral duty to protect life and property and as such was not held to have been acting as a volunteer or giving willing consent to the action - it was his contractual obligation as an employee and police officer and moral necessity as a human being to do so, and not a wish to volunteer, which caused him to act. In this case the court of appeal affirmed a judgement in favor of a policeman who had been injured in stopping some runaway horses with a van in a crowded street. The policeman who was on duty, not in the street, but in a police station, darted out and was crushed by one of the horses which fell upon him while he was stopping it. It was also held that the rescuer's act need not be instinctive in order to be reasonable, for one who deliberately encounters peril after reflection may often be acting more reasonably than one who acts upon impulse. By contrast, in Cutler v. United Dairies [1933] 2 KB 297 =Unsuccessful attempts to rely on volenti= Examples of cases where a reliance on volenti was unsuccessful include: * Nettleship v. Weston [1971] 3 All ER 581 (Court of Appeal) * Baker v T E Hopkins & Son Ltd [1959] 3 All ER 225 (Court of Appeal). : In the first case, the plaintiff was an instructor who was injured while teaching the defendant to drive. The defence of volenti failed: that is, because the plaintiff specifically inquired if the defendant's insurance covered him before agreeing to teach. In the second case, a doctor went in to try to rescue workmen who were caught in a well after having succumbed to noxious fumes. He did so despite being warned of the danger and told to wait until the fire brigade arrived. The doctor and the workmen all died. The court held that it would be \\"unseemly\\" to hold the doctor to have consented to the risk simply because he acted promptly and bravely in an attempt to save lives. Generally courts are reluctant to recognise voluntary assumption of risk. An example of a court reluctant to find a voluntary assumption of risk includes Carey v Lake Macquarie City Council [2007] NSWCA 4. Instead the conduct amounted to contributory negligence, which is not a complete defence.

Plot Leading a bohemian existence In Paris is the artist Modigliani, known as Modi. Spending much of his time drinking and sleeping with the attractive writer Beatrice, he does some drawing and painting but sells virtually nothing. He meets a beautiful young art student called Jeanne, who is locked up by her family to keep her away from him. His friends the Zborowskis do their best to keep him afloat, but his fragile health, weakened by constant alcohol and tobacco, gives out and he is sent to Nice to recuperate. Jeanne escapes and joins him there, after which the two are inseparable. Returning to Paris, the Zborowskis arrange a one-man show in the prestigious gallery of Madame Weill, where everybody turns up for free drinks at the opening but nobody buys. After complaints, the police order the removal of a nude from the window. A cynical dealer called Morel explains that Modi is sure to die soon and that is when people will pay for his works. The Zborowskis find an American millionnaire who is genuinely interested in some of Modi's canvasses (which would later become world-famous) but when he says he would then use the blue eyes of Jeanne to advertise his products, Modi walks out in disgust. Despondent at his inability to combine the quest for beauty in his paintings of Beatrice and Jeanne with any commercial reality, and with his health increasingly feeble, he goes round caf√©s trying without success to sell his drawings. Collapsing in the street, he is taken to hospital where he dies alone. Without telling her what has happened, Morel rushes round to a delighted Jeanne to buy up all unsold works for immediate cash.

Founded as a purpose-built village by Sir Samuel Davenport in 1848, it initially struggled due to high land prices in the area. However, with Adelaide's inevitable expansion residents eventually settled. The early village had quite a cosmopolitan flavour-although predominantly Anglo-Saxon like most of Australia at this point, many of Beaumont's early residents were veterans of the British Navy or Army or had lived in other countries for some time. Beaumont House, constructed around 1850 for Augustus Short, still stands and is now owned by the National Trust of South Australia. Edward Burton Gleeson, the founder of the Mid North town of Clare originally owned a farm within the boundaries of Beaumont in the early 1840s, which he named \\"Gleeville\\". He became insolvent, sold the property to Davenport in 1842 and moved to his country property \\"Inchiquin\\" in the Clare Valley region. The original village was centred on a small park known as the \\"Beaumont Common\\" (or to residents simply as \\"The Common\\"). The suburb has now expanded south-east in the direction of the hills however, with newer developments now on the face of the Adelaide Hills. Beaumont Common The Beaumont Common Beaumont Common was an English style Common. Ownership of The Common was originally vested in trust only for those residents living within the Village of Beaumont, that is the bounds of Cooper Place, Beaumont Road (now Glynburn Road), Dashwood Road and Devereaux Road (as if it actually continued due south to Dashwood instead of meandering to the east at West Tce). Originally it was fenced and gated with the key being available only to residents of the Village of Beaumont. The fence and gates were removed in the early 20th century. The trust deed was lodged at the Land Titles Office Adelaide. Trustees remaining on the death of a trustee appointed a successor by unanimous not majority vote. The last trustees included the late Alfred Scammell (of Fauldings) and J B Cleland. They appointed Burnside Council a co-trustee following an undertaking by Council to maintain The Common as an open space public park. As the remaining trustees aged, Burnside Council then attempted many times to instead build on the Common, against the wishes of Beaumont residents. Residents were successful in ensuring what later became the JB Cleland kindergarten, The Hazelwood Park Swimming Pool, the Beaumont Uniting Church Tennis Courts and the Beaumont Bowling Club were all erected elsewhere. Several attempts over the years to build public lavatories and entertainment facilities were also rebuffed. Burnside Council refused to agree to any further trustee appointments as trustees died. The remaining trustees attempted to appoint Gordon Ditter (Ditters Nuts). Council refused. Fearing an attempt to obtain control of the Common by attrition, residents petitioned the State Government in 1971 to remove Burnside Council as a trustee by act of SA Parliament. Burnside Council objected. Several heated meetings between Council and residents ensured. To resolve the impasse the State Government declared Beaumont Common a public park under the Parks and Gardens Act with clauses prohibiting any future building to ever take place on Beaumont Common. Later revisions of the Act have had those clauses removed. No resident consultation on their removal ever took place. In popular culture Beaumont is mentioned in the Redgum song \\"Beaumont Rag\\" featured on the band's 1978 album If You Don't Fight You Lose.

They are usually made of grape, fruit, and citrus, with added sugar, artificial flavor and artificial color. Brands * Buckfast Tonic Wine is a tonic wine with added alcohol, caffeine and sugar, produced under license from Buckfast Abbey, a Roman Catholic monastery located in Devon, England. It is very popular in Glasgow, Faifley, East Kilbride, Hamilton, Coatbridge and other Strathclyde areas in Scotland, but critics have blamed it for being a cause of social problems in Scotland. Some have called it \\"Wreck the Hoose Juice\\". It also enjoys a strong popularity and near cult-following in Northern Ireland, often referred to simply as \\"Buckie\\" and in some cases \\"Lurgan Champagne\\". *MD 20/20 (often called by its nickname Mad Dog) is an American fortified wine. The MD actually stands for its producer: Mogen David. MD 20/20 has an alcohol content that varies by flavor from 13% to 18%. Originally, 20/20 stood for 20 oz at 20% alcohol. Currently, MD 20/20 is sold neither in 20 oz bottles nor at 20% alcohol by volume. * Solntsedar (, named after a town on the Black Sea where it was produced) was a Soviet brand of low-end fortified wine produced using ingredients sourced from Algeria. It was marketed as \\"port wine\\" and infamous for many severe cases of alcohol poisoning and for inducing vomiting. Its production was canceled after Mikhail Gorbachev's anti-alcohol laws came into effect. * Wild Russian Vanya was a fortified fruit wine vinted and bottled by the Seabord Beverage Co and sold in the American southeastern states (such as Georgia and Florida) during the late 1960s and early 1970s. It was referred to in commercials as WILD RUSSIAN VANYA, WHAT A WINE, and featured various flavors similar to competitor brand MD 20/20. It had 20% alcohol by volume. Advertising implied the wine was a Russian import but it was produced in the US. It went out of production in the late 1970s. * Two notable brands are produced by the Centerra Wine Company (a division of Constellation Brands). ** Cisco is a fortified wine with varieties selling at 13.9%, 17.5%, and 19.5% alcohol by volume (ABV). It has a syrupy consistency and sweet taste. Because of its original color and bottle shape, it was frequently mistaken for a wine cooler. The Federal Trade Commission eventually required the company to put labels on their bottles stating that Cisco is not a wine cooler, to change the shape and color of their containers, and to recall their advertising slogan \\"Takes you by surprise\\". ** Richards Wild Irish Rose was introduced in 1954 and at its height sold about two million cases annually. The brand is available in 13.9% and 18% alcohol by volume and comes in both \\"red\\" and \\"white\\" varieties. The red is described as tasting like \\"cheap cherry hard candy\\" and the white like \\"crunchy milk and fake vanilla\\". * Three popular brands in this category have been produced by the E & J Gallo Winery, and were a large part of that company's early success. ** Ripple was a fortified and carbonated wine that was popular in the United States, particularly in the 1970s (and made famous by Fred G. Sanford of Sanford and Son). Possessing a low 11% ABV (lower than modern table wines), it was originally marketed to \\"casual\\" drinkers. Due to its low price, it gained a negative reputation as a drink for destitute alcoholics. It was popular among young drinkers, both underage and college students, due to its low price. It was later replaced with Boone's Farm. ** Night Train Express, usually abbreviated to Night Train, typically contains 17.5% ABV. Night Train Express has been condemned by some civic leaders who think inexpensive high alcohol content drinks contribute to vagrancy and public drunkenness. A full bottle was consumed by Joliet Jake in The Blues Brothers, after which he holds his head and refers to it as a \\"mean wine\\". The song \\"Nightrain\\" by rock band Guns N' Roses also pays tribute to this spirit. ** Thunderbird (The American Classic), a flavored, fortified wine of 13‚Äì18% ABV. Ernest Gallo ordered development of the wine upon discovering that inexpensive white port wine was popular in inner city and skid row neighborhoods, where shopkeepers would display lemon juice bottles and Kool-Aid packets next to the wine, which patrons would purchase to mix with the port and produce their desired flavor. A 1957 radio jingle proclaimed: \\"What's the word? Thunderbird / How's it sold? Good and cold / What's the jive? 'Bird's alive / What's the price? Thirty twice.\\" (i.e. 60 cents, at a time when the federal minimum wage was $1 per hour.) Gallo salesmen supposedly dropped empty Thunderbird bottles in the streets of skid-row neighborhoods to build brand awareness among city \\"wino\\" populations. The wine became so popular among the indigent that Gallo recounted a story in which he encountered a wino drinking on a sidewalk in Atlanta and upon asking him \\"What's the word?\\", the man shouted \\"Thunderbird!\\" after which both laughed. Another salesman told of giving free samples to alcoholics and newly-released prisoners. History An early reference to the problem of cheap and poorly made wines is in the \\"Report on Cheap Wines\\" in the 5 November 1864 issue of The Medical Times and Gazette. The author, in prescribing inexpensive wines for a number of ills, cautions against the \\"fortified\\" wines of the day, describing of one sample that he had tried: It is reported, however, that the popularity of cheap, fortified wines in the United States arose in the 1930s, as a product of Prohibition and the Great Depression: Concerns and media attention While overtaken somewhat in the low-end alcoholic drink market by sweetened malt beverages by the 1990s, the appeal of cheap fortified wines to the poor and homeless has often raised concerns: In 2005, the Seattle City Council asked the Washington State Liquor Control Board to prohibit the sale of certain alcohol products in an impoverished \\"Alcohol Impact Area\\". Among the products sought to be banned were over two dozen beers, and six wines: Cisco, Gino's Premium Blend, MD 20/20, Night Train, Thunderbird, and Wild Irish Rose. The Liquor Control Board approved these restrictions on 30 August 2006.Alcohol Impact Area Information and Updates , City of Seattle website.

The mine first operated from 1844 until 1850, and again briefly in 1888 to 1889, and 1916. From 1986 onwards, the mine was accessible by guided tour, until a rockfall event prompted its closure in 2005.  Development  The Wheal Watkins mine was preceded by the Wheal Gawler mine, which was opened in May 1841. The initial discovery of galena in the field is attributed to James Heneker. The property containing the Wheal Watkins lead and silver deposit was purchased by Mr Watkins of Worthing, England in December 1841. It was purchased through his South Australian agent, Peter Peachey, who opened a mine there on his behalf in 1843. He first worked the deposit in May 1844. The lode was found to contain 70% lead and 30 ounces of silver per ton. The ore was sold in London for ¬£13 13 shillings per ton. The mine's principle contractor was Thomas Williams, and a team of Cornish miners was employed. The 'wheal' part of the name comes from Cornish, and means 'place of work'. In its first year, the mine employed twelve to eighteen people. In the mine's first seven months, 150 tons of ore was extracted, 100 tons of which was shipped to England. A nearby hotel called The Miner's Arms provided accommodation and provisions to visitors to the mine and region. Peachey died in 1850, but work on the mine continued. The mine was abandoned due to a combination of \\"extravagant\\" management, the \\"ridiculously high\\" impost of royalties and miners seeking more lucrative prospects during the Victorian gold rush of 1851.  Later workings  The field, which included the adjacent Wheal Gawler and Glen Osmond mines, enjoyed a short-lived revival in 1888. At this time, the operation was led by Captain Rowe, and the mine's secretary was Mr H. Conigrave. A report on the mine from 1888 referred to the mine by the alternative name of \\"Peachey's lode\\". In 1913, a prospector became feint while down the mine, and was saved from falling to his death by his partner. A bow- line loop of rope was lowered around his body and the prospector was hauled safely to the surface. The last entity to formally work the mine was the Tarcoola Development Syndicate in 1916.  Closure  After the closure of the mine, some shafts and adits remained open. Several incidents are known to have occurred whereby people or animals fell down holes or became stuck in adits. These include a dog and a cow, both of which were safely recovered.  Preservation  The mine was listed on the South Australian Heritage Register in 1984 and was added to the now-defunct Register of the National Estate in 1996, and re-opened by then South Australian Minister for Mines, Stephen Baker MP. In 2004, tours departed from the Burnside Council Chambers with a round trip two hours in duration. Tours ran on the third Sunday of every month, and tickets cost $7 for adults and $4 for children. In 2005, the mine was closed after a rockfall event. In 2008, a bequest of $30,000 AUD was given to the City of Burnside Council in trust, to facilitate repairs and make it possible to reopen the mine for tours. The late donor, John Clark, had previously facilitated tours of the mine from 1986, and appeared in an episode of the TV series Postcards which was dedicated to the Glen Osmond mines, and presented by Keith Conlon. In 2008, Ross Both and Greg Drew wrote of the Glen Osmond mines in the Journal of Australasian Mining History: \\"It is essential that further restoration of the [Wheal Watkins] adits be carried out so that public access will again be possible to one of Australia's most significant mining heritage sites.\\" In 2013, Mayor David Parkin stated that \\"ratepayers have outlaid considerable funds on preservation of these mines over the years and it is a matter of judgment when enough is enough.\\" As of March 2016, the mine remains closed to the public. The Burnside Historical Society plans to work with the council to reopen the mine for tours and develop a display for public viewing which will feature a pick found in the Glen Osmond mine and a piece of galena.

He was one of the first post-World War II Germans to openly embrace Nazism and call for the formation of a Fourth Reich. He enacted a policy of setting up several differently named groups in an effort to confuse German authorities, who were attempting to shut down neo-Nazi groups. K√ºhnen's homosexuality was made public in 1986, and he died of HIV-related complications in 1991.  Early life  K√ºhnen was raised as a staunch Roman Catholic, and initially came to politics in his early teens as a Maoist.Martin A. Lee, The Beast Reawakens, London: Warner Books, 1998, p. 196 When he took a job at the shipyards of Hamburg, K√ºhnen moved to the far right, joining a local National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD) youth group. He did not remain long in the NPD, soon denouncing party members as \\"a bourgeois crowd of swines\\", and leaving the party to join the neo-Nazi movement.Lee, op cit 1970s Following his departure from the NPD, K√ºhnen had a brief spell in the German Army but he was dishonourably discharged in 1977 for attempting to spread Nazi propaganda in his barracks. During that time, he studied at the Helmut Schmidt University (originally known as the University of the German Federal Armed Forces Hamburg), located in Hamburg, Germany.\\"Wir wissen zuwenig\\" After this expulsion, he took his first steps in organising a new movement, setting up the Action Front of National Socialists. Initially, the organisation consisted only of K√ºhnen, but he soon made contact with like- minded individuals across West Germany, resulting in a nationwide network of cells. The group soon became notorious for its violent activities, which included bank robberies and arms raids, often working in tandem with other similar groups, such as the Wiking-Jugend.Lee, op cit, pp. 197‚Äì198 Known as the leader of the group, K√ºhnen was arrested in 1979 and sentenced to three and a half years in prison for inciting violence and racial hatred. Released in 1982, he set about trying to reorganise the Action Front of National Socialists, merging them with Thomas Brehl's National Activists, but the attempts were hindered by the Ministry of the Interior, who outlawed the group in November 1983. 1980s With the ANS/NA banned, K√ºhnen turned his attention to the fledgling Free German Workers' Party (FAP) and encouraged his supporters to infiltrate and take over the group. K√ºhnen's bid was successful, (largely due to the fairly insignificant nature of the FAP before K√ºhnen) but nonetheless, he found that support for his cause had waned during his prior incarceration. Some believe this was due to a move away from orthodox Nazism to Strasserism in the German underground, leaving K√ºhnen's position somewhat compromised. K√ºhnen then began to look to Ernst R√∂hm for inspiration, and he broke away from full support for Adolf Hitler; condemning Hitler's purges against the SA and calling for a return to pre-1934 Nazism.Lee, op cit, pp. 200‚Äì201 Alongside the infiltration he also formed his own successor group, the Gesinnungsgemeinschaft der Neuen Front in 1984. With rumours spreading that he was to be arrested, K√ºhnen fled to Paris in early 1984 and sought refuge with the neo-Nazi group F√©d√©ration d'action nationale et europ√©enne (FANE), with whom he had previously established contacts. Whilst working with FANE, he visited Spain and met with L√©on Degrelle, establishing relations with the former Waffen-SS man who had become a central player in the Spanish Circle of Friends of Europe (CEDADE).Lee, op cit, pp. 201‚Äì203 K√ºhnen was arrested in Paris and extradited to Germany to face trial on a number of charges related to neo-Nazism. He was sentenced to a further four years in prison. In 1986, while in jail, K√ºhnen came out as gay.Samar Habib, Islam and Homosexuality, ABC-CLIO, 2010, p. 421 In response to critics within the neo-Nazi movement, he argued that his lack of a family meant he had more time to devote to militancy, and he pointed out that Ernst R√∂hm was also a gay Nazi. However, K√ºhnen lost much support in the strongly-homophobic neo-Nazi scene. The FAP split, with K√ºhnen's former ally Friedhelm Busse leading the larger anti-gay wing, which held effective control of the party by 1989. K√ºhnen was released from prison in March 1988, and almost immediately, he set up a new group, Nationale Sammlung. When this group was banned the following year, he enacted a policy of setting up group after group, in an effort to confuse authorities.Lee, op cit, p. 231 Of these movements, German Alternative was the most well-known. During this period, it was revealed that K√ºhnen had contracted HIV.Rand C. Lewis, The Neo-Nazis and German Unification, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1996, p. 37 1990s Again implementing his direct action approach, K√ºhnen led a group of white power skinheads to Frankfurt an der Oder on April 8, 1991, to protest against the opening of the Polish border. Despite police presence, K√ºhnen led the group in throwing stones and other projectiles at cars crossing the border.Lee, op cit, p. 251 The Polish border incident was K√ºhnen's last public action. Within Germany, his death had a twofold effect on neo-Nazism; it meant the loss of its most dynamic leader, and it meant that the divisions he had caused would be largely left behind.Lee, op cit, p.252‚Äì254 He was effectively succeeded by Christian Worch, his closest ally, whom K√ºhnen had nominated to take over his leadership. K√ºhnen died on April 25, 1991, of AIDS-related diseases.Paul Hockenos, Free to Hate, Routledge, 1993, p. 63 He was cremated at the Kasseler Westfriedhof (Kassel West Cemetery).Staub zu Puderzucker See also *Nicky Crane *Russell Veh References *K√ºhnen v.

The Society was established as a medium for scholars to discuss relevant engineering issues and to fraternise. Nowadays, ENSOC is the largest faculty club at the University and welcomes members from all faculties. ENSOC is run by a student committee elected annually by the university's engineering students. Objectives ENSOC is an incorporated society whose constitutional objectives include: *To hold meetings at which papers may be presented, or addresses given, on engineering or allied subjects. *To assist members to understand the conduct of meetings, presenting papers, and promote knowledge desirable to practice as a professional engineer. *To further the cultural, educational, engineering and allied interests of members of the Society in particular and the School of Engineering in general. History The Canterbury College Engineering Society was founded by the Engineering School Dean, Professor-in-charge Robert Scott on 19 May 1897 when the School of Engineering was merely 10 years old. As such, it is one of the oldest surviving student clubs at the University of Canterbury; only being younger than the Christian Union by a couple of months. In the early decades of the 20th century, the Engineering Society was regarded as one of the most important student organisation of what was then Canterbury College, alongside the Christian Union and the Dialectic Society. Academic activities *Intermediate Mentoring - ENSOC organise an end of semester coaching series for struggling intermediates. The coaching is typically undertaken by members of the ENSOC Committee and other final year engineering students and capitalises on the positive role model status of its coaches. The activities include assistance with homework, individual \\"pep-talks\\", miniature construction activities. *Student Representation - The ENSOC Chairman along with five other members selected by the ENSOC Committee represent student interests at the monthly College of Engineering Faculty meetings. The Chairman is consulted by senior members of the College and Faculty on matters of interest to students and may attend Head of Department meetings on a casual basis. *The Templin Scroll - a competition instituted by Honorary Life Member J. R. Templin in 1941 to reward the best technical paper presented before the Society.

It is a constituent of crude oil and refined fuels. It is a flammable colorless liquid that has a boiling point of 152 ¬∞C. Nearly all the cumene that is produced as a pure compound on an industrial scale is converted to cumene hydroperoxide, which is an intermediate in the synthesis of other industrially important chemicals, primarily phenol and acetone. Production Commercial production of cumene is by Friedel‚ÄìCrafts alkylation of benzene with propylene. Cumene producers account for approximately 20% of the global demand for benzene.Market Study Benzene, published by Ceresana, July 2011 The original route for manufacturing of cumene was by alkylation of benzene in the liquid phase using sulfuric acid as a catalyst, but because of the complicated neutralization and recycling steps required, together with corrosion problems, this process has been largely replaced. As an alternative, solid phosphoric acid (SPA) supported on alumina was used as the catalyst. Reaction of benzene with propene to cumene in the presence of phosphoric acid supported on silica & promoted with boron trifluoride Since the mid-1990s, commercial production has switched to zeolite-based catalysts.The Innovation Group website, page accessed 15/11/07 In this process, the efficiency of cumene production is generally 70-75%. The remaining components are primarily polyisopropyl benzenes. In 1976, an improved cumene process that uses aluminum chloride as a catalyst was developed. The overall conversion of cumene for this process can be as high as 90%. The addition of two equivalents of propylene gives diisopropylbenzene (DIPB). Using transalkylation, DIPB is comproportionated with benzene. Safety Cumene forms peroxides upon long exposure to air.CDC - NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards Tests for peroxides are routinely conducted before heating or distilling.

This model is commonly used by consulting and accounting firms. For example, once a consultant accesses data belonging to Acme Ltd, a consulting client, they may no longer access data to any of Acme's competitors. In this model, the same consulting firm can have clients that are competing with Acme Ltd while advising Acme Ltd.

It is three kilometres south-east of Adelaide's central business district (CBD). The name Frewville is taken from an early settler James Frew. Frewville is in the local government area of the City of Burnside. It has a triangular layout, bounded on the north by Flemington Street, the east by Conyngham Street, and the south-west by Glen Osmond Road. History James Frew ca. 1865 James Frew Jr. ca. 1861 Frewville was originally part of the farming land originally sold to William Giles ‚Äî this land is now known as the suburb of Fullarton. In early maps Frewville is shown to be on both the north-eastern and south-western sides of Glen Osmond Road. =James Frew= James Frew (c. 1804 ‚Äì 21 June 1878), his wife Jane Frew, n√©e Fullarton (died 31 May 1878), and their daughter Ellen arrived in South Australia aboard Lady Bute in June 1839. Also on the voyage were his brothers Francis, James, and Robert. Frew acquired part of section 265 from Giles in July 1847, and subdivided it as \\"Frewville\\" in 1865.James Frew, State Library of South Australia He purchased section 252, Hundred of Adelaide, from P. V. Agnew, and in 1849 subdivided it as \\"Fullarton\\", his wife's former surname. In 1853 James Frew paid ‚Ç§2,200 for the allotment after Glen Osmond Road was cut through the middle of the Section. A son, James Frew Jr (21 October 1840 ‚Äì 8 September 1877) was born in Adelaide and educated at Adelaide Educational Institution. He was a member of John McDouall Stuart's 1861-1862 expedition, the first to cross the continent from south to north. He died aged 36 and was buried in the West Terrace Cemetery. =Frewville village= Frewville was originally used for the grazing of horses by the early colonists, but the village of Frewville was laid out in 1854 in Section 265. In 1855 a blacksmith set up on the corner closest to Adelaide, and the Frewville Inn was established on Glen Osmond Road. In the next few years a weighbridge was established by the Hollard family - whose name is remembered as one of the streets in Frewville. There was at about this time a single large two-storey wooden villa house that was set well back from Glen Osmond Road. Tall pines were planted along Glen Osmond Road. In 1881 most of Frewville was then subdivided into the property boundaries that exist today. The suburb was populated by the \\"new\\" trades-people of the day - electricians, gas-fitters and the like. In the 1930s Frewville was \\"landmarked\\" by the unusual advertising of a car wrecking yard on Glen Osmond Road. The car body of a Model \\"T\\" Ford was wedged high up in the branches of a tree. In the 1960s and 1970s the national freight carrier IPEC housed its main office and distribution centre at Frewville. The building has now been subdivided into offices. On the northern side of the suburb, in the Glenside hospital, a chemical research company built a large two-storey building in Flemington Street. This building caught fire sometime in the 1980s, and now is the headquarters for the Royal District Nursing Service (South Australia), a community-based nursing service. The McDonald's restaurant on Glen Osmond Road was one of the first McDonald's restaurants in Adelaide. Geography The suburb is leafy with some trees which make up for the lack of parks and reserves. There are more parks in nearby Glenunga, such as the Webb Oval which is on the eastern border of Frewville. Transport The suburb is well- serviced by public transport; buses run down Glen Osmond Road every 15 minutes until 6pm and there are numerous other bus routes in the city. The buses are provided by the Adelaide Metro. However, the majority of commuters still use cars and Frewville is well placed for this. Frewville residents can reach the Adelaide CBD by various routes, and the Adelaide Hills by way of Glen Osmond Road and the South Eastern Freeway. Residents The suburb is home to a number of families and retirees of predominantly Anglo-Celtic background. Some of the suburb is moderately wealthy, but as one border of Frewville is Glen Osmond road, a large part of the suburb is used for commercial and retail businesses. Attractions The main attractions of Frewville are the businesses along Glen Osmond Road - a McDonald's, Chinese and Mexican restaurants, along with a number of small businesses and motels. A prestige car company is located at the southernmost point adjacent to an office block that houses among other businesses a community television station. Politics Frewville is in the South Australian House of Assembly Electoral District of Unley and the Federal Division of Sturt.

Inhabited by the Kaurna people before settlement by Europeans, it became known as Pile's Paddock, after James Pile, who was born in the county of Yorkshire, England, in 1800 and arrived in South Australia in 1849. Pile's Paddock was popular as a picnic ground for a long time, before part of the land was reserved as a public recreation ground in perpetuity, as originally suggested by a Mr H.J. Holden, a member of the Tramways Trust, on condition that a tramline be run to the ground. This is now the large recreational park, Kensington Gardens Reserve, also referred to as Kensington Gardens, created around 1908‚Äì1909 and occupying . Stonyfell Creek runs through the park. The south-eastern corner and part of South Terrace were once part of a Kaurna burial ground. In 1906 the Bank of New South Wales obtained section 271 from William Pile and subdivided it in 1910, with the suburb renamed to Kensington Gardens around 1910, after Kensington Gardens in London. [cont. next page] A tramline for electric trams, part of the network of Adelaide trams and on the first line of the network to be electrified in 1909, was built as an extension to the Kensington Line, which had terminated The Parade/Gurrs Road intersection. The extension was built to serve the recently created reserve. An annual sweet-pea exhibition was held in the reserve between 1910 and 1920, and in 1920, trees were felled in order to create the bowling green in the north-east corner. By 1923, part of the park had been laid out as a garden by a Mr A.H. Matthews of the Tramways Trust, and the name Kensington Gardens was used to refer to the suburb or the reserve.

The son and aide-de-camp to Field Marshal and Reich President Paul von Hindenburg had considerable influence on the appointment of Adolf Hitler as German chancellor in January 1933. Early life Oskar von Hindenburg was born in K√∂nigsberg, East Prussia (present-day Kaliningrad, Russia), the only son of Paul von Hindenburg (1847‚Äì1934) and his wife Gertrud Wilhelmine (1860‚Äì1921). He had two sisters, Irmengard Pauline (1880‚Äì1948) and Annemarie (1891‚Äì1978). In 1921, he married Margarete von Marenholtz (1897‚Äì1988), the couple had four children. Military career He followed his father into the Prussian Army and joined the 3rd Foot Guards regiment in 1903, where he befriended Kurt von Schleicher. Initially, his career did not prosper, as Hindenburg's superiors considered him to be of low intelligence. Nevertheless, after his father became a German World War I hero upon the Battle of Tannenberg, Oskar von Hindenburg's career started to advance thanks to his surname. A General Staff officer at the Armeeoberkommando during the war, he achieved the rank of Hauptmann (Captain) in the 20th Division. The Reich President leaving Berlin Cathedral with his son and aide-de-camp Oskar von Hindenburg, January 1931 After the war, he continued his career within the newly established German Reichswehr, where he was promoted to Major and acted as his father's liaison officer. After his father became Reich President of the Weimar Republic in 1925, Major von Hindenburg acted as his father's aide-de-camp. As his father's closest friend and advisor, he exercised considerable power behind the scenes as he largely controlled access to the President. It was in large part due to his friendship with the younger von Hindenburg, that von Schleicher became Chancellor and one of the elder von Hindenburg's closest advisors. Because of this influence on the President beyond any control by constitutional means, the publicist and writer Kurt Tucholsky spoke of him as \\"... the son of the president, not designated by the Reich's constitution ...\\".... den in der Reichsverfassung nicht vorgesehenen Sohn des Reichspr√§sidenten ... Hitler's appointment In a meeting with the \\"camarilla\\" around Franz von Papen and State Secretary Otto Meissner on 22 January 1933, Oskar von Hindenburg, who like his father had long been opposed to making Hitler chancellor, was persuaded to support the plan to have Hitler appointed but having von Papen control him from behind the scenes as Vice-Chancellor. At the same time, Oskar was stuck in the major Eastern Aid (Osthilfe) scandal, concerning a Weimar Republic programme for developing the agrarian economy in eastern Germany. Moreover, he was under pressure due to his manor in Neudeck, which the German government with large contributions from German industrialists on initiative of Elard von Oldenburg- Januschau gave to President Hindenburg on the occasion of his 80th birthday on 2 October 1927. The president had titled the deed in the name of his son Oskar, according to his political opponents ostensibly to avoid payment of inheritance taxes. Shortly after Hitler's appointment, Hindenburg and his descendants were officially exempt from taxes by law. After his father's death, Major von Hindenburg made a radio broadcast on 18 August 1934, in which he asked the German people \\"in accordance with my father's intention\\" to vote 'Yes' in a plebiscite that took place the next day. The question posed in this plebiscite, was whether the German people approved of Hitler merging the offices of President and Chancellor into one. The speech text was published in all major newspapers. The \\"Yes\\" vote amounted to over 90%. In fact, Hitler had decided to succeed Hindenburg as F√ºhrer und Reichskanzler a long time before. World War II Discharged from active military service in the rank of Major General in 1934, Oskar von Hindenburg had retired to Neudeck manor. During World War II, Oskar von Hindenburg was again appointed General commanding in East Prussia, where he supervised several prisoner of war camps. Promoted to Generalleutnant in 1942, he finally requested permission to resign because he considered the position to be a demotion when compared to his previous military and government positions. As a member of the F√ºhrerreserve, he lived in Neudeck until the advance of Red Army troops late in the war forced him to flee to his brother-in-law in Medingen. Previously, he had supervised the dismantling of the Tannenberg Memorial honoring his father's 1914 victory over the Russians. He also had his parents' remains moved west. In the 1950s, Polish authorities razed the site, leaving few traces. Later life In the Nuremberg trials, Oskar von Hindenburg was a witness against Franz von Papen. In 1956, he won a lawsuit against South German Publishers, which in 1954 posthumously published the book by Baron Erwein von Aretin, Crown and Chains. Memories of a Bavarian Nobleman alleging that in 1930 Oskar von Hindenburg had obtained illegal funding from the Eastern Aid programme. Oskar von Hindenburg lived in Medingen, West Germany after the war. Having suffered a heart attack in early 1960 he traveled to a spa in Bad Harzburg, where he died on 12 February 1960. He was buried at Waldfriedhof Medingen. Assessment Oskar von Hindenburg in plain clothes fending off photographers, July 1932 Allegations that President Hindenburg appointed Hitler Chancellor because of pressure from his son Oskar have never been conclusively established. Nevertheless, Franz von Papen, who had served previously as Reich Chancellor until he was supplanted by Schleicher in December 1932, was negotiating behind Hitler's back to again be named chancellor of a presidential government (a government that would rule by decree under Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution) and almost succeeded, had it not been in large part for the influence of Oskar von Hindenburg on his father. While other factors are important, without the behind the scenes influence of Oskar von Hindenburg and State Secretary Meissner, Papen would have had a much tougher time convincing President Hindenburg to invite \\"that Bohemian corporal\\" and the Nazi Party to form a government at all.Fischer, Nazi Germany: A New History, pp. 255‚Äì258. William Shirer, in his book The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, states that Oskar von Hindenburg was promoted to Major General after the plebiscite unifying the offices of President and Reich Chancellor and that he remained a loyal Nazi. While he did fade from the history of the Third Reich after this plebiscite, Shirer argues that this final act in Hitler's consolidation of power was vital and without Oskar von Hindenburg's earlier influence with his father on behalf of Hitler's bid to be invited to form a government after the fall of Chancellor von Schleicher on 28 January 1933, Hitler might not have ascended to power at all. The other obvious influence in Hitler's favour was the likelihood of a coalition government with the conservative German National People's Party (DNVP). This almost fell apart at the last minute as well‚Äîthe coalition partners were so intent arguing over prospective cabinet appointments (the Nazis were ultimately outnumbered in the Cabinet 8-3) that they left Reich President Hindenburg waiting well past the appointed time for the meeting at which Hitler was named chancellor. The president almost cancelled the meeting in exasperation. Hitler being named chancellor was not certain until it was announced and it was Oskar von Hindenburg and his work with his father that (in Shirer's view) tipped the balance in Hitler's favour. Shirer also claims that Hindenburg Junior received 5,000 additional acres to his estates at Neudeck in addition to rapid advancement in the German Armed Forces. Secret British MI5 files declassified in February 2014 allege that President Paul von Hindenburg created a last will and testament that would have rejected Hitler's claim to the Reichstag and urged the nation to embrace democracy.Blake, Could WWII have been avoided?, The Daily Mail 14 March 2014 According to these files, President von Hindenburg drew up the will as a \\"bomb timed to go off posthumously to blow Hitler off course.\\" However, as soon as Hitler heard about the will, he reportedly ordered his henchmen to capture the document. Major von Hindenburg is alleged to have duly handed it over, and it was never seen again. Instead, the Nazis published Hindenburg's 'political testament' - which included an endorsement of Hitler and his political goals that some historians believe was a forgery. citation needed References Notes Bibliography * Fischer, Klaus.

History =Dr Penfold= Most of Rosslyn Park started life as paddocks belonging to Dr Christopher Rawson Penfold, of Penfolds Wine. Dr Penfold was an English emigrant who purchased of land in the area in 1844. Here he planted vines and established Penfolds as one of the leading winemakers in Australia. He and subsequent generations of his family resided at the Grange Cottage, to the east of Penfold Road. Dr Penfold became the first chairman of the District Council of Burnside in 1856. =Sub-division= Upon Dr Penfold's death in 1870, his son-in-law, Thomas Hyland, assumed control of the business, and began to sell some of the land. The area of Rosslyn Park to the west of Gordon Terrace, between Kensington Road and The Parade, was sold in 1877 to a syndicate made up of: *James Gartrell, merchant, partner in G. Wood, Son & Co. *Thomas Gordon, accountant *William Taylor, draper *Alexander McGeorge, draper *David Tweedy, land agent The syndicate subdivided the land, and sold parcels of it the next year. Wine production declined at the Rosslyn Park site in the 20th century as production shifted to other areas in South Australia. The last vintage of Penfolds Wine was crushed at Magill Estate in 1972. Prior to and following this, subdivision of the land surrounding Magill Estate continued. The area bounded by Penfold Road, Park Avenue, Edgcumbe Terrace and The Parade was formerly the site of Joseph Gillard Jnr's (manager at the Grange vineyard) main vineyard. It was sold and subdivided by the Penfolds in around 1912. The area around Angove Court and Edgcumbe Terrace contains the former family home of Dr Roger Angove, inaugural President of the Burnside Historical Society. This land was subdivided in 1960. The family stables remained until they were demolished by a landowner in 1970. A larger subdivision occurred in the early 1980s, when owners Tooth & Co sold much of the area to the east of Penfold Road, resulting in the survival of only the core of the former winery, including production plants and Grange Cottage. =Contemporary events= In May 2002, Rosslyn Park experienced an incidence of freak weather when a tornado passed through it and Wattle Park late in the morning. The tornado cut a narrow, 2 km long path of destruction through the suburbs, tearing limbs off trees and tiles from roofs.Bureau of Meteorology - Significant Weather May 2002, www.bom.gov.au Geography Eucalyptus trees on Edgecumbe Terrace Rosslyn Park is situated approximately 6 km east of the Adelaide city centre. It is bounded by The Parade to the north, Coach Road to the east, Kensington Road to the south and Hyland Terrace to the west. The suburb is divided by Penfold Road into two distinct areas. West of Penfold Road, the area is characterised by wide, tree-lined roads and architecture representing many styles popular during the twentieth century. East of Penfold Road, the area is much steeper in its approach to the Adelaide Hills, and contains some large, striking and very modern architecture. Some undeveloped vegetatation, and some of the vines, also remain in this part of the suburb. =Land use= Land use in Rosslyn Park is primarily residential. Penfolds is a notable exception, with its rows of grapevines along Penfold Road a relic of the area's earlier agricultural focus. =Significant places= Grange Cottage By far the most notable landmark in Rosslyn Park is the Magill Estate branch of Penfolds Winery. This site offers cellar door sales, tours and the award-winning Penfolds Magill Estate Restaurant. The winery's chimney is visible throughout the area. Also located at Magill Estate is the historic Grange Cottage. This was constructed by Dr Penfold and his wife, Mary, in 1845, and named after Mary's home town in England. Grange Hermitage wine was in turn named after the cottage. Other notable locations in Rosslyn Park include: *WH Holmes Reserve, situated on Park Avenue. *Dr Christopher Rawson Penfold Reserve, a small park on the corner of The Parade and Penfold Road. The park contains a collection of winemaking artefacts donated by wineries in the area. *The Consulate General of Greece, located on Mary Penfold Drive. =Street names= Entrance to Mary Penfold Drive Street names in Rosslyn Park reflect the area's viticultural history and the predilections of its subdividers. *Angove Court: named for Roger Angove, whose former family home is located at the end of the court *Ayr Street: also the name of a Scottish town, likely originates with the Scottish heritage of members of the syndicate *Dalwood Court: the name of a range of Penfolds wine *Edgcumbe Terrace: name of the Angoves' family home *Gillard Drive: named for Joseph Gillard Jnr, manager of the Penfolds cellars and vineyards 1869-1905 *Gordon Terrace: named for Thomas Gordon, syndicate member *Grange Avenue: name of the Penfolds' family cottage *Hyland Terrace: named for Thomas Hyland, son-in-law of Dr Penfold and a key contributor to the winemaker's success *Inez Court: named for Inez Hyland, granddaughter of Dr Penfold *Lanark Street: also the name of a Scottish town, probably originates with the syndicate *Mary Penfold Drive: Mary was Dr Penfold's wife and supervised the development of the company after his death *Penfold Road: named for Dr Penfold and his wife, Mary *Rawson Penfold Drive: named for Dr Penfold *Schubert Court: named for Max Schubert, creator of the Grange Hermitage wine *Taylor Terrace: named for William Taylor, syndicate member A bus stop on Penfold Road Politics At the Federal level, Rosslyn Park residents are represented in the electorate of Sturt. The member for the seat is currently Christopher Pyne MP. At the state level, the suburb is split between the electorates of Hartley, currently held by Grace Portolesi MP, and Morialta, currently held by John Gardner MP. Transport Rosslyn Park is primarily accessed by car and bus. The main roads leading to the suburb are The Parade, Kensington Road and Penfold Road. The Adelaide Metro bus system services Rosslyn Park, with routes H22 and H20 travelling from Grenfell Street in the city to service the area via the Parade, and routes H23 and 141 servicing the area via Kensington Road. The 141 originates from North Terrace in the city, whilst the H23 follows the routes of H20 and H22 before crossing over to Kensington Road via Portrush Road. Bike lanes also exist most of the way along the Parade into the suburb, whilst the development of a 'bicycle boulevard' on the suburban Beulah Road also promotes bicycle usage in the area.

It is located in the City of Burnside. Geography The suburb is located in the foothills of the Adelaide Hills, in a region known as the Hills Face Zone. It is the easternmost suburb in the Burnside council area. Most of the streets have expansive westward views over the Adelaide plains. Allotments in these streets thereby command high prices. As a result, there are many prestige residences. Demographics The 2006 Census by the Australian Bureau of Statistics counted 278 persons in Skye on census night. Of these, 50.4% were male and 49.6% were female. The majority of residents (69.8%) are of Australian birth, with other common census responses being England (6.1%), Italy (5.4%), Malaysia (2.5%), Scotland (2.5%), and India (2.2%). The age distribution of Skye residents is skewed slightly higher than the greater Australian population. 73.8% of residents were over 25 years in 2006, compared to the Australian average of 66.5%; and 26.2% were younger than 25 years, compared to the Australian average of 33.5%. Facilities and attractions =Views= Many parts of Skye have views over Adelaide, reaching to Spencer Gulf. =Parks= There is a reserve between Wyfield Street and Knox Terrace. =Water= Supply of reticulated water has been controversial for decades, primarily due to the steepness of the streets. Previously, many allotments within the suburb have no government water supply, instead being serviced by independent water schemes sourced from bores, some being privately owned, some being co-operatives. However SA Water is now taking responsibility for the water supply with all homes expected to be connected to their systems in early 2016. =Roads= Skye is serviced by Old Norton Summit Road, connecting the suburb to Magill Road and Adelaide city centre. The loftiest (and most populous) portions of the suburb are reached by Coach Road, sections of which are quite steep. Coach Road is an extension of Norwood Parade.

History =Quarry and winery= Stonyfell quarry, c.1923 James Edlin opened the first quarry in the hundred of Adelaide on Section 1050 in 1837, to supply building stone and slate to local builders. G. Walker Johnson and Arthur Hardy took over the quarry by 1850 and it became known as Beacon Hill Quarry.

By 1862, had been planted with vines, mostly of the Black Portugal variety. Joseph Crompton assisted in the vineyard, and in 1862 established a partnership with Clark and his brother A. Sidney Clark to conduct the business of winemakers, trading as Clark and Crompton. The company offices were in the same building as Francis Clark and Sons, with a warehouse in Blyth Street, Adelaide. On Henry's death, Sidney inherited his share of the business, which he sold to Crompton in 1873, though the business name remained \\"Clark and Crompton\\" until 1880. Crompton took over the Home Park Winery at Magill, at which time Henry Tyler was the winemaker. Crompton married Susan Mary, sister of Clark, in 1866. The house and property, including the vineyards and winery, was taken over by quarry operator Henry Dunstan in 1886 or 1888, after he had acquired nearby properties for quarrying in 1877. In 1892 he separated the quarry and wine business, forming two companies. He employed Henry Martin as his secretary and accountant, with the company first called \\"H.Dunstan & Co. Winegrowers\\". Martin's son Ronald joined his father in 1902, trading as H.M. & R.H. Martin. Winery, c.1920 Stonyfell took over winemaking for Arthur Formby at Langhorne Creek in 1910; in 1955 the storage was moved to Stonyfell and the grapes from the Langhorne Creek property were crushed at Stonyfell. In 1939 the winery purchased a vineyard in Rostrevor and in 1949 another property at Magill. Ronald Martin died in a car accident in 1950; in 1958 Michael Auld was managing director and John Kilgour the winemaker. By this time, the original vineyard no longer existed, but was thought to be where the Stonyfell Quarry offices stood. The great hill on the Stonyfell property was still being quarried by Dunstan's family (as Quarry Industries Ltd.) well over a century after the first rock was quarried. In 1972 the winery was owned by Dalgety Australia, but by 1978 had been taken over by Seagram's, at which time the winemaking part of the business at Stonyfell was wound up. The Stonyfell Restaurant opened in 1981, after a -million renovation under V. Deleso, who planned to restart winery operations, using grapes from the remaining of vineyard at Stonyfell, complemented by more from Barossa Valley vineyards. Promotions manager Kevin Parker said that activities in the functions cellar (which had been open since 1975 and seated about 200 people) had continued strongly, although wine-making had declined. The Stonyfell Winery and Vineyards were recommended for the local heritage list in 1986, at which time the premises comprised a restaurant and a small winery. In 2001, Amphora Wine Group bought the premises, reopening the site to the public in 2007. The winery outbuildings, including the \\"vintage hall\\", were converted into a function centre for weddings and other events, However the Stonyfell Function Centre closed on 30 June 2014. =Clifton Manor= The Clifton Manor estate was established by a flour miller named George Sismey, who built the grand Gothic Revival-style mansion in 1852. The home was first leased (in 1872) and later purchased by Nathaniel Knox, who extended and developed the gardens, planting many European trees and shrubs. The estate was subdivided in 1926 and again in 1976, reducing the size to , and since then subdivided further for housing. =Olives= The Stonyfell Olive Company was founded by Joseph Crompton with William Mair and Sidney Clark in 1873, with planting continuing until 1882. By the 1900 had a planted with about 10,000 olive trees, around Penfold Road. In 1901, the company employed 81 workers. This business became largely owned by the family of Owen Crompton (1875‚Äì1923) after his marriage to Sarah Simpson, daughter of A. M. Simpson, who settled on her the whole of his considerable stake in the company. With the inexorable expansion of Adelaide's suburbs, the land was sold to developers. The olive crushing plant was actually in what is now the suburb of Wattle Park, at the western end of Crompton Drive. In August 1932, the Stonyfell Olive Company was the largest producer of olive oil in South Australia, and it entered into an agreement with Bickford's (manufacturers of drinks and cordials) to do the bottling of the oil. =Chiverton= Another grand manor, Chiverton, was built in the Italianate style in 1880 for merchant John Nankivell, but he soon afterwards leased the house to Harry Bickford, the manufacturer of drinks, cordials and syrups. The house was purchased by the Anglican Community of Sisters in 1894, who established a school on the premises. In 1957 the Sisters moved their North Adelaide school, St Peter's Girls' School, to the Stonyfell building. The house, stables and coach house were made of stone from the nearby quarry, and are now heritage-listed. The house is used as the school's administration building Description Stonyfell Creek arises on the eastern border of Stonyfell, flowing through several suburbs before joining Second Creek. St Peter's Girls' School was founded in 1894 in North Adelaide and moved to its current site on Hallett Road in Stonyfell in 1957. The cellars of the old Stonyfell winery now house Massey wines, while Stonyfell Wines now uses vineyards at Langhorne Creek. There is still a quarry operating at Stonyfell , operated by Boral since the 1980s and extracting sandstone and quartzite. The Stonyfell Quarry Reserve is on Penfold Road. Parks and reserves The Ferguson Conservation Park, adjacent to St Peter's School, was dedicated as a conservation park on 2 June 1977. It is a Category III protected area. In 1980, the conservation park was listed on the former Register of the National Estate. The Michael Perry Botanic Reserve, comprising a long strip of land along Second Creek, originally part of the Clifton Manor estate, was created in the 1970s. It is named after Michael Perry, who was a councillor, alderman and Mayor of Burnside between 1958 and 1983. A Vegetation Management Plan for the reserve was published by the council in 2012, which recommended a return to the native vegetation of the area. Restoration work has been undertaken by the council and biodiversity contractors since then. Part of the revegetation project was undertaken by a collaboration involving Burnside Council and Boral, as a corporate partner of Conservation Volunteers Australia (CVA), and 17 volunteers. More than 500 native seedlings were planted, and a new walking track was constructed in 2017. In 2019, the Michael Perry Reserve Historic Garden Adaptation Plan was developed by council, \\"to guide the restoration of the historic garden areas of the reserve\\".

History Possibilities for derivation of the name Toorak are Torrak, an aboriginal word meaning tea-tree springs, toora an Aboriginal word for coot or malleefowl and other aboriginal words of similar pronunciation meaning reedy swamp and black crow.History of Toorak, Victoria, localhero.biz Today's suburb of Toorak Gardens is composed of parts of the Adelaide sections of 275 (Toorak) and 274 (Monreith Farm). Section 274 was bounded by (in clockwise order) Swaine Avenue, Portrush Road, Greenhill Road and Fullarton Road. Section 275 was bounded by Kensington Road, Portrush Road, Swaine Avenue and Prescott Terrace. The suburb of Toorak was first developed in 1912, largely on land that had previously been the eastern half of the Prescott Farm. Before its development into a village, it had been farmland up until that point with little settlement apart from the Prescott's home and worksheds as well as two large and extravagant houses. Julia Hallett owned a spectacular mansion on Portrush Road (now located at No. 15) while Benjamin Burford had a grand mansion on Kensington Road that he named Attunga. When the suburb was first planned, laid-out and named there were many objections, primarily because of the association with the elite Melbourne suburb of Toorak (which remains wealthy and upper-class to this day). The real-estate agents assigned to the suburb received many complaints due to this association, including one signed 'No Snobbery'. Extensive building restrictions were placed on development in the early suburb. After the first houses had been built, the Adelaide Mail reported on 18 May 1912: Toorak received considerable attention from real- estate businesses, the press and the community at large. The Adelaide papers paid particular notice to the suburb's developments, announcing council work on the suburb's paths and gardens. In 1912 when trees were planted on Grant and Alexandra avenues, in 1914 when flower strips were developed on the kerbs, in 1916 when a reserve was created on Giles Street; they were all quickly reported. The Toorak Bowling Club was also developed in this era, it stands to this day. The Attunga property being inspected by the Burnside Council in 1944 Section 274 was bought by a Scottish family, the Fergussons. It was purchased along with property at Knoxville (today's suburbs of Glenunga and Glenside) and named by the family. They had come from the village of Monreith in Wigtown County, Scotland and gave that name to their new farm. The Monreith farm was steadily developed by the family, but with the death of Alexander Fergusson in 1869, the property passed into the hands of his widow, Agnes. She sold off parts of the farm in 1883 for ¬£15,000, and the remainder in 1917 for ¬£20,000. Before the farm was sold, the Fergussons had established a flour mill, horse stabling and were engaging in business ventures in various parts of the state. It was in 1917The Manning Index of South Australian History, www.slsa.sa.gov.au that Monreith was given its modern name of Toorak Gardens. Developers started subdividing the new suburb on much the same lines as Toorak had been, with similar building restrictions and much media attention. The original Fergusson family home was demolished in 1923 and the family settled in separate houses on Cudmore Avenue. Miss Ivy Laver, a successful local businesswoman, was responsible for building the main park of Toorak Gardens, Fergusson Square. It remains as a monument to those who first settled the area. Benjamin Burford's Attunga property contained the largest and most extravagant mansion built in the suburb, and with his passing it was bought in 1905 by an investor from Broken Hill, Otto Georg Ludwig von Rieben. Although living at the property for 37 years, maintaining it, and paying particular attention to the gardens, von Rieben eventually settled on a property at Mount Lofty in the Adelaide Hills. Attunga however, almost forty years after he gained it, was offered to the Burnside Council free of charge in 1944 for use as a hospital, on the condition that the house and grounds be maintained. A Council committee had previously suggested building a community hospital in August 1943, as part of its Post-War Reconstruction and Development Plan; it was to cost no more than ¬£100,000, and was to remain as a memorial to honour Burnside's war dead. In April 1949 the first conversion of von Rieben's home was completed, as a convalescent home caring for 21 patients. It closed in September 1956, having cared for over 1,400 patients. The adjacent newly completed Burnside War Memorial Hospital opened in October, and received its first patients in November 1956. Geography A typical tree lined street in Toorak Gardens.

There is only one notable park, Fergusson Square; the only other open space is provided by the Toorak Bowling Club. Prior to European settlement, the area was heavily forested. Blue Gum and River Gum trees grew on the floodplains around First and Second creeks. Grey box woodlands, known to early settlers as the 'black forest', grew around and south of Greenhill Road. Native Australia flora and fauna inhabited the plains. With the advent of colonisation, much of the forest was cleared and replaced by farmland, on which wheat and barley were grown.City of Burnside: Native Vegetation Accessed 13 June 2007 First Creek provided a reliable source of water, and crops flourished. In the late 19th century, the area that today comprises Toorak Gardens was almost completely free of native vegetation. When the land was sold and subdivided, with streets beginning to run through it, lush gardens were grown. The new wealthy white inhabitants, both of their own preference, and under duty from the land deed, put much effort into the suburb's greenery.

By the 1900 had a planted with about 10,000 olive trees, around Penfold Road. In 1901, the company employed 81 workers. This business became largely owned by the family of Owen Crompton (1875‚Äì1923) after his marriage to Sarah Simpson, daughter of A. M. Simpson, who settled on her the whole of his considerable stake in the company. With the inexorable expansion of Adelaide's suburbs, the land was sold to developers. The olive crushing plant was actually in what is now Wattle Park, at the western end of Crompton Drive. In August 1932, the Stonyfell Olive Company was the largest producer of olive oil in South Australia, and it entered into an agreement with Bickford's to do the bottling of the oil. =Post office= Wattle Park Post Office opened on 8 April 1965 and closed in 1967.

It also addresses how to assign specific access rights. It is mainly used in access control mechanisms for distributed systems. There are three main parts to the model: A set of subjects, a set of objects, and a set of eight rules. A subject may be a process or a user that makes a request to access a resource. An object is the resource that a user or process wants to access.  Features  This model addresses the security issues associated with how to define a set of basic rights on how specific subjects can execute security functions on an object. The model has eight basic protection rules (actions) that outline: * How to securely create an object. * How to securely create a subject. * How to securely delete an object. * How to securely delete a subject. * How to securely provide the read access right. * How to securely provide the grant access right. * How to securely provide the delete access right. * How to securely provide the transfer access right. Moreover, each object has an owner that has special rights on it, and each subject has another subject (controller) that has special rights on it. The model is based on the Access Control Matrix model where rows correspond to subjects and columns correspond to objects and subjects, each element contains a set of rights between subject i and object j or between subject i and subject k. For example an action A[s,o] contains the rights that subject s has on object o (example: {own, execute}). When executing one of the 8 rules, for example creating an object, the matrix is changed: a new column is added for that object, and the subject that created it becomes its owner. Each rule is associated with a precondition, for example if subject x wants to delete object o, it must be its owner(A[x,o] contains the 'owner' right )  Limitations  Harrison- Ruzzo-Ullman extended this model by defining a system of protection based on commands made of primitive operations and conditions.

He served as a United States Senator from the state of Vermont and as the President pro tempore of the United States Senate during the early 1800s. Early life Bradley was born on February 20, 1754, in the part of Wallingford, Connecticut that is now Cheshire.Franklin Bowditch Dexter, Biographical Sketches of the Graduates of Yale College: May 1763-July 1778 with Annuals of the College History, Vol. III (Henry Holt & Co.: 1903), pp. 549-52. He was the son of Moses and Mary (Row) Bradley. He was the grandson of Stephen Bradley, a New Haven silversmith who was one of six brothers who served in Cromwell's Ironsides before emigrating to America. Bradley graduated from Yale College in 1775. After his graduation, Bradley was commissioned as captain in the Connecticut Militia and rose to the rank of major. He commanded the Cheshire Volunteers and in December 1776, he served as adjutant. He was promoted to vendue master (auctioneer of seized enemy and Loyalist property) and quartermaster, and then served as aide-de-camp to General Wooster during the British attack on Danbury on April 27, 1777 when Wooster was fatally wounded. Bradley resigned his commission after the battle. He received a Master of Arts degree from Yale in 1778. In 1779, he moved to Westminster, Vermont and studied law, directed by Tapping Reeve, founder of the Litchfield Law School. Bradley was admitted to the bar in 1779 and began the practice of law in Westminster, becoming an important citizen of the town. In October 1779, the Legislature selected him as one of five agents to the U.S. Congress from Vermont; in early 1780, he wrote a tract entitled Vermont's Appeal to a Candid and Impartial World, which defended Vermont's right to independence against competing claims by New York, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts. Political career In June 1780, Bradley was appointed state's attorney for Cumberland County, Vermont. He held the positions of register of probate and town clerk, and in 1783 he served as county judge. He also served for seven years in the Vermont House of Representatives in the 1780s. He was speaker of the Vermont House of Representatives during 1785. Bradley continued to be given additional responsibility in the militia. Appointed a first lieutenant in August 1780, he was promoted to colonel as commander of the 1st Regiment in October. He was later promoted to brigadier general as commander of the 8th Brigade, and served until 1791. He served as judge of the Vermont Superior Court during the 1780s, and of the Vermont Supreme Court in 1788. Bradley was instrumental in settling Vermont's boundary disputes with New Hampshire. Vermont became part of the United States on March 4, 1791. Bradley and Moses Robinson were elected by the state legislature to be the first to fill Vermont's two senate seats. In 1791, he entered the United States Senate and supported the anti-administration faction. Defeated for reelection in 1794, he returned to Westminster and was active in law and local politics, serving on the town council. Reelected as a Jeffersonian candidate to the United States Senate in 1800, he served as President pro tempore of the Senate from the end of 1801 to near the end of 1802. After he was reelected in 1807, he served as the presiding officer again for a couple of weeks in the 1808-1809 period. Bradley is credited with writing the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which was passed by Congress in 1803 and ratified in 1804. Although a Democratic-Republican, he was opposed to the War of 1812. After retiring from the Senate in 1813, he retired from politics and returned to Westminster. He lived there for five years, and in 1818 he moved to Walpole, New Hampshire where he lived for the rest of his life. His Walpole house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Death Bradley died in Walpole, Cheshire County, New Hampshire, on December 9, 1830 (aged 76 years, 292 days). His body was returned to Westminster, Vermont and he is interred at the Westminster Cemetery. Personal life Known as an intelligent and eccentric man, Bradley was a good lawyer and orator.

Biography =Early career= Born in Montreal, Quebec in 1888 and after graduating from McGill University with a degree in civil engineering he moved to Saint Boniface, Manitoba where his bilingual Montreal upbringing fostered quick assimilation into the local French and Metis culture. =Political career= Bilingual and bicultural, John Caswell Davis's political abilities were appreciated as a bridge to unify a French minority intent on asserting itself culturally and politically within a Canada dominated by the English majority. Member of the Liberal Party and gifted orator John Caswell Davis entered the senate in 1949. His promising political career was cut short by his untimely death in 1953 while only 63 years old. =Other work= Caswell Davis was a gifted, inspired, and prolific artist who worked in numerous media including pencil, pen and ink, watercolour, and pastels. His landscapes captured the changing and often vanishing natural beauty of the forests, prairie, and mountains of western Canada. His cityscapes are low key but very revealing explorations of a Canadian society in process of urbanisation after centuries of rural existence. As a draughtsman, his linear ability was used in the documentation of the everyday life of French Canada and his adopted home St. Boniface. Adept at representation, his numerous portraits of friends and family members demonstrate a brilliance in capturing and revealing the personality and inner character of the subject. His numerous journeys to London and Paris made him aware of the fervent that contemporary European art was experiencing. While never addressing 20th-century modernism, Caswell Davis drew inspiration from the 19th century concerns of painters such as Millet and the Barbizon School's commitment to landscape the portrayal of more humble members of society. Individuals from all stations of life were C D's subjects, including prime ministers and politicians, wealthy and famous, colourful voyageurs and trappers, members of first nation Canada, humble farmers, tradesmen, merchants, and housekeepers. A first rate draughtsman and brilliant caricaturist who drew inspiration from Daumier and the 19th-century tradition of satire and political cartoon, much of his best work involved an understated and quiet portrayal of the ironic and humorous spectacle of everyday experience. He was also deeply committed to the documentation of vanishing Aboriginal Canada. His fondness and fascination for native culture resulted in numerous portraits that he executed while attending and participating in pow wows and tribal gatherings all over Canada. =Personal life= He married Priscilla Emmerling Guilbault (1896 - 1973) in approximately 1916 (Emmerlings and Guilbaults were peripherally involved in the Riel Rebellion) and their union produced four children: James Edward Joseph (1919‚Äì2003); Yvonne (b. 1921); Lucille (1923‚Äì1995); and Patricia (b. 1931).

The drama features Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, David Strathairn, Vanessa Martinez and Kris Kristofferson.. It is the first theatrical film to be released and distributed by Screen Gems. Plot Port Henry, Alaska, is a town undergoing stress as the local economy switches from an industrial one based around the canning and paper industries towards a tourism-based model. Joe Gastineaux is a former high school basketball star and fisherman who quit fishing after some undisclosed tragedy. He now works as a handyman, particularly for Frannie and Lou, a lesbian couple who own the local resort hotel. Joe is friends with teenager Noelle De Angelo who also works for Frankie and Lou. At an event which they are working, Noelle's mother Donna, a lounge singer, breaks up with her live in boyfriend and asks Joe for help in moving. The two become close and eventually begin a romantic relationship. Meanwhile, Joe gets the chance to return to fishing when Frankie and Lou ask him to work a fishing boat which they have acquired as collateral from local fisherman Harmon. Donna has a strained relationship with her daughter Noelle, due mainly to Noelle's disapproval of her mother's lifestyle. This is exacerbated when Donna begins dating Joe, who Noelle had a crush on. Donna overhears the story of why Joe quit fishing: he had been involved in a deadly sinking which claimed the lives of all of his boatmates, including the brother of local bush pilot and small-time criminal \\"Smilin Jack\\" Johannson. When Joe's dissolute half-brother Bobby shows up, he asks Joe to help crew his boat to pick up a client. Joe brings along Donna and Noelle. They dock for the night in an isolated bay and Bobby reveals the truth: he is involved in marijuana smuggling and had dumped a load overboard when he was spooked by the police. Now they are going to meet Bobby's partners to settle his debt. That night, men sneak onto the boat and kill Bobby. Joe, Donna, and Noelle flee to a nearby island where the men begin to hunt them. They take shelter in an abandoned cabin and try to survive. As they do they grow closer and Noelle finds a diary written by a teenage girl who had lived in the cabin with her family. She spends the nights reading segments of the diary to Joe and Donna. Eventually Donna looks at the diary and discovers that it is blank after the portion her daughter Noelle had read during the first two evenings. Noelle had made up most of its contents, expressing her own feelings. They maintain a signal fire and scrape some food from the seashore. After a week and a half a seaplane piloted by Smilin' Jack Johannson lands. He says that he is looking for supplies, his radio is busted, and that he doesn't have enough fuel to fly them out. He tells Joe that he was hired by a couple of men to look for three people roughing it. When told of Bobby's murder, he expresses sympathy and promises to return the next day and rescue them. Joe, who does not trust Jack, sees the radio was removed, and remains unsure of whether the seaplane return will bring rescue or the men who killed his brother. A stressful few days of rain prevent any flights' return. One morning Joe, Donna, and Noelle gather on the beach as a seaplane flies towards them, larger than the one belonging to Jack.

Roger Ebert lauded the film and its story structure, writing, \\"What I liked so much about this story structure is that it confounded my expectations at every step. I expected the story to stay in Juneau, but it didn't. When it took a turn toward adventure, I thought the threat would come from nature‚Äîbut it comes from men. After the three characters are stranded, I expected‚ÄîI don't know what, maybe Swiss Family Robinson-style improvisation. But Sayles gradually reveals his buried theme, which is that in a place like the Alaskan wilderness you can never be sure what will happen next. And that optimism, bravery and ingenuity may not be enough.\\" Christopher Null lambasted the ending, writing, \\"I can forgive many things. But using some hackneyed, whacked-out, screwed-up non-ending on a movie is unforgivable. I walked a half-mile in the rain and sat through two hours of typical, plodding Sayles melodrama to get cheated by a complete and total copout finale.\\" Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that the film has a 72% fresh rating, based on thirty-nine reviews.. =Accolades= Wins * Seattle International Film Festival: Golden Space Needle Award; Best Director, John Sayles; 1999. * National Board of Review: Special Recognition, for excellence in filmmaking; 1999.

LaFortune, was mayor of Tulsa from 1970 to 1978.Kent A. Schell, Robert James LaFortune profile at the Oklahoma Historical Society Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture ; retrieved February 5, 2009.\\"Boardmember in the Spotlight,\\" Oklahoma Cities and Towns (June 2005), pp. 5-6. He attended Cascia Hall Preparatory School, the University of California, Santa Barbara, and the University of Tulsa College of Law. History in Tulsa Politics Bill LaFortune served as district attorney of Tulsa County, as a special judge for Tulsa County, and as Assistant Attorney General for the state of Oklahoma. Running as a Republican, he was elected mayor in 2002, but he was unsuccessful in his bid for re-election on April 5, 2006 when he lost to his Democratic opponent, former Oklahoma Secretary of Commerce and Tourism, Kathy Taylor. LaFortune's nephew, G. T. Bynum, ran for mayor of Tulsa in 2016 and was elected to begin the role that December. = Mayor, City of Tulsa, 2002-2006 = While a partner at the prestigious Tulsa law firm of Norman Wohlgemuth Chandler and Dowdell, Tulsa's longtime Mayor Susan Savage announced she would be retiring at the end of her current term, thereby creating a vacancy in the Mayor's office in 2002. LaFortune, with a long career of public service and community involvement, ran for the office against several other contenders. Running as a Republican, he won decisively in both the primary and general elections.\\"Difficult decisions await LaFortune.\\" Tulsa World. 17 March 2002. = Vision 2025 = Despite the economic downturn, LaFortune was able to put together a county-wide coalition of elected officials, business leaders and everyday citizens to prepare a long overdue capital improvements plan. The result of this unprecedented effort was ‚ÄúVision 2025‚Äù, a four-part $885 million ballot initiative which was passed overwhelmingly by Tulsa County voters in September 2003. LaFortune was the point person for the successful campaign. Over 34 job incentives and capital improvement projects were funded through Vision 2025, including significant new medical clinics at the University of Oklahoma-Tulsa and in Tulsa's under-served communities, a new engineering facility at Oklahoma State University's Tulsa Campus, a new administration building at Langston University's Tulsa Campus, books and updated technology for Tulsa's school children, and capital improvements at many Tulsa County smaller municipalities. = BOK Center = The flagship project of Vision 2025, however was an 18,000 seat multi-purpose event center/arena, later named as the BOK Center. Since its completion in 2008, the BOK Center has consistently ranked in the nation's top arenas for tickets sales, hosting the biggest names in the entertainment world. LaFortune personally selected world-renowned architect Cesar Pelli as the architect for the venue and his outstanding achievement that is now the BOK Center. In addition to being showered with numerous honors, the arena was recognized as the top venue in the country by the International Entertainment Buyers Association in October 2016. = District Judge, 14th Judicial District, State of Oklahoma, 2015 ‚Äì present = Bill LaFortune was elected to a four-year term as District Judge for the 14th Judicial District of the State of Oklahoma in 2014. He ran unopposed in the non-partisan race. Judge LaFortune brought his legacy of public service to the bench in 2015. He has presided over a full- time criminal felony docket since that time. He has handled approximately 15,000 felony case docket settings over that period.Oklahoma Supreme Court Network (OSCN), Docket CF-B, Tulsa County District Court, 12 January 2015 to present. He has also presided over approximately 60 felony jury trials, including trials of multiple defendants. Most of these trials involved either first degree murder, rape, armed robbery or child abuse charges. Even more importantly, in cases resulting in conviction and were subsequently appealed, Judge LaFortune has been consistently affirmed by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals. He was also affirmed, and new law was made, as to the application of the Uniform Interstate Detainers Act. His decisions in post- conviction relief cases have also been consistently affirmed. Administratively, Judge LaFortune was elected by his fellow criminal division judges as Chief of the Criminal Division within just his first year of taking office. During his tenure, he has developed a reputation for a strong work ethic, dedication, fairness and integrity. He has also championed alternatives to incarceration for non-violent offenses, specifically Tulsa's Women in Recovery Program. Legal career =Introduction= Bill LaFortune served as a licensed legal intern for the Tulsa County District Attorney's Office in the spring of 1983 during his third year of law school.\\"Internship instrumental in setting goal.\\" Tulsa Daily Commerce and Legal News. 9 June 1993. Immediately after his graduation from the University of Tulsa College of Law, LaFortune was hired as a contracts administrator for Telex Computer Products, Inc. He was later promoted to Senior Contracts Administrator, acting as second in command of the contracts administration department that tripled in size during his tenure. = Assistant Attorney General = After a brief stint working with his father in the oil and gas business, LaFortune was appointed as an Assistant Attorney General for the State of Oklahoma by newly elected Attorney General Robert H. Henry in 1987. Initially assigned to the office's civil division, he represented various state agencies, including the State Auditor and Inspector's office, the Department of Transportation, the Oklahoma Police Pension and Retirement Board, the Oklahoma Military Department, and the Merit Protection Commission. He also represented the State Board of Osteopathic Examiners and the State Board of Chiropractic Examiners, prosecuting licensees of these Boards against whom formal complaints had been filed. LaFortune also handled all civil litigation and appellate work for these state agencies before the Oklahoma Supreme Court. As an Assistant Attorney General, LaFortune also authored numerous, formal Attorney General Opinions, was the chief in- house consultant on all county and municipal matters, represented the Attorney General as legal advisor to numerous state grand juries and was the in-house ‚Äúexpert‚Äù on the Administrative Procedures Act, while also serving as a member of the Oklahoma Legislature's ‚ÄúTask Force on Administrative Rules‚Äù, charged with the compilation and codification of all state agency rules and regulations. During this time LaFortune was honored for his service by the Association of County Commissioners of Oklahoma for ‚ÄúService to County Government‚Äù. The Oklahoma Attorney General later tapped LaFortune to organize and impanel Oklahoma's first multi-county grand jury. After receiving the necessary approval from the Oklahoma Supreme Court, LaFortune was assigned to the newly created Multi-County Grand Jury Division, where he worked until being appointed as an Assistant District Attorney in late 1988. To this day, the multi-county grand jury remains a powerful weapon in Oklahoma's fight against crime. = Assistant District Attorney = In November 1988, LaFortune was appointed as an Assistant District Attorney for Tulsa County by then District Attorney David Moss. He was initially assigned to the Juvenile Division of Tulsa County District Court, prosecuting only child abuse and neglect cases in juvenile court, rising to Chief of the District Attorney's Juvenile Division, supervising assistant district attorneys and support staff in that division. The District Attorney later promoted LaFortune to a felony team prosecutor in the office's Criminal Division. He acted in that capacity as one of two lead prosecutors on a felony trial team, responsible for representation of the State of Oklahoma at jury trial, non-jury trial, motion and sentencing criminal dockets. = Administrative Chief, Tulsa Bureau of the Office of Oklahoma Attorney General = In July 1990, then Oklahoma Attorney General Robert H. Henry opened a Tulsa branch of the Attorney General's Office. LaFortune was chosen by the Attorney General to accomplish this task. Starting with just himself and one support person, the Tulsa branch rapidly expanded under his leadership and today, houses several assistant attorneys general, investigators and support staff. = Special Judge ‚Äì 14th Judicial District for State of Oklahoma = In June 1993, LaFortune sought appointment by then elected Tulsa County district judges as a special judge. He was unanimously elected to this position by the district judges and immediately assumed his duties as a special judge. His first dockets were handling felony preliminary hearing and arraignment dockets. He later was assigned to domestic order, mental health and juvenile dockets. His decisions included upholding the constitutionality of Oklahoma's new ‚Äústalking‚Äù laws. = Tulsa County District Attorney 1995 - 1998 = While serving as a Special Judge, the untimely death of then District Attorney David Moss created a vacancy in that office. LaFortune applied for the position and in December 1995, he was appointed by then Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating as the Tulsa County District Attorney.\\"Governor Selects LaFortune as District Attorney.\\" Tulsa World. 8 December 1995. As Tulsa County's chief law enforcement officer, LaFortune managed the largest ‚Äúlaw firm‚Äù in Tulsa County, composed of over 80 persons. This included overseeing thousands of felony cases, as well as all civil litigation for county government. LaFortune personally prosecuted violent crimes, including record-setting verdicts in sex crime and first-degree murder cases. Also, during his tenure as Tulsa County District Attorney, LaFortune created the first ‚ÄúCrimes Against Children‚Äù Division in office to focus the fight against child abuse in all forms. He also created an ‚ÄúElder Abuse Task Force‚Äù to consolidate and coordinate agencies and resources to better focus, prevent and prosecute crimes against our senior citizens. = Partner, Norman Wohlgemuth Chandler and Dowdell = In June 1988, LaFortune was offered, and accepted, a partnership at the prestigious Tulsa law firm of Norman Wohlgemuth Chandler and Dowdell. His practice focused on land use planning and zoning matters before the City of Tulsa Board of Adjustment and the Tulsa Metropolitan Area Planning Commission. He also represented numerous clients in every type of civil litigation. = Of Counsel, Moyers, Martin, Santee & Imel, LLP = After leaving the Mayor's Office in 2006, LaFortune was asked to serve in an ‚ÄúOf Counsel‚Äù position with the prestigious Tulsa law firm of Moyers, Martin, Santee & Imel. His practice there focused on public and administrative law, civil litigation, land use planning and zoning and work for the University of Oklahoma and Waste Management Corporation of Oklahoma in a governmental affairs capacity. During this time, LaFortune also served as an Administrative Law Judge for the Oklahoma Department of Labor. He also served as General Counsel for the Tulsa Housing Authority and even represented the Philadelphia Housing Authority in a class action matter filed in Oklahoma. In 2010, LaFortune established a successful solo law practice, again specializing in land use planning and zoning as well as all varieties of civil litigation. His zoning clients included major advertising firms. His solo practice concluded with his successful bid in 2014 to be elected as District Judge for the 14th Judicial District, State of Oklahoma.  Notable Cases  = Notable child abuse, child pornography and child neglect cases = Judge LaFortune has presided over numerous jury trials and cases involving child abuse and neglect.Oklahoma Supreme Court Network (OSCN), CF-B Docket, Tulsa County District Court, 2015-2017. Scott Allen Bolden trial Scott Allen Bolden was convicted of first-degree murder and child abuse by injury in the death of a 19-month-old toddler, the little daughter of his girlfriend at the time. The prosecution maintained that Bolden used unreasonable force upon the child, causing fatal subdural hemorrhaging, extensive retinal hemorrhaging and bruises all over her body. LaFortune sentenced Bolden to back-to-back life sentences. Bolden maintained throughout the proceedings, including at sentencing, that the child's injuries were caused accidentally, and LaFortune noted at sentencing that he found it ‚Äúincredible‚Äù that Bolden continued to claim the child's death was caused by accident. LaFortune was affirmed on appeal by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals.Bolden v. State, Case No. F-2015-1112 (Okl. Cr. March 24, 2017). Yvon Demesmin trial LaFortune's child abuse jury trials also include the trial of Yvon Demesmin, a former school security guard, convicted of several counts of child sexual abuse. Demesmin had maintained at trial that the various sex acts he had engaged in with a young girl were acceptable in his native country of Haiti, although a prosecution witness, that was also a native Haitian, testified that the country does not condone sex with children. LaFortune sentenced Demesmin to 2 consecutive life terms and 3 concurrent 25-year prison sentences. At sentencing, LaFortune said, ‚ÄúThat should protect the public‚Äù. Jeffery Arch Jones trial Another child abuse injury trial presided over by Judge LaFortune involved Jeffery Arch Jones, convicted of 5 counts of child sexual abuse. LaFortune sentenced Jones to 175 years in prison, to be served consecutively. John Mark Jennings trial Judge LaFortune also presided over the jury trial of John Mark Jennings, convicted of 4 counts of sexual abuse of a child family member over the course of 3 years. Judge LaFortune sentenced Jennings to 115 consecutive years in prison. Timothy Shawn Cato trial Judge LaFortune presided over the jury trial of Timothy Shawn Cato, convicted of 11 counts of child sexual abuse committed against 5 boys he met through church and while doing volunteer work for a local Department of Human Services Shelter. In sentencing Cato to more than 200 consecutive years in prison, LaFortune noted that Cato had consistently tried to minimize, justify or otherwise rationalize his actions against the boys, who were ages 7 to 17. Judge LaFortune further stated at sentencing that ‚ÄúThere appears to be a pattern of behavior‚Äù that ‚Äúwas very telling to the court‚Äù that Cato repeatedly put himself in a position to work in areas ‚Äúwhere the most vulnerable young boys were found‚Äù. Paul Owen Hamilton trial Judge LaFortune presided over the jury trial of Paul Owen Hamilton, who was convicted of distribution of child pornography and aggravated possession of more than 100 images of child pornography. Detectives had found 241 images containing child pornography on Hamilton's computer, including images of a girl who appeared to be 12 or younger wearing only high heel shoes and lying on a white rug. LaFortune sentenced Hamilton to 30 years in prison. LaFortune was affirmed on appeal by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals in a published decision.Hamilton v. State, 2016 OK CR 13. ‚ÄúAlien Baby‚Äù case Judge LaFortune accepted the plea of Candace Marie Stanley, who pleaded guilty to a child-neglect charge alleging she had exposed her newborn to Xanax, marijuana, methamphetamine, and or heroin. Stanley was arrested after emergency responders found the newborn on a pile of trash in her apartment. Responders found Stanley ‚Äúswinging her placenta around‚Äù and she told the EMTs that the baby was an ‚Äúalien‚Äù and she refused to hold him to keep him warm. The baby had to have multiple life-saving medical treatments, including heart-lung bypass surgery. LaFortune sentenced Stanley to a 20-year term, 15 years after that on probation. The ‚ÄúShed‚Äù case Judge LaFortune presided over the case of a 5-month baby boy that was living in what was initially termed as a ‚Äúdirty shed‚Äù. Anna Marie Hyden and Kevin Lee Crawford were charged with child neglect and both entered guilty pleas. Prosecutors claimed that Hyden and Crawford had exposed the baby to methamphetamine, which along with their failure to seek medical care contributed to the baby dying January 16, 2016. Police described the shed as ‚Äúdeplorable‚Äù with no running water, no heat, no insulation and the only power coming from an extension cord running from a nearby home. Debris in the shed included hypodermic needles, trash, chemicals and drug paraphernalia. Authorities said the couple had used or manufactured methamphetamine in the presence of the baby who slept in the shed's attic. Judge LaFortune sentenced Hyden to 20 years in prison and Crawford to life in prison. At sentencing, LaFortune rejected Hyden's request for drug treatment in lieu of prison, noting that what she did to the baby ‚Äútranscends mere addiction‚Äù and that she had ‚Äúcompletely failed‚Äù to comply with her rules and conditions of probation in a previous felony case and an array of treatment options that had been made available to her. Judge LaFortune, in sentencing Crawford, who had a criminal record dating to 1983, stated that he had brought Hyden into his life as his ‚Äúpuppet‚Äù in a ‚Äúhorrendous ride‚Äù of drug abuse. Starvation of special needs child Judge LaFortune presided over the child neglect case of Victor Castro-Huerta and Christina Calhoun. Castro-Huerta and Calhoun were charged with nearly starving to death a 5-year-old special needs child. The child had presented at Saint Francis Hospital weighing only 19 pounds and ‚Äúseverely dehydrated‚Äù and ‚Äúextremely malnourished‚Äù. A jury convicted Castro-Huerta and LaFortune sentenced him to 35 years in prison as recommended by the jury. At Calhoun's sentencing, her attorney argued that a life sentence for her would be cruel, but LaFortune, in sentencing her to a life prison term, stated, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe a life sentence is cruel. The starvation of special needs child is cruel‚Äù. He also noted that the 5-year-old, who has cerebral palsy, was ‚Äúsingled out due to her special needs‚Äù based in part on evidence that all the other children in the home were healthy and happy. The child has multiple medical issues caused by extended starvation. = Notable crimes against women cases = Judge LaFortune has presided over many jury trials involving charges of sex crimes against women. Admiral Street Rapist case Judge LaFortune presided over the jury trial of the so-called ‚ÄúAdmiral Street Rapist‚Äù, Shawn Conrad Freeman. Police conducted an 18-month investigation into reports of rapes in the Admiral Place area which resulted in Freeman's arrest and subsequent charges: 4 counts each of first-degree rape and kidnapping, 5 counts of sodomy, and 1 count of robbery. LaFortune followed the jury's recommendation and sentenced the convicted serial rapist to 365 consecutive years in prison. Ex-Tulsa County deputy convicted of sex crimes Judge LaFortune presided over the jury trial of former Tulsa County deputy Gerald Nuckolls, who was charged with sex crimes allegedly committed while on duty. Nuckolls was convicted of Indecent Exposure and Sexual Battery and LaFortune sentenced him to 8 consecutive years in prison as recommended by the jury. LaFortune was affirmed on appeal.Nuckolls v. State, Case No. F-2015-1064 (Okl.Cr.June 29, 2017). Rape of elderly woman in nursing home by nurse Judge LaFortune presided over a case involving the rape of an 84-year-old woman with dementia at a Tulsa assisted living center. Stephen Craig Reed, who was a nurse at the center, plead guilty to the rape and LaFortune sentenced him to 20 years in prison. At sentencing, the prosecutor called Reed a ‚Äúsexual predator‚Äù for ‚Äútaking advantage‚Äù of a woman in a ‚Äúmost vulnerable‚Äù state. In delivering his sentence, LaFortune noted that Reed had shown a ‚Äúpattern of minimalizing‚Äù his actions and placing blame on the victim. A year later, LaFortune refused to modify Reed's 20-year sentence at a judicial review. = Notable DUI manslaughter cases = Judge LaFortune has presided over numerous DUI fatality cases. Christina Cantrell case Judge LaFortune presided over the case involving Defendant Christina Cantrell. She entered a blind guilty plea to 2 counts of first degree manslaughter, driving under the influence, causing great bodily harm and other related charges. Cantrell had run a red light while driving under the influence and crashed into a vehicle, killing two of its occupants and injuring 3 others. A 12-year-old and her 16-year-old sister were thrown from the car on impact. The 12-year-old and 16-year-old later died at Saint Francis Hospital. LaFortune sentenced Cantrell to life in prison. Whitney Tatum Wheeler case Judge LaFortune presided over the case of Defendant Whitney Tatum Wheeler. She was charged with 1 count of first-degree manslaughter and 1 count of driving under the influence and causing great bodily injury. The investigation revealed that Wheeler rear- ended a 1920 Ford Model T while she was driving 65 mph and was still accelerating at impact. The impact caused the car to roll and its driver was killed, and a passenger suffered several injuries. LaFortune sentenced Wheeler to 25 years in prison. Christopher David Mitchell case Judge LaFortune presided over Defendant Christopher David Mitchell's second-degree felony murder case. Mitchell was charged with first hitting a motorcycle with 2 occupants, injuring both, fleeing that scene at 75 mph and then crashing into the vehicle of a 22-year-old woman, killing her. Her husband termed her death as ‚Äúa murder, not an accident‚Äù. LaFortune sentenced Mitchell to life in prison after he entered a blind guilty plea. = Notable first-degree murder cases = Judge LaFortune has presided over many jury trials in first-degree murder cases. Isaac Luna Ashton murder case Defendant Isaac Luna Ashton was convicted by a jury of shooting and killing 3 unarmed individuals at close range. LaFortune sentenced Ashton to 2 consecutive life without parole terms for the murders. He had earlier denied Ashton's request for immunity under Oklahoma's ‚ÄúStand Your Ground‚Äù law. LaFortune was affirmed on appeal by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals in a published decision.88 OBJ 1255 (June 24, 2017) Gilcrease Expressway murder Judge LaFortune presided over the jury trials of David Ruble and Travis Lozada, who were convicted of felony murder first-degree in the random slaying of a 14-year-old girl who was innocently traveling home with her family along the Gilcrease Expressway after a day of recreation at Keystone Lake. He sentenced Ruble to a life term plus 10 years and Lozada to life in prison without parole plus 10 years. At the sentencing of Lozada, LaFortune noted, ‚ÄúThis concludes one of the most tragic stories of Tulsa County criminal justice history. A young girl was shot basically at random in a botched, poorly planned robbery.‚Äù LaFortune was affirmed on appeal in Ruble's case.Ruble v. State, Case No. F-2016-843 (Okl.Cr. December 14, 2017). Papa John‚Äôs Pizza murder Judge LaFortune presided over the trial of Frankie Jackson Jr. and the sentencing of his 2 co- defendants, Jermaine Savory and Damian Anderson. They were charged with murder in the fatal shooting of a Papa John's truck driver while he was making a delivery and unloading his truck behind a Papa John's pizza restaurant in the early morning hours. He sentenced Jackson, who was convicted of felony murder by a jury, to life in prison and Savory, who plead guilty to first-degree murder, to life in prison. Anderson was sentenced to 20 years in prison after pleading to a charge of accessory to first-degree felony murder. LaFortune was affirmed on appeal in Jackson's case.Jackson v. State, Case No. F-2015-587 (Okl.Cr.March 15, 2017). North Tulsa barber shop murder Judge LaFortune presided over the trial of Dezmen ‚ÄúDash‚Äù Smith, who was charged along with Chadrick Lamont ‚ÄúFat Cat‚Äù Colbert in a gang-related shooting that killed an innocent barber while he was cutting hair and injured 3 customers, including a child. LaFortune sentenced Smith to life in prison for first- degree murder and Colbert, who testified at Smith's trial on behalf of the prosecution, to 15 years for accessory after the fact to murder and 3 counts of assault and battery with a deadly weapon, pursuant to a plea agreement with the state. LaFortune was affirmed on appeal in Smith's case.Jackson v. State, Case No. F-2015-587 (Okl.Cr. March 15, 2017). James Edward ‚ÄúG-Baby‚Äù Knapper murder case Judge LaFortune presided over the first-degree murder trial of James Edward ‚ÄúG-Baby‚Äù Knapper. A jury convicted Knapper of a gang- related daytime shooting and killing of a 16-year-old girl, who was an innocent bystander and the unintended target in what a prosecutor called a ‚Äúgangland assassination‚Äù. The prosecutor argued that Knapper's intent was to kill a different person because of that person's membership in a rival gang. Knapper, who was 14 at the time of the crime, was sentenced by Judge LaFortune to life in prison for first-degree murder and 55 years for assault and battery with a deadly weapon related to the intended victim and 5 years for a gang- related offense. Knapper was 16 at the time LaFortune imposed the sentence. At sentencing, LaFortune stated that the shooting death of the 16-year-old girl was ‚Äúespecially tragic and senseless‚Äù. He further noted that Knapper's behavior during his trial showed ‚Äúa complete lack of accountability and a lack of any semblance of remorse‚Äù and his belief that he would have continued to commit violent crimes had he not been charged and arrested in the incident. After sentencing, the prosecutor noted that Knapper's behavior at the trial was ‚Äúnot juvenile behavior. It‚Äôs (the) behavior of someone who truly enjoys the fact that they‚Äôre getting credit for killing someone‚Äù. Murder of mother and unborn child Judge LaFortune presided over the jury trial of Kenneth Hopkins who was convicted of first-degree murder in the shooting death of a woman who was about 8 months pregnant with a boy who would have been her second child with Hopkins. Prior to trial, LaFortune had denied Hopkin's request to dismiss the case for a violation of the Uniform, and that ruling was affirmed by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals in a published decision that made new Oklahoma law on the issue.88 OBJ9 (January 14, 2017). Pursuant to the jury's sentencing recommendations, LaFortune sentenced Hopkins to 2 consecutive life-without-parole terms for the killing of the 19-year-old woman and their unborn child. Jabara case Vernon Majors first appeared before Judge LaFortune on a pending charge of Assault and Battery with a Deadly Weapon.Oklahoma Supreme Court Network (OSCN), Tulsa County District Court, Case No. CF-2015-5006 Afterwards, his defense attorney filed a motion to quash and dismiss Major's case on April 12, 2016. LaFortune after a full hearing, denied the Motion to Dismiss. A new defense attorney subsequently entered the case and requested a bond be set. In May 2016, the district attorney's office asked Judge LaFortune to hold Vernon Majors without bond or set bond to $300,000 for charges of assault and battery with a deadly weapon case in which Majors is accused of running over Haifa Jabara, an Arab-American Christian, with a car in September 2015. Relying on the pre-set Tulsa County Bond Schedule, Judge LaFortune initially set the bond at $30,000 per the Bond Schedule. Then upon the State's request, and over the Defendant's objection, he doubled the bond to $60,000, which is also the amount pre-set by the Tulsa County Bond Schedule for the charge of Assault and Battery with a Deadly Weapon, after a former felony conviction. When the bond was set at $60,000 by Judge LaFortune, Majors had a protective order in place against Khalid Jabara and Mr. Jabara had a protective order in place against Majors. Majors was released on May 25, 2016. Almost three months after Majors made the $60,000 bond, the State filed first degree murder charges against Majors for the death of Khalid Jabara. Vernon Majors was arrested on Friday August 12, 2016, accused of shooting and killing Haifa Jabara's son, Khalid Jabara. LaFortune was the judge for the trial of Stanley Vernon Majors, accused of killing his neighbor, Khalid Jabara, on August 12, 2016.Pickard, Arianna. Victim's family says Tulsa murder suspect had history of ethnic harassment. Tulsa World. August 27, 2016. Accessed December 5, 2016. A trial is still pending as to this charge as well as the previous charge. Universal Aryan Brotherhood murder and assault case Judge LaFortune presided over the jury trial of Ronnie Dean Haskins, who was convicted of fatally stabbing a man in his home in 2013. Haskins was accused of involvement in the Universal Aryan Brotherhood, a ‚Äúwhite only‚Äù prison-based criminal organization whose members engage in drug distribution, money laundering and acts of violence involving kidnapping, assault and arson throughout Oklahoma. LaFortune sentenced Haskins to 2 consecutive life sentences, one of which was without parole, upholding the jury's recommendation. LaFortune was affirmed on appeal.Haskins v. State, Case No. F-2015-590 (Okl.Cr. September 2, 2016). In another case with allegations relating to the Universal Aryan Brotherhood, Judge LaFortune presided over the jury trial of Jestin Tafolla, who was found guilty of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, brass knuckles, of a black man during a road rage incident in East Tulsa in 2016. LaFortune followed the jury's recommendation in imposing a life sentence. Irish Mob Gang murder case Judge LaFortune presided over the jury trial of John Kyle Crandall, who was convicted of first-degree murder in a fatal Irish Mob gang-related shooting and he also plead guilty and was convicted of intimidating a prosecution witness and having contraband in his jail cell. During the trial, prosecutors read jailhouse correspondence from Crandall that detailed his membership in the Irish Mob Gang, its importance to him and the Irish Mob Gang's rivalry with members of the Universal Aryan Brotherhood. Crandall wrote in that correspondence that he would ‚Äúput the Mob first, even above my family‚Ä¶.I do what needs to be done, and I do what I‚Äôm told even if it means losing my own life‚Äù. LaFortune upheld the jury's sentencing recommendation of life in prison without the possibility of parole and, at sentencing, told Crandall that he believed the jury, ‚Äúthrough their verdicts, told you cold- blooded murder on our streets will not be tolerated‚Äù.  Community service  = Volunteer board member = Over the course of his professional life, LaFortune has volunteered his time and talents to many nonprofit boards and causes. This includes prior service as a board member for the Tulsa Psychiatric Center, Operation Aware, Inc., Child Abuse Network (CAN), Inc., the Arthritis Foundation for Eastern Oklahoma, the Children's Services Advisory Board of Tulsa County, St. John Health System's Community Liaison Board and the Tulsa Boys‚Äô Home. = Fundraising event chair = He and his wife of 35 years, forensic psychologist Dr. Kathy LaFortune, have also chaired major fundraising events for Big Brothers and Sisters of Green Country, the then existing Tulsa Philharmonic and Junior Philharmonic. = Awards = More recently, LaFortune has served on the Tulsa World Community Advisory Board.

The Tulsa Press Club also honored he and his wife as their ‚ÄúHeadliners‚Äù for 2017, the first time that honor has been bestowed upon a married couple. = Tulsa County Bar Association Professionalism Committee and Board of Directors = LaFortune has also been active in local bar association activities, having served on the Tulsa County Bar Association Professionalism Committee and Board of Directors (elected by his peers). = Addressing concerns about impacts of juror stress = In 2016, Judge LaFortune wrote a column in which he described reports of traumatic stress experienced by many jurors from having to hear and/or view disturbing evidence in certain types of cases, especially capital murder and child abuse cases. Using his own observations and reports from other professionals in the field, he emphasized that such traumas often do not just go away on their own with the passage of time, but constitute a real problem, just like many other traumatic experiences. The judge expressed his opinion that trial courts need to play a bigger role in helping jurors obtain professional help when needed to recover from such events. He noted that, at his instigation, the University of Tulsa Psychology Department had begun a pilot program to address the issue.LaFortune, Bill. \\"Alleviating juror stress is a real community issue.\\" Tulsa World.

The \\"twist\\" (innovation) was the use of a super-spinning, high-tech bearing, that allowed the top to spin at very high speed and remain standing for a long period of time. This top did not rely on a string to attain high speed so it was easier to master than tops of old. Wizzers are not sold as scientific instruments, but may be used to demonstrate the conservation of angular momentum and gyroscope stability. History Wizzzer stationary (left) and spinning (right). The Wizzzer first appeared in the Mattel Catalog in 1969, with various iterations offered through the early 70's. Mattel used innovative wedge-shaped packaging and gave the tops interesting personas through the use of color combinations and stickers. The most memorable are those named: Spin- Fire, Mach-1, Prowler, Night Winder, Bonehead, Sparkshooter and \\"The Color Changer\\" (the last described the Wizzzer's actions rather than having a trademarked name). To expand the line, Mattel added a Wizzzer Hockey Game, the Trick Tray and the Super Competition Set. Several automobile toys were included that were Wizzzer-driven as \\"Spin-Buggies.\\" The technology was reused by Mattel as part of their Upsy Downsy series of toys as vehicles that figures would ride (\\"Furry Hurry\\" and \\"Hairy Hurry\\"). Two He-Man action figures from the late 80's also reused this technology: Rotar and Twistoid (as a side note, there were plans for a vehicle called \\"Gyrattacker\\" that did not make it into production that would power up and launch them). Wizzzers were marketed by all the major toy stores and also in department store catalogs like Sears, J.C. Penney, Wards and Spiegel in their Christmas Catalogs. Mattel worked with several companies to produce \\"Canned Wizzzers\\" - changing the body shape to a can/cylinder. Canned Wizzzers include: Coca-Cola, 7-Up, Pepsi, Hi-C, Hawaiian Punch, Minute Maid, Campbell's Tomato Soup and Bardahl Motor Oil. For the Mattel Anniversary, a special clear \\"Mattel Logo\\" Wizzzer was made available to Mattel employees. Special \\"Mini-Wizzzers\\" were made available as cereal premiums. Wizzzers were unavailable for many years then revived first by Mattel then later by Matchbox and Duncan (the Yo-yo company). A more recent appearance was in the McDonald's Happy Meal Chicken Little toy, available October 28 - November 22, 2005. Two vehicles are driven by wizzzer figures, with each figure built on a wizzzer. The bearing is struck and then the figure is placed into his vehicle, which drives the vehicle forward. The most recent incarnation of the toy is the 2016-17 remake from the vintage toy company called \\"Super Impulse\\". 8 styles are offered, 4 being the familiar spherical shape, and 4 of the 1960s \\"hot air balloon\\" shape.

The series has also been broadcast in France, New Zealand, Croatia, Italy, Netherlands, Australia, Japan, and Poland. Premise Johnny Messner plays Detective Jack Hale of the San Francisco Police Department. Hale has a history of causing tension in whatever department to which he is assigned, as much for his abrasive nature towards co-workers as the direct and sometimes unsettling manner in which he conducts investigations. Hale's reputation is also worsened by the infamy of his father, a self-confessed serial killer currently serving life in prison. The gruesome nature of his father's crimes combined with Hale's attitude has led many of his co-workers to wonder if he will one day become a serial killer himself, a fear which Hale secretly shares. Nonetheless, this strong familiarity with serial killers leads to Hale being recruited by the Deviant Crimes Unit. The Deviant Crimes Unit's mission is to track down the perpetrators of unusual crimes within the city. Each new crime spree is investigated by the head of the unit, Lieutenant Matt Cavanaugh (Chi McBride), who judges whether the crime is \\"deviant\\" enough to be investigated by the DCU. In addition to Hale and Cavanaugh, the DCU employs Detective Danielle Carter (Kristin Lehman), whose analytical nature clashes both with the impulsive Hale and the subjective nature of their shared mission.

Garage doors are frequently large enough to accommodate automobiles and other vehicles. Small garage doors may be made in a single panel that tilts up and back across the garage ceiling. Larger doors are usually made in several jointed panels that roll up on tracks across the garage ceiling, or into a roll above the doorway. The operating mechanism is spring-loaded or counterbalanced to offset the weight of the door and reduce human or motor effort required to operate the door. Less commonly, some garage doors slide or swing horizontally. Doors are made of wood, metal, or fiberglass, and may be insulated to prevent heat loss. Warehouses, bus garages and locomotive sheds have larger versions. Description An electric garage-door opener operates on the center track A typical version of an overhead garage door used in the past would have been built as a one-piece panel. The panel was mounted on each side with unequal parallelogram style hinge lifting mechanism. Newer versions of overhead garage doors are now generally built from several panels hinged together that roll along a system of tracks guided by rollers. The weight of the door may be or more, but is balanced by either a torsion spring system or a pair of extension springs. A remote controlled motorized mechanism for opening garage doors adds convenience, safety, and security. History The history of the garage door could date back to 450 BC when chariots were stored in gatehouses, but in the United States they arose around the start of the 20th century. As early as 1902, American manufacturers‚Äîincluding Cornell Iron Works‚Äîpublished catalogs featuring a \\"float over door.\\" Evidence of an upward- lifting garage door can be found in a catalog in 1906. Single panel garage doors jamb type hardware Single panel doors are constructed from one monolithic panel. From the closed position a single panel door swings up and overhead with a hinge on each side (known as jamb type hardware) to the fully open position. A disadvantage of monolithic panel doors is that the swing up arc of the door occurs partially outside the garage. This means a vehicle must stop and park several feet in front of the door to avoid being hit by the garage door when it is opened. one piece track type hardware Single panel doors can also be installed with (one piece track type hardware) that folds the door back with a single horizontal track on each side (which is mounted at the top of the wood frame) and a roller, (mounted to the top of the door on each side. A hinge on each side that attaches to the bottom of each side of garage door. Using track hardware, a car can be parked much closer to the door, as the whole door, when in the open position, rests completely inside of the garage door header. Track type hardware has much less arc when raising and lowering the garage door as opposed jamb type hardware. Sectional garage doors Sectional garage door panel being installed Sectional doors are usually constructed of three to eight panels and slide up and overhead. Sectional doors occupy exactly the same amount of internal garage space as a monolithic door. Sectional doors have two advantages over single panel monolithic doors: * Sectional doors do not require any space outside the garage to open. A vehicle may park very close to the garage before opening the door. * Each panel of a sectional door has its own connection to the door track. This increases reliability and robustness compared to monolithic doors, which have only a few track connections for the whole panel. Garage doors can be made out of many materials, but steel, aluminum, wood, copper, glass, and vinyl (polyethylene) are the most popular materials. Some manufacturers incorporate foamed-in-place polyurethane insulation within the monolithic panel and sectional garage doors. The side sliding sectional door\\"Side Sliding garage Door\\" PRIMO TIM 2014 * A lot of space under the garage ceiling. * Can use the entire ceiling of the garage. * Fast access to the garage Roller doors Detail of roller door mechanism Roller doors (sometimes called \\"sheet doors\\") are usually constructed of corrugated steel. They evolved from cover window and door coverings. Other materials can be used (e.g.; transparent corrugated fibreglass) where strong impact resistance is not required. Corrugations give the door strength against impacts. A typical single car garage roller door has a preloaded spring inside the rolling mechanism. The spring reduces the effort required to open the door. Larger roller doors in commercial premises are not sprung (except USA) and use a manual pulley and chain system or a geared motor to raise and lower (roll up and roll down) the door. Roller doors cannot be effectively insulated. In the UK (and other parts of the EU), 'insulated' roller garage doors are available, using an aluminium lathe filled with polyurethane foam for thermal and acoustic insulation. The common use of roller doors in Australian garages is discussed at Garage (residential) ¬ß In Australia. In terms of thermal insulation, the roller door has a typical insulation R-value of 4.9 to 5.2. A sheet steel garage door has a typical insulation R-value of 0.5 to 2.7. Application that need more thermal insulation typically use foam filled sectional garage door, which provide typical insulation R-values of 6.1 to 6.4. Although roller doors are very reliable, the rollers themselves tend to require some maintenance or replacement from time to time. Steel rollers require frequent lubricant and plastic ones tend to get replaced more often than others. Luckily, lubricating or replacing garage door rollers is a job which is quite simple and there are many guides online on how to do yourself. Garage door materials * Aluminum garage doors are low-cost, light, rust-proof, and feature low- maintenance. They are prone to denting because aluminum is not strong and they are energy-inefficient since aluminum is a highly conductive material. * Fiberglass and vinyl garage doors are composite units, combining a steel core behind a fiberglass or vinyl skin. They have also polyurethane insulated base sections, or other type of foam insulation. These premium doors can match steel garage doors, and be a realistic imitation of wood (namely fiberglass units), but they may be more expensive than steel units. * Steel doors have become common and are available in a variety of sizes and styles, provide strength and security, are cost-competitive, and may have optional insulating value. Extra strength is available with two or three layers of galvanized steel with a low gauge number (0.6 - 0.7 mm steel panels). * Wood garage doors offer aesthetic appeal, but they are high-maintenance and may be expensive. Low-priced wood garage doors may warp and break easily. Steel stamped construction Sectional-type steel with exterior cladding overhead garage doors in the style of old carriage house doors A common material for a new garage door is steel sheet formed or stamped to look like a raised panel wooden door. Steel doors are available in uninsulated, insulated, and double skin steel. A design mimicking carriage house doors has become popular since early 2000s, and many manufacturers clad the exterior of a steel door with composite, vinyl boards, or other trim to give it the appearance of wood. Insulation In situations involving residential attached garages where the insulating value and the energy efficiency of a garage door is important to prevent overheating and freezing problems, as well as for comfort and energy savings. Some manufacturers advertise very high insulating values for some of their garage doors (R-15 to R-17), but it may be true for only for some central sections. The actual R-values ‚Äì for the entire door ‚Äì are often 1/2 or 1/3 of the advertised value. Torsion spring lift mechanism A torsion spring counterbalance system consists of one or two tightly wound up springs on a steel shaft with cable drums at both ends. The entire apparatus mounts on the header wall above the garage door and has three supports: a center bearing plate with a steel or nylon bearing and two end bearing plates at both ends. The springs themselves consist of the steel wire with a stationary cone at one end and a winding cone at the other end. The stationary cone is attached to the center bearing plate. The winding cone consists of holes every 90 degrees for winding the springs and two set screws to secure the springs to the shaft. Steel counterbalance cables run from the roller brackets at the bottom corners of the door to a notch in the cable drums. When the door is raised, the springs unwind and the stored tension lifts the door by turning the shaft, thus turning the cable drums, wrapping the cables around the grooves on the cable drums. When the door is lowered, the cables unwrap from the drums and the springs are rewound to full tension. =Life of torsion spring= Garage door manufacturers typically produce garage doors fitted with torsion springs that provide a minimum of 10,000 to 15,000 cycles and are guaranteed for three to seven years. One cycle is a single opening and closing sequence. Most manufacturers offer a 30,000 cycle spring. However, it is important to remember that if the weight of the garage door is increased by adding glass, additional insulation, or even several coats of paint, the life of the torsion spring may be greatly reduced. Additionally, springs at highly humid environments, such as coastal regions tend to have a significantly shorter cycle life, due to the corrosive cracking. Other factors like poor garage door maintenance, loose tracks, or components shorten torsion spring life. Owners are advised to avoid applying grease to garage door tracks because that makes the wheels \\"skate\\" in the track instead of turning on their bearings. Only bearings, hinges, and spring wire require lubricant. Extension spring lift mechanism An extension spring counterbalance system consists of a pair of stretched springs running parallel to the horizontal tracks. The springs lift the door through a system of pulleys and counterbalance cables running from the bottom corner brackets through the pulleys. When the door is raised, the springs contract, thus lifting the door as the tension is released. Typically these springs are made of 11 gauge (3 mm) galvanized steel, and the lengths of these springs are based on the height of the garage door in question. Their lifting weight capacity can best be identified by the color that is painted on the ends of the springs. Maintenance Maintenance of garage door is described in the manufacturer's instructions and consists of periodic checks for correct operation, visual inspection of parts, and lubrication. Safety Garage doors cause injury and property damage (including expensive damage to the door itself) in several different ways. The most common causes of injury from garage door systems include falling doors, pinch points, improperly adjusted opener force settings and safety eyes, attempts at do-it- yourself repair without the proper knowledge or tools, and uncontrolled release of spring tension (on torsion spring systems). A garage door with a broken spring, or the wrong strength spring, can fall. Because the effective mass of the door increases as the garage door sections transfer from the horizontal to vertical door tracks, a falling garage door accelerates rapidly. A free falling garage door can cause serious injury or death. The sections and rollers on garage doors represent a major pinch hazard. Children should never be allowed near a moving garage door for this reason. On manually operated garage doors, handles should be installed vertically, to promote \\"vertical orientation of the hand\\". Mechanical garage door openers can pull or push a garage door with enough force to injure or kill people and pets if they become trapped. All modern openers are equipped with ‚Äúforce settings‚Äù that make the door reverse if it encounters too much resistance while closing or opening. Any garage door opener sold in the United States after 1992 requires safety eyes‚Äîsensors that prevent the door from closing if obstructed. Force settings should cause a door to stop or reverse on encountering more than approximately 20 lbs (9.07 kg) of resistance. Safety eyes should be installed a maximum of six inches above the ground. Many garage door injuries, and nearly all garage door related property damage, can be avoided by following these precautions. Certain parts, especially springs, cables, bottom brackets, and spring anchor plates, are under extreme tension. Injuries can occur if parts under tension are removed. Extension spring systems should always be restrained by a safety cable that runs through the middle of the spring, tying off to a solid point at the rear and front of the horizontal door track. The safety cable prevents hazards to bystanders when a spring, pulley, or cable breaks under tension and makes the system quite safe. Torsion spring systems can be very dangerous as they are always under tension and release energy when the spring fails. Serious injury or death can be caused by the projectile pieces of a failed torsion spring. Many people have been injured or killed trying to adjust torsion springs, and special training and procedures are required to safely adjust a torsion spring, it is a job for a professional not a homeowner or DIYer.

He was particularly gifted at improvisation, and was regarded as the finest organist of his age by many writers, including Vadian and Paracelsus; in addition he was one of only two German-speaking composers of the time (Heinrich Isaac was the other) who had a reputation in Europe outside of German-speaking countries. He is grouped among the composers known as the Colorists. Life He was born in Radstadt, near Salzburg. Sources are somewhat contradictory on his early life, with Vadian asserting that he was self-taught, and the Nuremberg humanist Konrad Celtis saying that he acquired his technique at the court of Emperor Frederick III. Hofhaimer went to Innsbruck in 1478, and so impressed Archduke Sigismund of Tyrol that he was given a lifetime appointment as court organist in 1480. He almost certainly knew Heinrich Isaac well while he was in Innsbruck, since Isaac became court composer there later that decade. In 1489 he began serving Maximilian I as organist, but he did this in addition to his Innsbruck service. In 1498, after several years of travel, during which time he visited the Saxon court of Elector Frederick the Wise, he moved to Passau, and in 1507 he moved to Augsburg, where he could be closer to Maximilian. Maximilian and the king of Poland made him a knight and nobleman in 1515, conferring on him the title of \\"First Organist to the Emperor\\". Hofhaimer's last move was to Salzburg, where he remained as organist at Salzburg Cathedral until his death. Music and influence Hofhaimer was a spectacularly gifted improviser, and witnesses attested to his unequaled gift; he could play for hours, never repeating himself: \\"one would wonder not so much how the ocean gets all the water with which to feed the rivers, but how this man gets the ideas for all his melodies.\\" Not only was he a performing musician, though, he was the teacher of an entire generation of German organists: and the famous school of German organists of the Baroque era can trace much of its lineage to Hofhaimer. In addition, some of the organists he trained went on to Italy, for example Dionisio Memno, who became organist at St. Mark's in Venice, and there passed on technique learned from Hofhaimer to the organists who were part of the early Venetian school. While he was most prolific as a composer for organ, little of that music has survived in its original form. Most of the surviving works are either German songs in three or four voices, or arrangements (intabulations) of them for either keyboard or lute. The large quantity of surviving copies of his songs from different locations in Europe, usually in arrangements, attests to their popularity. The handful of pieces for organ which have survived show Hofhaimer's gift for composing polyphonic lines around a cantus firmus. His German lieder are typical of the time, and usually in bar form, with one section being polyphonic and the other being more chordal. He rarely used the smooth polyphonic texture then being cultivated by the Franco-Flemish composers such as Josquin or Gombert, a style he probably first encountered in Innsbruck with the music of Isaac. Hofhaimer was also well known as an organ consultant, and frequently advised on the building and maintenance of organs.

Declaration of war Prime Minister Mackenzie King's request to King George VI for approval that war be declared against Germany in His Majesty's name, 10 September 1939. When the United Kingdom declared war on Germany in August 1914, Canada was a Dominion of the British Empire with full control over only domestic affairs, thus automatically joining the First World War. After the war, the Canadian government wanted to avoid a repeat of the Conscription Crisis of 1917, which had divided the country and French and English Canadians. Stating that \\"Parliament will decide,\\" in 1922 Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King avoided participating in the Chanak Crisis as the Parliament of Canada was not in session. The 1931 Statute of Westminster gave Canada autonomy in foreign policy. When Britain entered World War II in September 1939, some experts suggested that Canada was still bound by Britain's declaration of war because it had been made in the name of their common monarch, but Prime Minister King again said that \\"Parliament will decide.\\" In 1936 King had told Parliament, \\"Our country is being drawn into international situations to a degree that I myself think is alarming.\\" Both the government and the public remained reluctant to participate in a European war, in part because of the Conscription Crisis of 1917. Both King and Opposition Leader Robert James Manion stated their opposition to conscripting troops for overseas service in March 1939. Nonetheless, King had not changed his view of 1923 that Canada would participate in a war by the Empire whether or not the United States did. By August 1939 his cabinet, including French Canadians, was united for war in a way that it probably would not have been during the Munich Crisis, although both cabinet members and the country based their support in part on expecting that Canada's participation would be \\"limited.\\" It had been clear that Canada would elect to participate in the war before the invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939. Four days after the United Kingdom declared war on 3 September 1939, Parliament was called in special session and both King and Manion stated their support for Canada following Britain, but did not declare war immediately, partly to show that Canada was joining out of her own initiative and was not obligated to go to war. Unlike 1914 when war came as a surprise, the government had prepared various measures for price controls, rationing, and censorship, and the War Measures Act of 1914 was re-invoked. After two days of debate, the House of Commons approved an Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne on 9 September 1939 giving authority to declare war to King's government. A small group of Quebec legislators attempted to amend the bill, and CCF party leader J. S. Woodsworth stated that some of his party opposed it. Woodsworth was the only Member of Parliament to vote against the bill and it thus passed by near-acclamation.James Shaver Woodsworth, Canadian Encyclopedia. Retrieved 2016-03-29Once Upon a Time, Canadians could be proud of Parliament, Globe and Mail, May 04, 2012. Retrieved 2016-03-29 The Senate also passed the bill that day. The Cabinet drafted a proclamation of war that night, which Governor-General Lord Tweedsmuir signed on 10 September. King George VI approved Canada's declaration of war with Germany on Sept. 10.Donald Creighton, The Forked Road: Canada 1939-1957, McClelland and Stewart, 1976, p.2. Canada later also declared war on Italy (11 June 1940), Japan (7 December 1941), and other Axis powers, enshrining the principle that the Statute of Westminster conferred these sovereign powers to Canada. Preparations Though Canada was the oldest Dominion in the British Commonwealth, it was, for the most part, reluctant to enter the war. Canada, with a population somewhere between 11 and 12 million, eventually raised very substantial armed forces. Around 10% of the entire population of Canada joined the army, with only a small portion conscripted. After the long struggle of the Great Depression of the 1930s, the challenges of the Second World War accelerated Canada's ongoing transformation into a modern urban and industrialized nation. Photograph before the signing of the Munich Agreement, 1938. The Sudeten crisis caused spending on defence to nearly double in Canada. Canada informally followed the British Ten Year Rule that reduced defence spending even after Britain abandoned it in 1932. Having suffered from nearly 20 years of neglect, Canada's armed forces were small, poorly equipped, and for the most part unprepared for war in 1939. King's government began increasing spending in 1936, but the increase was unpopular. The government had to describe it as primarily for defending Canada, with an overseas war \\"a secondary responsibility of this country, though possibly one requiring much greater ultimate effort.\\" The Sudeten crisis of 1938 caused annual spending to almost double. Nonetheless, in March 1939 the Permanent Active Militia (or Permanent Force (PF), Canada's full-time army) had only 4,169 officers and men while the Non-Permanent Active Militia (Canada's reserve force) numbered 51,418 at the end of 1938, mostly armed with weapons from 1918. In March 1939 the Royal Canadian Navy had 309 officers and 2967 naval ratings, and the Royal Canadian Air Force had 360 officers and 2797 airmen. Under Secretary of State for External Affairs Oscar D. Skelton stated the government's war policy. Among its highlights: * Consult with Britain and France, and \\"equally important, discreet consultation with Washington\\". * Prioritize Canadian defence, especially the Pacific coast. * Possibly aid Newfoundland and the West Indies. * The RCAF should be the first to serve overseas. * Canada can \\"most effective[ly]\\" serve its allies by providing munitions, raw materials, and food. King's cabinet approved this policy on 24 August 1939, and in September disapproved of the proposal by the Chiefs of Staff to create two army divisions for overseas service, in part due to cost. His \\"moderate\\" war strategy soon demonstrated its national and bilingual support in two elections. When Premier of Quebec Maurice Duplessis called an election on an anti-war platform, Ad√©lard Godbout's Liberals won a majority on 26 October 1939. When the Legislative Assembly of Ontario passed a resolution criticizing the government for not fighting the war \\"in the vigorous manner the people of Canada desire to see\\", King dissolved the federal parliament and, in the resulting election on 26 March 1940, his Liberals won the largest majority in history. =Mobilization and deployment= The Toronto Scottish Regiment on parade in Aldershot, UK, December 1939. Canada's initial commitment to the war was one division, with another in reserve for home defence. At the outbreak of war, Canada's commitment to the war in Europe was limited by the government to one division, and one division in reserve for home defence. Nevertheless, the eventual size of the Canadian armed forces greatly exceeded those envisioned in the pre-war period's so-called mobilization \\"schemes\\". Over the course of the war, the army enlisted 730,000; the air force 260,000; and the navy 115,000 personnel. In addition, thousands of Canadians served in the Royal Air Force. Approximately half of Canada's army and three-quarters of its air-force personnel never left the country, compared to the overseas deployment of approximately three-quarters of the forces of Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. By war's end, however, 1.1 million men and women had served in uniform for Canada. The navy grew from only a few ships in 1939 to over 400 ships, including three aircraft carriers and two cruisers. This maritime effort helped keep the shipping lanes open across the Atlantic throughout the war. In part, this reflected Mackenzie King's policy of \\"limited liability\\" and the labour requirements of Canada's industrial war effort. But it also reflected the objective circumstances of the war. With France defeated and occupied, there was no Second World War equivalent of the Great War's Western Front until the invasion of Normandy in June 1944. While Canada sent 348 troops, the manpower requirements of the North Africa and Mediterranean theatres were comparatively small and readily met by British and other British Empire/Commonwealth forces. departed with Convoy HX 1 just six days after the Canadian Declaration of War. While the response to war was initially intended to be limited, resources were mobilized quickly. Convoy HX 1 departed Halifax just six days after the nation declared war, escorted by and . The 1st Canadian Infantry Division arrived in Britain on 1 January 1940.Byers, p. 26 By 13 June 1940, the 1st Battalion of The Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment was deployed to France in an attempt to secure the southern flank of the British Expeditionary Force in Belgium. By the time the battalion arrived, the British and allies were cut off at Dunkirk, Paris had fallen, and after penetrating 200 km inland, the battalion returned to Brest and then to Britain. Apart from the Dieppe Raid in August 1942, the frustrated Canadian Army fought no significant engagement in the European theatre of operations until the invasion of Sicily in the summer of 1943. With the Sicily Campaign, the Canadians had the opportunity to enter combat and later were among the first to enter Rome. Canada was the only country of the Americas to be actively involved in the war prior to the Attack on Pearl Harbor. Canadian support for the war was mobilized through a propaganda campaign, including If Day, a staged 'Nazi' invasion of Winnipeg which generated more than $3 million in war bonds. Early campaigns A British Commonwealth Air Training Plan (BCAT) facility in Uplands, Ontario. More than half of BCAT graduates were Canadian. Although it regularly consulted with Canada, Britain was essentially in charge of both countries' war plans during the first nine months of the war. Neither nation seriously planned for Canada's own defence; Canada's training, production, and equipment emphasized combat in Europe. Its primary role was to supply food, raw materials, and to train pilots from throughout the Empire with the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan, which the British proposed on 26 September 1939; not send hundreds of thousands of troops overseas as it had done in World War I. Canada was the primary location of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan, the largest air force training program in history. 131,553 air force personnel, including 49,808 pilots, were trained at airbases in Canada from October 1940 to March 1945. More than half of the BCAT graduates were Canadians who went on to serve with the RCAF and Royal Air Force (RAF). One out of the six RAF Bomber Command groups flying in Europe was Canadian. It is possible that Britain did not want Canada to send troops overseas at all. The Canadian government agreed, because doing so might result in the need for conscription, and it did not want a recurrence of the problem with French Canadians that caused the 1917 crisis. Public opinion did cause King to send the 1st Canadian Infantry Division in late 1939, possibly against British wishes, but it is possible that had the air training proposal arrived ten days earlier no Canadian troops would have left North America that year. Canada fully cooperated with Britain otherwise, devoting 90% of the manpower of the small Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) to the air training plan; a force that had trained 125 pilots annually when the war began now produced 1,460 airmen every four weeks under the plan. On 12 June 1940, King's government asked the British and French to end their \\"small experimental orders\\" in favour of larger bulk orders, as \\"Canadian plants might be utilized to a far greater extent as a source of supply\\". In 1937 the two nations had agreed that any Canadian military equipment manufactured in Canada would use British designs. While this reasonably assumed that its troops would presumably always fight with Britain so the two forces should share equipment, it also resulted in Canada being dependent on components from a source across the Atlantic. Canadian manufacturing methods and tooling used American, not British designs, so implementing the plan would have meant complete changes to Canadian factories. Once war began, however, British companies refused Canadians their designs and Britain was uninterested in Canadian military equipment production. (When Canada suggested in early 1940 that its factories could replace British equipment given to the 1st Canadian Division, Britain replied that Canada might provide regimental badges.) While Britain gave Canada priority over the United States for purchases, Canada had very little military production capacity in 1939 and Britain had a shortage of Canadian dollars. As late as 12 June 1940, King's government and the Canadian Manufacturers' Association asked the British and French governments to end their \\"small experimental orders\\" and \\"make known at the earliest moment their pressing needs of munitions and supplies\\", as \\"Canadian plants might be utilized to a far greater extent as a source of supply\\". This situation began to change on 24 May 1940, during the Battle for France, when Britain told Canada that it could no longer provide equipment. 48 hours later, Britain asked Canada for equipment. On 28 May seven Canadian destroyers sailed to the English Channel, leaving only two French submarines to defend the nation's Atlantic coast. Canada also sent 50 to 60 million rounds of small arms ammunition and 75,000 Ross rifles, leaving itself with a shortage. The air training plan's first graduates were intended to become instructors for future students, but they were sent to Europe immediately because of the danger to Britain. The end of British equipment deliveries threatened the training plan, and King had to ask president Franklin D. Roosevelt of the United States for aircraft and engines by stating that they would help defend North America. As the fall of France grew imminent Britain looked to Canada to rapidly provide additional troops to strategic locations in North America, the Atlantic and Caribbean. Following the Canadian destroyer already on station from 1939, Canada provided troops from May 1940 to assist in the defence of the West Indies with several companies serving throughout the war in Bermuda, Jamaica, the Bahamas and British Guiana. On 12 June 1940, the 1st Canadian Infantry Brigade was deployed to Brest as a part of the second British Expeditionary Force during Operation Aerial. The brigade advanced towards Le Mans on 14 June before they withdrew to the United Kingdom from Brest, and Saint-Malo on 18 June. =Defence of the United Kingdom= No. 1 Squadron RCAF in the UK, October 1940. The squadron was deployed to the UK in June 1940, shortly before the Battle of Britain. From France's collapse in June 1940 to the German invasion of the USSR in June 1941, Canada supplied Britain with urgently needed food, weapons, and war materials by naval convoys and airlifts, as well as pilots and planes who fought in the Battle of Britain and the Blitz. During the Battle of Britain between 88 and 112 Canadian pilots served in the RAF, most had come to Britain on their own initiative. For political necessity an \\"all Canadian\\" squadron was formed under the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan at the start of the war and the Squadron served in the Battle of France. They were later joined by No. 1 Squadron RCAF in June 1940 during the Battle for Britain and they were in \\"the thick\\" of fighting in August, by the end of the battle in October 1940, 23 Canadian pilots had been killed.Bungay, Stephen, The Most Dangerous Enemy: A History of the Battle of Britain Aurum Press Ltd, 2009 Squadrons of the RCAF and individual Canadian pilots flying with the British RAF fought with distinction in Spitfire and Hurricane fighters during the Battle of Britain. By 1 January 1943, there were enough RCAF bombers and crews in Britain to form No. 6 Group, one of eight bomber groups within RAF Bomber Command. If the planned German invasion of Britain had taken place in 1941, units of the formation later known as I Canadian Corps were already deployed between the English Channel and London to meet them. near Hvalfj√∂r√∞ur, Iceland. Fearing the loss of a land link to the British Isles, Canada occupied Iceland following the British invasion of Iceland. in June 1940. After France's surrender Britain told Canada that a German invasion of North America was not impossible, and that Canadians needed to plan accordingly. From June 1940 Canada viewed defending itself as important as aiding Britain, perhaps slightly more so. Canadian troops were sent to the defence of the colony of Newfoundland, on Canada's east coast, the closest point in North America to Germany. Fearing the loss of a land link to the British Isles, Canada was requested to also occupy Iceland, which it did from June 1940 to the spring of 1941, following the initial British invasion. Canada also produced military equipment using American methods and tooling. Cost was no longer an issue; on 24 June King's government presented the first $1 billion budget in Canadian history. It included $700 million in war expenses compared to $126 million in the 1939‚Äì1940 fiscal year; however, due to the war, the overall economy was the strongest in Canadian history. With opposition support the National Resources Mobilization Act began conscription. Drafted soldiers were for use only in North America unless they volunteered, avoiding the issue that caused the 1917 crisis. (When Mayor of Montreal Camilien Houde nonetheless opposed conscription in August 1940, he was arrested and sent to an internment camp.) The United States government also feared the consequences to North America of a German victory in Europe. Because of the Monroe Doctrine the American military had long considered any foreign attack on Canada as the same as attacking the United States. American isolationists who criticized Roosevelt administration aid to Europe could not criticize helping Canada, which a survey of Americans in the summer of 1940 found that 81% supported defending. The isolationist Chicago Tribune advocating a military alliance on 19 June surprised and pleased Canada. Through King, the United States asked the United Kingdom to disperse the Royal Navy around the Empire so that the Germans could not control it. On 16 August 1940, King met with Roosevelt at the border town of Ogdensburg, New York. Through the Ogdensburg Agreement, they agreed to create the Permanent Joint Board on Defence, an organization that would plan joint defence of both countries and would continue to exist after the war. In the fall of 1940 a British defeat seemed so likely the joint board agreed to give the United States command of the Canadian military if Germany won in Europe. By the spring of 1941, as the military situation improved, Canada refused to accept American control of its forces if and when the United States entered the war. =Newfoundland= Digby Mark I off the coast of Newfoundland. During the war, several Canadian units were garrisoned in Newfoundland, a separate dominion of the Empire. When war was declared, Britain expected Canada to take responsibility for defending British North America. In 1939, L. E. Emerson was the Commissioner of Defence for Newfoundland. Winston Churchill instructed Emerson to cooperate with Canada and comply with a \\"friendly invasion\\" as he encouraged Mackenzie King to advise the occupation of Newfoundland by the king as monarch of Canada. By March 1942, Commissioner Emerson had restructured official organizations, such as The Aircraft Detection Corps Newfoundland, and integrated them into Canadian units, like The Canadian Aircraft Identity Corps. Several Canadian regiments were garrisoned in Newfoundland during the Second World War: the most famous regiment was The Royal Rifles of Canada who were stationed at Cape Spear before being dispatched to British Hong Kong; In July 1941, The Prince Edward Island Highlanders arrived to replace them; In 1941 and 1942, The Lincoln & Welland Regiment was assigned to Gander Airport and then St. John's. The Canadian Army built a concrete fort at Cape Spear with several large guns to deter German naval raids. Other forts were built overlooking St. John's Harbour; magazines and bunkers were cut into the South Side Hills and torpedo nets were draped across the harbour mouth. Cannons were erected at Bell Island to protect the merchant navy from submarine attacks and guns were mounted at Rigolette to protect Goose Bay. The 57th (Newfoundland) Heavy Regiment, August 1940. Several regiments from Newfoundland were formed under the British Royal Artillery, serving in North Africa, and Europe. The British Army mustered two units in Newfoundland for overseas service: The 59th Field Artillery and the 166th Field Artillery. The 59th served in northern Europe, the 166th served in Italy and North Africa. The Royal Newfoundland Regiment was also mustered, but was never deployed overseas. No. 125 (Newfoundland) Squadron R.A.F. served in England and Wales and provided support during D-Day: the squadron was disbanded on 20 November 1945. All Canadian soldiers assigned to Newfoundland from 1939 to 1945 received a silver clasp to their Canadian Volunteer Service Medal for overseas service. Because Canada, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia had all issued their own volunteer service medals, the Newfoundland government minted its own volunteer service medal in 1978. The Newfoundland Volunteer War Service Medal was awarded only to Newfoundlanders who served overseas in the Commonwealth Forces but had not received a volunteer service medal. The medal is bronze: on its obverse is a crown and a caribou; on its reverse is Britannia and two lions. =Battle of Hong Kong= Japanese invasion of the city. In Autumn 1941, the British government accepted an offer by the Canadian Government to send two infantry battalions and a brigade headquarters (1,975 personnel) to reinforce British, Indian and Hong Kong personnel garrisoned at Hong Kong. It was known as \\"C Force\\" and arrived in Hong Kong in mid-November 1941, but did not have all of its equipment. They were initially positioned on the south side of the Island to counter any amphibious landing. On December 8, following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese began their attack on Hong Kong with a force 4 times bigger than the Allied garrison. Canadian soldiers were called upon to counterattack and saw their first combat on December 11. After bitter fighting allied forces surrendered on December 25, 1941. \\"C Force\\" lost 290 personnel during the battle and a further 267 subsequently perished in Japanese prisoner of war camps. =Dieppe Raid= There was pressure from the Canadian government to ensure that Canadian troops were put into action.Thompson, Julian. \\"The Dieppe Raid.\\" BBC History (World Wars in Depth series), 30 March 2011 The Dieppe Raid of 19 August 1942, landed nearly 5,000 soldiers of the inexperienced Second Canadian Division and 1,000 British commandos on the coast of occupied France, in the only major combined forces assault on France prior to the Normandy invasion. While a large number of aircraft flew in support, naval gunfire was deliberately limited to avoid damage to the town and civilian casualties. As a result, the Canadian forces assaulted a heavily defended coast line with no supportive bombardment. Of the 6,086 men who made it ashore, 3,367 (60%) were killed, wounded, or captured.Hamilton 1981, pp. 546‚Äì558. The Royal Air Force failed to lure the Luftwaffe into open battle, and lost 106 aircraft (at least 32 to flak or accidents), compared to 48 lost by the Luftwaffe.Franks 1998, pp. 56‚Äì62. The Royal Navy lost 33 landing craft and one destroyer. Two Canadians received the Victoria Cross for actions at Dieppe: Lieutenant Colonel Charles Merritt of the South Saskatchewan Regiment and Honorary Captain John Foote, military chaplain of the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry. View of Dieppe after the failed raid against the port, August 1942. Lessons learned from the failure at Dieppe laid the framework for later Allied landings in North Africa, and Europe. The lessons learned at Dieppe became the textbook of \\"what not to do\\" in amphibious operations, and laid the framework for the later (Operation Torch) landings in North Africa and the Normandy landings in France. Most notably, Dieppe highlighted: # the need for preliminary artillery support, including aerial bombardment;Thompson, Julian. \\"The Dieppe Raid.\\" BBC (World Wars in Depth series), 6 June 2010. # the need for a sustained element of surprise; # the need for proper intelligence concerning enemy fortifications; # the avoidance of a direct frontal attack on a defended port city; and, # the need for proper re-embarkation craft.Maguire 1963, p. 190. The British developed a range of specialist armoured vehicles which allowed their engineers to perform many of their tasks protected by armour, most famously Hobart's Funnies. The major deficiencies in RAF ground support techniques led to the creation of a fully integrated Tactical Air Force to support major ground offensives.\\"RAF RAF History Timeline 1942.\\" raf.mod.uk, 2012 [last update]. Retrieved: 21 July 2012. Because the treads of most Churchill tanks were caught up in the shingle beaches of Dieppe, the Allies initiated pre-operation environmental intelligence collection, and devised appropriate vehicles to meet the challenges of future landing sites.Foot, M.R.D. \\"The Dieppe raid.\\"History Today, August 1992. Retrieved: 29 November 2015. The raid also challenged the Allies' belief that the seizure of a major port would be essential in the creation of a second front. Their revised view was that the amount of damage sustained by bombardment in order to capture a port, would almost certainly render it useless. As a result, the decision was taken to construct prefabricated \\"Mulberry\\" harbours, and tow them to beaches as part of a large- scale invasion.Atkin 1980, p. 274. =Aleutian Islands campaign= Major General George Pearkes (seated, far right) planning Operation Cottage with American officers. Shortly after the attack of Pearl Harbor, and the American entry into the war, Japanese troops invaded the Aleutian Islands. RCAF planes flew anti-submarine patrols against the Japanese while on land, Canadian troops were deployed side by side with American troops against the Japanese. Owing to circumstances, Canadians troops were only once sent into combat during the Aleutian campaign during the invasion of the island of Kiska. However, the Japanese had already withdrawn their forces at that point. Western Front (1943‚Äì45) =Italian campaign= While Canadians served at sea, in the air, and in small numbers attached to Allied formations and independently, the Italian campaign was the first full scale combat engagement by full Canadian divisions since World War I. Canadian soldiers went ashore in 1943 in the Allied invasion of Sicily, the subsequent Allied invasion of Italy, and then fought through the long Italian Campaign. During the course of the Allied campaign in Italy, over 25,000 Canadian soldiers became casualties of war. Several soldiers from the 48th Highlanders of Canada at the Battle of Ortona, December 1943 The 1st Canadian Division and the 1st Canadian Armoured Brigade took part in the Allied invasion of Sicily in Operation Husky, 10 July 1943 and also Operation Baytown, part of the Allied invasion of Italy on 3 September 1943. Canadian participation in the Sicily and Italy campaigns were made possible after the government decided to break up the First Canadian Army, sitting idle in Britain. Public pressure for Canadian troops to begin fighting forced a move before the awaited invasion of northwest Europe.Bercuson, David J. Maple Leaf against the Axis: Canada's Second World War. Toronto: Stoddart, 1995. p. 152. Troops fought on through the long and difficult Italian campaign until redeployed to the Western Front in February‚ÄìMarch 1945 during Operation Goldflake. By this time the Canadian contribution to the Italian theatre had grown to include I Canadian Corps headquarters, the 1st Division, 5th Canadian (Armoured) Division and an independent armoured brigade. Notable battles in Italy included the Moro River Campaign, the Battle of Ortona and the battles to break the Hitler Line, later fighting on the Gothic Line. Three Victoria Crosses were awarded to Canadian Army troops in Italy: Captain Paul Triquet of the Royal 22e R√©giment, Private Smokey Smith of The Seaforth Highlanders of Canada, and Major John Mahoney of The Westminster Regiment (Motor). =Liberation of France= LCAs heading towards Juno Beach during D-Day, June 1944 On 6 June 1944, the 3rd Canadian Division landed on Juno Beach in the Normandy landings and sustained heavy casualties in their first hour of attack. By the end of D-Day, the Canadians had penetrated deeper into France than either the British or the American troops at their landing sites, overcoming stronger resistance than the other beachheads except Omaha Beach. In the first month of the Normandy campaign, Canadian, British and Polish troops were opposed by some of the strongest and best trained German troops in the theatre, including the 1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler, the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend and the Panzer-Lehr-Division. Several costly operations were mounted by the Canadians to fight a path to the pivotal city of Caen and then south towards Falaise, part of the Allied attempt to liberate Paris. By the time the First Canadian Army linked up with U.S. forces, closing the Falaise pocket, the destruction of the German Army in Normandy was nearly complete. Three Victoria Crosses were earned by Canadians in Northwest Europe; Major David Currie of the South Alberta Regiment received the Victoria Cross for his actions at Saint-Lambert, Captain Frederick Tilston of the Essex Scottish and Sergeant Aubrey Cosens of the Queen's Own Rifles of Canada were rewarded for their service in the Rhineland fighting in 1945, the latter posthumously. 50,000 Canadians fought in D-Day. =The Low Countries= Amphibious vehicles of the First Canadian Army cross the Scheldt, in the effort to open shipping routes to Antwerp, September 1944. One of the most important Canadian contributions was the Battle of the Scheldt, involving II Canadian Corps, under Lieutenant-General Guy Simonds, under command of the First Canadian Army, commanded by General Henry Duncan Graham Crerar. The Corps included the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division, 3rd Canadian Infantry Division and 4th Canadian (Armoured) Division. Although nominally a Canadian formation, II Canadian Corps contained the Polish 1st Armoured Division, with the 1st Belgian Infantry Brigade, and the Royal Netherlands Motorized Infantry Brigade. The British 51st Infantry Division was attached to the Corps. The British had liberated Antwerp, but that city's port could not be used until the Germans were driven from the heavily fortified Scheldt estuary. In several weeks of heavy fighting in the fall of 1944, the Canadians succeeded in defeating the Germans in this region. The Canadians then turned east and played a central role in the liberation of the Netherlands. In 1944‚Äì45, the First Canadian Army was responsible for liberating much of the Netherlands from German occupation. Canada lost 7,600 troops in these operations. This day is celebrated on May 5th commemorating the surrender of the German Commander- in-chief Johannes Blaskowitz to Lieutenant-General Charles Foulkes, commanding I Canadian Corps, consisting of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division, 5th Canadian (Armoured) Division and the 1st Canadian Armoured Brigade, together with supporting units. The Corps had returned from fighting on the Italian Front in February 1945 as part of Operation Goldflake. Many Thanks spelt in tulips after Operation Manna. The operation saw humanitarian airdrops, to help relieve the famine in the Netherlands. The arrival of Canadian troops came at a time of crisis for the Netherlands: the \\"hunger winter\\". Canadian troops gave their rations to children, and blankets to civilians. Bombers were used to drop food packets to hungry civilians in German-occupied Rotterdam, Amsterdam, and the Hague in \\"Operation Manna\\", with permission from Germany, so long as the bombers did not fly above 200 feet. The royal family of the Netherlands had moved to Ottawa until the Netherlands were liberated, and Princess Margriet was born during this Canadian exile. Princess Juliana of the Netherlands, the only child of then-Queen Wilhelmina and heir to the throne, sought refuge in Canada with her two daughters, Beatrix and Irene, during the war. During Princess Juliana's stay in Canada, preparations were made for the birth of her third child. To ensure the Dutch citizenship of this royal baby, the Canadian Parliament passed a special law declaring Princess Juliana's suite at the Ottawa Civic Hospital \\"extraterritorial\\". On 19 January 1943, Princess Margriet was born. The day after Princess Margriet's birth, the Dutch flag was flown on the Peace Tower. This was the only time a foreign flag has waved atop Canada's Parliament Buildings. Dutch Royal Family arrive in the Netherlands from Canada, August 1945. Members of the royal family were relocated to Ottawa during the Nazis' occupation of the Netherlands. In 1945, the people of the Netherlands sent 100,000 hand-picked tulip bulbs as a post-war gift for the role played by Canadian soldiers in the liberation of the Netherlands. These tulips were planted on Parliament Hill and along the Queen Elizabeth Driveway. Princess Juliana was so pleased at the prominence given to the gift that in 1946, she decided to send a personal gift of 20,000 tulip bulbs to show her gratitude for the hospitality received in Ottawa. The gift was part of a lifelong bequest. Since then, tulips have proliferated in Ottawa as a symbol of peace, freedom and international friendship. Every year, Canada's capital receives 10,000 bulbs from the Dutch royal family, celebrated in the Canadian Tulip Festival. In 1995, the Netherlands donated an additional 5,000 bulbs for Parliament Hill, 1,000 for each provincial and territorial capital and 1,000 for Ste. Anne's hospital in Saint-Anne-de-Bellevue, Que. (the only remaining federal hospital in Canada, administered by Veterans Affairs Canada) It is thought that the Netherlands and the Dutch people have had an enduring affection for Canada and Canadians long after the war, lingering into the present day. Naval warfare =Battle of the Atlantic= Map of the Mid-Atlantic Gap, an area outside the cover of land-based aircraft, and ships sunk in 1941 (blue dots signify Allied ships sunk). Canada was given the responsibility of defending Allied convoys traversing the Gap from German wolfpacks. The Battle of the Atlantic was the longest ongoing battle in World War II. Once Britain declared war on Germany, Canada quickly followed, entering the war on 10 September 1939, as they had a vested interest in sustaining Britain. Canadian security relied on British success in this war, along with maintaining national security, politically speaking, some felt it was Canada's duty to assist her allies. For example, the Canadian prime minister Mackenzie King had been utterly convinced that it was Canada's \\"Self- evident national duty\\" to \\"back Britain\\". Once World War II had erupted in 1939, Canada had a small navy. In 1939 Canada had seven warships. Once entering the war, Canada needed a naval reformation in order to keep up with and aid the British. On the outbreak of the war Canada had roughly 3,500 men supporting the RCN. In September 1940 \\"the RCN grew to 10,000 men\\". The Canadian government agencies also played a major role in the patterns of warfare in the Atlantic. The Canadian Navies Division operated a network of naval control of shipping agents in the neutral United States from 1939 to 1941. These agents managed the shipping movements of British shipping in the United States, and also managed the growing United States Navy systems in regards to basic trade movements. Special publications on trade matters were supplied to the United States Navy from Ottawa in 1941, and by the time of Pearl Harbor American port directors were working with Ottawa as a team. Ottawa's job of studying trade movements and keeping track of intelligence was so effective and crucial that they were given the task of controlling shipping west of 40„Ä´and north of the equator from December 1941 to July 1942, along with supplying the USN trade directorate with daily intelligence. Canada was also given the responsibility of covering two strategically key points in the Atlantic. The first is known as the \\"Mid-Atlantic Gap\\", located off the coast of Greenland. This gap was a very hostile point in the supply line which was very difficult to take control. With the use of Iceland as a refuelling point and Canada to the west, the gap was narrowed down to . \\"The Surface gap was closed by the Royal Canadian Navy [in 1943]. This Newfoundland Escort Force started with 5 Canadian corvettes and two British destroyers [manned by Canadian seamen], followed by other Canadian-manned British destroyers when available\\". Gun crew of during a naval bombardment of German positions at Normandy, prior to the D-Day landings. The second task Canada was given was to control the English Channel during Operation Overlord (the Normandy landings). \\"On the 6th of June, 50 RCN escorts were redeployed from the North Atlantic and Canadian Waters for invasion duties\\". Their tasks were to cover the flanks of the invasion to ensure submarine defence of the invasion fleet, also to provide distant patrols of the southern flank of the invasion area, and lastly to prevent submarine flotillas in the channel from gaining reinforcements. This invasion relied on the RCN to cover British and American flanks to ensure a successful landing on the beaches of Normandy. Canada saw enormous growth during World War II, going from a limited amount of warships to becoming the third largest navy in the world after the Axis powers were defeated and the role they played in aiding the USN in intelligence. Their primary role in protecting merchant ships from North America to Britain was ultimately successful, though that victory was shared with the major Allied powers. Throughout the war Canada had made 25,343 successful escort voyages delivering 164,783,921 tons of cargo. By the end of the war, German documents state that the Royal Canadian Navy was responsible for the loss of 52 submarines in the Atlantic. In return 59 Canadian merchant ships, and 24 warships were sunk during the battle of the Atlantic. > \\"Canadians solved the problem of the Atlantic convoys.\\" ‚Äî British Admiral > Sir Percy Noble =Southeast Asia and the Pacific= bombards Miyako-jima, serving as a part of the British Pacific Fleet, May 1945. Canadian naval and special forces participated in various capacities in the Pacific and South-East Asia. The cruisers and HMCS Uganda, along with the armed merchant cruiser HMCS Prince Robert were assigned to the British Pacific Fleet. HMCS Uganda was in theatre at the time. HMCS Ontario arrived to support the post-war operations in the Philippines, Hong Kong and Japan. However the Uganda was the only Royal Canadian Navy ship to take an active part against the Japanese while serving with the British Pacific Fleet. Various Canadian special forces also served in Southeast Asia including the \\"Sea Reconnaissance Unit\\", a team of navy divers tasked to spearhead assaults across the rivers in Burma. Conditions aboard HMCS Uganda, compared to ships in the United States Navy, strict discipline, and the inability to display a separate Canadian identity, had contributed to poor morale and resentment amongst the crew. In an attempt to remedy this and mindful of the change in Canadian government policy that henceforth only volunteers would serve overseas, the ship's commander, Captain Edmond Rollo Mainguy, invited crew members (before the official date) to register their unwillingness to serve overseas. Of the 907 crew members, 605 did so on 7 May 1945. This decision, which had legal impact, was relayed to Canada and thence to the British government. Reacting to the angry British response, the Canadians agreed to stay on station until replaced. This happened on 27 July 1945, when joined the British Pacific Fleet and Uganda departed for Esquimalt arriving on the day of the Japanese surrender. =Attacks in Canadian waters and the mainland= German submarine surrenders in St. John's, Newfoundland, June 1945. U-boats operated in Canadian and Newfoundland waters during the war in an attempt to disrupt the convoys. Axis U-boats operated in Canadian and Newfoundland waters throughout the war, sinking many naval and merchant vessels. Two significant attacks took place in 1942 when German U-boats attacked four allied ore carriers at Bell Island, Newfoundland. The carriers SS Saganaga and SS Lord Strathcona were sunk by U-513 on 5 September 1942, while SS Rosecastle and P.L.M 27 were sunk by U-518 on 2 November with the loss of 69 lives. When the submarine fired a torpedo at the loading pier, Bell Island became the only location in North America to be subject to direct attack by German forces in the Second World War. U-boats were also found in the St. Lawrence River; during the night of 14 October 1942, the Newfoundland Railway ferry, SS Caribou was torpedoed by German U-boat U-69 and sunk in the Cabot Strait with the loss of 137 lives. Both sides fought to outsmart each other and decide the fate of the merchant vessels in the Atlantic Ocean. Several U-boat wrecks have been found in Canadian waters, a few as far in as the Churchill River in Labrador. The Canadian mainland was also attacked when the Japanese submarine I-26 shelled the Estevan Point lighthouse on Vancouver Island on 20 June 1942. Japanese fire balloons were also launched at Canada, some reaching British Columbia and the other western provinces. The Japanese Fu-Go balloon bombs were released during the winter of 1944‚Äì45, although no Canadians were actually hurt by the devices. The Japanese Army hoped that, aside from direct blast effects the incendiary bombs would cause fires. Since the balloons had to be launched in the winter, when the jet stream is at its strongest, the snow-covered ground prevented any fires from spreading. Nevertheless, 57 devices were found during the war as far east as Manitoba. Many others were discovered as late as 2014. Home front =Manufacturing, mining, and production= When the Second World War began, Canada was in the midst of escaping the Great Depression and this placed a lot of importance on the industries and farmers of Canada. Canada was in desperate need of workers. During the war, Canada's industries manufactured war materials and other supplies to all allied countries valuing at almost $10 billion - approximately $100 billion today. With men overseas, women began to have a more prominent role in the workplace. Due to such stringent wage and price restrictions by the government, workers rights‚Äô were not adequately acknowledged during this time. Out of Canada's population of 11.3 million, the total number of workers in war industries was roughly 1 million, whereas 2 million were employed in agriculture, communications, and food processing. Wheat was one of Canada's largest sources of produce. Although wheat was extremely important, Canada started to drown in wheat production and James Gardiner admitted that farmers needed to produce other agricultural commodities. After Gardiner's speech, farmers took a different direction and by 1944, Canada had produced 7.4 million hogs. Canada's contribution to the war effort was recognized by nations around the world. After Gardiner requested farmers to produce less wheat, during the next five years the production of wheat dropped. From 1940 to 1945, the income resulting from selling farm products such as livestock, grains, and field crops saw a dramatic increase, due to the growing worth and necessity of these goods in the war effort. And since there was a labour shortage in the farm work force, goods became more expensive. Wheat production in Canada dropped by over 200 million bushels a year between 1939 and 1945, but the total income from Canada's wheat production increased by more than $80 000 000. In 1942, Ottawa registered women between ages 20‚Äì24 into service sectors to fill in the roles of those who went to war. In total, around 1,073,000 women were in the workforce. Roles that traditionally belonged to men, like agriculture, airforce, labour, and production, were filled in by women seeking to work for the economy. It was also planned for them to take over the jobs of men in the homefront to encourage them to go to war. Women at the homefront provided for the war effort by donating clothes, food, money to medical organizations. Because women were now working, and men going to war, average family sizes decreased, and children had no parents to care for them. There was still a stigma around women working in industries and urban jobs. In contrast, the government had given 4,000-5,000 women a new responsibility- to regulate the food supplies so that it is preserved nor wasted in accordance with the fluctuating consequences of war and weather, something understood as squarely within the domestic sphere. Children and youth also experienced significant changes to their lives. The older teenagers also served as farmers and joined into the labour force as most able-bodied men were serving overseas. The Canadian government even lowered the minimum age for obtaining a licence to 14 so that teenagers could legally operate tractors and other vehicles. Indigenous Canadians played a large role on the Home Front during The Second World War. They donated a large amount of money for patriotic and humanitarian causes. The Indigenous Canadians collected scrap metals, rubber and bones in support of the war effort. More specifically, the Inuit population collected animal bones to secretly ship down south to be used for ammunition. The labour shortages across Canada during the Second World War provided improved financial conditions for many indigenous families. These shortages provided more work opportunities at higher wages the indigenous people had previously seen. Despite the influx of indigenous people entering the army and contributing at home, there was also some opposition to the war effort on the part of First Nations, Metis and Inuit Canadians. This was primarily due to taxes imposed on indigenous peoples by the government and the aftereffects of the previous war haunting the indigenous communities. Furthermore, conscription had a negative impact on the relationship between many of Canada's First Nations, Metis, and Inuit communities and the federal government. Before the war, Chinese Canadians often experienced discrimination in Canada and through Canada's immigration system. Nevertheless, Chinese- Canadian contributions to the war effort became the basis for their claim to equal treatment in Canada following the war. Though initially discouraged from enlisting, the victory of Japan in Hong Kong led to renewed calls from the British government for the enlistment of Chinese-Canadians, specifically Chinese ones that could speak English and could help with guerrilla warfare. Chinese Canadians fought with the Canadian armed forces and communities raised funds for the war effort . Vancouver Chinese contributed more per capita than any other group towards Victory Loan Drives . Chinese Canadians joined into different service groups, such as the Red Cross. Many young men volunteered for service overseas, while others worked in research, and war industries. Participation in the war was somewhat controversial within the Chinese- Canadian community, due to the racist treatment they had historically endured. Yet by 1944, participation in the war effort became the basis for a petition demanding increased acknowledgment of the rights of Chinese-Canadians. Female assembly workers during World War II. During the war, Canada became a major producer of war goods, particularly wheeled vehicles. At the beginning of the Second World War, Canada did not have an extensive manufacturing industry besides car manufacturing.Dr. J. L. Granatstein - (2005), Arming the Nation: Canada's Industrial War Effort, 1939-1945 - Canadian Council of Chief Executives. However, by the end of the war, Canada's wartime motor vehicle production constituted 20% of the combined total production of Canada, the US, and the UK. The nation had become one of the world's leading automobile manufacturers in the 1920s, owing to the presence of branch-plants of American automakers in Ontario. In 1938, Canada's automotive industry ranked fourth in the world in the output of passenger car and trucks, even though a large part of its productive capacity remained idle because of the Great Depression. During the war, this industry was put to good use, building all manner of war material, and most particularly wheeled vehicles, of which Canada became the second largest (next to the United States) producer during the war. Canada's output of about 800,000 trucks and wheeled vehicles, for instance, exceeded the combined total truck production of Germany, Italy, and Japan. Rivals Ford and General Motors of Canada pooled their engineering design teams to produce a standardized vehicle series, amenable to mass production: the Canadian Military Pattern (CMP) truck, which served throughout the British Commonwealth. With a production of some 410,000 units, the CMP trucks accounted for the majority of Canada's total truck output; and approximately half of the British Army's transport requirements were supplied by Canadian manufacturers. The British official History of the Second World War argues that the production of soft-skinned trucks, including the CMP truck class, was Canada's most important contribution to Allied victory.Hall, H. Duncan and Wrigley, C. C. Studies of Overseas Supply, a volume in the War Production Series directed by M. M. Postan, published as part of the History of the Second World War. United Kingdom Civil Series edited by Sir Keith Hancock. Her Majesty's Stationery Office and Longmans, Green and Co., London, 1956, pp. 51‚Äì52. Eldorado Mine, 1944. Expropriated by the Canadian government in 1939, it produced uranium for the Manhattan Project. Canada also produced its own medium tank, the Ram. Though it was unsuitable for combat employment, many were used for training, and the 1st Canadian Armoured Carrier Regiment used modified Rams as armoured personnel carriers in North-West Europe.Tonner, Mark. The Kangaroo in Canadian Service, Service Publications, 2005. See also The Ram in Canadian Service Vol 1. and Vol 2., same publisher. In addition 1,390 Canadian-built Valentine tanks were shipped to the Soviet Union. Approximately 14,000 aircraft, including Lancaster and Mosquito bombers, were built in Canada. In addition, by the end of 1944, Canadian shipyards had launched naval ships, such as destroyers, frigates, corvettes, and some 345 merchant vessels. But perhaps no Canadian contribution to the Allied war effort was so vital as that made by the metals industries: half of Allied aluminum and ninety percent of Allied nickel was supplied by Canadian sources during the war. The Canadian company Eldorado Gold Mines Ltd., which produced uranium as a byproduct of gold and radium production using ore from its mine at Port Radium in the Northwest Territories, was recruited by the Canadian government into involvement in the Manhattan Project. In particular, Eldorado's refinery at Port Hope processed ore from both Port Radium and the Belgian Congo to produce much of the uranium used in the Little Boy bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima. Regardless of King's political manoeuvrings, French- Canadians still experienced discrimination as Canadians‚Äîmany Anglophones still held the same sentiments towards them as they did in the First World War. Approximately 160,000 French-Canadian soldiers served overseas, which comprised 20% of all Canadian. The majority of these soldiers served in Francophone infantry units such as Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal, Le R√©giment de Maisonneuve, Le R√©giment de la Chaudi√®re, and the Royal 22e R√©giment. Despite the number of French-Canadians who joined the military a plebiscite that was held on April 27, 1942 to decide whether or not Canadian conscription for the Second World War should be enforced. This revealed that Quebec and other Francophone ridings were against it, whereas Anglophone communities were overwhelmingly in favour for conscription. This division and ultimate passing of Bill 80 in favour of conscription worsened relations between Anglophones and Francophones in Canada. Although most French-Canadians were against conscription, the Catholic Church ultimately encouraged participation in the war effort. This both spurred volunteerism earlyin the war and created some divisions between French-Canadians. =Veterans Guard of Canada= As with the Home Guard, the Veterans Guard of Canada was initially formed in the early days of the Second World War as a defence force in case of an attack on Canadian soil. Composed largely of First World War veterans it included, at its peak, 37 Active and Reserve companies with 451 officers and 9,806 other ranks. Over 17,000 veterans served in the force over the course of the war. Active companies served full-time in Canada as well as overseas, including a General Duty Company attached to Canadian Military Headquarters in London, England, No. 33 Coy. in the Bahamas, No. 34 Coy. in British Guiana and Newfoundland, and a smaller group dispatched to India. The Veterans Guard were involved in a three-day prisoner of war uprising in 1942, known as the Battle of Bowmanville. Along with its home defence role, the Veterans Guard assumed responsibility for guarding internment camps from the Canadian Provost Corps, which helped release younger Canadians for service overseas. The Guards were disbanded in 1947. =Conscription Crisis of 1944= 1942 plebiscite passed by over 65 percent, conscripts were not levied until November 1944. The political astuteness of Mackenzie King, combined with much greater military sensitivity to Quebec volunteers resulted in a conscription crisis that was minor compared to that of the First World War. French-Canadian volunteers were front and centre, in their own units, throughout the war, highlighted by actions at Dieppe (Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal), Italy (Royal 22e R√©giment), the Normandy beaches (Le R√©giment de la Chaudi√®re), the thrust into the Netherlands (Le R√©giment de Maisonneuve), and in the bombing campaign over Germany (No. 425 Squadron RCAF).unity between francophones and anglophones. Historiography and memory Canada deployed trained historians to Canadian Military Headquarters in the United Kingdom during the war, and paid much attention to the chronicling of the conflict, not only in the words of the official historians of the Army Historical Section, but also through art and trained painters. The official history of the Canadian Army was undertaken after the war, with an interim draft published in 1948 and three volumes in the 1950s. This was in comparison to the First World War's official history, only 1 volume of which was completed by 1939, and the full text only released after a change in authors some 40 years after the fact. Official histories of the RCAF and RCN in the Second World War were also a long time coming, and the book Arms, Men and Government by Charles Perry Stacey (one of the main contributors to the Army history) was published in the 1980s as an \\"official\\" history of the war policies of the Canadian government. The performance of Canadian forces in some battles have remained controversial, such as Hong Kong and Dieppe, and a variety of books have been written on them from various points of view. Serious historians ‚Äì mainly scholars ‚Äì emerged in the years after the Second World War, foremost Terry Copp (a scholar) and Denis Whitaker (a former soldier).Tim Cook, Clio's Warriors: Canadian Historians and the Writing of the World Wars (UBC Press, 2011).

Club career Dilevski started his career as a junior for Victorian lower league team Sydenham Park where he was coached by Tony Ivanov and eventually played in their seniors at a very young age. It was club policy to promote talent into the senior team that was adopted by Bill Dimovski. After showing obvious talent and out-classing others many years his senior, the Victorian Institute of Sport recruited him. Dilevski was recruited by European clubs Tottenham Hotspur and PSV Eindhoven early in his career. After Tottenham offered him an extension on his contract, he chose to move out of England in order to get some first team experience in Australia. Dilevski joined Melbourne Victory for the duration of their participation in the 2005 Australian Club World Championship Qualifying Tournament, ultimately just the one game where they were knocked out of the tournament by Adelaide United. After a stint with Queensland Roar in Australia, he moved to Romania where he struggled for game time. In 2008, the new manager of Craiova decided to use him as a defensive midfielder, and Dilevski played well in the new position. He returned to the A-League in March 2011 and was signed on a one- year deal with Adelaide United. Making 12 out of a possible 27 appearances for the club. Dilevski signed for home town club Melbourne Victory on a one-year deal, It was announced on 14 June 2012.

Brownlie scored a hat-trick in QAS's 4‚Äì1 win over UTS Olympic in round seven of 1996‚Äì97, and several goals in the following season to earn his call-up to the Brisbane Strikers senior team for the end of the 1997‚Äì98 National Soccer League season. Brownlie made five appearances for the Strikers in 1997‚Äì98, but none the following season, and so moved to the Brisbane Premier League to play for the Brisbane Lions. The 2000 BPL season was a large success for Brownlie, as he scored 12 goals in just 11 appearances for the Lions, as well as making his representative debut and scoring a goal for Queensland against his home state in September. Brownlie then signed with Marconi Stallions for 2000‚Äì01, scoring 6 goals in 24 appearances in his first season with the Sydney club. He made his true breakthrough the following season though, breaking an NSL scoring record by notching up 8 goals in a series of 4 matches, and ending the 2001‚Äì02 season with 11 goals from his 15 appearances. His success earned him an invitation to trial with English club Sheffield Wednesday, and whilst on the verge of a contract offer, he broke his cheekbone and missed the opportunity. Upon recovery, Brownlie remained in England to trial with Brentford, Portsmouth, Oldham Athletic and Swindon Town throughout August 2002, and despite scoring a goal for Swindon in a friendly against Spanish side Sporting de Gij√≥n after just 86 seconds, he returned to Australia without a contract. After training with Perth Glory in the lead-up to the 2002‚Äì03 season, Brownlie eventually signed for Parramatta Power when contract negotiations with Perth broke down. Despite Parramatta finishing third, Brownlie had a disappointing season personally. He was in the starting line-up just four times, and scored once ‚Äì in Parramatta's 2‚Äì0 win over his old club Brisbane in round 8. This prompted Brownlie to return to the Strikers for the 2003‚Äì04 season, but he was hampered by injuries which forced him to undergo surgery on his knee, and he scored just three times in 21 appearances. From 2006 to 2008 Royce continued to play professionally in England and then New Zealand. From 2008 Royce has played mainly in player/coach roles for clubs in the Brisbane area in the National Premier Leagues Queensland and the Brisbane Premier League. =A-League= In February 2005, Brownlie was announced as one of the first eleven signings at new club Queensland Roar,. He began playing for them in the annual Silver Boot competition, scoring a hat-trick against Pine Rivers in an early 7‚Äì1 victory, and the equaliser in the final against Rochedale Rovers. Brownlie's scoring form continued in the North Queensland Challenge Cup, scoring in Queensland's 2‚Äì1 win over the Central Coast Mariners in Townsville. Despite suffering a rib injury in a 5‚Äì0 Pre-season Cup win over New Zealand Knights, Brownlie recovered in time for Queensland's 2005‚Äì06 A-League season opener. Dropped in favour of Reece Tollenaere, Brownlie missed the following two rounds, and after earning a call-up into the starting line-up against Sydney FC, was struck by three onsets of a virus within a month, which also affected other members of the Queensland squad. Brownlie returned to the first team in round 8, and scored against Adelaide United the following week, but was hit by virus again and forced out of the squad. Following a further short absence, a suspension to fellow striker Michael Baird saw Brownlie return to the team against New Zealand, and he picked up his second league goal of the season. The introduction of Brazilian striker Reinaldo to the Roar in early 2006, however, again forced Brownlie out of the squad and he played just twice more before the end of the season. Citing his proneness to injury and illness, Queensland declined to offer a contract extension, but gave him the opportunity to prove himself during their Tongyeong Cup campaign in South Korea. Still with no offer forthcoming and permission to negotiate with other clubs, Brownlie headed to England again in July 2006. =England= Four years after his first attempt, Brownlie trialled with Swindon Town again, and this time scored five goals in his first two trial matches for the Robins. On 27 July 2006 he signed for Swindon Town for their 2006‚Äì07 season in the English League Two. He scored his first league goal for the club on his debut, with a last-minute blistering strike against Barnet, shortly after an equaliser by Ricky Shakes, to seal a 2‚Äì1 victory. Brownlie earned a red card in Swindon Town's League Cup match against Brentford, and since his mandatory one-match suspension, has been deployed as a wide right midfielder by Paul Sturrock. Brownlie was released by Swindon Town on 9 May 2007 after an unsuccessful loan period at Chester City. =New Zealand= On 19 May 2007, Brownlie signed for A-League club Wellington Phoenix on a two-year contract but left the club on 4 March 2008 after struggling to gain a spot in the first team and will return to Brisbane to pursue a career in the construction industry.Brownlie released by Phoenix =Australia= Brownlie signed with Peninsula Power in the Brisbane Premier League alongside his brother Paul. He was also an assistant coach with the Power and netted 8 goals in 12 games in 2009 season. Brownlie joined North Star FC as player/coach and won the 2011 Brisbane Premier League Division 1 grand final and promotion to the Brisbane Premier League. In 2013, he became a foundation player and later player/coach with FFA National Premier Leagues Queensland club Moreton Bay United winning the 2015 NPLQ premiership/championship double. When he stepped down at the end of the 2016 season he was the most lethal striker in the short history of the NPLQ with 72 goals in four seasons. He plans to continue playing for Moreton Bay United feeder club Albany Creek Excelsior (ACE) in the Brisbane Premier League in 2017.

He was the Chief Administrative Law Judge for the U.S. Department of the Interior in the first Reagan administration and was a candidate for Senate District 21 in the Maryland congressional elections, 2006. Biography John Stafford was born December 18, 1940, to a United States Marine Corps family at Parris Island, South Carolina, and died June 29, 2011 at 8:30pm at the Orlando Regional Medical Center, Orlando, Florida. His paternal ancestors were Irish Catholic migrants from County Wexford, and claim links to the Dukes of Buckingham. His maternal ancestors were from Sweden and Bohemia. Stafford was educated at the University of Maryland, College Park, where he was Treasurer of the SGA, serving with now-U.S. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer who was elected VP on that same ballot. He wrote the column \\"Cloakroom Caucus\\" for the Diamondback daily newspaper, was Editor-in-Chief of the \\"M-Book\\", and was Associate Editor of the \\"Terrapin\\", and was a DJ for four years on WMUC with his four-hour every Sunday evening show, playing pop and folk, and the early R&B; songs on 45s and LPs of those earliest singers, most of whom are now in the R&B; Hall of Fame in Cleveland. Stafford met and knew many of those early pioneer artists‚ÄîRuthie Brown, The Platters, The Drifters, etc.‚Äîpersonally, from the Casino Royale in downtown DC in the 1950s, and their other dates and concerts, as well as Joan Baez and Ian and Sylvia and Harry Belafonte and Miriam Makeba, et al., in his later years. He served four years in the US Marine Corps as a lawyer during the Vietnam War. His cases as a prosecutor and defense counsel at Cherry Pt. MCAS and NAVARA and the Navy JAG Investigations Division included three of the most important cases arising during that war. The case of US v. Denzil Allen was the first torture and mass murder and atrocity case of the Vietnam war, nine months before My Lai. The case of US v. David Y. Przbycien led to setting the limit on how long a serviceman may be detained before trial at 90 days, or charges must be dismissed. That rule was later adopted by the Federal criminal courts, on a 60-day basis. The case of US v. John Phillip Wass raised the issue of whether the United States was in \\"a time of war\\" in Vietnam, as Congress had not declared war (as required by the Constitution), but merely passed the infamous Gulf of Tonkin Resolution in a rush requested by President Lyndon Johnson, before any confirmation of the reality of the second alleged North Vietnamese attack on the destroyer USS Turner Joy could be confirmed. = Political career = He was elected a Democratic Precinct Committeeman in the 43rd Legislative District of Washington State in 1964, on the ballot with Lyndon Johnson and former Congressman James McDermott, who was elected a state representative. Stafford has worked for other candidates on about 50 political campaigns from county-level to presidential over 54 years, beginning in 1952 with Presidential candidate Dwight D. Eisenhower, and the past 32 years for Republicans, beginning in 1979 as a National Vice-Chairman of Reagan Finance, at a time when Gov. Reagan was written off, as was Stafford's boyhood friend since 1947 at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Sen. John McCain, in 2007. Stafford has run for the US Senate in past elections in Maryland, in 1998,Federal Election Commission. http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/fe2002/senate.htm - 1998 Senate Primary Results.

John Stafford was the Chief Administrative Law Judge for the U.S. Department of the Interior in the first Reagan administration. He was also National Vice-Chairman of Reagan Finance in 1979, and Special Counsel for the Chairman, Warren G. Magnuson, of the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce. In this position he worked on the Rail Services Act of 1975, the 4R Act, where he proposed the re-privatization of Conrail, with the sale of stock to the public, which occurred in 1986, and is now owned by Norfolk Southern and CSX. Stafford also served as Caucus Counsel for the majority leaderships of both the Washington State House and Senate, and as counsel to two committees thereof. Finishing second in a field of nine in the Republican primary in 2004, he was outspent by the 2004 US Senate primary winner, State Senator E. J. Pipkin, by nearly $1 million. Stafford won the Republican nomination for the Maryland House of Delegates in 2002 in the 13th District of Howard County where he was then outspent by 100 to 1 by the 8-year Democrat incumbent, Shane Pendergrass. Stafford was also the nominated Republican candidate for Senate District 21 in the 2006, then voluntarily stepping aside for Sen. John Giannetti, the Democrat incumbent, when John offered to switch to the Republican party, as reported by the \\"Laurel Leader\\" and by \\"The Washington Post\\" (for whom Stafford was a paper boy in 1953 in Chevy Chase DC) Maryland congressional elections.  Platform  Stafford opposes abortion, slot machine casino gambling, and gun control, and the many stresses and costs on families and family formations, inter alia, such as excessive income, sales, and real estate taxes. He supports his improved and fairer version of the Cong. Linder/Gov. Huckabee, et al.-supported, \\"Fair Tax\\". Stafford's proposal would abolish Federal personal income taxation and the 16th Amendment, which, under President Woodrow Wilson, and at the behest of the NYC bank owners and their \\"Federal\\" Reserve Bank, which they actually privately own all the preferred stock of, eliminated the Founders' specific Constitutional prohibition of such a direct \\"head\\" tax on personal [but not on business or corporate] income. Stafford would replace it completely with a Constitutional point-of-sales Federal sales tax. He has advocated this necessary change in the many Federal sources of revenue for 4 decades, and with the 3 Members of Congress and the US Senate for whom he has worked, first as a Congressional Staffer and later as Special Counsel to the Chairman of the US Senate Committee on Commerce. Stafford was the one who persuaded the former Chairman of the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman, Bill Archer, the Congressman of George H.W. Bush, from Houston, TX, and his Chief Counsel, to this position in 1995, which proposed legislation Stafford also prepared as a White Paper for U.S. Sen. Bob Dole during Dole's 1996 Presidential race, where Stafford was a close and voluntarily-unpaid advisor for 3¬Ω years. And by alerting the Budget Director, Myrt Charney, of the State of Alaska, and its then-Gov. Egan, in 1973, of the impending bankruptcy of that State by 1979, Stafford played a key role in the repeal of the State income tax in that State, as that second-time Governor, Democrat Bill Egan, called a special hydrocarbon tax structure session of the Alaska Legislature and put that State on a sound financial footing ever since. Stafford's warning was connected to his job as a Consultant with Mathematical Sciences NW of Seattle, the firm which wrote the accurate socio-economic study for the Alyeska Pipeline Co. which then built the Trans-Alaska oil pipeline. A Libertarian Party-elected friend of Stafford's, a member of that legislature, then was able to secure all the support needed to repeal that state-level income tax. And Alaska's Permanent Fund, established because the State's finances were put on that sound basis after Stafford's study and research-based warning, has now paid to all its legal residents as much as $2000 in income per year, rather than taxing their annual income.

In his early days with the Strikers he played predominantly as a wide midfielder under the guidance of Frank Farina and was a part of the Brisbane Strikers team to win the Ericsson Cup (NSL title) in the 1996/97 season. He was a part of the Australian under-20 squad and played three matches for his country before missing out on the final Youth World Cup squad in 1997. In early 1998, whilst contracted to the Strikers, Reece transferred on loan to the Newcastle Breakers for the final 9 games of the season. He played in each game scoring 6 goals, which included a hat-trick against Perth Glory in a 4‚Äì3 win and a goal against the Strikers to deny his former team of a win. Reece returned to his hometown and the Strikers the next season with the Newcastle Breakers coach John Kosmina. Although the season started brightly with a headed goal against Marconi-Fairfield, he suffered a fracture to the ankle in the third game of the season against Sydney Olympic and struggled for the remainder of the season, requiring surgery to remove floating bone. Reece suffered multiple facial fractures in a head clash in only his third game of the inaugural A-League season whilst playing for the Roar and was forced to miss the remainder of the season, undergoing two facial reconstructions. After a long absence from the game he continued his playing career with the Brisbane Strikers, halfway through the 2006 Brisbane Premier League season.

Gebert was in Detroit, Michigan by 1920, where he was editor of the three primary Polish-language publications: G≈Ços Robotniczy (Workers' Voice), Trybuna Robotnicza (The Workers' Tribune), and G≈Ços Ludowy (People's Voice).Robbie Terman, Finding Aid for the Don Binkowski Papers , Walter P. Reuther Library, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, 2008. As well as working in his editorial capacity, Gebert was the Secretary of the Polish Bureau of the Workers (Communist) Party and was a fraternal delegate to the party's 6th National Convention, held in New York City in March 1929.Russian State Archive for Socio-Political History (RGASPI), fond 515, opis 1, delo 1600, list 11. Available on microfilm as \\"Files of the Communist Party of the USA in the Comintern Archives,\\" IDC Publishers, reel 122. In 1932, Gebert was a founder of the Polonia Society from the existing Polish-language section of the International Workers Order (IWO), an organization for which he remained as a national officer. He also served in the first half of the 1930s as District Organizer of the CPUSA's Chicago and Pittsburgh districts.Randi Stroch's Red Chicago: American Communism at Its Grassroots, 1928‚Äì35 refers to Bill Gebert in 1931 as \\"Chicago's leading Communist Party official\\" (pg. 31), which is an accurate description of the District Organizer's role as supervisor, dues collector, cheerleader, and the conduit of directives from the party center. Louis F. Budenz wrote of a conflict between Gebert and Morris Childs, District Organizer for Illinois, over Gebert's intrusion into Chicago and, in particular, over a \\"Czech comrade who was doing vital underground work for Gebert.\\" In 1936 he went to work for the Steel Workers Organizing Committee (SWOC) of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) in charge of efforts to organize fraternal organizations of foreign-born Americans.Fraser M. Ottanelli, The Communist Party of the United States: From the Depression to World War II. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1991. Page 143. Ottanelli erroneously refers to Bill Gebert's first name as \\"William.\\" As such, Gebert organized a conference of said organizations in Pittsburgh at the end of 1936 ‚Äî a gathering attended by 447 representatives of various national origins. The gather was addressed by Phillip Murray and greeted by John L. Lewis of the SWOC.Fraser M. Ottanelli, The Communist Party of the United States: From the Depression to World War II, pp. 143‚Äì144. Gebert was a frequent contributor to the theoretical monthly of the CPUSA, The Communist, between the years 1933 and 1939.According to Joel Seidman's 1969 Communism in the United States ‚Äî A Bibliography, Bill Gebert published articles in the following issues of The Communist: August, September, December 1933; July 1934; September 1935; January, March, June, August 1936; May, October 1937; February 1938; May 1939. Gebert's contributions seem to have ceased abruptly at this juncture. Gebert appears in nine intercepted KGB messages between May and October 1944.Boles≈Çaw Gebert's cover name, as assigned by Soviet intelligence and deciphered in Venona project transcripts, was ATAMAN. Gebert was a contact of the mysterious unidentified KHAN (also SELIM KHAN). Gebert is referenced in the following Venona decrypts: 700 KGB New York to Moscow, 17 May 1944; 759‚Äì760 KGB New York to Moscow, 27 May 1944; 761 KGB New York to Moscow, 27 May 1944; 763 KGB New York to Moscow, 29 May 1944; 823 KGB New York to Moscow, 7 June 1944; 928 KGB New York to Moscow, 1 July 1944; 956, 957 KGB New York to Moscow, 6 July 1944; 1229 KGB New York to Moscow, 29 August 1944 ; 1410 KGB New York to Moscow, 6 October 1944. Gebert was the contact of fellow Soviet agent, Oskar Lange, a Polish economist who was a personal emissary from President Franklin D. Roosevelt to Joseph Stalin on the \\"Polish question\\". Another Venona message reports Gebert's demand for a $500 balance the KGB still owed him on a one thousand dollar contract to publish a Polish-language book. Boles≈Çaw Gebert grave After World War II, Gebert returned to the now Communist-dominated Poland, where he assumed a leading position in the state- controlled labor unions. From 1949 to 1950, Gebert was Secretary of the World Peace Council and from 1950 to 1957, the editor of Glosu Pracy. He returned to the United States in 1950 as United Nations representative of the World Federation of Trade Unions. From 1960 to 1967 Gebert served as the Polish People's Republic's Ambassador to Turkey. =Death and legacy= Bill Gebert died in 1986 in Warsaw. He was married two times, first in 1920 in the US, with Romanian-born Elvira Koenig (1898‚Äì1974), with whom he had one son, Armand Gebert (1922‚Äì2009), a journalist who lived and died in Detroit. He was survived by his second wife, Krystyna Pozna≈Ñska-Gebert (1916‚Äì1991), of Jewish origin, and was the father of two children with her: a daughter and son, Konstanty Gebert (born 1953), a prominent Polish journalist and Jewish activist.

FPAs are used most commonly for imaging purposes (e.g. taking pictures or video imagery), but can also be used for non-imaging purposes such as spectrometry, LIDAR, and wave-front sensing. In radio astronomy, the focal-plane array (FPA) is an array at the focus of a radio telescope. At optical and infrared wavelengths it can refer to a variety of imaging device types, but in common usage it refers to two- dimensional devices that are sensitive in the infrared spectrum. Devices sensitive in other spectra are usually referred to by other terms, such as CCD (charge-coupled device) and CMOS image sensor in the visible spectrum. FPAs operate by detecting photons at particular wavelengths and then generating an electrical charge, voltage, or resistance in relation to the number of photons detected at each pixel. This charge, voltage, or resistance is then measured, digitized, and used to construct an image of the object, scene, or phenomenon that emitted the photons. Applications for infrared FPAs include missile or related weapons guidance sensors, infrared astronomy, manufacturing inspection, thermal imaging for firefighting, medical imaging, and infrared phenomenology (such as observing combustion, weapon impact, rocket motor ignition and other events that are interesting in the infrared spectrum). Comparison to scanning array Staring arrays are distinct from scanning array and TDI (time-delay integration) imagers in that they image the desired field of view without scanning. Scanning arrays are constructed from linear arrays (or very narrow 2-D arrays) that are rastered across the desired field of view using a rotating or oscillating mirror to construct a 2-D image over time. A TDI imager operates in similar fashion to a scanning array except that it images perpendicularly to the motion of the camera. A staring array is analogous to the film in a typical camera; it directly captures a 2-D image projected by the lens at the image plane. A scanning array is analogous to piecing together a 2D image with photos taken through a narrow slit. A TDI imager is analogous to looking through a vertical slit out the side window of a moving car, and building a long, continuous image as the car passes the landscape. Scanning arrays were developed and used because of historical difficulties in fabricating 2-D arrays of sufficient size and quality for direct 2-D imaging. Modern FPAs are available with up to 2048 x 2048 pixels, and larger sizes are in development by multiple manufacturers. 320 x 256 and 640 x 480 arrays are available and affordable even for non-military, non- scientific applications. Construction and materials The difficulty in constructing high-quality, high-resolution FPAs derives from the materials used. Whereas visible imagers such as CCD and CMOS image sensors are fabricated from silicon, using mature and well-understood processes, IR sensors must be fabricated from other, more exotic materials because silicon is sensitive only in the visible and near-IR spectra. Infrared-sensitive materials commonly used in IR detector arrays include mercury cadmium telluride (HgCdTe, \\"MerCad\\", or \\"MerCadTel\\"), indium antimonide (InSb, pronounced \\"Inns-Bee\\"), indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs, pronounced \\"Inn- Gas\\"), and vanadium(V) oxide (VOx, pronounced \\"Vox\\"). A variety of lead salts can also be used, but are less common today. None of these materials can be grown into crystals anywhere near the size of modern silicon crystals, nor do the resulting wafers have nearly the uniformity of silicon. Furthermore, the materials used to construct arrays of IR-sensitive pixels cannot be used to construct the electronics needed to transport the resulting charge, voltage, or resistance of each pixel to the measurement circuitry. This set of functions is implemented on a chip called the multiplexer, or readout integrated circuits (ROIC), and is typically fabricated in silicon using standard CMOS processes. The detector array is then hybridized or bonded to the ROIC, typically using indium bump-bonding, and the resulting assembly is called an FPA. Some materials (and the FPAs fabricated from them) operate only at cryogenic temperatures, and others (such as resistive amorphous silicon (a-Si) and VOx microbolometers) can operate at uncooled temperatures. Some devices are only practical to operate cryogenically as otherwise the thermal noise would swamp the detected signal. Devices can be cooled evaporatively, typically by liquid nitrogen (LN2) or liquid helium, or by using a thermo- electric cooler. A peculiar aspect of nearly all IR FPAs is that the electrical responses of the pixels on a given device tend to be non-uniform. In a perfect device every pixel would output the same electrical signal when given the same number of photons of appropriate wavelength. In practice nearly all FPAs have both significant pixel-to-pixel offset and pixel-to-pixel photo- response non-uniformity (PRNU). When un-illuminated, each pixel has a different \\"zero-signal\\" level, and when illuminated the delta in signal is also different. This non-uniformity makes the resulting images impractical for use until they have been processed to normalize the photo-response. This correction process requires a set of known characterization data, collected from the particular device under controlled conditions. The data correction can be done in software, in a DSP or FPGA in the camera electronics, or even on the ROIC in the most modern of devices. The low volumes, rarer materials, and complex processes involved in fabricating and using IR FPAs makes them far more expensive than visible imagers of comparable size and resolution. Staring plane arrays are used in modern air-to-air missiles and anti-tank missiles such as the AIM-9X Sidewinder, ASRAAM Air-to-Air Weapons - Royal Air Force  Applications  = 3D LIDAR Imaging = Focal plane arrays (FPAs) have been reported to be used for 3D LIDAR imaging.Goldberg, A.; Stann, B.; Gupta, N. (July 2003). \\"Multispectral, Hyperspectral, and Three-Dimensional Imaging Research at the U.S. Army Research Laboratory\\" (PDF). Proceedings of the International Conference on International Fusion [6th]. 1: 499‚Äì506.  Limitations  Cross talk can inhibit the illumination of pixels.  Improvements  In 2003, a 32 x 32 pixel breadboard was reported with capabilities to repress cross talk between FPAs. Researchers at the U.S. Army Research Laboratory used a collimator to collect and direct the breadboard‚Äôs laser beam onto individual pixels. Since low levels of voltage were still observed in pixels that did not illuminate, indicating that illumination was prevented by crosstalk. This cross talk was attributed to capacitive coupling between the microstrip lines and between the FPA‚Äôs internal conductors. By replacing the receiver in the breadboard for one with a shorter focal length, the focus of the collimator was reduced and the system‚Äôs threshold for signal recognition was increased. This facilitated a better image by cancelling cross talk. Another method was to add a flat thinned substrate membrane (approximately 800 angstroms thick) to the FPA. This was reported to eliminate pixel-to-pixel cross talk in FPA imaging applications. In another an avalanche photodiode FPA study, the etching of trenches in between neighboring pixels reduced cross talk.

Upon satisfaction of those conditions, the stock is no longer restricted, and becomes transferable to the person holding the award. Restricted stock is often used as a form of employee compensation, in which case it typically becomes transferable (\\"vests\\") upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, such as continued employment for a period of time or the achievement of particular product-development milestones, earnings per share goals or other financial targets. Restricted stock is a popular alternative to stock options, particularly for executives, due to favorable accounting rules and income tax treatment.Lecture 18 - Legal and Accounting Basics for Startups, Stanford University. Attorney Carolynn Levy, General Counsel at Y Combinator. Restricted stock units (RSUs) have more recently become popular among venture companies as a hybrid of stock options and restricted stock. RSUs involve a promise by the employer to grant restricted stock at a specified point in the future, with the general intention of delaying the recognition of income to the employee while maintaining the advantageous accounting treatment of restricted stock. Vesting conditions Typical vesting conditions for restricted stock awards in venture capital‚Äìbacked startups may include the following: * A period of time before vesting, intended to prevent employees from \\"walking away\\" from the venture. There is generally a one-year \\"cliff\\" representing the formative stage of the company when the founders' work is most needed, followed by a more gradual vesting over a four-year schedule representing a more incremental growth stage. Founders are sometimes permitted to recognize a portion of the time spent at the company before investment in their vesting schedule, generally from six months to two years. * \\"Double trigger\\" acceleration provision, stating that the restricted stock vests if the company is acquired by a third party and the employment of the grantee is terminated within a certain time frame. This protects employees from losing the unvested portion of their equity share award in case the employees are forced out by new management after a change in control. Another alternative is \\"single trigger\\" acceleration under which the change of control itself accelerates the vesting of the stock, but this structure is more risky for investors because following an acquisition of the company, key employees will not have any equity award that provides a financial incentive to remain with the company. * \\"Market standoff provision\\", stating that holders of restricted stock may not sell for a certain period of time (usually 180 days) after an initial public offering. This is intended to stabilize the stock price of the company after the IPO by preventing a large sale of stock on the market by the founders. ‚â†History Executive compensation practices came under increased congressional scrutiny in the United States when abuses at corporations such as Enron became public. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, P.L. 108-357, added Sec. 409A, which accelerates income to employees who participate in certain nonqualified deferred compensation plans (including stock option plans). Later in 2004, FASB issued Statement no. 123(R), Share-Based Payment, which requires expense treatment for stock options for annual periods beginning in 2005. (Statement no. 123(R) is now incorporated in FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, Compensation‚ÄîStock Compensation.) Prior to 2006, stock options were a popular form of employee compensation because it was possible to record the cost of compensation as zero so long as the exercise price was equal to the fair market value of the stock at the time of granting. Under the same accounting standards, awards of restricted stock would result in recognizing compensation cost equal to the fair market value of the restricted stock. However, changes to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) which became effective in 2006 led to restricted stock becoming a more popular form of compensation. Microsoft switched from stock options to restricted stock in 2003, and by May 2004 about two-thirds of all companies surveyed by HR consultancy Mercer had reported changing their equity compensation programs to reflect the impact of the new option expensing rules. The median number of stock options (per company) granted by Fortune 1000 firms declined by 40% between 2003 and 2005, and the median number of restricted stock awards increased of all reporting executives in the S&P; 500 increased by 88%. Tax treatment =United States= Under Section 83 of the Internal Revenue Code, the value of property transferred in connection with the performance of services is included in gross income, and is recognized as such on the date on which the property is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, or the date on which the property becomes transferable, whichever is earlier. In the case of restricted stock, the former date is generally known as the \\"vesting date\\" and is the date when the employee recognizes income for tax purposes (assuming that the restricted stock is not transferable at an earlier date, which is how employers generally structure their restricted stock awards). Employees pay income tax on the value of the restricted stock in the year in which it vests, and then pay capital gains tax on any subsequent appreciation or depreciation in the value of the restricted stock in the year in which it is sold. A grantee of restricted stock may make an \\"83(b) election\\" to recognize the income from the restricted stock grant based on the fair market value of the restricted stock at the time of the grant, rather than at the time of vesting. This is often desirable to minimize income tax liability when the restricted stock is granted at a very low value, but is risky in that the tax paid on the stock award is non-refundable even if the stock does not ultimately vest. =Other countries= Revenue authorities in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland have issued guidelines on the taxation of restricted stock and RSU awards. Valuation Restricted stock is generally incorporated into the equity valuation of a company by counting the restricted stock awards as shares that are issued and outstanding. This approach does not reflect the fact that restricted stock has a lower value than unrestricted stock due to the vesting conditions attached to it, and therefore the market capitalization of a company with restricted stock outstanding may be overstated. However, restricted stock has less of an impact than stock options in this regard, as the number of shares awarded tends to be lower and the discount for illiquidity tends to be smaller.

Character overview Mentored by his godfather Burr Redding, Hill started selling and using drugs during his teenage years. In 1995, a SWAT team busted Hill's apartment while he and his wife were having sex. As he tried to make his escape on the roof, Hill was cornered and killed one of the SWAT officers. In retaliation, he was thrown off the roof and left paralyzed from the waist down. At the Oswald Maximum Security Penitentiary (\\"Oz\\"), Hill is a mostly neutral figure. As he uses a wheelchair and is not associated with any gang members, Hill remains one of the more consistently decent characters, struggling to avoid moral compromises while staying alive in the prison. Hill serves as the narrator of the series, even after his character is killed in the fifth season. =Season 1= Hill is one of the inmates sent to \\"Emerald City,\\" an experimental cell block designed to rehabilitate prisoners from differing backgrounds. He works in the dress factory with inmates Bob Rebadow and Tobias Beecher. When conjugal visits are allowed, Hill sleeps with his wife Annabella for the last time; as he is paraplegic, he has no sensation below his waist and cannot experience the pleasure received during sex. When Simon Adebisi asks why Hill even wants to have sex with his wife without sensation, he replies it is all for her. Despite being clean for almost two years, Hill started using again with the encouragement of his favorite NBA player, Jackson Vahue, after he arrives in Oz. After using one time and falling out with Vahue, he stops his habit again. Hill admires Eugene Dobbins, an inmate who has a gift for playing the cello. When Dobbins is harassed by Vahue for no apparent reason, Hill tells him stop and recognize the gift that Dobbins has. However, Vahue breaks into Father Ray Mukada's office and smashes Dobbins' instrument. When a prison riot erupts in Em City, Hill forces Vahue to tend to Dobbins after he is shanked by a black inmate. He hides with the rest of the prisoners as the SORT team recaptures the unit. =Season 2= Law school dean Alvah Case interviews Hill as part of his investigation into the riot. Hill is told that Dobbins has died. When Em City is reopened, he is angered when he is assigned with a prisoner group called the \\"Others\\" along with Rebadow, Beecher, and Agamemnon Busmalis instead of the Homeboys, the black gangsters in Oz. He is wary of rooming with Beecher, who recently bit off the tip of the penis of an Aryan inmate. When the judge from Hill's trial is sent to Oz for taking bribes while sentencing inmates, Hill asks black Muslim inmate Kareem Said to help get him freed. It is determined the judge had fairly sentenced Hill. Frustrated, he spends the rest of the season figuring out ways of escaping Oz. =Season 3= Inmate Malcolm Coyle confesses to Hill that he got away with murdering a family. Hill and Said inform Warden Leo Glynn, who contacts the district attorney. When the Homeboys plot to murder Hill, Said convinces Antonio Nappa, Carmen Guerra, and Vernon Schillinger to have their respective gangs aid the Muslims in protecting Hill. Nappa murders Coyle before his trial, deterring the Homeboys from taking any action. When Adebisi takes over the Homeboys, he stirs up racial tension in Oz to the point that inmates lose their pornographic magazines. After Adebisi gives Hill a confiscated magazine as a truce, corrections officer Sean Murphy has Hill thrown into solitary confinement. The tensions cause Glynn to lock down Oz. =Season 4= Part I After three weeks, Hill returns to Em City and rooms with Desmond Mobay. Unbeknownst to Hill, Mobay is an undercover detective named Johnny Basil who is investigating Oz's drug trade. In the visiting room, Hill thinks he recognizes Mobay's girlfriend, forcing Mobay to put a halt to their visits. Mobay begins abusing heroin and decides he has to kill a random inmate to get in the good graces of the Homeboys. Hill initially refuses to help Mobay, but is manipulated into doing so and watches as Desmond pushes inmate Bruno Goergen down an elevator shaft. Mobay also accidentally loses his accent one night, drawing Hill's suspicion. When Hill realizes the truth and confronts Mobay, he is beaten out of his wheelchair. Mobay turns himself in for killing Goergen. Part II The Homeboys are in disarray in the wake of Adebisi's death. Possible salvation appears when Redding comes to Oz and immediately takes control of the gang. Hill becomes more involved with the Homeboys as a result. The Italians and the Latinos plot to eliminate Redding, who intends on taking back power in the drug scene. Supreme Allah, whom Redding despises, is released from solitary and offered a third in the drug trade from the competing gangs. When Hill asks why Redding hates Allah, he learns that Allah gave up Hill's location to avoid prison and is culpable for his capture and paralysis. Furious, Hill attacks Allah and ends up hospitalized. In retaliation, Redding arranges for Allah to be killed, only for him to survive the attempt. Redding plans to eliminate the Italians and the Latinos, but Hill doesn't want violence and alerts Murphy of the plan. When Murphy breaks up the murder attempt, Redding casts Hill out of the gang. Meanwhile, Hill sabotages Vahue's parole, feeling he has shown no remorse. As the gang war within Oz escalates, Allah tries to ally himself with Hill for the purpose of using him to kill Redding. When Allah is set to kill Redding on his own, Hill obtains Allah's medical records and learns he is lethally allergic to eggs. With this information, Hill has the Homeboys mix Allah's food with a heavy concentration of eggs, resulting in his death in the cafeteria. Redding forgives Hill and allows him to rejoin the Homeboys. Hill respectfully declines, but keeps Redding's good will nonetheless. =Season 5= Hill is warned by his mother Eugenia that his wife plans to divorce him. Eugenia then dies when the visitor's bus crashes. Distraught by the bad news, Hill becomes a complete emotional wreck and begins using heroin. Under the influence, he forgets to clean his catheter and goes into kidney failure. McManus assumes Redding sold the heroin to Hill, but Redding denies any involvement and vows to bring down the men responsible. Arnold \\"Poet\\" Jackson, the inmate who sold the drugs, gets Busmalis to frame Italian inmate Salvatore DeSanto. Redding has Poet put a lethal amount of LSD in DeSanto's food. As he recovers, Hill refuses to give up Poet but exonerates the Italians. Poet next forces Busmalis to finger the Latinos, ending the alliance between them and the Homeboys. Hill is released after Redding and Latino leader Enrique Morales are sent to solitary for fighting. Redding has a long talk with Hill, stating that he is sorry for ever encouraging him to do or sell drugs in the first place. During this talk, the Latinos and Italians renew their alliance on the condition that the Italians kill Redding. Frank Urbano charges at Redding with a knife but is stopped by Hill, who dies defending his adoptive father. Hill's death puts Redding in complete disarray and motivates him to have the Homeboys drop out of the drug trade. =Murders committed= *Officer Lawrence Hudack - Shot by Hill, while trying to run away from the cops, after Hudack's death, police threw Hill off the roof, paralyzing him. *Supreme Allah - After Allah demands that Hill kill Redding, Hill ensures that eggs are put in Allah's food, triggering a severe allergic reaction, resulting in Allah's death.

Biography Robinson was born in Hardwick, Massachusetts. He moved with his family to Bennington, Vermont at the age of five. Robinson did not enter politics until he was about thirty years old, when his brother Moses Robinson became a successful politician. Jonathan Robinson was elected to the Vermont House of Representatives in 1789. A few years later he decided to study law and passed the bar exam in 1795. He was admitted to the bar in 1796. Immediately after, he became a judge of the Vermont probate court and the town clerk of Bennington. He was a probate judge until 1798. In 1801, Robinson was appointed to be the chief justice of the Vermont Supreme Court, and soon left his positions as state representative and town clerk. He remained the chief justice until 1807, when he gained a position in the United States Senate from Vermont, filling the unexpired term of Israel Smith, who had resigned. Robinson was a member of the Democratic-Republican Party. He was elected to a full term in the Senate in 1809 and remained a senator until 1815, when he retired after the end of his term. Robinson then served again as a probate judge from 1815 until his death four years later, and served for one more year in the Vermont House of Representatives in 1818. Family life Robinson married Mary Fassett Robinson and they had two children, Jonathan Edwards Robinson and Isaac Tichenor Robinson. Robinson's brother Moses Robinson served as governor during the Vermont Republic and helped steward Vermont's transition to U.S. statehood. His brother David Robinson was a major general in the Vermont Militia. Brother Samuel was a colonel in the militia and served as Speaker of the Vermont House of Representatives. Death Robinson died on November 3, 1819 in Bennington, Vermont. He is interred at the Old Bennington Cemetery in Bennington.

It was founded in 1987 by Daniel Katz, who serves as the Chair of the board of directors. Its main work is the provision of an environmental certification on sustainable forestry and agriculture and tourism. Its certificate seal gives information to consumers about business practices, based on certain standards they set. They are a product-oriented multistakeholder governance group combining the interests of companies, farmers, foresters, communities, and consumers to produce sustainable and harmonious goods and services.  Merger with UTZ  In June 2017, the Rainforest Alliance and UTZ announced the intention to merge, and in January 2018 the merger was legally closed and completed. The organizations merged in recognition of their similar work to address deforestation, climate change, systemic poverty, and social inequity. The merged organization, going by the name the Rainforest Alliance, points to the increased size and strength of their combined expertise to achieve a scale of impact necessary to meet these challenges effectively. The Rainforest Alliance's work continues in Latin America, Africa, and South and Southeast Asia. The new Rainforest Alliance plans to release a new certification standard in 2019, building upon the existing Rainforest Alliance Sustainable Agriculture Standard and the UTZ Certification Standard. The UTZ and Rainforest Alliance certification programs are running separately and in parallel until the publication of the new program in 2020. Additionally, releasing one standard will help the 182,000 cocoa, coffee, and tea farmers currently certified under both standards, avoiding a double administrative load of working with two standards and certification systems. The two certification programs will continue to operate in parallel, and farms will continue to be either Rainforest Alliance or UTZ certified until the release of the new standard in 2020. Rainforest Alliance programs A woman picks coffee on the slopes of the Rainforest Alliance Certified cooperative Ciudad Barrios in El Salvador. = Sustainable forestry certification = The Rainforest Alliance launched the world‚Äôs first sustainable forestry certification program in 1989 to encourage market-driven and environmentally and socially responsible management of forests, tree farms, and forest resources. As of October 1, 2018, the Rainforest Alliance transitioned its certification business, including all related services, personnel and clients, to Nature Economy and People Connected (NEPCon), a non- profit organization based in Copenhagen, Denmark, with a global network. NEPCon has been a member of the FSC¬© since 1996. = Sustainable agriculture certification = The Rainforest Alliance's sustainable agriculture program includes training programs for farmers and the certification of small, medium and large farms that produce more than 100 different crops, including avocado, cattle, cinnamon, coffee, palm oil, and potatoes, as well as tea, cocoa, and bananas. In recent years, the Rainforest Alliance has greatly expanded its work with smallholders, who now account for 75% of the farms (more than 783,000 farmers in all) certified by the organization. To obtain certification, farms must meet the Sustainable Agriculture Standard, which is designed to conserve ecosystems, protect biodiversity and waterways, conserve forests, reduce agrochemical use, and safeguard the well-being of workers and local communities. The Rainforest Alliance encourages businesses and consumers to support sustainable agriculture by sourcing or choosing products grown on certified farms. More than 7 million hectares of farmland‚Äîare being managed sustainably under Rainforest Alliance certification, as of 2018. Crop standards and criteria The organization requires that 50% of criteria under a certain principle (group of criteria) be achieved, and 80% overall. Several of these criteria are \\"critical\\" and must be complied with for a farm to earn certification. They include an ecosystem conservation program, protection of wild animals and waterways, the prohibition of discrimination in work and hiring practices, the prohibition of contracting children under the age of 15, the use of protective gear for workers, guidelines about agrochemical use and the prohibition of transgenic crops. Rainforest Alliance Certified Seal The Rainforest Alliance Certified seal appears only on products that meet the crop standards and criteria detailed above. According to Consumer Reports, \\"The Rainforest Alliance Certified label is clear and meaningful in support of sustainable agriculture, social responsibility and integrated pest management. The label is consistent in meaning among all certified. The label does not consist of farmers and none of the members are certified by the Rainforest Alliance. In this sense, the organizations behind these labels are independent from the products they certify.\\"Consumer Reports: Greener Choices (March 2008). \\"Resources: Eco- labels Center: Rainforest Alliance\\" Accessed March 24, 2008.

As of October 1, 2018, NEPCon assumed management of the Rainforest Alliance Sustainable Tourism Standards for Hotel and Lodging Services and Inbound Tour Operators. These standards include all elements of the Global Sustainable Tourism Council (GSTC) Criteria for Hotels and Tour Operators. Criticism and response =Minimum price issues= Rainforest Alliance sustainable agriculture certification, like the certification schemes UTZ Certified and organic, does not offer producers minimum or guaranteed price, therefore leaving them vulnerable to market price variations. For example, in the 1980s, a pound of standard-grade coffee sold for around US $1.20; in 2003, however, a pound sold for about $0.50, which was not enough to cover the costs of production in much of the world. The price of coffee has since rebounded somewhat, with prices for arabica reaching $1.18/pound by the end of 2007. Although many Rainforest Alliance Certified farms do in fact achieve price premiums for high-quality produce, Rainforest Alliance focuses on improving the entire spectrum of farming practices. Third-party studies have shown the organization‚Äôs approach to be effective in raising both income and net revenue for farmers. Michigan State University professor of sociology Daniel Jaffee has criticized Rainforest Alliance certification, claiming that its standards are \\"arguably far lower than fair trade's \\" and saying \\"they establish minimum housing and sanitary conditions but do not stipulate a minimum price for coffee. Critically, they require plantation owners only to pay laborers the national minimum wage, a notoriously inadequate standard.\\" The Economist favors the Rainforest Alliance's method and notes that \\"guaranteeing a minimum price [as Fairtrade does] means there is no incentive to improve quality.\\" They also note that coffee drinkers say \\"the quality of Fairtrade brews varies widely. The Rainforest Alliance does things differently. It does not guarantee a minimum price or offer a premium but provides training advice. That consumers are often willing to pay more for a product with the [Rainforest Alliance] logo on it is an added bonus, not the result of a formal subsidy scheme; such products must still fend for themselves in the marketplace.\\" =Use of seal= The organization certification has been criticized for allowing the use of the seal on products containing a minimum of 30% of certified content. According to Michael Conroy, former chairman of the board for Fair Trade USA, this use of the seal is the \\"most damaging dimension\\" of Rainforest Alliance's agricultural certification program and \\"a serious blow to the integrity of certification\\". = Lawsuit filed against Rainforest Alliance = An article in The Guardian reported that the US nonprofit Water and Sanitation Health (WASH) filed a lawsuit against Rainforest Alliance in 2014 alleging that Rainforest Alliance was responsible for unfair marketing because it certified Chiquita banana suppliers as sustainable when they were \\"contaminating drinking water with fertilizers and fungicides and have air-dropped pesticides perilously close to schools and homes\\" in Guatemala, raising the issue that Rainforest Alliance was facilitating greenwashing by companies making environmental claims. In the same article Rainforest Alliance called WASH‚Äôs allegations untrue and said it stands by its auditing practices and also objected to the lawsuit‚Äôs charges that the alliance sells its endorsement. The nonprofit Truth in Advertising also reported that WASH was suing Rainforest Alliance for allegedly misrepresenting how earth-friendly its certified products actually are. = Costa Rican pineapples = A report in 2020 by The Guardian alleged that some Costa Rica pineapple growers certified by the scheme were exploiting their labour force, using illegal agrochemicals, and concealing hundreds of undocumented workers from auditors. The Rainforest Alliance said all its certified plantations were required to comply with strict audits and inspections; but the report quoted the president of Fecon, a Costa Rican environmental group, as saying that audits were insufficiently rigorous to reveal violations.

Although there are many routes to accomplish this oxidation, the most common and direct processes use a high-oxidation-state transition metal (typically osmium or manganese). The metal is often used as a catalyst, with some other stoichiometric oxidant present. In addition, other transition metals and non-transition metal methods have been developed and used to catalyze the reaction. center Mechanism right In the dihydroxylation mechanism, a ligand first coordinates to the metal catalyst (depicted as osmium), which dictates the chiral selectivity of the olefin. The alkene then coordinates to the metal through a [3+2] cycloaddition, and the ligand dissociates from the metal catalyst. Hydrolysis of the olefin then yields the vicinal diol, and oxidation of the catalyst by a stoichiometric oxidant regenerates the metal catalyst to repeat the cycle. The concentration of the olefin is crucial to the enantiomeric excess of the diol since higher concentrations of the alkene can associate with the other catalytic site to produce the other enantiomer. Osmium catalyzed reactions Osmium tetroxide (OsO4) is a popular oxidant used in the dihydroxylation of alkenes because of its reliability and efficiency with producing syn-diols. Since it is expensive and toxic, catalytic amounts of OsO4 are used in conjunction with a stoichiometric oxidizing agent. The Milas hydroxylation, Upjohn dihydroxylation, and Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation reactions all use osmium as the catalyst as well as varying secondary oxidizing agents. = Milas = The Milas dihydroxylation was introduced in 1930, and uses hydrogen peroxide as the stoichiometric oxidizing agent. Although the method can produce diols, overoxidation to the dicarbonyl compound has led to difficulties isolating the vicinal diol. Therefore, the Milas protocol has been replaced by the Upjohn and Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation. =Upjohn= Upjohn dihydroxylation was reported in 1973 and uses OsO4 as the active catalyst in the dihydroxylation procedure. It also employs N-Methylmorpholine N-oxide (NMO) as the stoichiometric oxidant to regenerate the osmium catalyst, allowing for catalytic amounts of osmium to be used. The Upjohn protocol yields high conversions to the vicinal diol and tolerates many substrates. However, the protocol cannot dihydroxylate tetrasubstituted alkenes. The Upjohn conditions can be used for synthesizing anti-diols from allylic alcohols, as demonstrated by Kishi and coworkers. =Sharpless asymmetric= The Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation was developed by K. Barry Sharpless to use catalytic amounts of OsO4 along with the stoichiometric oxidant K3[Fe(CN)6]. The reaction is performed in the presence of a chiral auxiliary. The selection of dihydroquinidine (DHQD) or dihydroquinine (DHQ) as a chiral auxiliary dictates the facial selectivity of the olefin, since the absolute configuration of the ligands are opposite. The catalyst, oxidant, and chiral auxiliary can be purchased premixed for selective dihydroxylation. AD- mix-Œ± contains the chiral auxiliary (DHQ)2PHAL, which positions OsO4 on the alpha-face of the olefin; AD-mix-Œ≤ contains (DHQD)2PHAL and delivers hydroxyl groups to the beta-face. The Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation has a large scope for substrate selectivity by changing the chiral auxiliary class. center right =Other variants= As mentioned above, the ability to synthesize anti- diols from allylic alcohols can be achieved with the use of NMO as a stoichiometric oxidant. The use of tetramethylenediamine (TMEDA) as a ligand produced syn-diols with a favorable diastereomeric ratio compared to Kishi‚Äôs protocol; however, stoichiometric osmium is employed. Syn-selectivity is due to the hydrogen bond donor ability of the allylic alcohol and the acceptor ability of the diamine. This has since been applied to homoallylic systems. Other dihydroxylation methods Since osmium tetroxide is expensive and toxic, other metals have been used to prepare vicinal diols from olefins. Another popular metal used in dihydroxylation is ruthenium. Although it is highly oxidative, ruthenium has been used because of its short reaction time and its cost-effectiveness. Typically, the ruthenium tetroxide is created in situ from ruthenium trichloride, and a secondary oxidant NaIO4 is used to regenerate the catalyst. The turnover-limiting step of the reaction is the hydrolysis step; therefore, sulfuric acid is added to increase the rate of this step. Manganese is also used in dihydroxylation and is often chosen when osmium tetroxide methods yield poor results. Similar to ruthenium, the oxidation potential of manganese is high, leading to over-oxidation of substrates. Potassium permanganate is often used as the oxidant for dihydroxylation; however, due to its poor solubility in organic solvent, a phase-transfer catalyst (such as benzyltriethylammonium chloride, TEBACl) is also added to increase the number of substrates for dihydroxylation. =Pr√©vost and Woodward dihydroxylation= center Unlike the other methods described that use transition metals as catalyst, the Pr√©vost and Woodward methods use iodine and a silver salt. However, the addition of water into the reaction directs the cis- and trans- addition of the hydroxyl groups. The Pr√©vost reaction typically uses silver benzoate to produce trans-diols; the Woodward modification of the Pr√©vost reaction uses silver acetate to produce cis-diols. In both the Pr√©vost and Woodward reactions, iodine is first added to the alkene producing a cyclic iodinium ion. The anion from the corresponding silver salt is then added by nucleophilic substitution to the iodinium ion. center In the Pr√©vost reaction, the iodinium ion undergoes nucleophilic attack by benzoate anion. The benzoate anion acts as a nucleophile again to displace iodide through a neighboring-group participation mechanism. A second benzoate anion reacts with the intermediate to produce the anti-substituted dibenzoate product, which can then undergo hydrolysis to yield trans-diols. center The Woodward modification of the Pr√©vost reaction yields cis-diols. Acetate anion reacts with the cyclic iodinium ion to yield an oxonium ion intermediate. This can then readily react with water to give the monoacetate, which can then be hydrolyzed to give a cis-diol center To eliminate the need for silver salts, Sudalai and coworkers modified the Pr√©vost-Woodward reaction; the reaction is catalyzed with LiBr, and uses NaIO4 and PhI(OAc)2 as oxidants. LiBr reacts with NaIO4 and acetic acid to produce lithium acetate, which can then proceed through the reaction as previously mentioned. The protocol produced high dr for the corresponding diol, depending on the oxidant chosen. center Applications The synthesis of highly substituted and stereospecific sugars is important since polysaccharides make up a large class of compounds found in nature. One specific example is in the biologically active molecule kakelokelose, which has been shown to have anti- HIV activity. Research conducted by Harris et al. have worked on an enantiospecific synthesis of sugars pertaining to kakelokelose and other sugars, employing many different dihydroxylation reactions with osmium catalyst. Vinylfuran was reacted under Sharpless conditions with AD-mix-Œ± to yield (R)-diol. Later, a resulting dihydropyran was reacted under Upjohn conditions to yield the resulting sugar, mannose (where R represents either H or a protecting group). center Additionally, talose and gulose were also synthesized from a different dihydropyran. Since the compound contains an allylic alcohol, Upjohn conditions and the Upjohn modification using TMEDA as the secondary oxidant to create the resulting sugars (where R represents either H or a protecting group). center Another application of dihydroxylation methods is in the synthesis of steroids. Brassinosteroids are a class of steroids shown to regulate plant growth and has been shown to have agricultural activity as an insecticide. This class of steroids contains the standard framework of steroids in addition to four vicinal diols that have their own stereochemistry. Brosa installed the hydroxyl groups in the steroid using both Woodward conditions to yield a cis-diol to the A ring of the steroid. Then, the alkene chain on the D ring was dihydroxylated to yield the second cis-diol using OsO4 and NMO as the stoichiometric oxidant. center References Category:Chemical processes Category:Alkenes Category:Diols ","title":"Dihydroxylation"},{"id":"3024814","text":"Jason Andrew Narvy (born March 27, 1974) is an American actor known for playing the role of Eugene \\"Skull\\" Skullovitch on the various iterations of Power Rangers and film franchise from 1993 to 2012, beginning with Mighty Morphin Power Rangers in 1993.

Moore is a neighborhood in the North Philadelphia section of the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. The district is loosely arranged around the main campus of Temple University. The neighborhood has gentrified due to an influx of Temple students during the past several years. The controversial term ‚ÄúTempletown‚Äù was coined by former Temple president Peter J. Liacouras, but has only recently come into wide use after a real estate development company adopted the name. \\"Cecil B. Moore\\" Avenue also refers to the street running parallel to Oxford and Montgomery, intersecting with N. Broad Street. Demographics The neighborhood consists of 17,012 males and 20,277 females. The median age is 25.49. The population has increased 6.7% from 2000 to 2014 and 1.1% from 2010 to 2014 to reach a total population of 37,289 in 2014. Boundaries and population Cecil B. Moore shopping district, with Philadelphia skyline in the background The Cecil B. Moore neighborhood loosely extends from 6th street to the east, York street to the north, 17th street to the west, and Girard avenue to the south. The majority of its native residents are African Americans and Puerto Ricans, although Temple students of all races are a growing presence, with many living off campus and in the Cecil B. Moore community. Recently the renaissance of Progress Plaza shopping center can mainly be attributed to the economic impact of students within these borders, furthering Temple's expansion further south down broad street towards Center City. Furthermore, the purchase of the closed-down William Penn High School by the university, after redevelopment, will extend the footprint even further down Broad street towards Girard. History The region was named after Cecil Bassett Moore (April 2, 1915 - February 13, 1979) who was a Philadelphia lawyer, activists in the Civil Rights Movement who led the fight to integrate Girard College, president of the local NAACP, and member of Philadelphia's City Council. Moore is best remembered for leading a picket against Girard College which led to the desegregation of that school. He was also a champion of a wide range of causes central to the Civil Rights Movement, including integration of schools and trade unions, and increased political and economic representation for poor African-Americans. He has been credited with helping to restore order after the unsettling vandalism and violence of the racially charged Columbia Avenue riot of 1964. During his tenure, membership in the local NAACP chapter expanded from 7,000 in 1962 to more than 50,000 within a few years. =Templetown naming controversy = The Templetown nickname was widely used due to the influence of Temple University. The name, however, was not approved by either Temple University or its surrounding community. In October 2014 the Templetown name began to experience backlash from longtime local residents that became disgruntled due to 60 years of economic stagnation along the Cecil B. Moore corridor. The complaints were strong enough that Google removed the name in favor of the Cecil B. Moore name.

History For eight years after the first non- stop heavier than air Atlantic crossing by a British Vickers Vimy in 1919, there were no further such flights. Then, in 1927, three crossings were made by American flyers, the America's being the third after Lindbergh's first solo crossing in the Spirit of St. Louis flight and Clarence Chamberlin's Columbia flight from New York to Berlin. All three were aspiring to win the Orteig Prize. It was also the first aircraft to carry official airmail across the Atlantic. The America was destroyed after it was ditched near the French village of Ver-sur-Mer after having flown to Paris but unable to land due to fog. Distance covered was about 3,800 miles not counting the time and distance spent at Paris waiting in vain for the fog to clear. After it was towed ashore, it was torn apart by souvenir hunters. Portions of the aircraft reside in several museums in Europe and in the United States. The America is a subject of the America/Goldbeach Museum, located in Ver-sur-Mer.

He is one of only nine regular characters (both prisoners and guards) to survive the entire run of the show. The others are Bob Rebadow, Ryan O'Reily, Miguel Alvarez, Arnold \\"Poet\\" Jackson, Sister Peter Marie Reimondo, Tim McManus and Dr. Gloria Nathan. Character overview Beecher, a successful attorney and family man, is an alcoholic who hits and kills a nine-year-old girl while driving drunk. He is offered a plea bargain that would have allowed him to serve his sentence in a minimum security prison, but Beecher, not wanting to do any time at all, instead goes to trial seeking an acquittal. The effort fails and the judge, a family friend of the Beechers, decides to make an example of him and sentences him to 15 years in the Oswald Maximum Security Penitentiary (\\"Oz\\") with a chance for parole after four. Beecher's personal transformation forms a major part of the show's drama. Arriving in Oz without any street skills and having a naturally timid personality, he becomes an easy target for abuse and is hardened by his experiences. He later remarks that, in Oz, he \\"became the man he always was and never knew\\". Despite having done terrible things while in Oz, Beecher often tries to atone. =Season 1= Beecher quickly learns that he is out of his element when he witnesses fellow arrival Miguel Alvarez (Kirk Acevedo) getting shanked right before entering Cell Block E, or \\"Emerald City.\\" He is roomed with monstrous inmate Simon Adebisi (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) during his first week in the titular facility. Approaching him in friendship, inmate Vernon Schillinger (J.K. Simmons) offers to be his new cellmate. Beecher, completely unaware that Schillinger is the leader of the Aryan Brotherhood, naively accepts the offer, only to be \\"initiated\\" into prison life when Schillinger rapes him and burns a swastika onto his right buttock. Beecher is routinely abused as the Brotherhood's sex slave, or \\"prag\\". In attempting to deal with the trauma, Beecher starts using heroin and develops an addiction. This is quickly noticed by prison psychologist Sister Peter Marie Reimondo (Rita Moreno), who arranges for Beecher to attend group drug counseling. In preparation for a prison talent show, Schillinger has Beecher get a \\"makeover\\" from one of Em City's drag queens. At the show, Beecher sings a rendition of \\"I Got It Bad (and That Ain't Good)\\" while dressed in women's clothing and makeup. Among other tortures, Schillinger makes Beecher beg to have sex with his wife before a conjugal visit, forces him to eat pages of a law book, polish Schillinger's boots with his tongue, and orders him to tear up pictures of his family. In an attempt to reach him, Sister Pete arranges for Beecher to meet with the mother of his DUI victim. Beecher is too ashamed to speak, however, and the girl's mother angrily lashes out at him. Eventually, Schillinger tires of Beecher and forces him to leave the cell wearing a Confederate Flag t-shirt. Beecher, fearing he will be killed by a black inmate, goes to Irish-American inmate Ryan O'Reily (Dean Winters), who provides him with PCP. Beecher then seeks out Schillinger, smashes the acrylic glass wall of his cell, and sends a broken shard flying into his eye. Beecher almost commits suicide immediately afterward, but is restrained by guards and put in solitary confinement. After being released, he confronts Schillinger in the prison gym's basketball court. He assaults Schillinger, ties him down, then defecates upon him in front of other inmates. This earns him respect from inmates such as O'Reily, Alvarez, and even Adebisi. When a riot erupts in Em City, Beecher sides with O'Reily in the chaos, defending him from an attack by the Muslims, as neither belongs to any strong gangs. =Season 2= Beecher shares a cell with James Robson (R.E. Rodgers), an Aryan who tries to make Beecher perform oral sex on him. Beecher bites off the tip of Robson's penis, landing him in solitary. There, he is interviewed by Alvah Case (Charles S. Dutton), who is investigating the riot. Upon his release from isolation, Beecher threatens to manipulate Sister Pete's psychiatric reports to ruin Schillinger's chances at parole. Frightened, Schillinger tries to put a hit on Beecher. He resorts to blackmailing corrections officer Diane Whittlesey (Edie Falco) with knowledge that she had shot prisoner Scott Ross (Steven Gavedon) during the riot. Whittlesey reluctantly agrees to the hit if Schillinger will keep quiet. Beecher disappears and Schillinger subsequently meets with Whittlesey to see his dead body. Whittlesey reveals that she recorded their conversation. Schillinger is arrested for conspiracy to commit murder, lengthening his sentence. Despite Beecher's celebratory mood, his new cellmate, Augustus Hill (Harold Perrineau), warns him that Schillinger will be out for revenge. Unit Manager Tim McManus (Terry Kinney) also forces Beecher to confront the judge who sentenced him; she expresses remorse for her ruling and apologizes to him. Beecher responds that she was right in her ruling, but adds that he can't forgive her. After Hill is transferred to a different cell, Beecher is paired with Chris Keller (Chris Meloni), a charming sociopath. Later, Beecher receives word that his wife has killed herself; Schillinger brags that the Aryans actually killed her and staged the death as a suicide. Beecher gradually finds he is attracted to Keller, only to learn that Keller is working with Schillinger. After driving Beecher to start drinking again, the two corner him with the help of an Aryan guard, Karl Metzger (Bill Fagerbakke), and break his arms and legs. =Season 3= Keller discovers that he has genuinely fallen in love with Beecher, and is desperate to win back his trust. However, Beecher refuses to forgive him. Beecher then kills Metzger by sharpening his fingernails and slashing his throat. Later, Beecher stabs Keller shortly after his release from the infirmary. When Schillinger's son Andy (Frederick Koehler) is sent to Oz, Beecher befriends the young man and arranges to share a cell with him. While Beecher does not mistreat Andy, he leads Schillinger to believe that he is going to sleep with him. Moved by Beecher's kindness, Andy renounces his father and his white supremacist ideology. Schillinger arranges to have his own son killed, having him thrown in solitary and getting a prison guard to deliver heroin on which he overdoses. Beecher feels guilty for his part in Andy's death and, following advice from Muslim leader Kareem Sa√Ød (Eamonn Walker), resolves to ask forgiveness from Keller and Schillinger. Beecher finally forgives Keller after saving him from Schillinger's attack and the two reunite as lovers. =Season 4= Part I Beecher tries to bury the hatchet with Schillinger further by having a private investigator at his father's law firm search for his younger son Hank (Andrew Barchilon). However, Schillinger thinks Beecher is trying to turn Hank against him and orders his son to kidnap Beecher's children. Hank severs the hand of Beecher's son and mails it to him in Oz. Hank kills Beecher's son before ultimately releasing his daughter. Schillinger also pays another prisoner to tell Beecher that Keller is responsible for the kidnapping. Enraged, Beecher tries to kill Keller. When Beecher learns the truth, he tries to apologize to Keller, but Keller casts him aside. Upon learning that Hank has been acquitted due to a legal technicality, he approaches Chucky Pancamo (Chuck Zito) in order to commission a hit. Beecher has second thoughts and tries to cancel the hit, only to learn that Hank is already dead. Part II When Schillinger learns of Hank's death, he plots revenge ‚Äî all chance of which is lost after Keller falsely confesses to having hired the hitman. Keller does so to make himself Schillinger's target instead of Beecher, and is transferred to Massachusetts not long afterwards. Beecher and Schillinger then are involved in a victim-attacker interaction program led by Sister Pete, who is trying to help Beecher fight his inner conflicts. With Keller in Massachusetts for confessing to Hank's murder, Beecher is up for parole and falls in love with his attorney, Katherine McClain (Sandra Purpuro). McClain does what she can for Beecher, but he is denied parole. Later that day in the library, Schillinger and Robson come by to taunt Beecher. Before they can harm him, Sa√Ød appears and stabs them both. =Season 5= Fearing a war between the Aryans and Muslims, Sister Pete suggests Beecher act as a mediator between Schillinger and Sa√Ød. In the first mediation, Beecher says that Sa√Ød and Schillinger are very alike despite drastic differences in beliefs. Pancamo informs Beecher that Agent Pierce Taylor (Robert John Burke) has implicated him in Hank's murder, and will likely inform Schillinger that Pancamo arranged the hit of his son. Shortly after, Keller is transferred back to Oz and, now suspected of a series of murders, is isolated from the general population and Beecher. During another mediation in which homosexuality is discussed, Beecher attacks Schillinger when he denies ever raping him. Afterwards, convicted rapists Franklin Winthrop (Andy Powers) and Adam Guenzel (Mike Doyle) arrive in Oz, the latter being a friend of Beecher's family. Beecher, fearing for Guenzel's safety, recruits the Italians to protect him. Schillinger forces Winthrop, now a sex slave for the Aryans, to tell the homophobic Guenzel about Beecher's past relationships with men and spread false rumors about the pair. Schillinger offers to let Beecher reunite with Keller if he convinces McManus to transfer Guenzel to a cell block where the Italians won't protect him. Beecher initially refuses, but gives in when Guenzel assaults and humiliates Beecher. Beecher later finds a bloodied Guenzel in the gym following his gang rape by the Aryans. Sa√Ød counsels a guilt-stricken Beecher to give up his relationship with Keller and help Guenzel any way he can. Beecher asks Sister Pete to talk to Guenzel and Schillinger; afraid that Guenzel will eventually inform on the Aryans, Schillinger arranges for Guenzel to die during a staged escape attempt. Beecher tells the authorities about Schillinger's rapes of Winthrop and Guenzel and his involvement with Guenzel's death. Warden Leo Glynn (Ernie Hudson) moves Schillinger to solitary. Beecher sees Keller, who has just been found guilty of murder, and the two share an intimate kiss. =Season 6= Beecher is transferred to a safer unit, as McManus sees that he is being targeted by the Aryans for testifying against Schillinger. Beecher's father, Harrison (Edward Herrmann), appeals Keller's death sentence until Winthrop kills him to join the Aryans. Beecher is paroled, inherits his father's law firm, and gets Keller's sentence overturned. However, Beecher is sent back to prison after a lonely Keller arranges for him to get caught buying drugs. Upon returning to Oz, Beecher severs ties with Keller. In an attempt to make Beecher forgive him, Keller switches a prop knife for a real one before a prison production of Macbeth, resulting in Schillinger's death when Beecher stabs him. When Beecher rejects Keller for the final time, Keller throws himself backwards over a railing while screaming \\"Beecher, DON'T!\\", both committing suicide and implicating Beecher as his killer. At the end of the series, Beecher awaits trial for Keller's death.

He was a third-generation Georgia Bulldogs football player. After serving two seasons as a graduate assistant at Wake Forest, in January 2012, Tereshinski was hired as the inside receivers coach at Charlotte. Playing career =High school career= Tereshinski attended Athens Academy, a private school in Georgia, where he led the Spartans for his sophomore, junior, and senior seasons. Tereshinski threw for 2,100 yards and 17 touchdowns in his senior year at Athens (Georgia) Academy in 2001, and was heavily recruited by Harvard University. =College career= 2005 season Tereshinski played in six games during UGA's 2005 season. He played the entire game against the University of Florida Gators, which the Bulldogs narrowly lost. Tereshinski completed 8 of 21 passes for 100 yards, with an interception, and he scored Georgia's only touchdown in the 14‚Äì10 defeat, catching a touchdown pass from tailback Thomas Brown. Starter D.J. Shockley returned the following week from an MCL sprain, and Tereshinski was not seen again until Georgia's SEC Eastern Division-clinching win over the University of Kentucky Wildcats, in which he threw his first career touchdown pass, a 27-yarder to A.J. Bryant. 2006 Season Tereshinski was the starting quarterback until injuring his ankle in the second game of the season. He was replaced by freshman Matthew Stafford. After the 5th game of the season, Georgia coach Mark Richt said that Tereshinski's ankle had healed and that he would again be the starting quarterback for Georgia's 6th game, against the Tennessee Volunteers. Georgia's Tereshinski led offense had a considerable lead going into halftime, but after a disastrous second half, Georgia suffered a 51-33 loss to Tennessee. Tereshinski started again the next week, against the Vanderbilt Commodores, and the entire Georgia offense was once again lackluster in a 24-22 loss. After the game, Richt benched Tereshinski in favor of Stafford. Coaching career After graduating in 2007, Tereshinski embarked on a career as a consultant in the finance industry in Atlanta. In 2010, he enrolled at Wake Forest University to serve as a graduate assistant under defensive coordinator Brad Lambert. In 2011, he was promoted to tight ends coach. On January 4, 2012, Tereshinski accepted the receivers coaching position at Charlotte also under Brad Lambert.

It is O'Flaherty's first published work of fiction, published in a small London- based socialist weekly The New Leader (12 January 1923) while the war it depicted was still ongoing. The favorable notice it generated helped get other works by O'Flaherty published, and started his career. It is widely read today in secondary schools of many English-speaking countries, owing to its being easy to read, its short length, and its having a notable surprise ending. Summary There is heavy fighting taking place in Dublin, Ireland. A Republican sniper is sitting on a rooftop, eating a sandwich and drinking a bottle of whiskey. Despite knowing it is dangerous, he decides to smoke a cigarette and instantly a bullet hits the roof. An armored car of the Irish Free State forces arrives, and an old woman steps out of the darkness and points out the sniper's position to the soldier in the car. The sniper shoots both the woman and the man in the car. Immediately he is hit by the enemy sniper in the right arm. The sniper applies a dressing, though in great pain, and prone in position for some time. He decides he has to escape from the roof before morning. He is no longer able to hold his rifle; hence, he tricks the enemy sniper into shooting his cap, which he places over the rifle. He lets the cap fall into the street, drops his rifle, and lets his left hand hang over the edge of the roof, giving the impression that he has been shot dead. The enemy sniper then stands up clearly, only to be shot instantly by the Republican sniper with a revolver. The dying man falls over the roof and hits the ground. Weakened and disgusted, the protagonist moves down to the street, curious to find out whom he had killed. The sniper darts across the street. A machine gun tears up the ground around him with a hail of bullets, but he escapes. He throws himself face downward beside the corpse. The machine gun stops.

K. Simmons on the HBO series Oz. TV Guide included him in their 2013 list of The 60 Nastiest Villains of All TimeBretts, Bruce; Roush, Matt; (March 25, 2013). \\"Baddies to the Bone: The 60 nastiest villains of all time\\", TV Guide. pp. 14 - 15. and the Rolling Stone has ranked him #22 of the \\"40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time\\". Schillinger is one of the most powerful and feared inmates in Oswald Maximum Security Penitentiary (\\"Oz\\"). As leader of Oz's Aryan Brotherhood, Schillinger controls most white inmates and has a reputation for ruthless brutality and rape. He is shown to be a high-ranking member of the Brotherhood outside of prison, thus giving him power outside of Oz through a vast network of allies. Character overview Schillinger is the head of the Aryan Brotherhood inside the Oswald Maximum Security Penitentiary (\\"Oz\\"). An ardent racist, he is serving an eight-year sentence for aggravated assault for beating up a black drug dealer with a crowbar for selling drugs to his sons. He indulges in varying degrees of sexual sadism, especially toward fellow inmate Tobias Beecher, whom he rapes to \\"initiate\\" him into prison life. In addition to Beecher, Schillinger commits several acts of rape over the series against weaker white inmates; ironically, he is virulently homophobic. He is also quick to have the Brotherhood kill other inmates to prove that the Aryans are a legitimate threat to the rest of Oz's inmate population. Throughout the series, Schillinger has a number of major family issues: his father, whom he hates, taught him everything he knows about white supremacist ideology; his sons are both amoral drug addicts; he has disowned his sister for marrying a Jew, and his daughter-in-law is a prostitute. Many of his underlings are imprisoned for hate crimes and readily affiliate themselves with his group. Despite his status as a leader, he seeks approval from his superiors such as former mentor Wilson Loewen, who views him as having \\"a big ego and no balls to back it up.\\" Schillinger strongly objects to his name being mispronounced, averring that it should be pronounced with a hard \\"G\\" sound (\\"Schilling - ur\\"), not a soft \\"G\\" sound (\\"Schillin - jur\\"). Few characters throughout the show's run actually pronounce it properly. =Season 1= Schillinger is among the inmates in the specialized Cell Block E, or \\"Emerald City.\\" After Tobias Beecher is threatened by his larger black cellmate, Simon Adebisi, the initially harmless-looking Schillinger offers to let him move into his \\"pod.\\" Beecher naively accepts the offer, unaware that Schillinger is a prison rapist who intends to turn Beecher into a sex slave, or \\"prag.\\" As a result, Schillinger rapes Beecher once he is inside the pod and burns a swastika on his right buttock. Schillinger subjects Beecher to a series of rapes and humiliations, most notably forcing him to perform in drag for a prison talent show. To cope with the constant trauma, Beecher begins using drugs, much to Schillinger's disgust. Schillinger forces Beecher to wear a T-shirt bearing a Confederate Flag in hopes that he will be killed by black inmates. However, after taking some PCP, Beecher flies into a rage and throws a chair at Schillinger, shattering a window in Schillinger's pod and temporarily blinding him in one eye. After Unit Manager Tim McManus transfers Schillinger to the prison's general population, he threatens Beecher in the gym. Beecher reacts fiercely, beating Schillinger unconscious with free weights before defecating on his face in front of other inmates. Schillinger realizes how vulnerable he is and tells McManus how badly he wants to be paroled in his upcoming review. McManus reluctantly allows him to move back into Emerald City. Throughout this season, Schillinger is wary of the high-profile leader of the Muslim prisoners, Kareem Sa√Ød, because of his ability to gain access to and sometimes influence McManus and other prison officials. He fears that Sa√Ød could mobilize the black inmates in a takeover of the prison. These fears prove true when a prison riot breaks out in Emerald City, during which Schillinger lies low, allowing biker inmate Scott Ross to command his Aryan troops. During the riot, Schillinger sees correctional officer Diane Whittlesey murder Ross after the SORT team supplies her with a gun. =Season 2= When law school dean Alvah Case investigates the riot, he offers Schillinger a letter of recommendation for parole. Despite this, Schillinger uses his knowledge of Ross' killing to blackmail Whittlesey. After Emerald City is reopened, Beecher begins taunting and threatening Schillinger in the hopes of ruining his chance at parole. Schillinger goes to various inmates and attempts to hire one of them to kill Beecher, but they all mock Schillinger for being too weak to do his own dirty work. Beecher learns of Schillinger's actions and, with the help of Whittlesey and McManus, gets Schillinger's parole hearing canceled and his sentence extended by ten years for plotting to kill him. Schillinger is moved out of Emerald City permanently. In gen pop, Schillinger is then brutally attacked by black inmates. He and a fellow Aryan, Mark Mack, decide to randomly kill a non-white inmate to win back respect for the Brotherhood, targeting Jewish inmate Alexander Vogel. Warden Leo Glynn cannot find any evidence to conclusively nab the Aryans, who are not prosecuted for the murder. As a result, the Aryans are once again feared in Oz and Schillinger renews his plan for revenge against Beecher. He employs Chris Keller, a bisexual serial killer who once served time with him in another prison, to play a sick mind game on Beecher to break him down. As the plan goes forward, Beecher is informed of his wife's apparent suicide, and Schillinger tauntingly implies that he actually arranged her murder. Cyril O'Reily, the intellectually disabled brother of Irish inmate Ryan O'Reily, arrives in Oz and is put on Schillinger's cell block. Schillinger promises to take Cyril to see his brother in Emerald City, but instead orchestrates his gang rape by the Aryans. When Ryan realizes what has happened, he orders Cyril to assault him so he can be sent to solitary confinement, isolated but safely away from Schillinger. After his release, Cyril suffers terrible flashbacks and nightmares about the gang rape. Meanwhile, Keller seduces Beecher and gets him to relapse into alcoholism. Schillinger, Keller, and Aryan Brotherhood prison guard Karl Metzger ambush Beecher, revealing Schillinger's revenge plan and breaking his arms and legs. =Season 3= When Augustus Hill testifies against Malcolm Coyle for murdering an innocent family, Sa√Ød asks Schillinger, among other inmates, to help protect him. Schillinger agrees because he also is a family man and respects the fact that one member of the family died while serving in Vietnam. CO Sean Murphy starts a boxing tournament in Emerald City, to which Robson agrees to compete for the Aryans. Schillinger taunts Cyril about the gang rape before he fights Robson, but Ryan pours chloral hydrate in Robson's water, thus allowing his brother to win the match. The Aryans leave Cyril alone. Schillinger's son Andrew arrives in Oz for his part in the lynching of a black man. Schillinger, upset that Andrew is a heroin addict, tells the Brotherhood to ignore his son until he is clean. Ryan, Keller, and Beecher devise a plan to turn father and son against each other. Beecher befriends Andrew as he helps get him off drugs, angering Schillinger. When he confronts his son, Andrew rejects his father's ideology. Feeling that Andrew has betrayed him, Schillinger arranges for his own son to die of a drug overdose in solitary, having CO Len Lopresti, a Brotherhood sympathizer, secretly provide Andrew with a highly potent package of heroin. Beecher, after counseling from Sa√Ød, tells Schillinger that Andrew's death was a setup. Schillinger attacks Beecher, who is now protected by Keller and the Muslims. Schillinger and Beecher both end up in the hospital ward as a result of mutual stab wounds. When Schillinger is discharged, he realizes that Adebisi is plotting something against the white inmates. He asks all the other whites, including Beecher and Keller, to form a bond of solidarity ‚Äî albeit only a temporary, opportunistic one ‚Äî to prevent the blacks from taking over the entire prison. As another race riot is brewing, Glynn locks down the prison. =Season 4= When Schillinger's younger son Hank visits him in prison, Schillinger pays him to kidnap Beecher's kids as revenge for what happened to Andrew. Schillinger then pays Jewish inmate Eli Zabitz to help frame Keller for the kidnapping, turning the two against each other. He then has Hank remove the hand of Beecher's son Gary and ship it to Oz. Gary is then killed by Hank. Father Ray Mukada asks Schillinger to give up Beecher's daughter. Hank returns Holly and is arrested by the FBI. Despite Schillinger's concerns about being given up on an interrogation, Hank is freed from the murder charges on a legal technicality. Unbeknownst to Schillinger, however, Beecher hires the Italians to murder Hank. Hank's wife, Carrie, informs Schillinger that he is going to become a grandfather. Reverend Jeremiah Cloutier helps Schillinger let go of his previous unhappiness and to focus on the birth of his grandchild. Schillinger then asks Sister Peter Marie to be involved in the interaction sessions, much to Beecher's surprise. During the session, however, Schillinger is taken to Glynn's office and told that Hank's body has been found in Massachusetts. Convinced Beecher is behind his son's death, he enlists Robson to kill his old foe. However, Keller takes the blame. A black pimp, Curtis Bennett, comes to Oz and tells Schillinger that Hank allowed him to pimp out Carrie, whose clients included black men. Furious, Schillinger forces Carrie to get a paternity test. Mukada suspects Schillinger was the father of Shirley Bellinger's miscarried baby; Schillinger denies this but admits to being attracted to Bellinger. Before Robson is put on trial for murder, Schillinger sends the only witness a disturbing letter that drives him to kill himself. Schillinger also warns Cloutier not to cross the Brotherhood again, but lets him go unharmed. Sa√Ød savagely attacks and beats Robson, forcing Warden Glynn to consider putting Oz on lockdown. Schillinger agrees to a truce between the Muslims and the Aryans. Schillinger tries to use the Aryans and Bikers to sabotage Beecher's chances for parole, leading to a warning from Sa√Ød. When Beecher's parole is denied, Schillinger attempts to rape him, but Sa√Ød stabs and nearly kills both him and Robson. =Season 5= Carrie proves that her baby belongs to Hank, but is killed in a bus accident on the way to Oz. The baby survives and is sent to live with Carrie's parents in Montana. Sister Pete averts an Aryan‚ÄìMuslim war by arranging mediation sessions between Beecher, Sa√Ød, and Schillinger. In one session Beecher admits to abusing alcohol and heroin, Sa√Ød admits to previously using heroin and crack cocaine while Schillinger proudly admits to never using drugs. When discussing homosexuality, Schillinger and Sa√Ød denounce it as a \\"perversion\\" but Sa√Ød points out Schillinger's previously raped Beecher, Cyril O'Reily, among others. Schillinger denies the accusation causing Beecher to angrily attack him in a rage. Schillinger offers Beecher a job delivering mail to Keller in exchange for allowing Adam Guenzel to be left at the mercy of the Aryans in Unit B. Beecher accepts the offer, allowing Guenzel to be beaten and gang raped following his transfer. An FBI agent informs Schillinger that he strongly believes Pancamo orchestrated the murder of Schillinger's younger son Hank. The Aryans attack the Italians in the gym with Robson stabbing Pancamo, who is hospitalized. Peter Schibetta seeks revenge and asks Sa√Ød for help. Sa√Ød refuses, saying Schibetta's previous rape by Adebisi cannot change Schibetta's reputation. The other Italian mobsters agree and decide not to move against the Aryans without Pancamo's order. Schibetta goes after the Aryans alone attempting to stab Schillinger, when he and Robson go to pick up their damaged pool table, after they taunt him with racial slurs and references to being raped by Adebisi. Schillinger, Robson, and another Aryan beat and gang-rape Schibetta over the pool table, during the rape Schillinger taunts Schibetta about comparing Schillinger's penis size to Adebisi's. Schibetta is returned to the psych ward, while the Aryans now get a good laugh when playing with their repaired pool table. Meanwhile, Robson has to get his gum tissue replaced. Schillinger suggests that Robson see Dr. Faraj, the Muslim prison dentist. In retaliation for Robson's racist insults, Faraj replaces Robson's tissue with that of a black man. When word gets out, Aryan leaders on the outside order a reluctant Schillinger to kick Robson out of the Brotherhood. Beecher, feeling remorse about what happened to Guenzel, attempts to get Sister Pete to talk to him. Guenzel is later killed after Schillinger convinces him to escape. Beecher testifies against Schillinger, who is moved to solitary. Before this happens, Schillinger tasks Wolfgang Cutler, a prospective Aryan member, to kill a black inmate. Cutler targets Sa√Ød, but is instead attacked and nearly killed by black inmate Omar White. =Season 6= Schillinger is released from solitary, on the condition that he does not rape any more inmates. He immediately rapes Franklin Winthrop, who offers to kill Beecher's father if he can join the Aryans. Schillinger accepts, and Winthrop kills Beecher's father after paying the guards to lock him in a corridor. Meanwhile, a family friend of Schillinger's, Mayor Wilson Loewen, faces trial for reportedly assisting the Ku Klux Klan in murder of two young black girls in 1963. The trial leads to a full-scale race riot in the city, which spreads into Oz, putting the entire prison in lockdown. When the lockdown is over, Loewen is sent to Oz and put in Unit J with Beecher. When Beecher saves Loewen from choking, Schillinger is so grateful that he agrees not to interfere with Beecher's parole. When Keller intervenes in Beecher's parole and gets him sent back to Oz, Schillinger decides to call a truce with Keller. Despite Beecher saving Schillinger's idol, the truce is ultimately undone when Loewen expresses regret for supporting Schillinger, having learned of his vendetta against Beecher. In addition, Loewen tells Schillinger that he never really admired him. Disgusted, Schillinger turns against Loewen and has him killed by Willy Brandt. Ryan and Cyril's father, Seamus O'Reily, is sent to Oz for murder. He unsuccessfully attempts to have Schillinger kill Jahfree Neema, a black inmate who is dating Seamus' ex-girlfriend. Schillinger refuses due to his long-time rivalry with the brothers. Seamus attempts to murder Jahfree himself, but is instead stabbed with his own knife and put in the prison hospital, while Jahfree is sent to solitary. In a desperate attempt to win back Beecher's love, Keller switches prop knives during the prison production of Macbeth, in which both Schillinger and Beecher have been cast. Beecher unwittingly stabs him in the play's climactic scene. New warden Martin Querns and Sister Pete conclude that Schillinger's death was an accident. Due to the deaths of Schillinger and other Aryan lieutenants, the Brotherhood is reduced to pulling mail room duty; all are wiped out when an anthrax shipment is delivered to Oz in the series finale. =Murders committed= *Alexander Vogel - Killed by Schillinger and Mark Mack, by hanging his ankles in the gym and carving JEW on his chest.

Incorporated in May 2003, it can assist researchers interested in Railway Mail Service, route agent, Seapost, Railway Post Office (RPO), and Highway Post Office (HPO) history. The collection has many unique, original-source documents that provide answers to questions dealing with the transportation and distribution of USA Mail between 1862 and 1977, as well as other countries during the 19th century and 20th century.  History  The RMS Library has grown from the AmeRPO (\\"American RPO\\") Society Library established in the early 1950s by Bryant Alden Long, co- author of Mail by Rail. After a period of stagnation, it was acquired by Hershel Rankin, who renamed it the RMS Library. When he was 80 years old and no longer able to handle research requests, Dr. Frank R. Scheer purchased the collection. Over a two-year period, the collection was moved from Florida to Virginia and renamed the \\"Railway Mail Service Library.\\"  The collection  The RMS Library has every major book published about the Railway Mail Service/Postal Transportation Service (RMS/PTS). It also has many periodical articles written about en route distribution, and continually seeks ones that are not represented. There are six types of original-source documentation in the collection, however. These are: # Photographs of HPO and RPO vehicles # The Railway Post Office and Postal Transport Journal issues between 1905 and 1959 # Oral recollections of former clerks on audio and videotapes, as well as movies about the RMS/PTS # General orders describing weekly changes within several divisions # General and standpoint schemes of mail distribution # Schedules of mail trains/routes. Schemes and schedules are particularly helpful for understanding how the network of mail transportation and distribution activities operated, as well as when routes began, ended, or underwent significant changes. Since 1982, several major additions have been made to the collection. These include the Edwin Bergman scheme and schedule collection, Lloyd Jackson's, John Kay's, Lawrence Kruse's, Ed Maloney's, and Roy Schmidt's postal artifacts, Carm Cosentino's Transfer Office covers, Charles Scott's Fifth Division RMS records, worldwide postal emblems assembled by Len Cohen, James Mundy's postal locks, Lt. Col (ret) A. B. \\"Chip\\" Komoroske's railroad books, H. W. \\"Red\\" Reed's post office route maps, John McClelland's 1905 to 1949 bound issues of The Railway Post Office, as well as Paul Nagle's set of the Postal Transport Journal between 1950 and 1959. A multitude of other historically-significant resources have been acquired from many former railway and highway postal clerks.  Activities  As with most archival libraries, the principal activities are assisting research inquiries, organizing and filing the collection, as well as preservation of materials. The largest artifact in the collection is the building that became the Library's home on October 16, 2003: the Boyce, Virginia, railroad station. Built in 1913 and in service on the Norfolk and Western Railway for more than four decades, it was used for the town post office during the 1970s. Inside the 24 by 46 feet freight room are 20 filing cabinets and more than 500 feet of shelving. Artifact displays will be presented in the former baggage and waiting rooms after 2005.  Expansion  The RMS Library also seeks to buy or exchange documents, publications, and artifacts to expand the collection's scope and coverage. Items that are acquired are preserved in a climate- controlled environment. Rarer items are restored or treated to insure their existence for use by future researchers.  Potential Move  An article published February 9, 2019 in The Winchester Star describes Dr. Scheer's intent to move much of the library's collection to another site in Boyce, leaving space in the old depot \\"available for public use, such as for a town visitor‚Äôs center, wedding receptions and other special events, or model railroad club layouts.\\" Revenue from its use as a venue would provide income for the building's maintenance  Scope  The limited scope of the collection ‚Äì doing a few specific things well ‚Äì combined with Dr. Scheer's personal knowledge of transportation and postal history, permits better responses to user queries than many other non-specialized organizations can provide. The RMS Library also participates in inter-library loans or will provide photo- reproductions of items at five cents per page. Inquiries pertaining to RMS Library holdings or persons seeking research assistance should contact Dr. Scheer, at the library.

The first possible kokles related archaeological findings in the territory of modern Latvia are from the 13th century, while the first reliable written information about kokles playing comes from the beginning of the 17th century. The first known kokles tune was notated in 1891, but the first kokles recordings into gramophone records and movies were made in 1930s. Both kokles and kokles playing are included in the Latvian Culture Canon. Etymology  According to Finnish linguist Eino Nieminen, the name of the instrument, along with the names of most of its neighbouring counterparts (Lithuanian kanklƒós, Finnish kantele, Estonian kannel and Livonian kƒÅndla), possibly comes from the proto-Baltic form *kantlƒ´s/*kantlƒìs, which originally meant 'the singing tree', ultimately deriving from the Proto- European root *qan- ('to sing, to sound'). However, Lithuanian ethnologist Romualdas Apanaviƒçius believes kokles could be derived from the Proto-European root *gan(dh)-, meaning 'a vessel; a haft (of a sword)', suggesting that it may be related to the Russian word gusli.Romualdas Apanaviƒçius. Ancient Lithuanian Kanklƒós, Institute of Ethnomusic, Vilnius, Lithuania Construction The kokles has a hollow trapezoidal body (ƒ∑ermenis or korpuss) usually carved out of a single piece of wood (vienkocis) that's topped with a thin ornated wooden soundboard (ska≈Ügaldi≈Ü≈°). A distinct feature that sets kokles apart from most of the other string instruments is that the strings don't rest on a bridge, making the sound quieter, but richer in timbre. Wooden (or sometimes metal) tuning pegs (tapas) are set into the wide tip of the body, while at the narrow tip is a metal rod (stƒ´gturis) upon which the strings are secured, giving them a slightly fan-shaped arrangement. The strings may be of brass or steel. Traditionally, there were 6‚Äì9 strings which later increased to 10 and more. Playing Latgale kokles player in Riga The technique of kokles playing differs from most other plucked string instruments, including that of zither, harp and guitar. There are also some playing differences between the regional types of Latgale and Kurzeme instruments. In Kurzeme kokles was generally played while sitting on a stool, bench or chair without armrests and placing it horizontally in the lap with legs slightly parted. It could be played while laid down on the table as well. For Latgale kokles the size and form of the instrument also allowed for it to be steadily placed in the lap in a vertical position, resting the shorter edge of kokles against the stomach and placing both arms on the instrument for extra comfort and stability. Strumming is done with the right hand's index finger, while the left hand is used for muting unwanted strings by lightly placing fingers on them. An alternative string muting technique found in Latgale features the fingers being inserted in-between the strings, but such option heavily restricts the movement of the left arm. The left hand can also be used for picking strings.  Tuning  Tuning of the kokles is a diatonic scale, with some lower strings traditionally functioning as drones. A few traditional tuning variations include D-G-A-H-C for 5-stringed kokles written down by Andrejs JurjƒÅns at the end of the 19th century, D-C-D-E-F-G-A for 7-stringed kokles and D-C-D-E-F-G-A-H-C for 9-stringed kokles both used by traditional suiti kokles player JƒÅnis Poriƒ∑is. However, as kokles began to be constructed with more strings and Latgale kokles became the dominant type of kokles among many other factors, the drone strings have gradually lost their function and become just a lower range extension of the kokles' diapason. Since the 1980s, the most popular tunings among kokles players for 11-stringed kokles are G-A-C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C (GA) and G-A-C-D-E-F-G-A-B‚ô≠-C (GA-b‚ô≠). Types In his book \\"The Baltic Psaltery and Playing Traditions in Latvia\\" (Kokles un koklƒì≈°ana LatvijƒÅ) Latvian ethnomusicologist Valdis MuktupƒÅvels distinguishes 3 types of traditional kokles ‚Äì Kurzeme kokles (Kurzemes kokles), Latgale kokles (Latgales kokles) and zither kokles (cƒ´tarkokles) ‚Äì and 3 types of modernised kokles ‚Äì the so-called 15-stringed Krasnopjorovs'-ƒ∂irpis' diatonic kokles (Krasnopjorova-ƒ∂irpja diatoniskƒÅs kokles) and the concert kokles (koncertkokles) both designed in the Latvian SSR in 1940s to 1960s, as well as the so-called 13-stringed Linauts'-Dravnieks'-Jansons' kokles (Linauta-Dravnieka-Jansona kokles) that emerged in the Latvian American community in the 1960s. =Kurzeme kokles= Latvian) according to ethnograph Matƒ´ss Sili≈Ü≈° In the Latvian historical region of Kurzeme kokles are traditionally constructed smaller in size and without a \\"wing\\", but with more ornate carvings and ornaments. It also usually has fewer strings than Latgale kokles, ranging from 5 to 6 stings for the ones found at the west coast of Kurzeme and Selonia to 7, 8 or even 9 strings for the suiti inhabited areas. On May 17, 2015, during Latvia's presidency of the Council of the European Union, a Kurzemes kokles built by the crafter JƒÅnis Rozenbergs was donated to the Musical Instruments Museum of Brussels. =Latgale kokles= 11-string Latgale kokles with aspen body, fir soundboard and oak tuning pegs In the largely Catholic Latgale region of Latvia, it was characteristic for the kokles to be constructed with an extension of the body beyond the peg line called a wing, that reinforces sound of the instrument and can also be used as an arm support. Estonian ethnologist Igor T√µnurist believes that the wing may be a more recent innovation, that developed sometime before the 14th century for the Baltic psaltery played in the Pskov and Novgorod lands and later was borrowed by some neighboring Baltic and Baltic Finnic people, such as Setos, Vepsians, and Latgalians. In comparison with Kurzemes kokles, the finish of Latgale kokles is less thorough; the instrument is bigger and heavier, with more strings (sometimes even up to 12 and only in rare cases less than 9) and with a more sober decoration. In the Aug≈°zeme-Vidzeme region both types of kokles, as well as mixed forms (for example, kokles with a small wing) were constructed. = Zither kokles = At the end of the 19th century and the beginning of 20th century kokles traditions were influenced by the construction and playing style of the Western zithers coming from Germany and other Central European countries. Thus arose the so-called zither kokles: kokles with larger, zither-type cases, steel tuning pins, and an increased number of strings (from 17 to sometimes even up to 30 single or double strings). =Concert kokles= Latvian concert kokles ensemble The first larger \\"concert kokle\\" with a three-and-a-half octave range and 25 stings was constructed in 1951 by RomƒÅns ƒ∂irpis for the Latvian folk music orchestra's soloist Helƒìna Kƒºava-Birgmeistere. It was the first to have devices for changing the pitches of strings in order to change keys. Few years later concert kokles saw a few more innovations in the construction and the new design gradually spread in the Latvian Conservatoire and musical schools, as well as amateur kokles ensembles. For a long time concert kokles were produced at the Musical Instrument Factory of Riga, mainly from leftover materials used for pianos. But after Latvia regained its independence the factory was closed and until the mid 1990s instrument was left without any professional makers. Soon Imants Robe≈ænieks who had previously worked at the factory started making and fixing kokles again after receiving numerous requests from kokles players. Since then he has been the only master of concert kokles in Latvia.  In mythology  Valdis MuktupƒÅvels regards kokles as the most highly socially and economically valued Latvian instrument. Mythologically kokles may have been linked with the solar and celestial sphere as they are also sometimes called \\"Kokles of Dievs\\" (Dieva kokles) or \\"golden kokles\\" (zelta kokles) and sun ornaments were traditionally carved in the soundboard. Kokles, kokles playing (koklƒì≈°ana) and kokles players (koklƒìtƒÅji) are mentioned in 274 Latvian dainas and mythological kokles players include JƒÅnis and other unnamed sons of Dievs, as well as Saule playing kokles while sitting in the Austras koks. In modern music MƒÅris MuktupƒÅvels tuning kokles during a concert with the post-folk band Iƒºƒ£i, July 24, 2010 Kokles player Laima Jansone at a concert in Sweden, February 5, 2015 Already at the first kokles revival in 1930s and 1940s kokles music saw an influx of newly composed folk music-inspired compositions and orchestral arrangements of folk songs. However, only recently kokles has truly grown to transcend the boundaries of traditional folk music. From the experimental post-folk band Iƒºƒ£i, Biruta Ozoli≈Üa's and DJ Monsta's electronic folk collaboration, Laima Jansone's free improvisations and fusion of kokles' sounds with jazz in the project \\"Zarbugans\\" to a more heavier kokles- accompanied folk metal sound of Skyforger. In 2002 record label Upe released a double CD by ethnomusicologist Valdis MuktupƒÅvels titled \\"Kokles\\", dedicated to the instrument. The first disc \\"Muktukokles\\" contains 9 MuktupƒÅvels' original kokles compositions and 2 arrangements of traditional songs accompanied by other instruments (sarod, tambura, and tabla), as well as the vocals of R≈´ta MuktupƒÅvele, while the second disc \\"TradicionƒÅlƒÅs kokles\\" contains 24 Kurzeme, suiti and Latgale traditional tunes and dance melodies. In 2016 record label Lauska released a CD Trejdevi≈Üi koklƒìtƒÅji (Thrice-nine kokles players) featuring some of the best known Latvian kokles players (Valdis MuktupƒÅvels, Laima Jansone, Biruta Ozoli≈Üa and Ansis Jansons among others) and Baltic psaltery players from abroad (Leanne Barbo from Estonia and Jenni Ven√§l√§inen from Finland), as well as Latvian concert kokles ensembles, with a collection of 13 compositions that span from traditional to ethno-jazz and ethno-baroque genres. A bilingual Latvian-English hardback booklet was also included with notes on performing musicians and their compositions, as well as a brief history of kokles.

Due to withdrawal of many Railway Post Office (RPO) trains from service, the U.S. Post Office Department decided to experiment with distribution of mail on large buses equipped similarly to RPO cars. On February 10, 1941, experimental service started on the Washington, DC & Harrisonburg, Virginia HPO. It was a success from the start, but due to World War II, expansion of the service was delayed for several years. After the war, the service increased rapidly, with more than 130 routes established between 1948 and 1955. As this service was somewhat enmeshed with the RPO service, its value decreased as RPOs were abolished. The last HPO service to operate in the U.S. was the Cleveland, Ohio, & Cincinnati, Ohio HPO, which was discontinued in 1974.  See also  * Railway Mail Service Library  Sources  * Wilking, Clarence.

Only outgoing air mail was distributed at these workrooms, channeled there by both the post offices and Railway Post Office (RPO) routes. This mail was distributed and dispatched to other AMFs via the different flight connections. Incoming mail from other AMFs was distributed by general scheme and pouched to outgoing RPOs and necessary post offices. The Motor Vehicle Service provided frequent trips between the city post office and the AMF for air mail ground transportation. In 1951, there were 1200 clerks manning forty AMFs.

These offices were usually located in or near railroad stations in major cities or junction points. Terminal railway post offices operated generally from 1913-1914 into the mid-1960s, before their function was absorbed by post office sectional centers. History On January 1, 1913, the United States Post Office began handling parcel post, in addition to letters and more conventional mail. This service, which was in direct competition with the privately owned express companies, was quickly embraced by the general public, and over two million packages were mailed in the first week after parcel post service began.Railway Age Gazette; Vol. 54, No. 3; January 7, 1913, p117. Terminal Railway Post Offices (Term RPO) were started in nearly 100 cities in late 1913 and 1914, primarily to help handle the increase in volume of parcel post which was overwhelming the main transportation system. These terminals also came to distribute transit parcel post, circulars, magazines, and papers - mail that was generally considered less urgent than first class letters. Letter cases were used at many terminals to take care of advance work or unworked letters from Railway Post Office (RPO) routes, while a few terminals handled parcel post almost exclusively. The largest terminal railway post office was the Penn Terminal in the G.P.O. Building in New York City, New York‚Äîin 1951, it had over 1,100 clerks. Penn Terminal handled advance work for many of the railway post office routes leaving New York City. By comparison, the West Side Terminal, located along the New York Central line near the Hudson River piers, handled parcel post almost exclusively. Because parcel post transportation was generally by rail, most terminal RPOs were housed in or adjacent to the railroad station. Where mails for more than one state were distributed, the \\"state rights\\" of the assignments were prorated. If one- fourth of the mail distributed at the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Terminal was Ohio mail, clerks with \\"Ohio rights\\" were entitled to one-fourth of the assignments. Demise of Terminal RPOs The number of Terminal railway post offices peaked in 1914, with nearly 100 offices. In 1915, that number declined to 88, with a further decline to 71 offices by 1942, as many smaller offices were closed and their duties returned to RPO routes.Mail by Rail, the Story of the Postal Transportation Service; B.A. Long, 1951, p35-38. All the mail originating in the cities where Terminals were located was distributed by the city post offices. In many cases, this duplication of distribution was in the same building. Local postmasters had no jurisdiction over terminal RPO operations until the 1950s, when all the terminals were put under the supervision of the postmasters of the city in which they were located. The filling of assignments in the terminal was then limited to the roster from the civil service examination of the city post office. As railway post office routes declined in number, the volume of parcel post transported by this mode also decreased, allowing the closure of smaller terminals. Development of the U.S. Postal Service sectional centers duplicated many of the functions of the terminal RPO, and the terminals were phased out by the 1960s. Philatelic Interest This letter was worked by Tour 3 of the Texarkana, Arkansas, Terminal RPO in November 1924. First class mail worked (sorted for distribution) by terminal RPOs usually received a Terminal RPO postmark. Like the cancellations from RPO cars themselves, terminal RPO postmarks are collected by those who specialize in this aspect of postal history.

It is present in all tissues but, in general, found in higher concentrations in the liver. It is biosynthesized from palmitic acid by the action of the enzyme Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1.

He held a wide variety of positions in the state of Vermont, including as a member of the United States House of Representatives, a member of the United States Senate and Governor of Vermont. Early life Smith was born in Suffield in the Colony of Connecticut, where he spent his childhood. He studied at Yale University and graduated in 1781. He studied law with his brother Noah Smith, and was admitted to the bar. He began his law practice in Rupert, Vermont. He married Abiah Douglass (1767-1836), and they had two children, William (1785-1822) and Horace (1787-1790). After Israel Smith's death Abiah married Colonel William C. Harrington, who became an attorney in Burlington, Vermont. Career Smith began his political career in 1785 when he served as a member of the Vermont House of Representatives. He served in the Vermont House again from 1788 to 1791. During this period, he was active in solving Vermont's boundary disputes with other states and served as a delegate to the Vermont Constitutional Convention, at which Vermont ratified the American Constitution. By 1790 Smith had moved to Rutland, Vermont. When Vermont became a state in 1791, Smith ran for Vermont's seat in the United States House of Representatives. In a bitterly fought election between Smith, Matthew Lyon and Isaac Tichenor, Smith received second place, 35% of the vote in the first round, but won the runoff against Lyon. Smith represented Vermont's 1st District in the U.S. House from 1791 to 1797. In 1792 and 1794, Lyon unsuccessfully ran against Smith, but in 1796 Smith was defeated by Lyon. By this time, Smith had become a member of the Democratic-Republican Party. In 1797, Smith again briefly served in the Vermont State House. He became Chief Justice of the Vermont Supreme Court in 1797, but resigned the following year. In 1800, Smith was reelected to the United States House of Representatives, where he served until 1802. In 1802, Smith was elected to the United States Senate from Vermont, and served in the Senate from 1803 to 1807. In 1807 he successfully ran against one of his old political rivals, Isaac Tichenor, for governor. Tichenor had served as governor for a decade. Smith resigned from the Senate and served as Governor of Vermont from 1807 to 1808, when he was defeated for reelection by Tichenor. Smith served as Vermont's fourth Governor. Death and legacy After leaving the governorship, Smith moved back to Rutland, Vermont, where he retired from politics. He became ill and died in Rutland. He is interred at West Street Cemetery in Rutland. His home in Rutland has been preserved.

Specially equipped Railway Post Office (RPO) cars were a part of most passenger trains, the cars staffed by highly trained railway postal clerks who sorted mail as the train sped along its route. The growth of this mail distribution network paralleled the expansion of the railroads, allowing mail to be exchanged between routes at junction points where two railroads crossed or shared passenger terminals. Shortly before W.W.I, the Post Office Department began assigning railway mail clerks to new Transfer Office positions which were established at many of the larger railroad junction points as well as passenger terminals in larger cities. These transfer clerks supervised mail exchanges between trains, served as the local liaison between the Railway Mail Service and the host railroad, and maintained detailed statistical records which were used to audit railroad charges for mail transportation and car usage. This latter task involved determining the amount of mail in baggage cars or storage mail cars, a unique process of estimating the car area occupied by mail sacks rather than counting individual sacks. Other duties included sorting letters which had been mailed at depot letter boxes and providing a hand-to-hand receipt for registered mail transferred between connecting railway post office routes. Many of the transfer offices had a unique postmark to cancel the mail which was sorted by the office, and these cancellations are still collected by philatelists and postal historians. T.O. transfer office postal cancellation applied to mail sorted by the Memphis Central Station transfer office. Like many large cities, Memphis had two passenger terminals, and a similar transfer office was maintained at Memphis Union Station. Transfer offices were used by RPO clerks as a point to read job bulletins (order books maintained by the Chief Clerk) before starting on a run, and as a location to finish paperwork at the end of a run. In 1951, almost 200 transfer offices were maintained across the country. Larger cities with multiple railroad stations often had several different transfer offices, one at each station. As mail transportation by rail declined in the 1950s, smaller transfer offices were closed. With the continued erosion of rail mail operations, and particularly after the demise of the railway post office network in the late 1960s, the need for transfer offices diminished and most were closed or merged with other positions by the early 1970s.

It was created by an eccentric folk artist named Eddie Owens Martin (1908‚Äì1986), who called himself St. EOM. An internationally renowned art site, it consists of six major structures including a redesigned 1885 farmhouse, painted concrete sculptures, and of painted masonry concrete walls. In September 2008, Pasaquan was accepted for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. Pasaquan was restored by the Kohler Foundation and Columbus State University between 2014 and 2016. Eddie Owens Martin Eddie Owens Martin was born on July 4, 1908 in the village of Glen Alta in Marion County, Georgia to a sharecropper family of nine. He suffered abuse from his father that caused him to leave home for New York City at 14 years old and become a sex worker. His early adult years of skirting the law led to a one-year prison term in 1942. He became a fortune teller after his release from Federal Narcotics Prison on March 17, 1943. He committed suicide on April 16, 1986. Origins Martin was inspired by a spirit to create a religion called Pasaquoyanism. Its members are called Pasaquoyans. The spirit also named Martin \\"Saint EOM.\\" Pasaquoyanism emphasizes connection to the natural world and the use of hair. \\"Pasaquan\\" is a name coined from Spanish and Chinese meaning roughly \\"the past coming together.\\" He inherited the house and four acres of land from his mother after she passed away in 1950. Martin moved his fortune-telling business to the site in 1957 after a dispute with his brother Julius. He transformed the property over many years using proceeds earned from fortune telling. Construction Martin collected local natural materials to construct his first wall and hired D. W. Milner to assist him. His original decorated fence decayed because it was made out of wood. Edwin Stephens provided Martin with technical construction skills and a romantic relationship. After 10 years of construction, Martin began painting his structures with images inspired by his own personal acquaintances. Ownership transition The Marion County Historical Society assumed ownership of Pasaquan in 1986. A special committee was formed in order to facilitate care of the site and Martin's various other works. The committee later purged various materials in order to focus on the compound itself. The Pasaquan Preservation Society was born out of the committee and operated Pasaquan until 2014. The Pasaquan Preservation Society deeded Pasaquan to the Kohler Foundation in 2014 in order to finance its restoration. The Kohler Foundation transferred ownership of Pasaquan to Columbus State University after it reopened in 2016. Restoration In 2004, the Pasaquan Preservation Society solicited the Kohler Foundation for help in maintaining Pasaquan. The project was accepted in 2014. The Kohler Foundation collaborated with Columbus State University to restore Pasaquan's art. After two years of work, the site was re-opened to the public on October 22, 2016.Patterson, Tom. , Brut Force, December, 2016. Publicity President Jimmy Carter visited the site in the early 1980s. In 2015, the Pasaquan Preservation Society won the Governor's Award for the Arts and Humanities for its work on Pasaquan. In 2016, CNN recommended Pasaquan as a tourist destination. In 2019, Atlanta recommended Pasaquan as a folk art destination. In popular culture In 2013, Jason McCoy visited Pasaquan for his show Jason McCoy Eats America. In 2017, James Ogburn and Scott Wilkerson created an opera called \\"Eddie‚Äôs Stone Song: Odyssey of the First Pasaquoyan\\" that celebrated Martin's life.

After an operation on a patella tendon and a winter of rehabilitation, he worked his way back to fitness to take part in New Zealand's tour of South Africa in November/December 2007. Called into the Test side, Mills was forced to withdraw from the second and final Test due to a stomach bug.

Patty Flandrau was the daughter of Charles Eugene Flandrau, a Minnesota judge and politician; it was at the farm of Patty's maternal aunt Julia Stockton Dinsmore in Kentucky that Isabella was born. The Selmes family owned a ranch in the Dakota Territory that was close to Teddy Roosevelt's ranch and they developed a close friendship with each other. After the untimely death of her father in 1895, Isabella and her mother lived with various members of her mother's family in Kentucky, Minnesota, and New York. Isabella attended Miss Chapin's School in New York City, where she met and became lifelong friends with Roosevelt's niece, Eleanor. First and second marriages In 1905, Isabella was one of Eleanor's bridesmaids when Eleanor married Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Shortly thereafter, while the Roosevelts were on their honeymoon, Isabella married Robert Munro-Ferguson, the younger brother of Ronald Munro-Furguson. Robert was a family friend of the Roosevelts, as well as one of Theodore Roosevelt's Rough Riders. Robert and Isabella became the godparents of Franklin and Eleanor's only daughter, Anna Eleanor Roosevelt. Three years into the marriage, Robert contracted tuberculosis and in 1910 the couple moved to the dry climate of New Mexico, hoping his health would improve. There Isabella nursed her husband and educated their two children, Robert, Jr. and Martha. During this period, Isabella and Eleanor established a close correspondence that continued for the rest of their lives. After Robert's death in 1922, Isabella married a close friend, Gen. John Campbell Greenway, another of Roosevelt's Rough Riders, whom she had met in 1911. John moved the family to a ranch in Arizona near Bisbee where he was manager of the Calumet and Arizona Mining Company. Later the family moved to Ajo where Isabella and John's son, John Selmes (\\"Jack\\") Greenway, was born in 1924. In 1926, John died suddenly, following surgery, leaving Isabella a widow once again. Isabella and her two children moved to Williams, and bought a ranch there as she and John had planned, the Quarter Circle Double X Ranch. Through smart business dealings and the sale of her mining stock at the top of its value ahead of the market crash, Isabella was able to grow the ranch to over . During the same period, she also became the owner and operator of Los Angeles-based Gilpin Airlines. Activism and politics Roosevelt and other political figures at the Greenway Ranch, 1932 Isabella's political interests and social activism paralleled the interests of her friend Eleanor. During the First World War she developed and directed a network of southwest women who farmed while the men were overseas. During the late 1920s she opened Arizona Hut, a furniture factory employing disabled veterans and their immediate families. In 1928 she became Arizona's Democratic national committeewoman, and in 1932 she campaigned heavily for Franklin Roosevelt. She made one of the speeches seconding his nomination at the 1932 Democratic National Convention. Greenway, a Democrat, was elected as Arizona's sole Representative to the 73rd Congress in 1932 to complete the unexpired term of resigning Rep. Lewis W. Douglas, who had been appointed the U.S director of the budget. She won reelection in 1934. On her fiftieth birthday she announced that she was retiring from public office. There was some expectation that had she run in the 1936 election, she would have been unopposed in both the primary and general elections. Though she broadly supported New Deal legislation during her terms in Congress, she demonstrated her political independence by breaking with the President over some issues of concern to veterans, an important part of her political base in Arizona. She opposed legislation to reduce the pensions of World War I servicemen, funds for which FDR planned to shift to fund economic recovery programs. She also opposed some provisions of the Social Security Act, which she believed would be impossible to implement in the long term. Later life In 1939 she married one-time tool manufacturer Harry O. King, a former National Recovery Administration manager for the copper industry, and then-president of the Institute of Applied Economics in New York. During this marriage, Isabella spent part of her time in New York and part in Tucson. She died on December 18, 1953 in Tucson at the Arizona Inn, which she had founded in 1930. She is buried on the Dinsmore Homestead in Kentucky where she had been born. In Phoenix, Greenway Road and several public schools are named for her.

Hatcher previously served as first base coach for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and Cincinnati Reds. Pre-MLB career In 1979, Hatcher graduated from Williams High School in Williams, Arizona, where he had pitched an 11-inning no-hitter as a junior. Hatcher then played for Yavapai Community College in Prescott, Arizona, where he was a junior college All-America selection. Professional playing career =Chicago Cubs= Hatcher was drafted by the Cubs in the sixth round of the January 1981 MLB draft. He rose quickly through the Cubs' minor league system, playing exactly one season at each minor league level before receiving a late- season call-up to the major league club in 1984. He split time between AAA and the Cubs during the 1985 season before being traded to the Astros along with Steve Engel for Jerry Mumphrey. =Houston Astros= Hatcher would be the Astros' starting left fielder for the next seasons and is remembered by Astros fans for hitting one of the most dramatic post-season home runs ever in the 14th inning of Game 6 of the Astros' 1986 National League Championship Series vs the New York Mets' Jesse Orosco, temporarily saving the Astros from elimination. Hatcher had his best statistical season in 1987, when he opened the season with a 16-game hitting streak and led the Astros in hitting (.296) and had career highs in stolen bases (53, third in the National League), home runs (11) and runs batted in (63). His most dubious achievement came that season as well, as he received a 10-game suspension for bat corking.Baseball Digest, May 2008, by Marky Billson http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCI/is_3_67/ai_n25147858 Hatcher later explained that he had borrowed the bat from relief pitcher Dave Smith. Hatcher broke several of his own, uncorked bats in games leading up to the incident, and he continues to maintain his innocence. =Pittsburgh Pirates= Near the end of the 1989 season, the struggling Astros traded Hatcher to the Pirates for Glenn Wilson. He played just 27 games for Pittsburgh before being traded to the Reds for Jeff Richardson and Mike Roesler. =Cincinnati Reds= Hatcher had a memorable season in 1990 for the Reds when he stole 30 bases during their closely contested 1990 pennant run. On August 21, 1990, he tied the major league record against the Cubs with four doubles in one game. He ended up leading National League outfielders in fielding percentage (.997) on the season. The best hitting performance of Hatcher's career was timely, coming during the 1990 World Series against the Oakland Athletics. During the 1990 post-season he hit .519 overall (14-for-27), including a World Series record .750 in the four-game World Series sweep over the heavily favored A's. This mark broke a 62-year-old World Series record that was previously held by Babe Ruth (.625 in 1928), though it was achieved with the at-bat totals for only three games, as Hatcher was removed from Game 4 in the 1st inning after being hit on the hand by a Dave Stewart pitch and was taken to the hospital for precautionary x-rays. They were negative and he was able to return to the ballpark in time for the victory celebration. Hatcher also set records for most consecutive hits in a series (7) and most doubles in a four-game series (4). Despite his torrid hitting, Hatcher was not named the Series Most Valuable Player, that going to Reds pitcher Jos√© Rijo, who had a nearly perfect series of his own. Hatcher finished his career with a .404 postseason batting average in 14 games which included 12 runs, 2 home runs and 6 runs batted in. =Boston Red Sox= Hatcher was traded to the Red Sox for Tom Bolton in the middle of the 1992 season and, on August 3 of that season while with the Red Sox, stole home against the Toronto Blue Jays' Juan Guzm√°n. He was the Red Sox' starter in center field for the 1993 season before finishing his career as a reserve for the Phillies and Rangers before retiring following the 1995 season. Hatcher played 12 seasons in the major Leagues. He finished his career with a .264 career batting average with 54 home runs and 399 runs batted in during 1,233 games. Coaching career In 2015, Billy Hatcher entered his tenth season as a Major League coach with the Reds organization. He works as third-base, outfield, and baserunning coach. Prior to joining the Reds, he spent ten seasons in the Tampa Bay Rays organization, first as a roving minor-league instructor (1996), then as a minor-league coach for 1997 Florida State League champion St. Petersburg. Hatcher spent the next eight seasons as a member of the Rays' Major League coaching staff (1998‚Äì2005) as the first-base coach (1998‚Äì99, 2003‚Äì05), bench coach (2001‚Äì02), and third-base coach (2000). He holds the distinction of being the only coach to work for the Rays in each of the club's first eight years of existence. For the 2016 season, he switched from first base coach to third base coach. Hatcher was named the first base coach for the Miami Marlins prior to the 2020 season. Personal life Hatcher and his wife Karen have a son, Derek, who was Florida's 2004 Class A Player of the Year in football at Berkley Prep in Tampa, Florida and then played safety for the University of Richmond football team that won the 2008 NCAA FCS National Championship. The couple also have a daughter, Chelsea, who played soccer at the University of Tennessee from 2008 to 2011. She was selected to the All-SEC first team in 2010.

Similarly, many actors who appeared in The Corner later appeared in Simon's next television series, The Wire (2002‚Äì2008), often playing contrasting characters, e.g., Clarke Peters, Maria Broom, Corey Parker Robinson, Reg E. Cathey, Clayton LeBouef, Donnell Rawlings, Tootsie Duvall, Robert F. Chew, Lance Reddick, Delaney Williams, and DeAndre McCullough (as an assistant to Brother Mouzone).

Reception  A review by Hugh K. David of DVD Times praised The Corner as \\"raw, gritty, uncompromising, realistic, smartly directed, supremely well-acted, compulsively watchable, but harrowing and with little light at the end of the tunnel\\", comparing it to the television equivalent of such films as Last Exit to Brooklyn (1989) and Requiem for a Dream (2000; also adapted from novels), with elements in common with both La Haine (1995) and City of God (2002). = Awards = The miniseries received three Emmy awards at the 52nd Primetime Emmy Awards. It won for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Miniseries; Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special (Charles S.

The silos were used to store the soybeans reprocessed for a variety of purposes (pet food, animal feed, vegetable oils, etc...). In 1954 the mills were sold to Procter & Gamble and named Victory Soya Mills. It was purchased by Central Soy Incorporated in 1980 and renamed Central Soya Mills in the 1980s.

The Alamo bolide impact occurred 377-378 million years ago, when one or more hypervelocity objects from space slammed into shallow marine waters at a site that is now the Devonian Guilmette Formation of the Worthington Mountains and Schell Creek Range of southeastern Nevada; the event is named for breccias of metamorphosed crushed rock deposits, found as far as the town of Alamo, Nevada (the \\"Alamo Breccia\\"). This catastrophic impact event resulted in what is one of the best-exposed and has become the most accurately dated impact events; it occurred within the Frasnian age of the Devonian at about 377-378Ma Ma, a moment in time that was about 5.9 Ma prior to the Frasnian/Famennian extinction events, which it is unlikely to have affected. Alamo impact breccia near Hancock Summit, Pahranagat Range, Nevada. The actual impact site has not yet been significantly documented--even its precise diameter and its internal structural features are not yet clear enough to make speculations on the mass and trajectory genuinely useful. The \\"tectonic overprint\\", the subsequent geologic modifications since the event, have distorted the picture; the distribution of the breccia has been compressed and skewed by west-to-east thrust faults across the area. Insufficient detail does not permit a precise reconstruction of the Devonian paleogeography, beyond the fact that it was a \\"wet-target\\" impact in a reef front where carbonates were being built up in marine shallows. The impact site contains megabreccia of gigantic displaced blocks, together with several attributes familiar from other impact sites: shocked quartz, elevated iridium levels, and spherical lapilli. John E. Warme, one of the geologists who first recognized the geologic anomalies as the results of a bolide, estimates that the total volume of limestone reef deposits and bedrock that was smashed, deformed, partially melted or shifted during the Alamo event at 1,000 cubic kilometers.http://www.geotimes.org/jan04/feature_Alamo.html John E.

Women's Army Corps anti-rumor propaganda (1941‚Äì1945) In a more general sense, OPSEC is the process of protecting individual pieces of data that could be grouped together to give the bigger picture (called aggregation). OPSEC is the protection of critical information deemed mission-essential from military commanders, senior leaders, management or other decision-making bodies. The process results in the development of countermeasures, which include technical and non-technical measures such as the use of email encryption software, taking precautions against eavesdropping, paying close attention to a picture you have taken (such as items in the background), or not talking openly on social media sites about information on the unit, activity or organization's Critical Information List. The term \\"operations security\\" was coined by the United States military during the Vietnam War. Social engineering is the art of manipulating people into performing actions or divulging confidential information, rather than by breaking in or using technical cracking techniques Process  OPSEC is a five-step iterative process that assists an organization in identifying specific pieces of information requiring protection and employing measures to protect them: # Identification of Critical information: Critical information is information about friendly intentions, capabilities and activities that allow an adversary to plan effectively to disrupt their operations. U.S. Army Regulation 530-1 has redefined Critical Information into four broad categories, using the acronym CALI ‚Äì Capabilities, Activities, Limitations (including vulnerabilities), and Intentions.https://fas.org/irp/doddir/army/ar530-1.pdf This step results in the creation of a Critical Information List (CIL). This allows the organization to focus resources on vital information, rather than attempting to protect all classified or sensitive unclassified information. Critical information may include, but is not limited to, military deployment schedules, internal organizational information, details of security measures, etc. # Analysis of Threats: A Threat comes from an adversary ‚Äì any individual or group that may attempt to disrupt or compromise a friendly activity. Threat is further divided into adversaries with intent and capability. The greater the combined intent and capability of the adversary, the greater the threat. This step uses multiple sources, such as intelligence activities, law enforcement, and open source information to identify likely adversaries to a planned operation and prioritize their degree of threat. # Analysis of Vulnerabilities: Examining each aspect of the planned operation to identify OPSEC indicators that could reveal critical information and then comparing those indicators with the adversary's intelligence collection capabilities identified in the previous action. Threat can be thought of as the strength of the adversaries, while vulnerability can be thought of as the weakness of friendly organizations. # Assessment of Risk: First, planners analyze the vulnerabilities identified in the previous action and identify possible OPSEC measures for each vulnerability. Second, specific OPSEC measures are selected for execution based upon a risk assessment done by the commander and staff. Risk is calculated based on the probability of Critical Information release and the impact if such as release occurs. Probability is further subdivided into the level of threat and the level of vulnerability. The core premise of the subdivision is that the probability of compromise is greatest when the threat is very capable and dedicated, while friendly organizations are simultaneously exposed. # Application of Appropriate OPSEC Measures: The command implements the OPSEC measures selected in the assessment of risk action or, in the case of planned future operations and activities, includes the measures in specific OPSEC plans. Countermeasures must be continually monitored to ensure that they continue to protect current information against relevant threats. The U.S. Army Regulation 530-1https://fas.org/irp/doddir/army/ar530-1.pdf refers to \\"Measures\\" as the overarching term, with categories of \\"Action Control\\" (controlling one's own actions); \\"Countermeasures\\" (countering adversary intelligence collection); and \\"Counteranalysis\\" (creating difficulty for adversary analysts seeking to predict friendly intent) as tools to help an OPSEC professional protect critical information. An OPSEC Assessment is the formal application of the process to an existing operation or activity by a multidisciplinary team of experts. The assessments identify the requirements for additional OPSEC measures and required changes to existing ones. Additionally, OPSEC planners, working closely with Public Affairs personnel, must develop the Essential Elements of Friendly Information (EEFI) used to preclude inadvertent public disclosure of critical or sensitive information. The term \\"EEFI\\" is being phased out in favor of \\"Critical Information\\", so all affected agencies use the same term, minimizing confusion. History = Vietnam = In 1966, United States Admiral Ulysses Sharp established a multidisciplinary security team to investigate the failure of certain combat operations during the Vietnam War. This operation was dubbed Operation Purple Dragon, and included personnel from the National Security Agency and the Department of Defense. When the operation concluded, the Purple Dragon team codified their recommendations. They called the process \\"Operations Security\\" in order to distinguish the process from existing processes and ensure continued inter- agency support. = NSDD 298 = In 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed National Security Decision Directive (NSDD) 298. This document established the National Operations Security Program and named the Director of the National Security Agency as the executive agent for inter-agency OPSEC support. This document also established the Interagency OPSEC Support Staff (IOSS).  International and private-sector application  Although originally developed as a US military methodology, Operations Security has been adopted worldwide for both military and private-sector operations. In 1992, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) added OPSEC to its glossary of terms and definitions. The private sector has also adopted OPSEC as a defensive measure against competitive intelligence collection efforts. Military and private- sector security and information firms often require OPSEC professionals. Certification is often initially obtained from military or governmental organizations, such as: *U.S. Army OPSEC Support Element *U.S. Navy OPSEC Support Team *U.S. Marine OPSEC Support Team *U.S. Air Force OPSEC Support Team/ *U.S. Coast Guard Office of Security Policy and Management *Joint OPSEC Support Element. *Interagency OPSEC Support Staff.

The community proclaims itself the \\"Home of the White Squirrel\\", owing to the presence of the unusually-coloured mammals. Exeter's mascot, \\"Willis The White Wonder\\", can be seen at many community events throughout the year, including Canada Day celebrations, the Exeter Rodeo, and the Santa Claus Parade. History Exeter was first founded in the winter of 1832 by the Irish settlers James and Jane Willis accompanied by the explorer Sir Michael Jacques. By 1853, Exeter had grown into a community of over 300 with the help of Isaac Carling bringing immigrants from the Exeter and Devon areas of England. The original Carling homestead, a designated historical landmark still stands on Huron St.W. It was on July 1, 1873, when the villages north and south of the Ausable River (Francistown and Exeter respectively) merged to form the Village of Exeter. The first written reference to Exeter was by Rev. William Proudfoot who passed through the area in 1833. He described the area as having \\"excellent soil\\" with the trees \\"being chiefly maple, elm, oak, ironwood and black ash\\". When he passed through the area through London Road, which was barely a trail, there were only two dwellings in what is now Exeter. They were the homes of James Willis and William McConnell. Proudfoot spent the night in McConnell's home which also served as a tavern for the area. Exeter eventually became a town of over 4,700 people. Paintings of some of Exeter's historical citizens, by the late artist Harry Burke, may be seen at the Exeter Legion Hall. Transportation the federal election campaign, November 1904. Exeter is located on the north-south Highway 4. At the north end of the community, Highway 4 intersects with County Road 83.

Origins  Route Agents and, later, Railway Post Office (RPO) clerks were placed on inland boat lines at a very early date; postmarks go back to 1857. By the 1890s the river packets and steamers on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers usually carried RPO mail units, such as the old Cairo & Memphis, and the Vicksburg & New Orleans. Many lakes had this service. In 1902, 82 clerks were serving on 49 boat routes. The last year-round service of this type was in the state of Washington, where the Bellingham & Anacortes lasted until 1950. The longest Boat RPOs operated between New York and San Juan, Puerto Rico, New York and the Canal Zone, plus several routes from Seattle, Washington to Alaska ports. These were discontinued at the onset of World War II.  Last services  Two Boat RPOs outlived their railway route counterparts. The last rail route made its final trip between New York and Washington, D.C. on June 30, 1977. The Wolfboro & Merrymount RPO lost its Boat RPO status upon its last trip of the season on Lake Winnipesaukee on September 15, 1978.

The first six were published in 1998‚Äì1999. The next six were published in 2001. The final issue was published in May 2004. Plot The hero Dynasty gathers her colleagues in the superhero group Freedom Machine to inform them of a new threat. Their former colleague, the massively powerful telekinetic Daedelus, has decided to take over the world. Worried about Daedelus' unparalleled power, the Freedom Machine decides to gather all the heroes they can to fight him. Meanwhile, Daedelus kills one of his former colleagues and destroys an advanced underwater civilization to keep them from interfering in his plans. The darkness powered superhero Shadowpax recounts to a group of young superheroes the story of the Freedom Machine's most challenging threat to date. Years ago, they had to do battle with Deathboy, a psychotic teenager protected by an impenetrable force field and with the ability to disintegrate anything he sees. The Freedom Machine battled Deathboy in a desert where he killed several superheroes before Shadowpax was able to trap him in a block of solid darkness, where he remains imprisoned in the Freedom Machine's headquarters. In his first strike Daedalus releases several prominent supervillains in order to keep his former colleagues occupied. These include Kid Babylon a young man who has an Elder God trapped in a box, Chaos Nation a composite being who absorbs others, the gigantic canine Thunderdog, and the supernatural Doctor Meggido. As the Freedom Machine confronts these villains, the superbeing Outrider returns to Earth, seeking revenge on Dynasty. He is killed by Ivanhoe, but not before severely mutilating Dynasty. The non-powered adventurer Johnny Venture and his group the Darkside Rangers, take possession of the Freedom Machine's headquarters under authority of the US government. They are looking for a solution to the superhuman problem. They free Deathboy from his prison of darkness and while he is unconscious they implant a bomb inside him. They use this to force Deathboy to agree to their demands. The Freedom Machine begin their assault on Daedelus' island headquarters, but he brings the fighting to an end when he threatens to destroy the Earth, a threat they believe he has the power to carry out. The Darkside Rangers send Deathboy parachuting towards the island, which he destroys. Venture then reneges on his deal and uses the bomb to kill Deathboy. It is revealed that Deathboy had not actually destroyed anyone. Instead all the people and objects he had \\"disintegrated\\" were actually transported to an alternate dimension. The Freedom Machine joyously greet their long lost colleagues. Daedelus then announces his intention to take over this new world, but he soon dies from a biological poison which he was exposed to during the fight.

Known as 620 KHB, the station operates with 5,500 watts daytime (reduced power at night) and airs a mix of health talk and paid programming with classic hits music in the morning, evening and overnight hours. It is also known for its weekend polka shows and ministries that broadcast on KHB. WKHB's studios are located in Greensburg, while its transmitter is located near Wendel, just south of Irwin. WKHB's high power on a low frequency yields what is generally considered to be the second- best daytime AM signal in the Pittsburgh area (behind KDKA), covering nearly two and a half million people (2.0mV/m) in various portions of five states. WKHB also simulcasts on FM translators 94.1 W231BM, 92.3 W222CB, and 102.1 W271CW. WKHB and its sister stations 770 WKFB and 103.1 WKVE are owned by Broadcast Communications Inc., which also owns and operates WANB-Waynesburg, Pennsylvania, which simulcast 1210 AM and 105.1 FM. History =Beginnings as WHJB= 620 began as WHJB, formerly licensed Greensburg. The station began as a daytime-only operation, operating at a power of 250 watts, non- directional. The station was founded by H.J. Brennen, whose initials the station call letters stood for. WHJB, doing business as Pittsburgh Radio Supply House, first operated beginning October 28, 1934 from a studio at 128 North Penn Avenue in Greensburg. WHJB, as the first radio station on the air in suburban Pittsburgh, experienced steady growth and prospered over its formative years, getting nighttime power authorization by 1955, as well as a daytime power increase, with power settings at 1,000 watts during the day, and 500 watts at night, adopting a directional antenna pattern with changing patterns for night and day operation. By 1960, the name of the licensee had changed its name to WHJB, Inc., though the station still was owned by the Brennen family. That changed in 1962 when control was transferred to others after the Brennen family's interests were sold to Robert Burstein, and then to general manager Melvin Goldberg by 1967. =WHJB-FM signs on= On November 1, 1964, WHJB welcomed WHJB-FM, its like-named FM sister station to the air. Though the stations shared identical call letters, they were initially programmed separately, until 1967, when several changes took place. That year, WHJB and its FM sister, by this time named WOKU-FM, now simulcasting for half the broadcast day, moved to new studios and offices at 227 West Otterman Street in Greensburg. The stations moved to another location at 245 Brown Street near the Greensburg city limits in 1974, where they remained for the rest of the 20th century. As \\"Disco 107\\" in 1979, WOKU won an award from Billboard magazine as \\"Large-Market Disco Station of the Year.\\" In 1980, WHJB upgraded its transmitting facilities again, increasing its power to 2,500 watts daytime and 500 watts at night, which it kept until shortly after its sale in 1996. WHJB's antenna array along U.S. Route 30 (four towers for the AM directional pattern, plus a fifth tower for the FM, later used as an auxiliary site) could be seen overlooking Greensburg for many years, but came down after the sale was completed. =1996 sale= The station was sold in 1996 to Broadcast Communications, Inc. Broadcast Communications, Inc. moved WHJB's transmitter site closer to Pittsburgh, raised its daytime power twice, and changed its community of license to Irwin, Pennsylvania, a nearby suburb of Pittsburgh. WHJB had always been primarily a Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania radio station while WKHB with its higher power and closer tower, aspires to serve the tri-state greater Pittsburgh area. Although the station continued to operate as a music-formatted, stand-alone AM outlet for several more years, the call letter change to WKHB in 1999 was more or less concurrent with a format switch to all paid programming. Music continues to air in the station's off-peak hours, 7:15 p.m. to 7:00 a.m., consisting of classic hits from the mid 60's to the mid 80's. On-air staff and programs Morning host and station manager Barry Banker celebrated 40 years with the station in 2006. Banker retired and was replaced in morning drive by Bill Korch from nearby WEDO. Veteran Pittsburgh on-air personality and programmer Clarke Ingram was associated with the station (and sister station WKFB) as Program Director and Operations Manager for several years in the mid-2000s. His voice is still heard on many of the station's recorded elements, as well as on WKFB. Caleb Michaels and Michael J. Daniels appear at various times, often at night, doing the classic hits format. Regular non-music programs include \\"Health Breakthroughs\\" with Dr. James Winer, \\"Alternatives to Medicine\\" with Dr. Martin Gallagher, and the daily Scriptural Rosary, which has now aired on Pittsburgh radio for over 45 years. There is an extended lineup of polka shows on Saturday and Sunday and a variety of local ministry programs broadcast on WKHB.

Biography Stewart was 12 years old when he began singing with his younger brothers Johnny, James, and Frank as the Four Stewart Brothers, and later went on to get their own radio show every Sunday for five years at WUST-AM in Washington, D.C. He was a graduate of Armstrong High School. Stewart made the transition to secular music by filling in occasionally for the Rainbows, a D.C. area vocal group led by the future soul star, Don Covay. It was through the Rainbows that Stewart met another aspiring singer, Marvin Gaye. Rock and roller Bo Diddley has been credited with discovering Stewart playing piano in Washington, D.C. in 1956 and inviting him to be one of his backup musicians. By 1955, this led to a recording contract with Diddley's label, Chess Records and Diddley played guitar on Stewart's 1956 recording of \\"Billy's Blues\\". A strong seller in Los Angeles, \\"Billy's Blues\\" reached the sales top 25 in Variety magazine. Stewart then moved to Okeh Records and recorded \\"Billy's Heartache\\", backed by the Marquees, another D.C. area group which featured Marvin Gaye. Back at Chess in the early 1960s, Stewart began working with A&R; man Billy Davis. He recorded a song called \\"Fat Boy\\" and then had additional success with his recordings of \\"Reap What You Sow\\" and \\"Strange Feeling\\", both making the Billboard Hot 100 and the Top 30 in the R&B; charts. Major chart success was not far away and in 1965, Stewart recorded two self-written songs, \\"I Do Love You\\" (#6 R&B;, #26 Pop), which featured his brother Johnny Stewart as one of the backing vocalists with his partner James English, and \\"Sitting in the Park\\" (#4 R&B;, #24 Pop). His idiosyncratic improvisational technique of doubling-up, scatting his words and trilling his lips made his style unique in the 1960s. In 1966, Stewart recorded the LP Unbelievable. The first single released from that album was Stewart's radical interpretation of the George Gershwin song, \\"Summertime\\", a Top 10 hit on both the pop and R&B; charts. The follow-up single was Stewart's cover version of the Doris Day hit \\"Secret Love\\", which reached the Pop Top 30 and just missed the Top 10 on the R&B; chart. Stewart continued to record throughout the remainder of the 1960s on Chess without major success. A weight problem worsened, and he developed diabetes. Stewart suffered minor injuries in a motorcycle accident in 1969. Health and death Stewart's weight caused him several health problems, culminating in diabetes, a condition that may have contributed to him having a motorcycle accident in 1969. He died in a broad-daylight car accident in January 1970, just two months prior to his 33rd birthday. The accident happened when the Ford Thunderbird that Stewart was driving approached a bridge across the Neuse River near Smithfield, North Carolina (presumably on Interstate 95). His car left the highway, ran along the median strip at a slight angle to the highway, struck the bridge abutment, and then plunged into the river, killing Stewart and his three passengers instantly. The other victims in the accident were members of Stewart's band: Norman P. Rich, 39, of Washington D.C., William Cathey, 32 of Charlotte, N.C., and Rico Hightower, 22 of Newark, New Jersey. The four musicians were driving to a nightclub show in Columbia, South Carolina at the time of the wreck. The car had been purchased only 12 days before and had been driven only 1,400 miles before the accident occurred. Stewart was buried in National Harmony Memorial Park in Landover, Maryland.Blues: A Regional Experience Lawsuit and trial Sarah Stewart, the executrix of his estate, sued Ford Motor Company on behalf of his estate, claiming mechanical failure was the cause of the accident. The first trial was won by Ford Motor Company, but on appeal the court ruled that the trial court's refusal to give the requested jury instructions was in error and ordered the case reversed and remanded. The case was then settled out of court. Musical legacy During the late 1970s and early 1980s, his music was popular among Latino, specifically Chicano, youth on the West Coast. Stewart was inducted into the Washington Area Music Association Hall of Fame in 2002. His version of \\"Summertime\\" was one of the songs featured on Bob Dylan's Theme Time Radio Hour show, and was one of the few artists Dylan actually responded about during his mainly fictitious email responses to listener questions. His version of \\"Summertime\\" was also featured in the last scene and on the soundtrack of the 2003 movie Stuck on You. His musical legacy is also being kept alive by several talented family members in his hometown of Washington D.C. Cousins Grace Ruffin who is a member of the 60‚Äôs group The Four Jewels, singer and musician Calvin C. Ruffin Jr. and local Washington, D.C. independent recording artist Dane Riley, continue to perform several of his hits during their concerts. NRBQ has performed \\"Sitting In The Park\\" as a fluctuating part of their set list since 1970. Three versions have been released by NRBQ on cd. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Billy Stewart among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. In Quentin Tarantino's \\"Once Upon A Time In ... Hollywood,\\" Billy Stewart's \\"Summertime\\" is featured in a scene where Brad Pitt's character, Cliff Booth, leaves his home and erratically drives off into the twilight.

It is one of the 8 graduate schools that comprise Tufts University. Founded in 1868 as Boston Dental College by Dr. Isaac J. Wetherbee, the university is the second oldest dental school in the city, and one of the oldest in the country. As of 2013, Tufts is the second largest dental school in the United States, with a class size of approximately 190 students per class. As with many medical and dental schools, acceptance to Tufts Dental Medicine is highly competitive, with a single digit acceptance rate of approximately 4%, and 2% for international students. Tufts Dental Medicine is world-renowned for its clinical training. Tufts Dental Medicine, the Harvard School of Dental Medicine, and the Henry M. Goldman School of Dental Medicine at Boston University comprise the three schools of dental medicine in the Boston metropolitan area. TUSDM educates both pre- doctoral and post-doctoral students. The majority of students pursue a Doctor of Dental Medicine (DMD) degree. In addition to the DMD degree, TUSDM offers combined DMD/MS (Master of Science in Dental Research) and DMD/MPH (Master of Public Health) degrees. Post-doctoral students, who have already obtained a DMD or DDS degree, can specialize in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Endodontics, Periodontics, Orthodontics, Pediatric Dentistry, Prosthodontics and Implant Dentistry, as well as certificate programs in Craniomandibular Disorders and Orofacial Pain, Advanced Dental Technology and Research Program, Implant Dentistry Fellowship, and Advanced Education in Esthetic Dentistry. In 2011, Dr. Huw F. Thomas, formerly Dean of the University of Alabama School of Dentistry was named the 16th Dean of TUSDM. That same year, TUSDM was nationally recognized for leadership in teaching, research, community service, and diversity by the American Dental Education Association (ADEA) Gies Foundation with the 2011 William J. Gies Award for Outstanding Achievement by an Academic Dental Institution. History Tufts College Dental and Medical Building 1907 Founded on June 3, 1868 as Boston Dental College by Dr. Isaac J. Wetherbee, a graduate of the first organized dental university in the United States, Baltimore College of Dental Surgery. The college was incorporated into Tufts College in 1899 and was located at 416 Huntington Avenue in Boston. By 1929, Tufts Medical and Dental College began an affiliation with the Boston Floating Hospital for Infants and Children, as well as the Boston Dispensary. This merger resulted in the creation of an association known as the New England Medical Center (NEMC), which would be the name of the hospital attached to the current day Tufts Dental School until the 1990s. The union was partially caused by the fire, and subsequent destruction of the USS Boston Floating Hospital (ID # 2366), a mobile hospital for sick children on Boston Harbor. Archived copy at the Library of Congress (May 8, 2013). In 1948, Tufts Medical and Dental College sold the Huntington Avenue buildings to Northeastern University, and relocated closer to NEMC at 136 Harrison Avenue. In 1954, Tufts Dental College became the \\"Tufts University School of Dental Medicine\\". The school would remain at the Harrison Avenue location until 1971, when it was moved to its current location, 1 Kneeland Street. The building was only 10 floors in height, but was designed with future expansion in mind. In 2009, the building was expanded by 5 floors, vertically. This was seen by the architectural world as unprecedented; the design and execution has won several architectural awards. In 2013, the University announced plans to refurbish the third and fourth clinical floors, to match the newly renovated second floor. Admissions For the 2010-2011 application cycle, 4,475 applications were received for the 184 seats available in the Class of 2015. The DAT Academic Average was 20, and a PAT Average of 20 While in the past international applicants were considered for admission to the School of Dental Medicine, for the 2012-2013 application cycle those applicants without US citizenship or permanent residency will not be considered for the DMD program. Student class profile Tufts Dental Building in Boston from the South There are approximately 4000 applicants each year and roughly 200 students enrolled per class, making it the second largest dental school in the United States. The Class of 2015 had an average age of 24; ranging from 21-38. The class was composed of students from 29 states. The School has over 7,000 alumni composed of individuals from all fifty states and thirty-nine countries. Nearly half of the Class of 2015 identifies as Asian (45%) and 49% of the Class is female. Curriculum The curriculum of Tufts University School of Dental Medicine (TUSDM) is a competency based curriculum. The D.M.D. program, which extends over a four-year period, consists of a series of: # didactic (lecture and seminar) # patient simulation (patient simulation clinic, introductory clinical experience, and workshop) # clinical (group practice, rotations and Community Service Learning Externship) experiences. Facilities In 2009, Tufts Dental completed a $68 million, five-floor vertical expansion. The vertical expansion houses two new clinical patient floors, a new 108-chair simulation lab and teaching facilities for students, as well as a Continuing Education conference center and administrative offices. Tufts University School of Dental Medicine pre-clinical simulation laboratory The design for the five-story expansion, by ARC/Architectural Resources Cambridge, integrates contemporary forms and materials within the framework of the existing building. In contrast to the heavier forms of the existing structure, the vertical addition uses a glass and aluminum curtain wall system and white metal panels, which is extended to the street level. The existing egress stair at the corner of the building has also been transformed into a glass beacon that marks the gateway to the Tufts Health Sciences Boston Campus. The project includes updates to the entire building‚Äôs infrastructure, incorporating new elevators and updated life safety systems, as well as a new generator. Tufts University School of Dental Medicine five-story Vertical Expansion Additionally, the expansion has helped different departments work together more effectively with the use of two internal stairs, one connecting the clinical floors and a second connecting the administrative and Continuing Education departments. Research Areas of research at Tufts Dental include: Bone Remodeling, Sj√∂gren‚Äôs Syndrome: Dry Mouth and Dry Eye, Dental Materials, Division of Public Health Research and Oral Medicine, Public Health and Community Service, Craniofacial and Molecular Genetics, Integrated Tissue Engineering, Biostatistics, Prosthodontics and Operative Dentistry, TMD and Orofacial Pain. Student organizations The School of Dental Medicine has over 20 student organizations. Some of the organizations present at Tufts Dental include: Delta Sigma Delta (DSD), American Student Dental Association (ASDA), and the Bates Student Research Group. American Student Dental Association (ASDA) The American Student Dental Association was established in 1971 to represent, serve and support the needs and interests of dental students. As a national professional organization, ASDA provides a forum for expression of dental student concerns. ASDA currently has more than 14,000 predoctoral members at each of the 55 U.S. dental school chapters. Bates- Student Research Group The Bates Student Research Group (SRG) is a student-run organization that promotes student research in dentistry and its related disciplines. Our main purpose is to foster an environment whereby students interested in enriching their dental education through research are encouraged to do so. Dean of the School of Dental Medicine Dr. Nadeem Karimbux has been named the 17th Dean of School of Dental Medicine on July 2019. Dr. Karimbux has been the associate dean for academic affairs and a professor of periodontology at the School of Dental Medicine since 2012. Born and raised in Nakuru, Kenya, Karimbux received his undergraduate degree from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and his Doctor of Dental Medicine from Harvard School of Dental Medicine. He also earned a Master‚Äôs of Medical Science in oral biology and Graduate Certificate in periodontology from Harvard School of Dental Medicine.https://now.tufts.edu/articles/nadeem-karimbux-named-dean- school-dental-medicine References Category:Dental schools in Massachusetts Dental Medicine Category:Educational institutions established in 1868 Category:University subdivisions in Massachusetts ","title":"Tufts University School of Dental Medicine"},{"id":"3025193","text":"Seattle's Strippergate is the name of a 2003 government scandal and criminal conspiracy masterminded by Frank Colacurcio Sr., a strip-club magnate, and Frank Colacurcio Jr., his son. Former Washington state governor Al Rosellini assisted the Colacurcios by lobbying six members of the Seattle City Council and raising funds for three of the politicians. The scandal is unrelated to the 2000 scandal in San Diego sometimes called by the same name. In June 2003, James Bush, a reporter for the North Seattle Sun, reported city council members Judy Nicastro, Jim Compton and Heidi Wills received large amounts of campaign donations from the Colacurcio family and their business associates. Eventually, investigators determined the campaign contributions totaled $36,000. The prosecutor found that no councilmember, Nicastro, Wills or Compton did anything wrong. At the same time, the Colacurcios were seeking to expand parking at Rick's, their strip club in the Lake City neighborhood of Seattle. The parking expansion required zoning changes and had been rejected in previous years by the city council. The parking expansion was opposed by the neighbors who lived behind Rick's nightclub. People who lived in Seattle in the 1950s and 1960s knew of Colacurcio Sr.'s reputation. He was known as \\"Seattle's longest-running crime figure, [and] often was portrayed by law- enforcement officials and the news media as one of Seattle's most notorious racketeering figures.\\" On June 16, 2003, in a 5‚Äì4 vote, the council approved the parking zoning changes allowing them to use their existing land for parking requested by the Colacurcios. Nicastro, Compton and Wills, who had received donations from the Colacurcios and their associates, voted in favor of the parking-lot expansion. This vote was consistent with all their land use votes. As the scandal blew up in the press, Seattle P-I writer Lewis Kamb first reported that City Hall insiders were referring to it as \\"StripperGate\\" during a July 26, 2003 profile of the elder Colacurcio and his family's notorious past. In part, the story read: The Council members returned all the money. After investigations by the Seattle Ethics and Elections Commission and the King County Prosecutor's Office, the Colarcurios' associates' donations were revealed to be \\"political money laundering\\" according to King County Prosecuting Attorney Norm Maleng. In order to circumvent campaign finance laws, the Colacurcios had given $36,000 to their associates with instructions to contribute the funds to Nicastro, Compton and Wills. In January 2008, the Colacurcios both pleaded guilty to felony charges and paid King County $20,000 in fines for criminal violations. In a civil suit brought by the Seattle Ethics and Elections Commission, the Colacurcios paid $55,000 in fines for breaking city election laws. Heidi Wills unsuccessfully attempted to return to the Seattle City Council in 2019.

The station also broadcasts on 97.5 FM. Known as \\"97.5 770 KFB\\", the station airs an oldies format featuring music from the 1950s, 1960s, and the early to mid 1970s. The station is very popular with the audience that prefers the older music and is the only station in southwestern Pennsylvania that plays an oldies format. WKFB is owned and operated by Broadcast Communications, Inc. History For many years this station was WBCW (1530), and for a brief period, WKTW. The station originally operated at 1530 kHz with a daytime-only power of 1,000 watts, with 250 watts during critical hours, barely reaching the fringes of Westmoreland County. WBCW was founded by broadcast engineer Albert Calisti, who first put it on the air back in 1974, having completed an eight-year stint as general manager of WTRA in Latrobe. Very much a family business, Calisti did the engineering and hosted a provocative and often amusing local talk show called \\"People Talk\\" weekday afternoons from 1:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. The show was so provocative that visitors to the Westmoreland County Court House in nearby Greensburg could hear WBCW playing up and down the halls in various row offices. It was well known that various politically involved citizens including those at the court house who held political positions listened to the show daily to make sure that Calisti was not talking about them. He was known to call certain people:\\"a kook\\". The show was so provocative that his wife, Verna found it necessary to keep the front entrance door to the radio station locked during most afternoons, fearing that unwanted visitors who were upset with Al's show would show up and cause an unwanted incident. But Al had a lighter side too, hosting a weekly polka music show on Saturdays called \\"Happy Music for Happy People\\". Either way, Al definitely was a character and made a lot of people smile. His wife Verna kept the books and sold airtime, and in the early years of the station operation their daughter Jacqueline Rae served as program director. The station had a limited number of other full-time and/or part-time employees outside of the Calisti family. Clair Thomas, who served as the station's news and music director and who hosted a daily music show and daily talk show and who did the noon news block as well as hosted tradio during the noon hour was part of the operation during the 1980s and 1990s. Another notable WBCW personality was Mark Kuhns, also known as Marko Polka who handled various shifts, usually after 3:00 p.m. during the 1980s and 1990s. The original format consisted of adult contemporary music from sign-on to 10:00 a.m. then a talk show from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. (noon), a noon news block from 12:00 pm to 12:35 p.m. followed by tradio until 1:00 p.m. then \\"People Talk\\" from 1:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. with music until sign-off at sundown which also included a 5:00 p.m. news block when daytime operational hours permitted the station to be on the air. The Calistis maintained ownership of the station which evolved to a full-time talk format with local and syndicated talk until 1998, when they sold it to Broadcast Communications, Inc. which had acquired Greensburg-based 620 WHJB (now WKHB)two years earlier in 1996. Al Calisti died of cancer seven years later. Under the new ownership, the station moved from its original location at 111 South Fourth Street in Jeannette to WHJB's building at 245 Brown Street in Greensburg. A frequency change to 770 was made in early 2004, giving the station much better coverage of the Pittsburgh market, allowing the station to reach all of Westmoreland, Fayette, Washington, and Allegheny counties as well as parts of Armstrong, Indiana, Somerset, Greene, Beaver, and Butler counties too.

He was a general in the British Army. Early life He entered the army at the age of fifteen as an ensign, in the 53rd Regiment of Foot. After attending Eton College, he studied at the University of G√∂ttingen for two years, and subsequently purchased a captaincy in the 42nd Highland Regiment in 1771. He saw action during the American Revolutionary War; in 1777, he was appointed a major of the 53rd, and he commanded the light infantry companies at the Battle of Saratoga (1777), and surrendered there with Burgoyne. He was released from captivity in 1779. Around this time he founded the famous Haigh Ironworks with his partners, his brother Robert and James Corbett. Marriage On 1 June 1780, he married his first cousin, Elizabeth Bradshaigh Dalrymple, who had inherited Haigh Hall and estate, in Haigh near Wigan, Lancashire. They had five children: *Elizabeth Keith Lindsay (died 1825), second great grandmother of Sir Oswald Ernald Mosley, 6th Baronet *James Lindsay, 24th Earl of Crawford (1783‚Äì1869) *Edwin Lindsay *Charles Robert Lindsay (1784‚Äì1835) *Anne Lindsay (died 1846) He was subsequently promoted to the rank of colonel and made lieutenant-colonel commandant of the second 71st Regiment of Foot made up of the four additional or recruiting companies of the 71st Highlanders in Scotland.Letter from War Office to Sir Guy Carleton, 30 April 1782, PRO 30/55/39, document 4519, page 1, National Archives, Kew, United Kingdom He was chosen a representative peer for Scotland in 1784, and was re-elected through 1807, inclusive. On 27 August 1789 he was appointed colonel of the 63rd Regiment of Foot, and was promoted major-general in 1793. Later life Commander of the forces in Jersey from 1793 to 1794, he was then appointed Governor of Jamaica. He was governor when the Second Maroon War broke out, and he mishandled the situation so badly that he allowed a minor dispute over land to mushroom into a costly conflict that lasted months.R.C. Dallas, The History of the Maroons (London: T.N. Longman, 1803), Vol. 1, pp. 167‚Äì9.George Wilson Bridges, The Annals of Jamaica (London: John Murray, 1828), Vol. II, p. 258. In early 1795, worried at the prospect of an uprising, Balcarres sent representatives to Havana to purchase 100 Cuban bloodhounds, which in his words were '[a] breed which are used to hunt down runaway negroes'. When the dogs arrived in December 1795, with Spanish handlers, Balcarres was so impressed by their ferocity he considered sending them to support British troops in Haiti. Balcarres underestimated the guerrilla fighting capabilities of the Jamaican Maroons, who had the better of the skirmishes with the soldiers under the command of the governor's generals. Eventually, one of his generals, George Walpole, persuaded the leader of the Maroons of Cudjoe's Town (Trelawny Town), Montague James, to surrender on condition they would not be deported. However, Balcarres reversed Walpole's promise and transported the Trelawny Maroons to Nova Scotia.Mavis Campbell, The Maroons of Jamaica 1655-1796: a History of Resistance, Collaboration & Betrayal (Massachusetts: Bergin & Garvey, 1988), pp. 209‚Äì249. In the aftermath of the Second Maroon War, Balcarres struggled to disperse the runaway community of Cuffee (Jamaica) in the Cockpit Country in western Jamaica. Hundreds of runaway slaves secured their freedom by fighting alongside Trelawny Town in the Second Maroon War.Michael Sivapragasam (2019) \\"The Second Maroon War: Runaway Slaves fighting on the side of Trelawny Town\\", Slavery & Abolition, DOI: 10.1080/0144039X.2019.1662683 https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/PEX47HQYJUGEEZRJY6DE/full?target=10.1080/0144039X.2019.1662683 Retrieved 10 September 2019. He was promoted lieutenant-general in 1798, and resigned the governorship in 1801. On 25 September 1803 he was promoted to general. After his return from the American Revolution, he was introduced to Benedict Arnold, who had led several attacks on his position at Saratoga. Balcarres snubbed Arnold as a traitor, and a duel ensued, neither party being injured. After being maimed in an accident he retired to the family's second home at Haigh Hall, near Wigan. On his death he was succeeded by his eldest son James, the 7th Earl. After James had successfully pressed his claim to the title of Earl of Crawford in 1848, the title was conferred posthumously on Alexander, even though he had not claimed it himself. His younger son, Edwin Lindsay, an Indian army officer, was declared insane after refusing to fight in a duel and was sent to Papa Stour in the Shetland islands. He spent 26 years there as a prisoner before the Quaker preacher Catherine Watson arranged for his release in 1835.\\"General Alexander Lindsay, 6th Earl of Balcarres\\" The Peerage.com.

Despite there being a distance of eight years between his first and last One Day International, Callaghan only played 29 times for South Africa. He was born at Queenstown, Eastern Cape. Domestic career His first-class career lasted 19 years, with time being spent in England with Suffolk and Nottinghamshire. Primarily a right-handed batsman, he was also a handy pace bowler. Callaghan's cousin, Justin Kemp, played Test and ODI cricket for South Africa. Callaghan was a member of a South African Schools side in 1983 side which toured England under the name Albatrosses. That side contained Mark Rushmere (also a Cricketer of the Year), Dave Rundle, Daryll Cullinan, Meyrick Pringle and Salieg Nackerdien, among others. In Provincial cricket, he played much of his career in an Eastern Province side which contained the strongest batting lineup at the time in the country, Kepler Wessels, Phil Amm, Mark Rushmere and Kenny McEwan International career The defining moment of his international career was an innings of 169 not out, made against New Zealand at Centurion during the Mandela Trophy in 1994. Opening the batting, Callaghan made 169 off 143 balls and hit 4 sixes. This happens to be the highest score in ODIs by a batsman, who have scored only one 50-plus knock in their career. He also took his career best figures of 3 for 32 and was the obvious choice for man of the match. Callaghan's innings was his first after recovering from testicular cancer. In February 2020, he was named in South Africa's squad for the Over-50s Cricket World Cup in South Africa. However, the tournament was cancelled during the third round of matches due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The group made their name in the OPM (Original Pilipino Music) scene in 2006 with their sophomore effort Noontime Show with songs such as \\"Akin Ka Na Lang\\" and \\"Beer.\\" Members * Jazz Nicolas - lead vocals, drums, piano, keyboards, keytar (1996‚Äìpresent) * Jugs Jugueta - co-lead vocals, rhythm guitar, percussion, keyboards (1996‚Äìpresent) * Kelvin Yu - bass guitar, backing vocals (1997‚Äìpresent); lead guitar (1996-1997) * Chino Singson - lead guitar, backing vocals (1997‚Äìpresent) =Former member= *Haji Cruz - bass guitar, backing vocals (1996-1997) History =Early years= Formed in 1996, the band consisted of Jazz Nicolas, Jugs Jugueta, Kelvin Yu (then on lead guitar) and Hadrian \\"Haji\\" Cruz (then on bass). The band performed at various school-based events and competitions with a handful of original songs and Beatles covers. Unfortunately, communication and scheduling issues forced Cruz to leave the group. This predicament forced Yu to take up the bass guitar vacancy, effectively making the band a trio. The group continued as a trio until the middle of 1997, when a common friend in the Ateneo Musicians' Pool recruited Chino Singson to play guitar with the group at a school event. Singson eventually went on to become a permanent member, which solidified the group's current lineup. In 1998 the band put together Revenge of the Unsigned, their first official CD. They did this with the help of their manager Earnest Mangulabnan-Zabala, Eraserheads, Ely Buendia, Buddy Zabala and Romel \\"Sancho\\" Sanchez (Loquy, Cynthia Alexander). The band intended for Revenge to be their independently released debut album in the event that no major record label would sign them. As luck would have it, then-A&R; manager at Viva/Neo Records Mike Dizon (Teeth, Sandwich) got hold of Revenge. He helped push for Viva executives to sign the band and eventually release Little Monsters Under Your Bed. Little Monsters, the band's first major-label album, was released in 2001 and contained songs from Revenge plus new compositions by Nicolas and Jugueta. The song \\"Antipara\\" was probably the most well-known song on the album. The release of the album was somewhat ill-timed as its glossy pop-rock sound was an aberration in the Korn-influenced OPM Rock landscape of the late 1990s to early 2000s. =Breakthrough success= In 2005, the Itchyworms released Noontime Show, which gave them modest national success and industry recognition. Buddy Zabala and Raimund Marasigan, by this time both former Eraserheads, co-produced the album with the group. Most notably, the album went on to become Album of the Year at the 2006 NU Rock Awards, with Nicolas winning Drummer of the Year and the group winning Producer of the Year jointly with Marasigan and Zabala. =Commercial breakthrough= The popularity and radio-friendliness of the band's songs have gained the attention of several well-known commercial brands in the Philippines. The song \\"Akin Ka Na Lang\\" has been used by both KFC and Close-Up in separate television advertisements. In 2008, Pringles used \\"Salapi\\" for a nationwide campaign/songwriting contest. In addition Enervon, Close-Up and San Miguel Beer have also commissioned the band to write original songs for their advertising campaigns. The band also wrote and performed \\"Kabataang Pinoy\\", the theme song for the first season of ABS-CBN's Pinoy Big Brother: Teen Edition. This is arguably the band's most widely publicized song because of the series' popularity and media exposure. They also performed the station ID \\"Para Sa 'yo Kapatid\\" of TV5. = Recent achievements = In early 2016, songwriter Davey Langit asked the band to interpret \\"Dalawang Letra,\\" his entry into the Himig Handog P-Pop Love Songs competition. The song went on to win top prize at the finals night in April. Only a few months later in July, the band‚Äôs drummer/vocalist Jazz Nicolas with songwriting partner Wally Acolola, won the PhilPop grand prize with their composition \\"Di Na Muli,\\" also performed by the itchyworms. In August of the same year, the band released \\"Pariwara,\\" a song written in collaboration with Ely Buendia. The new release blends the best of their songwriting sensibilities. According to Buendia, the song had been in his chest of unfinished ideas since the days of the Eraserheads. The song remained untouched until early 2016, when vocalist Jugs Jugueta asked after any partial songs Buendia may have had lying around. Buendia gave the Itchyworms ‚ÄúPariwara,‚Äù and in short order, Jugueta and Jazz Nicolas delivered more lyrics and a new bridge. Shortly thereafter, Ely and the Itchyworms got together at his home studio, known as the Bunker, to hash out a final arrangement. Influences Although the individual members of the band draw on distinct influences, their common affection for The Beatles and The Eraserheads heavily defines the quartet's musical sound. Discography To date the Itchyworms have released five full-length studio albums and one EP. They have also contributed songs to numerous compilations, most notably including the Kami nAPO Muna tribute albums. In 2014 they launched their fourth full-length studio album, After All This Time. This new deluxe edition of the album contains six bonus tracks aside from the ten main tracks. These include the current single Ayokong Tumanda, the title track After All This Time, and a remake of the classic Juan dela Cruz song \\"Panahon.\\" =Studio albums= *Little Monsters Under Your Bed (Viva/Neo Records, 2001) *Noontime Show (Universal Records, 2005) *Self-Titled (Sony BMG Philippines, 2008) *After All This Time (Independently released, 2013) *Waiting For The End To Start (Sony Music Philippines, 2020) = EPs = * And The Worm Jumped Over The Moon (Independently released, 2003) * After All This Time (Independently released, 2013) =Compilation albums= * \\"Happy House\\" - Songs from NU107 In The Raw (Sony Music, 1998, also re-recorded for Little Monsters Under Your Bed) * Pulp Freakshow (Viva/Neo Records, 2001) * Gimik Nation (Viva/Neo Records, 2002) * \\"Awit Ng Barkada\\" - Kami nAPO Muna (Universal Records, 2006) * \\"Season Of Smiles\\" - Close-Up Season of Smiles Christmas CD (Universal Records, 2006) * Astig...The Biggest Band Hits (Universal Records, 2006) * AYUZ!

Born in Borgo San Donnino (now Fidenza) to a beggar-woman and an unknown father, he was picked up in the street by Cardinal Giovanni Maria Ciocchi del Monte and given a position in the household of the Cardinal's brother, Baldovino. Cardinal Giovanni del Monte was elected Pope in 1550, taking the name Julius III. He subsequently arranged for Baldovino to adopt Innocenzo, and appointed him as Cardinal- Nephew - the papacy's chief diplomatic and political agent. He proved totally unsuited to any of these offices, and his continuing relationship with Julius, whose bed he openly shared, created considerable scandal both inside and outside the Church. After Julius's death, he was shunned and ignored. Despite committing both rape and murder, he managed to retain his cardinal's hat and was permitted to return to Rome following several periods of banishment. His death passed unremarked, and he was buried in the Del Monte family chapel in Rome.  Early life  Innocenzo was born in Borgo San Donnino (now Fidenza) to a beggar-woman and an unknown father. As a boy he was illiterate but vivacious and good-looking. He left home at an extremely early age and made his way to Piacenza, where, at around 13 or 14, he found a position in the household of the city governor, Baldovino Ciocchi del Monte, as a valero, a menial role combining the offices of footman and dogsbody. His father may have been a soldier who had served with Baldovino, which would explain how he came into the household; although alternative stories were told that he had been picked up in the streets by Baldovino's brother, Cardinal Giovanni Maria Ciocchi del Monte.. He certainly quickly became a favourite of Giovanni Maria, who placed him in charge of his pet monkey and appointed him provost of the cathedral chapter of Arezzo, a title involving only nominal duties but with certain rights of income. Aldrich, p. 211  Favourite of Pope Julius  In February 1550 Cardinal Giovanni del Monte was elected pope as Julius III, and immediately made the boy a Cardinal. Two years later, faced with hostility to Innocenzo from the other Cardinals and a gathering move to have his position annulled on the basis of his illegitimacy and age, Julius had him adopted into the Del Monte family and decreed his year of birth as 1532, although this had previously been unknown. Pope Julius III made Del Monte a cardinal. The relationship between the two caused scandal in Rome Attempts to give the boy an education which could have prepared him for ecclesiastic office had already proven useless ‚Äì \\"a few social graces, a few bits of knowledge, perhaps about the glories of the Classical world, and Innocenzo's formal education was over.\\" The new Cardinal was given numerous important and lucrative positions, including Abbot commendatario of the abbeys of Saint-Michel du Tr√©port in Normandy, S. Zeno in Verona, and of the abbeys of S. Saba, Miramondo, and of Grottaferrata, Frascati. Most significantly, Julius named him Cardinal Nephew, effectively putting him in charge of all papal correspondence. But the role of secretary to the papacy proved manifestly beyond Innocenzo's abilities, and so, in order to find a way for his favourite to retain the appearance of power without having any real responsibility, Julius upgraded a hitherto minor position, that of secretary intimus, which, as Cardinal Secretary of State, was eventually to become the highest of Vatican offices. Innocenzo, although relieved of all real duties, continued to be showered with benefices and high offices, much to the disgust of his fellow cardinals. Cardinals who were more sensitive to the need to reform the mores of the Church in order to combat the Protestant Reformation protested in vain against Innocenzo's elevation. Rumours also circulated around European courts The Venetian ambassador, Matteo Dandolo, wrote that Cardinal Del Monte \\"was a little scoundrel\\", and that the Pope \\"took him [Innocenzo] into his bedroom and into his own bed as if he were his own son or grandson\\". Onofrio Panvinio wrote that Julius was \\"excessively given to intemperance in a life of luxuriousness and to his libido,\\" and, more explicitly characterized him as \\"puerorum amoribus implicitus\\" ('entangled in love for boys'). One more mocking rumour made the rounds in Rome, saying that Innocenzo had been made a cardinal as a reward for his being the keeper of the pope's monkey. The French poet Joachim du Bellay, who lived in Rome during this period, wrote in 1555: \\"Yet seeing a footman, a child, a beast,/ a rascal, a poltroon made a cardinal / for having taken care of a monkey well, / a Ganymede wearing the red hat on his head / ...these are miracles, my dear Morel, that take place in Rome alone.\\"Joachim Du Bellay, Les Regrets, Sonnet CV (Paris, 1555), cited in Robert Aldrich, Garry Wotherspoon, eds, Who's who in gay and lesbian history: from antiquity to World War II (Routledge, 2002), page 278. Innocenzo's affair with his future sister-in-law, the noted poetess and favorite in the papal court, Ersilia Cortese, resulted in scandal. Julius considered demoting him from the cardinalate after having compromised the pope's credibility. In 1562 he was given the titular church of San Callisto.  Crimes and banishment  After the death of Julius, Innocenzo took part in the two papal conclaves of 1555. In 1559, on the way to a third conclave from Venice he murdered two men, father and son in Nocera Umbra who had \\"uttered ill words about him\\". For this crime he was arrested and imprisoned in the Castel Sant'Angelo, by order of Pope Pius IV; and the following year he was moved to the abbey of Montecassino, and placed in solitary confinement. Following the intervention of Cosimo I de' Medici, duke of Florence, Innocenzo was released but nevertheless forced to face a fine of 100,000 scudi, and threatened with the stripping of his cardinalate. From Rome, Innocenzo was banished to Tivoli, but returned to take part in the conclave of 1564. He also participated in the conclave of 1565‚Äì1566, which elected Pope Pius V; because of his aura of mischief, the guards searched him and discovered a note hidden in his cloak which contained forbidden information; this discovery caused an incredible stir and from that moment until the end of the conclave, Innocenzo and his conclavists were guarded more closely than any other cardinal in the conclave. In 1567, Innocenzo was accused of raping two low-class women in Brevia, near Siena. Charges were brought against him and he was brought to the Vatican with two Theatine priests assigned to act as guards. An investigation recommended against his execution or degradation, but he was nevertheless once again banished by Pope Pius V to Montecassino and then Bergamo. From there, Innocenzo worked with friendly cardinals to petition the new pope to release him from the monastery. To strengthen the case for his release, and to demonstrate that his outlook and attitude had changed, he began to project the image of a reformed prelate.

Gregory (1780‚Äì1866), who served from the War of 1812 to the Civil War. Gregory was launched by the Todd-Pacific Ship Building Co., Tacoma, Washington, 8 May 1944; sponsored by Miss Ann McGuigan, daughter of Captain McGuigan, superintendent of construction at Tacoma; and commissioned 29 July 1944, Commander Bruce McCandless commanding.  1944 ‚Äì 1947  After shakedown along the West Coast, Gregory sailed for the Pacific with Hull (DD-802), reaching Pearl Harbor on 23 October 1944. Two months of local operations terminated in January 1945 as Gregory began practice for the impending invasion of Iwo Jima, next-to-last great campaign of the long and bloody Pacific war. Gregory sailed for the island 22 January, arriving off Iwo Jima via Saipan and Eniwetok on D-day, 19 February. For the next month she remained off the rocky coast under almost constant fire to screen transports and provide fire support for the invasion forces. Departing Iwo Jima 15 March, Gregory reached Saipan 4 days later to prepare for her role in the Okinawa campaign. USS Gregory in 1944. Okinawa, last step prior to invasion of the Japanese home islands themselves, involved over a thousand ships and half a million men, under Admiral Raymond A. Spruance, in the Pacific's war largest amphibious effort. Gregory joined this modern armada as it sailed from Saipan 27 March and was off Okinawa 1 April 1945 as the first waves of Marines waded ashore to bloody battle. Her task group, under Admiral Jerauld Wright, conducted a \\"demonstration landing\\" on the southeast coast, hoping to distract some Japanese attention from the actual invasion along Okinawa's western coast. This diversion complete, Gregory remained off Okinawa on patrol and radar picket station. On the afternoon of 8 April, Gregory‚Äôs lookouts spotted three Japanese planes coming in out of the setting sun, a favorite kamikaze device. One of the suicide craft, pieces of fuselage spinning wildly off as Gregory‚Äôs guns registered hit after hit, crashed into the destroyer amidships just above the waterline to port. Gregory shuddered under the impact and began to slow in the water as power failed in her forward engine and fire rooms flooded. The two other kamikazes mercilessly pressed on their attack, but the wounded DD downed both of them in blazing gunfire. Gregory then steamed to the anchorage at Kerama Retto for temporary repairs, and on 19 April departed Okinawa. After escorting the aircraft carrier Intrepid (CV-11) to Pearl Harbor, she sailed for San Diego, reaching there 18 May for battle repairs. While Gregory was still in overhaul, the Japanese surrendered and the destroyer was placed in inactive status, in commission in reserve, at San Diego. She decommissioned 15 January 1947.  1951 ‚Äì 1964  Gregory‚Äôs rest was to be brief, as Communist forces launched their war in Korea 24 June 1950 and the U.S. Navy joined United Nations forces; she recommissioned 27 April 1951, Comdr. H. C. Lank in command. Reaching Yokosuka, Japan, via Pearl Harbor and Midway 16 August 1951, Gregory immediately began patrol duty along the Korean coast. Her principal duties were screening American carriers, such as Essex (CV-9) and Boxer (CV-21), from which air strikes against North Korean positions and supply lines were launched; blockading the coast, and participating in coastal bombardment as the tide of war ebbed and flowed along the Korean peninsula. In addition, she was frequently assigned to the Formosa patrol, intended to prevent Communist action against the beleaguered republic. Here Gregory came under fire from mainland Communist Chinese shore batteries. While on a search- and-rescue (SAR) mission for a downed P2V 19 January 1953, she closed to within 8,000 yards of Nan-ao Tao, an island just off the China coast that had fallen to the Communists on 3 March 1950 in the Battle of Nan'ao Island. Though shore batteries opened fire on her. Gregory did not return fire, instead clearing the area immediately to continue her SAR mission. After the Korean Armistice ended the shooting war in August 1953, Gregory returned to a peacetime routine of local operations out of San Diego interspersed with yearly deployments, usually 6 months long, to the Far East. These deployments took her to Yokosuka, Sasebo, Hong Kong, Bangkok, Sydney, Okinawa, the Philippines, and Formosa for training maneuvers with American and other warships. In the fall of 1958 Gregory spent a tension-filled 2¬Ω months off the China coast during one of the periodic intensification of the Quemoy-Matsu crisis. Gregory earned the Battle Efficiency \\"E\\" three times during her post- war career ‚Äî 1955, 1956, and 1959. Gregory was decommissioned at San Diego, Calif. on 1 February 1964 and entered the reserve. She was struck from the Navy List 1 May 1966, renamed Indoctrinator, and served as an inoperable trainer at San Diego from 20 May 1966 to 8 January 1971. The ship was grounded on San Clemente Island, Southern California on 4 March 1971 to serve as a target.

Although this branch of the service had been in charge of all transit mail, some parts had little to do with railroads, even though they were still the most important part of the service. In 1950, of the 32,000 clerks assigned to the PTS, only about 16,000 actually worked on trains. The remainder were in terminals, transfer offices, Air Mail Facility, Highway Post Offices (HPO), administrative offices, etc. Boat Railway Post Office (Boat RPO), Streetcar Railway Post Offices, and the Seapost Service had already been discontinued. The name of the Chief Clerk's office was changed to District Superintendent's office. During the preceding decades, only one or two clerks per year had lost their lives in wrecks and several years saw no fatalities. When Pennsylvania Railroad's crack \\"Red Arrow,\\" New York City, New York & Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Railway Post Office (RPO) Train 68, derailed in 1947 at Bennington Curve (West of Altoona, Pennsylvania), killing six clerks and badly injuring others, the whole country was shocked. Even with all the trains that had been discontinued, the several round trips of RPO service on trunk lines, along with the expanded service and the star route highway services connecting the RPOs, maintained very good mail service through the 1950s. In the 1950s the Post Office Department turned the supervision of what had been the PTS Terminals over to the postmasters where the terminals were located. Discontinuance of the Mobile Units The HPO and RPO routes were collectively referred to as Mobile Units. The next move by the Post Office Department, in 1960, was to put each PTS District Superintendent's office under a postmaster, calling it the Mobile Unit Section, c/o Postmaster. This put all RPO clerks under postmasters. When there was no longer a surplus of RPO clerks from discontinued lines to fill vacancies on lines still operating, both subs and regulars from the post office roster were used. This eliminated the need for PTS civil service examinations. In 1963, the Sectional Center concept of transit mail service was announced, along with the introduction of a ZIP Code on mail to facilitate mechanized processing. The ZIP Code made it possible to distribute all mail by numbers with machines holding the routing associated for each address. This was a far cry from the knowledge that was necessary before when Mobile Unit distribution clerks were expected to know the routing for several thousand post offices in their assignment. There was no place in the new set-up for an RPO service. This development gave the railroads, knowing they were going to lose the mail revenue, an excuse to get out of the unprofitable passenger train business, something that they had wanted to do for years. After that, when a train was discontinued, instead of moving the RPO car on to another set of trains still operating, the RPO service was also discontinued. Within about four years there was only one round trip of RPO service left on practically all the trunk lines, and their value was minimal. It came as no surprise to the railroads or to the remaining RPO clerks when, on April 21, 1968, Assistant Postmaster General Hartigan issued a news release concerning RPO service. It stated that RPO cars on 162 passenger trains in the nation would be phased out of service by the end of the year, affecting 2,224 postal workers. The RPO clerks who were furloughed had a choice: they were placed in post offices at or near their homes, or they retired. If a clerk found no assignment in his grade at the post office assigned, he could keep his higher grade for two years, after which he had to take a reduction. With one exception, the phasing out was a success. The New York, New York & Washington, DC RPO, which covered the highest populated corridor in the nation, continued to operate until July 1, 1977. On a part of this same line, between Philadelphia and Washington, the first recorded \\"route agent\\" had been assigned to accompany the mail, 140 years earlier. The USPS continued to use regular scheduled Amtrak passenger trains to haul the mail on this line. On October 30, 1984, a \\"mail-only\\" train service was inaugurated between Washington, D.C., and Springfield/Boston, MA with a timetable tailored specifically to meet the postal service requirements. The northbound train was named \\"The Fast Mail\\" (train #12, later #190) departing Washington daily at 3 AM and the southbound \\"The Mail Express\\" (#13). Eventually, all mail transportation on Amtrak was discontinued by 2005 under the administration of David L. Gunn. References *Wilking, Clarence.

This was especially noteworthy because the NBA became the first major professional sports league to implement such a rule, although National Hockey League rules state that a player is supposed to wear a jacket and tie to games and on charters if not told otherwise by the head coach or general manager. The dress code went into effect at the start of the 2005‚Äì06 NBA season. Details of the dress code Stern's dress code stated that all players must dress in business or conservative attire while arriving and departing during a scheduled game, on the bench while injured, and when conducting official NBA business (press interviews, charity events, etc.). The new dress code banned fashions most often associated with hip-hop culture, specifically: jerseys, jeans, hats, do-rags, T-shirts, large jewelry, sneakers and timber boots (specifically, Timberland-type boots). This particular clothing is not allowed to be worn by players to interviews, games (on and off the bench), charity events, or any other occasion affiliated with the NBA and its developmental league (currently the G League). Violators of the dress code are fined and may be suspended with repeat offenses. The dress code was developed with the intention of combating image problems that had plagued the NBA in recent history. Under current NBA dress regulations, if a player does not dress to participate in a game, he must dress in a manner suitable for a coach. In the NBA, a suit or a sport coat is required for coaches, as well as a necktie. Supporting arguments The league's image was in bad shape following the Pacers‚ÄìPistons brawl in 2004. Supporters also claim that most businesses require their employees to adhere to a dress code of some kind so the NBA is not making any unusual demands. Moreover, the NBA was not requiring players to wear a suit and tie, as had been rumored initially. Further, many NBA teams already had dress codes, as dictated by coaches or general managers. Penalties for non-compliance usually involved fines such as having to pay for one's own airfare to wherever the team was going, rather than flying on the team charter. Opposing arguments Critics such as Allen Iverson, Stephen Jackson and Paul Pierce claim that the dress code will not change a person's character regardless of what type of clothing they wear, and that associating hip-hop style of dress with crime or a bad image is racist. Iverson was also quoted to say, \\"the dress code is not who I am and doesn't allow me to express myself.\\" Many NBA and non-NBA sports figures also claim that it targets young black males and is a slap against hip-hop culture. Most NBA players are sponsored by casual wear brands such as Nike, Adidas, Puma and Converse. Impact Writing for Rolling Stone, Zack Graham said that although players were initially critical of the dress code, \\"Over the years, NBA players accepted, then embraced and eventually began to have fun with the new dress code, changing men's fashion in the process.\\" References External links *NBA Dress Code specifics at NBA.com Dress code Dress code Category:Clothing controversies Category:African-American-related controversies Category:Workwear Category:Casual wear it:National Basketball Association#Codice di abbigliamento ","title":"NBA dress code"},{"id":"3025249","text":"Murray George Ross, (April 12, 1910 - July 20, 2000) was a Canadian sociologist, author, and academic administrator.

The SnapPeaKernel is released under GNU GPL 2+ReadMe file for the SnapPea kernel, accessed 2013-09-06. as is SnapPy. Algorithms and functions At the core of SnapPea are two main algorithms. The first attempts to find a minimal ideal triangulation of a given link complement. The second computes the canonical decomposition of a cusped hyperbolic 3-manifold. Almost all the other functions of SnapPea rely in some way on one of these decompositions. =Minimal ideal triangulation= SnapPea inputs data in a variety of formats. Given a link diagram, SnapPea can ideally triangulate the link complement. It then performs a sequence of simplifications to find a locally minimal ideal triangulation. Once a suitable ideal triangulation is found, SnapPea can try to find a hyperbolic structure. In his Princeton lecture notes, Thurston noted a method for describing the geometric shape of each hyperbolic tetrahedron by a complex number and a set of nonlinear equations of complex variables whose solution would give a complete hyperbolic metric on the 3-manifold. These equations consist of edge equations and cusp (completeness) equations. SnapPea uses an iterative method utilizing Newton's method to search for solutions. If no solution exists, then this is reported to the user. The local minimality of the triangulation is meant to increase the likelihood that such a solution exists, since heuristically one might expect such a triangulation to be \\"straightened\\" without causing degenerations or overlapping of tetrahedra. From this description of the hyperbolic structure on a link complement, SnapPea can then perform hyperbolic Dehn filling on the cusps to obtain more hyperbolic 3-manifolds. SnapPea does this by taking any given slopes which determine certain Dehn filling equations (also explained in Thurston's notes), and then adjusting the shapes of the ideal tetrahedra to give solutions to these equations and the edge equations. For almost all slopes, this gives an incomplete hyperbolic structure on the link complement, whose completion gives a hyperbolic structure on the Dehn- filled manifold. Its volume is the sum of the volumes of the adjusted tetrahedra. =Canonical decomposition= SnapPea is usually able to compute the canonical decomposition of a cusped hyperbolic 3-manifold from a given ideal triangulation. If not, then it randomly retriangulates and tries again. This has never been known to fail. The canonical decomposition allows SnapPea to tell two cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds apart by turning the problem of recognition into a combinatorial question, i.e. checking if the two manifolds have combinatorially equivalent canonical decompositions. SnapPea is also able to check if two closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds are isometric by drilling out short geodesics to create cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds and then using the canonical decomposition as before. The recognition algorithm allow SnapPea to tell two hyperbolic knots or links apart. Weeks, et al., were also able to compile different censuses of hyperbolic 3-manifolds by using the algorithm to cull lists of duplicates. Additionally, from the canonical decomposition, SnapPea is able to: *Compute the Ford domain *Compute the symmetry group =Computable invariants= =Censuses= SnapPea has several databases of hyperbolic 3-manifolds available for systematic study. *Cusped census *Closed census See also * Regina incorporates aspects of SnapPea. * Computational topology References External links * SnapPea Jeff Weeks' site * SnapPy Culler and Dunfield's extension * Orb Damian Heard's extension, allows : :*hyperbolic manifolds with totally geodesic boundary :*orbifolds where the orbifold locus contains trivalent vertices Category:3-manifolds Category:Numerical software Category:Free software programmed in C Category:Free mathematics software ","title":"SnapPea"},{"id":"3025259","text":"State Highway 13 (SH 13) was a state highway in the U.S. state of Texas that ran from Amarillo due west to the New Mexico border near Glenrio, Texas.

Types of states Ternary computing deals with three discrete states, but the ternary digits themselves can be defined in different ways: * Unbalanced Trinary ‚Äì {0,1,2} * Fractional Unbalanced Trinary ‚Äì {0,1/2,1} * Balanced Trinary ‚Äì {‚àí1,0,1} * Unknown-State Logic ‚Äì {F,?,T} * Trinary Coded Binary ‚Äì {T,F,T} History One early calculating machine, built entirely from wood by Thomas Fowler in 1840, operated in balanced ternary. The first modern, electronic ternary computer, Setun, was built in 1958 in the Soviet Union at the Moscow State University by Nikolay Brusentsov,. and it had notable advantages over the binary computers that eventually replaced it, such as lower electricity consumption and lower production cost. In 1970 Brusentsov built an enhanced version of the computer, which he called Setun-70. In the United States, the ternary computing emulator Ternac working on a binary machine was developed in 1973. The ternary computer QTC-1 was developed in Canada. Balanced ternary Ternary computing is commonly implemented in terms of balanced ternary, which uses the three digits ‚àí1, 0, and +1. The negative value of any balanced ternary digit can be obtained by replacing every + with a ‚àí and vice versa. It is easy to subtract a number by inverting the + and ‚àí digits and then using normal addition. Balanced ternary can express negative values as easily as positive ones, without the need for a leading negative sign as with unbalanced numbers. These advantages make some calculations more efficient in ternary than binary. Considering that digit signs are mandatory, and nonzero digits are magnitude 1 only, notation that drops the '1's and use only zero and the + ‚àí signs is more concise than if 1's are included. Unbalanced ternary Ternary computing implemented in terms of unbalanced ternary, which uses the three digits 0, 1, 2. The original 0 and 1 are explained as an ordinary Binary computer, but instead uses 2 as leakage current. The world's first unbalanced ternary semiconductor design on a large wafer was implemented by the research team led by Kim Kyung-rok at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology in South Korea, which will help development of low power and high computing microchips in the future. This research theme was selected as one of the future projects funded by Samsung in 2017, published on July 15, 2019. Potential future applications With the advent of mass-produced binary components for computers, ternary computers have diminished in significance. However, Donald Knuth argues that they will be brought back into development in the future to take advantage of ternary logic's elegance and efficiency.. One possible way this could happen is by combining an optical computer with the ternary logic system. A ternary computer using fiber optics could use dark as 0 and two orthogonal polarizations of light as 1 and ‚àí1. IBM also reports infrequently on ternary computing topics (in its papers), but it is not actively engaged in it. The Josephson junction has been proposed as a balanced ternary memory cell, using circulating superconducting currents, either clockwise, counterclockwise, or off. \\"The advantages of the proposed memory circuit are capability of high speed computation, low power consumption and very simple construction with fewer elements due to the ternary operation.\\" In 2009, a quantum computer was proposed which uses a quantum ternary state, a qutrit, rather than the typical qubit. Ternary computers in popular culture In Robert A. Heinlein's novel Time Enough for Love, the sapient computers of Secundus, the planet on which part of the framing story is set, including Minerva, use an unbalanced ternary system. Minerva, in reporting a calculation result, says \\"three hundred forty one thousand six hundred forty... the original ternary readout is unit pair pair comma unit nil nil comma unit pair pair comma unit nil nil point nil\\". Virtual Adepts in the roleplaying game Mage: The Ascension use ternary computers. In Howard Tayler's webcomic Schlock Mercenary, every modern computer is a ternary computer. AIs use the extra digit as \\"maybe\\" in boolean (true/false) operations, thus having a much more intimate understanding of fuzzy logic than is possible with binary computers. The Conjoiners, in Alastair Reynolds' Revelation Space series, use ternary logic to program their computers and nanotechnology devices. In Stanis≈Çaw Lem's short story \\"The Hunt\\", the robot hunted by the protagonist is called Setaur, Self-programming Electronic Ternary Automaton Racemic.

Because he is cursed with unending life, he is somewhat similar to the character Ahasvero. The legend of Rom√£ozinho started in the Boa Sorte district, Pedro Afonso, Goi√°s.Jos√© A. Teixeira - Folclore Goiano, pp. 361-374, S√£o Paulo, 1941 Text In the parable which bears his name, he is the son of a serf, and is disobedient from birth. He takes great pleasure in treating animals cruelly and destroying plants. Sometimes, his mother orders him to carry a meal to his father, who works in a garden, and Rom√£ozinho goes, albeit unwillingly. One afternoon en route to delivery, he eats the chicken his mother has sent, puts its bones back in the box, and carries it to his father. Upon opening the box, the perplexed father asks what the bones mean. Rom√£ozinho replies: Mad with rage, the father immediately returns home, whereupon he pulls out a dagger and kills his wife. Before dying, the mother curses the laughing son, saying: Rom√£ozinho laughs at the curse and leaves. From that moment onward, the boy never grows. He breaks roof tiles with stones, frightens people and tortures chickens, and is presumably walking through the streets and causing mischief to this day. However, despite his sadistic and sociopathic personality, Rom√£ozinho isn't pure evil and has been known to occasionally use his mischief for noble and selfless reasons. For example, there is a pregnant woman in labor, but there was no midwife to help, so she begged for help. Rom√£ozinho promptly assists by scaring a local midwife's chicken to the woman, helping the woman to give birth.

The station, which began broadcasting in 1924, is owned and operated by iHeartMedia. The WNDE broadcast license is held by Capstar TX LLC.  History  Former WNDE logo, prior to 2015. WNDE began operation as WFBM on October 23, 1924, as the fifth radio station licensed in Indianapolis. It was started by the Merchants Heating & Light Co., later Indianapolis Power & Light. When WFBM went on the air, it was assigned a frequency of 1130 kilohertz. In 1927, it moved to 1330 kHz, then to 1090 kHz in 1928, and to 1230 kHz in 1929. It arrived at its current frequency after the \\"great frequency shift of 1941,\\" when all stations in the United States at 1230 kHz were moved to 1260 kHz. In 1949, WFBM-TV (now WRTV) went on the air in time to broadcast the 1949 Indianapolis 500 (May 30, 1949). The WFBM ‚Äúfamily‚Äù grew on November 26, 1959, when WFBM-FM went on the air at 94.7 Mc. In 1957, the three WFBM stations were sold to Time-Life, Inc. McGraw-Hill bought the stations in 1972, and almost immediately put the radio stations on the market. The WFBM stations had been grandfathered when the FCC banned common ownership of television and radio stations, but lost that protection with the McGraw-Hill purchase. In 1973, WFBM became WNDE, followed by WFBM-FM becoming WFBQ in Spring 1974. The WNDE call letters were chosen as the letters \\"NDE\\" phonetically sound like \\"Indy\\". WNDE is the oldest operating radio station in Indianapolis, and third oldest in the state of Indiana. WNDE, which had at one time used a Top 40 format, competing with the original WIFE in the 1970s while using the identifier \\"Windy twelve sixty\\", has been a Fox Sports Radio affiliate since 2002. It had previously been an ESPN Radio affiliate on two occasions. In September 2012, the network switched from Fox Sports Radio to NBC Sports Radio in the 10 p.m.-5 a.m. weekday hours, remaining with FSR in other dayparts. Former hosts of the afternoon drive local show include former WISH-TV sports anchor and Hoosier Millionaire host Mark Patrick, the team of Tim Bragg & Bill Benner, Indiana Pacers announcer Mark Boyle, JMV (John Michael Vincent, currently with WFNI), IndyCar Radio announcer Jake Query, and Derek Schultz.

On July 6, 2015, WNDE became the Indianapolis outlet for Rush, which had been on WIBC for over two decades but whose carriage was ended for local programming. Coinciding with iHeart taking the show in-house to WNDE (the only choice it had locally due to incompatible music formats on iHeart's three other FM stations in the market), they also acquired translator station W248AW 97.5 FM from the Educational Media Foundation to simulcast WNDE.

It is called Buddha's hand in Chinese (‰ΩõÊâãÊüë), Japanese (‰ªèÊâãÊüë) and Korean (Î∂àÏàòÍ∞ê; ‰ΩõÊâãÊüë). The different cultivars and variations of this citron variety form a gradient from \\"open- hand\\" types with outward-splayed segments to \\"closed-hand\\" types, in which the fingers are kept together. There are also half-fingered fruits, in which the basal side is united and the apical side fingered. The origin of this kind of citron is commonly traced back to South or East Asia, probably northeastern India or China, where most domesticated citrus fruits originate. Uses Huge fruit breaking bearing twig Val Rahmeh botanical garden =Perfumery= Buddha's hand fruit is very fragrant and is used predominantly in China, Malaysia and Japan for perfuming rooms and personal items such as clothing. =Religious= The fruit may be given as a religious offering in Buddhist temples. According to tradition, Buddha prefers the \\"fingers\\" of the fruit to be in a position where they resemble a closed rather than open hand, as closed hands symbolize to Buddha the act of prayer. In China, the Buddha's hand fruit is a symbol of happiness, longevity, and good fortune. It is also a traditional temple offering and a New Year's gift. =Ornamental= The fingered citron is cultivated as an ornamental tree in gardens and containers on patios and terraces. =Food and medicine= Unlike other citrus fruits, most varieties of the Buddha's hand fruit contain no pulp or juice. Though esteemed chiefly for its \\"exquisite form and aroma\\", the Buddha‚Äôs hand fruit can also be eaten (often as a zest or flavouring) in desserts, savory dishes, and alcoholic beverages (such as vodka) or candied as a sweet. The sliced, dried peel of immature fruits is also prescribed as a tonic in traditional medicine. Description Citrus medica var. sarcodactylis is, like any other citron variety, a shrub or small tree with long, irregular branches covered in thorns. Its large, oblong leaves are pale green and grow about four to six inches. Its white flowers are tinted purplish from the outside and grow in fragrant clusters. The fruit's fingers contain only the white part of the fruit and sometimes a small amount of acidic pulp, but many of them are completely juiceless and some are seedless. The plant is sensitive to frost, as well as intense heat and drought. It grows best in a temperate climate. Trees can be grown from cuttings taken from branches two to four years old. It is very commonly grafted onto sufficient rootstock. Diseases that can affect the fruit include that of Citritic arthritis and Systematic loss (sarco- leiossis) Gallery File:Citrus medica01.JPGSemi-fingered and closed File:Castello,_collezione_degli_agrumi_06.jpgClosed fingers File:Buddha's hand fruit.jpgSide view File:Buddhas Hand.jpgA fingered citron File:Citrus_medica_var._sarcodactylis1SHSU.jpgSemi-closed fingers File:Castello, collezione degli agrumi 05.jpgIn Villa di Castello File:Semi dwarf fingered citron.jpgSemi dwarf fingered citron (green) Buddhas hand 2.jpgWith open fingers File:Citron_(8448513463).jpgCross section in a Variety etrog citron, and in fingered citron See also *Japanese citrus References External links * * Pictures Category:Citron Category:Fruits originating in Asia Category:Garden plants of Asia Category:Natural cultivars Category:Ornamental trees ","title":"Buddha's hand"},{"id":"3025288","text":"Streetcar Railway Post Office (RPO) routes operated in several major USA cities between the 1890s and 1920s.

Career =Sparta Prague= Jun joined AC Sparta Prague's youth system as a nine-year-old in 1992. Progressing through the club's youth teams he made his senior debut aged just 16. Only a year later he was in the starting formation in Sparta's Champions League clash with Arsenal. He also became an important member of the national youth team. By 2001 his first team opportunities became more restricted and he was loaned out to FK Jablonec 97. After a few months at Jablonec he was recalled by Sparta Prague and managed to score a few important goals for the team. The next season saw Jun being given more first team chances, but he was still restricted to just 19 league appearances. In the 2002‚Äì03 season the youngster featured on a more regular basis with a decent tally of 8 goals. After a change in management in the 2004‚Äì05 season he hit his best form yet becoming Sparta's and the league's top scorer with 14 goals in 30 appearances, helping Sparta Prague regain the league title. =Trabzonspor= His great season at Sparta had raised his profile, and not only did he break into the national team but a number of foreign clubs became interested in signing the promising young striker. In the end he moved to Turkish team Trabzonspor in 2005 for a ‚Ç¨3.25 million transfer fee, signing a five-year deal with the S√ºper Lig outfit. The excitement of his transfer was short-lived, however, as he failed to make an impact, moving to Be≈üikta≈ü J.K. on loan after only a few months without having scored a single goal for Trabzonspor. His luck at Be≈üikta≈ü was not much better as he spent most of his time as a substitute, only finding the net once. In the 2006‚Äì07 season Jun returned to Sparta Prague on a season-long loan, hoping to regain his previous goal scoring form after a bad run in the S√ºper Lig, but even there he was mainly used a late substitute, resulting in him managing to score only one league goal. In early 2007, there were rumours that he would move to the Swedish Allsvenskan side Helsingborgs IF. He was however called back to Trabzonspor main squad for 2007/08 season by Trabzonspor Trainer Ziya Dogan after the loss of explosive striker Ersen Martin to injury, but did not feature. =Teplice= In January 2008 Jun was again on his way back to the Czech First League, this time joining FK Teplice on loan. After six months in the league, where he netted 4 goals in 14 league appearances, Teplice made his loan move permanent. He continued in similar form in the next six months, scoring 3 times in 14 appearances. In January 2009 he left FK Teplice on a six-month loan move to Austrian Bundesliga side SCR Altach. His form seems to be recovering as he grabbed 8 goals in just 14 appearances for the club. Unfortunately despite this good run for the team he was unable to save them from relegation. =Austria Wien= Jun returned to the Austrian Bundesliga for the 2009‚Äì10 season on a season-long loan with FK Austria Wien and immediately made an impact, scoring no fewer than nine times during the first two months of the season in the league as well as the Austrian Cup (hat-trick against FAC in the second round) and the UEFA Europa League. On 4 October 2009, Jun once again scored the winner against SV Mattersburg. It was to be his last appearance for Austria Wien for a couple of months as he was diagnosed with a cruciate ligament rupture, sustained after a foul in the same match. With the expected pause for an injury like this no less than six months, Jun surprised everyone by making a speedy recovery, already being fit for a short comeback against Red Bull Salzburg on 21 March 2010. In the following weeks, he quickly regained his form, scoring his first goal after the pause against SV Mattersburg, after giving the assist for Austria Wien's winning goal in Ried just one week after his comeback. He went on to score four times until the end of the 2009‚Äì10 season, making him second-best goal- scorer after Milenko Aƒçimoviƒç with a total of nine goals and ten assists. As a result of this good first season, Austria Wien made the loan deal with FK Teplice permanent on 14 May 2010, just one day after the season finale, with Jun's new contract running until 2012. A torn hamstring from which he never had the chance to fully recover hindered Jun's first half of the season. Nevertheless, he scored once in Austria Wien's 3‚Äì1 away win at Ruch Chorz√≥w in the third round of the Europa League qualification and (league, cup and Europa league combined) as of February 2011, lead his club's assists statistic with eleven assists. As well as his incomplete pre-season, Jun sustained a further serious injury in training in October 2010, a ruptured ligament in his ankle keeping him on the sidelines for another six weeks. At the time of writing, he considers himself being \\"injury and pain - free\\" for the first time in months and with the second half of the Austrian League season starting soon, Jun could once again prove a valuable asset to Austria Wiens campaign for a 21st title / 28th win in the cup. He left the club after five years there, in the spring of 2014. International career Jun won silver at the 2000 UEFA under-17 European Championship and scored seven goals in the tournament. He also helped them to win the 2002 UEFA under-21 European Championship. In February that season, he scored his first goal for the full national team. Jun's most important goal of his career came in the final group match of 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification, scoring the first goal against Finland as a starting replacement for the injured Jan Koller and Vratislav Lokvenc. The win allowed the Czech Republic to advance to the playoff stage against Norway. In summer 2005 he joined Trabzonspor of Turkey but failed to score a single goal. He struggled to make even substitute appearances at Be≈üikta≈ü, which has led to his omission from the Czech Republic squad for the 2006 World Cup.

The Radio One owned outlet broadcasts at 104.1 MHz with an ERP of 50 kW and is licensed to Hazelwood, Missouri. Its transmitter is located in St. Louis, just outside Forest Park, and operates from studios in Olivette (with a St. Louis address). History The station signed on in 1978 as WJBM- FM, airing a full service country format targeting the more Northern areas of the St. Louis metropolitan area, as well as the Metro East area, with its city of license being Jerseyville. The station's transmitter at the time was located north of the city (near Jerseyville), which was a partial hindrance to any chance for success in the market for the next 2 decades, despite later moving to a tower on Douglas Road in Florissant.

Sydney, with Captain Joseph Burnett commanding, and Kormoran, under Theodor Detmers, encountered each other approximately off Dirk Hartog Island. Both ships were destroyed in the half-hour engagement. From 24 November, after Sydney failed to return to port, air and sea searches were conducted. Boats and rafts carrying survivors from Kormoran were recovered at sea, while others made landfall north of Carnarvon: 318 of the 399 personnel on Kormoran survived. While debris from Sydney was found, there were no survivors from the 645-strong complement. It was the largest loss of life in the history of the Royal Australian Navy, the largest Allied warship lost with all hands during World War II, and a major blow to Australian wartime morale.Jeans, Seafaring Lore and Legend, pp. 189‚Äì191 Australian authorities learned of Sydneys fate from the surviving Kormoran personnel, who were held in prisoner of war camps until the end of the war. The exact location of the two wrecks remained unverified until 2008. Controversy has often surrounded the battle, especially in the years before the two wrecks were located in 2008. How and why a purpose-built warship like Sydney was defeated by a modified merchant vessel like Kormoran was the subject of speculation, with numerous books on the subject, as well as two official reports by government inquiries, published in 1999 and 2009 respectively. According to German accounts‚Äîwhich were assessed as truthful and generally accurate by Australian interrogators during the war, as well as most subsequent analyses‚ÄîSydney approached so close to Kormoran that the Australian cruiser lost the advantages of heavier armour and superior gun range. Nevertheless, several post-war publications have alleged that Sydneys loss had been the subject of an extensive cover-up, that the Germans had not followed the laws of war, that Australian survivors were massacred following the battle, or that the Empire of Japan had been secretly involved in the action (before officially declaring war in December). No evidence has been found to support any of these theories. Background =HMAS Sydney= was one of three Modified Leander class light cruisers of the RAN.Olson, Bitter Victory, p. 3 Built for the Royal Navy, the cruiser was purchased by the Australian government to replace , and was commissioned into the RAN in September 1935.Cassells, The Capital Ships, pp. 148‚Äì9 The cruiser was long, and displaced .Cole, The loss of HMAS Sydney II, vol. 1, p. 18 Sydney carried eight 6-inch (152 mm) guns in four twin turrets (\\"A\\" and \\"B\\" forward, \\"X\\" and \\"Y\\" aft) as primary armament.Olson, Bitter Victory, pp. 3‚Äì4 These were supplemented by four 4-inch (102 mm) anti-aircraft guns, nine .303-inch (7.7 mm) machine guns, and eight torpedo tubes in two quadruple mountings.Olson, Bitter Victory, pp. 3‚Äì8 The cruiser also carried a single Supermarine Walrus amphibious aircraft.Olson, Bitter Victory, pp. 22‚Äì3 HMAS Sydney in 1940 Initially assigned to escort and patrol duties in Australian waters, Sydney was sent to the Mediterranean in mid-1940.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 149Goldrick, in The Royal Australian Navy, p. 111 Sydney operated against Italian naval forces for eight months, during which she participated in multiple battles, sank two Italian warships and several merchantmen, and supported convoy operations and shore bombardments.Goldrick, in The Royal Australian Navy, pp. 112‚Äì7 The cruiser was recalled to Australia in early January 1941: the need to rest the ship and personnel, plans to spread combat experience across the RAN fleet, and a desire to reinforce the nation following German raider activity in nearby waters were all factors.Goldrick, in The Royal Australian Navy, pp. 110‚Äì1Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 150Grove, in The Royal Australian Navy in World War II, p. 42 Sydney was assigned to Fremantle, Western Australia, and resumed escort and patrol duties.Goldrick, in The Royal Australian Navy, p. 117 Command was handed over from Captain John Collins to Captain Joseph Burnett in May 1941.Frame, HMAS Sydney, p. 26 On 11 November, Sydney departed Fremantle for Singapore with the transport .Oldham, Bitter Victory, p. 33 The vessels sailed to Sunda Strait, where the troopship was handed over on 17 November to . Sydney then turned for home, and was scheduled to arrive in Fremantle late on 20 November. At the time of the battle, she had a ship's company of 645: 41 officers, 594 sailors, six Royal Australian Air Force personnel, and four civilian canteen staff.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 152 =Kormoran= During the 1930s, disparities between the conventional warship strength of the Kriegsmarine (German Navy) and other nations caused by the Treaty of Versailles led the German military to recognise that auxiliary cruisers engaged in commerce raiding would be of use during future wars, and that suitable vessels should be identified.Frame, HMAS Sydney, pp. 41‚Äì7 The merchant ship Steiermark was one such vessel; she was taken up by the Kriegsmarine at the start of World War II. Renamed , she was the largest and newest of nine raiders, referred to as Hilfskreuzer (auxiliary cruisers) or Handelsst√∂rkreuzer (trade disruption cruisers).Frame, HMAS Sydney, pp. 275‚Äì7Winter, H.M.A.S. Sydney, p. 13 Kormoran in 1940, view from a German U-boat Kormoran was commissioned in October 1940: after modification, she was long, and measured 8736 grt.Frame, HMAS Sydney, pp. 50‚Äì1, 277 The raider was fitted with six single guns (two each in the forecastle and quarterdeck, with the fifth and sixth on the centreline) as main armament, supplemented by two anti-tank guns, five anti-aircraft autocannons, and six torpedo tubes (a twin above-water mount on each side, and two single underwater tubes).Frame, HMAS Sydney, p. 46 The guns were concealed behind false hull plates and cargo hatch walls, which would swing clear when the order to decamouflage was given, while the secondary weapons sat on hydraulic lifts hidden within the superstructure. The ship could be disguised as one of several Allied or neutral vessels.Olson, Bitter Victory, p. 97 Kormoran departed German waters during December 1940, under the command of Fregattenkapit√§n (Commander) Theodor Detmers.Winter, H.M.A.S. Sydney, p. 183Olson, Bitter Victory, p. 402Frame, HMAS Sydney, p. 55 After operating in the Atlantic, during which time she sank seven merchant ships and captured an eighth, the raider sailed to the Indian Ocean in late April 1941.Frame, HMAS Sydney, pp. 56‚Äì68 Only three merchantmen were intercepted during the next six months, and Kormoran was diverted several times to refuel German support ships.Frame, HMAS Sydney, pp. 69‚Äì77 As the raider was carrying several hundred sea mines and was expected to deploy some of these before returning home in early 1942, Detmers planned to mine shipping routes near Cape Leeuwin and Fremantle, but postponed this after detecting wireless signals from a warship (Australian heavy cruiser ) in the area.Winter, H.M.A.S. Sydney, pp. 123, 125 Instead, he decided to sail north and investigate Shark Bay.Frame, HMAS Sydney, pp. 77‚Äì9 At the time of the battle, the raider was disguised as the Dutch merchantman Straat Malakka, and carried 399 personnel: 36 officers, 359 sailors, and 4 Chinese sailors hired from the crew of a captured merchantman to run the ship's laundry.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 151Frame, HMAS Sydney, p. 47 Battle :Note: All times in this section are UTC+7. =Identification= On 19 November, shortly before 16:00, Kormoran was southwest of Carnarvon, Western Australia.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1939‚Äì1942, p. 453 The raider was sailing northwards (heading 025¬∞) at .Hore, in The Royal Australian Navy, p. 78 At 15:55, what was initially thought to be a tall ship sail was sighted off the port bow, although it was quickly determined to be the mast of a warship (HMAS Sydney). Detmers ordered Kormoran to alter course into the sun (heading 260¬∞) at maximum achievable speed (which quickly dropped from because of problems in one of her diesel engines), while setting the ship to action stations. Sydney spotted the German ship around the same time, and altered from her southward heading to intercept at . Straat Malakka in 1940 As she closed the gap, the Australian cruiser requested that Kormoran identify herself.Olson, Bitter Victory, p. 178 Communications were initially attempted with a signal lamp to repeatedly send \\"NNJ\\" (\\"You should make your signal letters\\"), but those aboard the raider did not understand the uncommonly used signal and did not respond.Frame, HMAS Sydney, p. 104 Sydney continued to signal for 30 minutes, after which those aboard the cruiser used flags to send the more common \\"VH\\" signal (\\"You should hoist your signal letters\\"), while the signal lamp was used to transmit the message in plain language.Olson, Bitter Victory, pp. 178‚Äì9 After another delay, Kormoran raised \\"PKQI\\"‚Äîthe call-sign for the Dutch merchant ship Straat Malakka‚Äîon the triatic stay and hoisted a Dutch merchant ensign. As Sydney was approaching from just starboard of Kormorans stern and away, the call-sign was obscured by the raider's funnel: German accounts vary as to if this was to further the illusion of a civilian ship, a ruse to lure Sydney closer, or an error on the signaller's part.Olson, Bitter Victory, p. 179Mearns, The Search for the Sydney, p. 28 Sydney signalled \\"Make your signal letters clear\\", which the signals officer aboard Kormoran did by lengthening the halyard and swinging it around to starboard. By 16:35, with Sydney away, the malfunctioning engine aboard Kormoran was repaired, but Detmers chose to keep it in reserve.Winter, H.M.A.S. Sydney, p. 130 Sydney asked Kormoran \\"Where bound?\\", to which the raider responded \\"Batavia\\".Olson, Bitter Victory, p. 180 Sydney may have then made signals asking for the raider's port of origin and cargo; the Germans who claimed this said their replies were \\"Fremantle\\" and \\"Piece-goods\\" respectively.Olson, Bitter Victory, p. 181Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1939‚Äì1942, pp. 453‚Äì4 At around 17:00, Detmers instructed his wireless operators to send a false distress signal indicating that Straat Malakka was being approached by a suspicious ship. The message, transmitted at 17:03 and repeated at 17:05, contained the distress call for a merchantman under attack from a raider instead of a warship (QQQQ, as opposed to RRRR), the latitude and longitude of the transmitting ship, the time per Greenwich Mean Time (normal practice was to transmit local time; using GMT was to let the Kriegsmarine know that the ship was actually a raider about to be lost), and the ship's name.Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney II, vol. 2, pp. 317‚Äì8Olson, Bitter Victory, pp. 186‚Äì9 This signal was partially received by the tugboat Uco (\\"QQQQ [unintelligible] 1000 GMT\\") and a shore station at Geraldton (\\"[unintelligible] 7C 11115E 1000 GMT\\").Olson, Bitter Victory, p. 186 The Geraldton station broadcast a message to all ships asking if there was anything to report (which was interpreted by the Germans as acknowledgement of their signal), but after no response was forthcoming, ignored it until a report on the signal was forwarded to the Naval Board on 27 November.Olson, Bitter Victory, p. 85 Port view of Kormoran from a German U-boat in 1940 During the exchanges and distress signal, Sydney positioned herself just off the raider's starboard beam on a parallel course, approximately from Kormoran.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1939‚Äì1942, p. 454 The cruiser may or may not have been at action stations: the main guns and port torpedo launcher were trained on Kormoran and her Walrus scout plane had been readied for launch, prompting Detmers to prepare to engage Sydney, but her guns were unmanned, and personnel were standing on the upper deck.Olson, Bitter Victory, pp. 195, 219‚Äì21 During her manoeuvre, Sydney appeared to signal \\"IK\\" (the short-form for \\"You should prepare for a cyclone, hurricane, or typhoon\\"), which Kormoran did not respond to, as from their perspective, such a signal did not make sense.Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney II, vol 2, p. 9 The Germans were unaware that the letters were the interior of the real Straat Malakkas secret callsign, \\"IIKP\\": to verify her identity, the ship had to signal back the outer letters. The aircraft was shut down by 17:25, and the catapult swung into the storage position; the two ships were too close for a safe launch.Olson, Bitter Victory, p. 209 At around 17:30, after the raider had failed to reply for 15 minutes, Sydney signalled by light \\"Show your secret sign\\"; Detmers knew that Kormoran was in trouble.Olson, Bitter Victory, p. 195 =Action= In response to the cruiser's signal, Detmers ordered that Kormorans disguise be dropped, for the Dutch flag to be replaced by the Kriegsmarine ensign, and for the guns and torpedoes to open fire. Accounts disagree on which ship fired first, but agree that both opened fire almost simultaneously.Olson, Bitter Victory, p. 234 The first shots from Sydney, a full, eight-shell salvo from the main guns, were reported in most accounts to have passed over Kormoran, although some of the Germans said that shells punched through the funnel and the wireless office at bridge level without exploding, and hit the water on the far side of the raider.Olson, Bitter Victory, pp. 216‚Äì8 One analysis claims that this was either a warning shot just over the superstructure, or an attempt to destroy the raider's bridge as a prelude to capture. With Kormorans opening salvo (which consisted of two shells instead of four because the raider's two centreline guns were slower to decamouflage), the gunnery officer attempted to bracket the cruiser's bridge but failed to hit it, with the shells striking other parts of the ship or missing completely.Olson, Bitter Victory, p. 248 Two torpedoes from Kormorans starboard above-water tubes were launched simultaneously with the raider's attack, and the close proximity of the target allowed the use of the anti- aircraft and close defence guns to rake Sydneys flank, thus preventing the use of the cruiser's secondary weapons.Mearns, The Search for the Sydney, p. 35 Subsequent salvoes from the raider were more accurate. The second, three-shell salvo destroyed Sydneys bridge and damaged her upper superstructure, including the gun direction control tower, wireless offices, and foremast. The fourth gun was ready by this time, and all four began to fire: the third and fourth salvoes knocked the cruiser's \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" turrets out of action before they could fire a second time, and the fifth hit Sydney on the waterline in proximity to the forward engine room, although one shell hit high and destroyed the Walrus.Olson, Bitter Victory, pp. 248‚Äì9 Kormorans guns were aimed at Sydney's waterline and upper deck during the next three salvoes. After the sixth German salvo, Sydney resumed fire with her aft turrets: \\"Y\\" turret fired less than four times with little effect, but multiple shots from \\"X\\" turret struck Kormoran, damaging the raider's machinery spaces, wounding the sailors manning one of the guns, and starting a fire in an oil tank.Olson, Bitter Victory, pp. 234‚Äì5 Around the time of the eighth or ninth German salvo, one of the two torpedoes fired at the start of the engagement struck Sydney just forward of \\"A\\" turret and near the asdic compartment (the weakest point on the ship's hull), ripping a hole in the side and causing the bow of the cruiser to angle down.Olson, Bitter Victory p. 249Mearns, The Search for the Sydney, pp. 37, 205 After the torpedo strike, Sydney turned hard to port: the Germans assumed that the Australian ship was trying to ram them, but the cruiser passed aft. During the turn, the 10th German salvo tore the roof from \\"B\\" turret and destroyed \\"A\\" turret's housing.Mearns, The Search for the Sydney, p. 37 The main phase of the engagement ended around 17:35, with Sydney heading south and slowing, while Kormoran maintained her course and speed. Sydney's main armament was completely disabled (the forward turrets were damaged or destroyed, while the aft turrets were jammed facing port, away from Kormoran), and her secondary weapons were out of range.Olson, Bitter Victory, p. 268 The cruiser was wreathed in smoke from fires burning in the engine room and forward superstructure, and around the aircraft catapult.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1939‚Äì1942, p. 456 Kormoran discontinued salvo firing, but the individually firing aft guns scored hits as Sydney crossed the raider's stern.Olson, Bitter Victory, p. 250 At around 17:45, Sydney fired two torpedoes from her starboard tubes (although some Germans reported more).Mearns, The Search for the Sydney, p. 201 Prior to the torpedo launch, Detmers had decided to destroy Sydney completely and ordered the raider to turn to port so four-gun salvoes could be fired: this manoeuvre caused the torpedoes to pass astern of Kormoran.Olson, Bitter Victory, pp. 258‚Äì9 After completing the turn, battle damage caused Kormorans engines to fail completely, leaving the raider dead in the water while Sydney continued to sail southwards at low speed. Kormoran maintained a high rate of fire despite being immobilised‚Äîsome sailors claimed that up to 450 shells were used during the second phase of the battle‚Äîand scored hits on the cruiser, although many shells missed as the range increased.Olson, Bitter Victory, pp. 259‚Äì60 The raider fired her guns for the last time around 17:50, with the range at , and a torpedo was launched at 18:00, but missed Sydney. =Conclusion= By the end of the 30-minute battle, the ships were about apart: both were heavily damaged and on fire.Olson, Bitter Victory, p. 237 Sydney was proceeding on a south-south-east bearing, apparently not under control. The Australian warship quickly disappeared from German sight, although the glow of the burning ship consistently lit the horizon until 22:00, with some German survivors stating that the light was visible consistently or occasionally until midnight. Sydney sank during the night; it was originally thought that the cruiser exploded when fires reached the shell magazines or torpedo launchers, or took on water through the shellholes on her port side and capsized.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1939‚Äì1942, p. 458Olson, Bitter Victory, pp. 300‚Äì3 However, after the wrecks were located, it was determined that Sydney was under limited control after the battle, maintaining a course of 130‚Äì140 degrees true at speeds of . The ship remained afloat for up to four hours before the bow tore off and dropped almost vertically under the weight of the anchors and chains.Mearns, The Search for the Sydney, pp. 204‚Äì5 The rest of the ship sank shortly afterward, and glided upright for underwater until it hit the seabed stern- first. Kormoran was stationary, and at 18:25, Detmers ordered the ship to be abandoned, as damage to the raider's engine room had knocked out the fire- fighting systems, and there was no way to control or contain the oil fire before it reached the magazines or the mine hold.Olson, Bitter Victory, p. 263 All boats and liferafts were launched by 21:00, and all but one filled: a skeleton crew manned the weapons while the officers prepared to scuttle the ship. Kormoran was abandoned at midnight; the ship sank slowly until the mine hold exploded 30 minutes later. The German survivors were in five boats and two rafts: one cutter carrying 46 men, two damaged steel liferafts with 57 and 62 aboard (the latter carrying Detmers and towing several small floats), one workboat carrying 72 people, one boat with 31 men aboard, and two rafts, each bearing 26 sailors.Frame, HMAS Sydney, pp. 3‚Äì5 During the evacuation, a rubber liferaft carrying 60 people, mostly wounded, sank without warning; drowning all but three aboard.Frame, HMAS Sydney, p. 95Winter, H.M.A.S. Sydney, p. 142 Total German casualties were six officers, 75 German sailors, and one Chinese laundryman. Search and rescue :Note: All times in this section are UTC+8. When Sydney did not arrive on schedule, there was no immediate concern: the northbound journey with Zealandia could have taken longer than expected, Durban could have been late to the rendezvous, Sydney could have diverted to aid southbound merchant shipping, or minor engine problems could have occurred.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1939‚Äì1942, p. 451Olson, Bitter Victory, p. 34 Warships were expected to maintain wireless silence unless absolutely necessary; none of these were sufficient reason to break silence and inform Fremantle of the delay. When the ship failed to arrive by 23 November, wireless communications stations (initially those in Fremantle, then all high- power stations in Australia) began signalling ordering Sydney to report in. At 06:00 on 23 November, the troopship recovered one of the two rafts carrying 26 German sailors at .Olson, Bitter Victory, p. 39 Initially believing that these were survivors of a German raider attack, and that the raider might still be in the area, Aquitania resumed her voyage to Sydney, maintaining silence until the afternoon of 26 November.Frame, HMAS Sydney, pp. 4, 6‚Äì7 Detmers saw the troopship, but he did not make their boat's presence known, as he hoped to be recovered by a neutral ship.Frame, HMAS Sydney, p. 4 Six Lockheed Hudson aircraft from No. 14 Squadron RAAF, based at RAAF Base Pearce, began to search for the ship on the morning of 24 November.Olson, Bitter Victory, p. 35 When it was learned that the Zealandia handover occurred on schedule, air searches commenced in the Java Sea.Gill, The Royal Australian Navy, 1939‚Äì1942, pp. 451‚Äì2 The first news relating to the engagement between Sydney and Kormoran was received by the Australian Naval Board during the afternoon of 24 November; the British tanker Trocas reported that she had rescued a raft at 15:00 carrying 25 German naval personnel (one having perished) at .Frame, HMAS Sydney, p. 5Gill, The Royal Australian Navy, 1939‚Äì1942, p. 452 After further communication with Trocas, the Naval Board learned that the sailors had come from the raider Kormoran, which had participated in a mutually destructive engagement with an unspecified ship, which the Naval Board assumed was Sydney. Centaurs lifeboats. The German lifeboat can be seen behind them. Wireless signals to Sydney ceased, as it was assumed that if the cruiser had survived, battle damage or operational reasons prevented her reply.Olson, Bitter Victory, p. 37 Six nearby merchant vessels (Pan Europe, Saidja, , Sunetta, Centaur, and Hermion) were instructed to pass through that location and keep a lookout for survivors or wreckage of either ship, while four RAN auxiliaries (, , , and ) sailed from Fremantle to search the area. Aircraft from No. 14 and No. 25 Squadrons were relocated to Carnarvon to commence aerial searches the next morning, and were supplemented by two PBY Catalina flying boats; one each from Townsville and Port Moresby. On 25 November, was sent from Sunda Strait to follow Sydneys assumed course if she had headed for Surabaya or Singapore after sustaining damage.Olson, Bitter Victory, pp. 36‚Äì7 Several German lifeboats were spotted on 25 November during the air search off Western Australia: the 46-man cutter had come ashore at 17-Mile Well, the 57-man lifeboat was nearing Red Bluff when spotted, and a third lifeboat was further off the coast.Frame, HMAS Sydney, p. 6Olson, Bitter Victory, p. 40 These locations were all within the 180 km coastline boundary of an enormous sheep station. That afternoon, the staff of Quobba Station rounded up the two groups that had made landfall with no resistance. On the morning of 26 November, aircraft spotted two boats at sea, but were unable to find them again that afternoon.Olson, Bitter Victory, pp. 47‚Äì8 At sunset, the 31-man boat was located by the passenger ship Koolinda at , which recovered the sailors and made for Carnarvon.Frame, HMAS Sydney, p. 7 Centaur, which had been ordered to collect the Germans from Carnarvon and transport them to Fremantle, encountered Detmers' lifeboat at 22:20, at coordinates .Olson, Bitter Victory, p. 52 The crew of Centaur lowered food to the 62 in the lifeboat, took on nine wounded, and began to tow the lifeboat.Milligan and Foley, Australian Hospital Ship Centaur, pp. 18‚Äì20 During the voyage to Carnarvon, the damaged and overloaded German lifeboat was swamped: Centaurs master lowered two of his lifeboats for the Germans to use, before resuming the \\"motley towing combination\\". Arriving in Carnarvon on the afternoon of 27 November, the Germans were relocated from the boats to Centaurs cargo holds, where they were joined by their colleagues which had reached shore and Australian Army guards. The last boat, carrying 70 Germans and two Chinese, was spotted from the air at during the late morning of 27 November, and was recovered shortly after by HMAS Yandra.Frame, HMAS Sydney, p. 8Olson, Bitter Victory, pp. 56‚Äì7 On 28 November, HMAS Wyrallah found a German lifeboat and two four-man liferafts, one of which was carrying a dead German sailor, who was buried at sea. The search was terminated at sunset on 29 November. All of the German lifeboats were accounted for: between them, 318 of Kormorans 399 personnel survived.Olson, Bitter Victory, p. 308 Conversely, none of 645 from Sydney were found, and the only definite remains from the Australian warship were an inflatable lifebelt located by HMAS Wyrallah on 27 November (the discovery of a second RAN lifebelt by the merchant ship Evagoras that same day was initially reported, but later found to be false), and a damaged Carley float discovered by HMAS Heros on 28 November.Olson, Bitter Victory, p. 72 A second Carley float, which washed up on Christmas Island in February 1942, is believed to be linked with the cruiser.Olson, Bitter Victory, pp. 328‚Äì32 Aftermath On 26 November, the Naval Board distributed lists of Sydneys ship's company to all district naval offices. Telegrams to next-of-kin, stating that their relatives were \\"missing as a result of enemy action\\" were lodged, although naval censors advised the media that no announcements relating to the cruiser be made. Despite this, rumours about the ship's loss were circulating, fuelled by the lack of information to substantiate the \\"missing\\" telegrams.Dennis, in Zombie Myths of Australian Military History, p. 118 Australian Prime Minister John Curtin officially announced the loss of the cruiser during the afternoon of 30 November.Frame, HMAS Sydney, p. 10 Censorship restrictions on the newspapers were lifted to publish the statement, but radio stations were instructed to wait 48 hours before broadcasting the news to avoid alerting any other German ships in the area.Olson, Bitter Victory, p. 94Mearns, The Search for the Sydney, p. 48 Several Melbourne stations disobeyed, and were temporarily suspended from broadcasting.Frame, HMAS Sydney, p. 279 Curtin made a second announcement three days later, providing some detail of the battle. The destruction of Sydney with all hands was a major blow to morale: it was the largest loss of life in the history of the RAN, and the ship's company made up over 35% of RAN naval personnel killed during World War II. This was compounded by the loss of , which was sunk by a German U-boat on 27 November; news of this was announced a day after Sydneys fate was made public.Goldrick, in The Royal Australian Navy, p. 124Montgomery, Who Sank the Sydney?, p. 204 However, the battle was not widely reported in other Allied nations, as it was a small loss compared to contemporary naval incidents ‚Äî the aircraft carrier and the battleship were sunk in separate incidents during the same two-week period ‚Äî and was quickly eclipsed by Japan's attacks on Pearl Harbor and Singapore in early December.Olson, Bitter Victory, p. 73 Sydney was the largest Allied ship to be lost with all hands during the war.Grubel, Australian judge to examine wartime ship loss In Germany, news of the battle was assembled from communications intercepts during the search for survivors, which was combined with Allied news articles to assemble an account of the battle and published in early 1943 for internal consumption by German officials.Hore, in The Royal Australian Navy in World War II, p. 84 The events were made public in December 1943, after the early accounts were confirmed by a sailor from Kormoran sent home in a prisoner exchange.Hore, in The Royal Australian Navy in World War II, pp. 77‚Äì8 =Interrogation of survivors= Interrogation of the German survivors to discover the fate of Sydney began on 25 November.Frame, HMAS Sydney, p. 80 This was initially hampered, as the sailors had been ordered to obfuscate the enemy by falsely answering all questions. Many did not follow this instruction, but their accounts included second-hand information of varying reliability. Several groups were quickly combined together, and had the opportunity to standardise any falsification: those who made landfall in two separate groups were combined, then placed aboard Centaur with the men from Detmers' lifeboat.Frame, HMAS Sydney, pp. 80‚Äì1 However, some efforts were made to keep officers separate from the sailors; Detmers and his executive officer were initially held aboard HMAS Yandra, then transported overland to Fremantle, and while all of the sailors were interned at a camp near Harvey, the officers were imprisoned at Swanbourne Barracks. Not all groups had this opportunity: the survivors rescued by Aquitania were delivered to Sydney, and interrogations of these men showed the same commonalities and inconsistencies as the main body of interviews.Frame, HMAS Sydney, p. 106 In addition, some of the Germans were interviewed, formally or informally, prior to their group reuniting with others; the independent accounts provided the same common elements.Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney II, vol. 1, pp. 338‚Äì9, 366‚Äì7 Based on this, it was concluded that the true story was being given, and that there were no widespread attempts to falsify accounts.Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney II, vol. 1, p. 393 Senior officers from Kormoran sitting for a group portrait while interned at Dhurringile. Detmers is the second from right in the front row. After the main interrogations were completed, the Germans were moved from Fremantle to Murchison, Victoria during late December and early January: the officers aboard the liner Duntroon, the sailors overland on two trains.Olson, Bitter Victory, p. 111 The sailors were placed in No. 13 Prisoner of War Camp, which already hosted 1,200 soldiers of the Afrika Korps and their shipmates rescued by Aquitania, while officers were sent to the nearby Dhurringile homestead.Frame, HMAS Sydney, p. 83 Some further interrogations were carried out after this point. Listening devices were planted in the prisoners' quarters, and intelligence agents infiltrated the camp, but neither method provided new information.Frame, HMAS Sydney, p. 107 One sailor died in captivity from lung cancer on 24 March 1942, and was buried in the Tatura war cemetery.Winter, H.M.A.S. Sydney, pp. 199‚Äì200 On 11 January 1945, Detmers and 19 other Axis officers escaped from Dhurringile through a tunnel excavated during the previous seven months; all were recaptured within days.Frame, HMAS Sydney, p. 108 Detmers was found with a German-English dictionary which contained two encrypted accounts of the battle (a deck log or action report, and an engineering log), although these provided little new information.Olson, Bitter Victory, pp. 190, 193 Shortly after returning to the camp, Detmers was hospitalised for three months following a stroke. The German officers and sailors were repatriated after the war, departing from Port Phillip Bay with other Axis prisoners aboard the steamer Orontes on 21 February 1947.Frame, HMAS Sydney, p. 109 Coincidentally, tied up to the opposite pier was the real Straat Malakka. On arrival in Cuxhaven, the prisoners were searched before leaving the ship; several written reports were confiscated, although nothing new was learned from these.Frame, HMAS Sydney, pp. 109‚Äì10 =Honours and awards= For sinking Sydney, Detmers' Iron Cross First Class was upgraded to the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (Ritterkreuz). Kormorans executive officer, gunnery officer, and a sailor who manned the starboard gun were awarded the Iron Cross First Class (for the executive officer, this was a bar to a previous Iron Cross), while the rest of the ship's company were all awarded the Iron Cross Second Class.Frame, HMAS Sydney, p. 84 Sydney was granted the battle honour \\"Kormoran 1941\\" in recognition of the damage done to Kormoran. This was one of only three honours awarded during the 20th century for the sinking of a single ship ‚Äì rather than a lengthy operation in a military campaign ‚Äì and the second granted to a ship named Sydney.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 207 Post-war searches Despite the approximate position of Kormoran being known (most German accounts giving the battle coordinates as ), the required search area for both ships was unfeasibly large.Olson, Bitter Victory, p. 47JCFADT, Report on the loss of HMAS Sydney, p. 138 This was due to the lack of a detailed location, a problem which was compounded by supporters of alternative engagement theories, who believed that the Germans were lying and that the ships would be found further south and closer to shore.Mearns, The Search for the Sydney, pp. 80, 90‚Äì2, 96‚Äì7Frame, HMAS Sydney, p. 225 The survey ship conducted multiple unsuccessful searches for Sydney and Kormoran between 1974 and 1991, when the ship was based in Fremantle.JCFADT, Report on the loss of HMAS Sydney, p. 139 Another search was conducted by in July 1997. However, all RAN surveys were restricted to the continental shelf, as the navy did not possess the technology to effectively search the seabed off the shelf. The searches were not exhaustive, and were primarily a response to civilian claims that the wreck site was at a certain location, with the survey ship sent to prove or disprove the claim.McCarthy, A pr√©cis of search-related events, pp. 2‚Äì3 Other searches were conducted by aircraft of the Royal Australian Air Force carrying magnetometers; again, these were only in response to claims of possible locations. In 1990, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) were approached to join a Western Australian Maritime Museum-led search for Sydney and Kormoran, which was agreed to on the condition that the search area be narrowed considerably.McCarthy, A pr√©cis of search-related events, pp. 3‚Äì4 This was attempted at a 1991 forum: although the location of the battle was generally agreed upon, because the exact fate and time of sinking for Sydney was unknown, the possible location could not be more accurately determined. WHOI staff did not believe that the search area could be sufficiently narrowed down‚Äîshipwreck hunter Robert Ballard commented that searching for the ships could not be described as a needle in a haystack, \\"because the haystack has not yet been found\\"‚Äîand the WHOI withdrew its support. Following the 1999 government report into the Australian cruiser's loss, which recommended that a seminar be organised to again attempt to identify the most likely search area for the warships, the HMAS Sydney Location Seminar was organised by the RAN's Sea Power Centre and held at the Western Australian Maritime Museum.McCarthy, A pr√©cis of search-related events, pp. 6‚Äì7 However, participants in the seminar could not agree on whether the battle location given by the Germans (referred to as the \\"northern position\\") or a point off the Abrolhos Islands (the area for the battle advocated by supporters of the \\"southern position\\") was more likely to contain the two ships.McCarthy, A pr√©cis of search-related events, p. 7 In 2002, a coalition of oil and gas companies involved in the North West Shelf Venture performed a gratis search of eight suspected targets in the proposed southern area.McCarthy, A pr√©cis of search-related events, p. 8 No evidence was found of shipwrecks at any of the eight sites, although supporters of this search area claimed that the equipment used was defective and rejected the findings. Subsequent examination of the most popular southern site by DOF Subsea Australia vessel SV Geosounder in March 2007 found no evidence of a shipwreck: the two searches firmly discrediting the alternative engagement area. =Wreck discovery= American shipwreck hunter David Mearns first learned of the battle and mutual destruction of Sydney and Kormoran during a conference in 1996, and started studying the battle in 2001.Mearns, The Search for the Sydney, pp. 61‚Äì77 Mearns focused on primary source documents, which led him to believe that German accounts of the battle's location were truthful, and was able to convince the RAN that a search around that area was feasible.Mearns, The Search for the Sydney, pp. 80‚Äì93, 121 Mearns's organisation entered a partnership with HMAS Sydney Search Pty. Ltd., a not-for-profit company set up to support a search for Sydney, in late 2004.Mearns, The Search for the Sydney, pp. 95, 108 In mid-September 2004, the German government granted Mearns permission to film Kormoran if she were found.Mearns, The Search for the Sydney, p. 104 On 14 August 2005, the Australian government announced a A$1.3 million grant to the Finding Sydney Foundation (a charitable foundation set up by the directors of HMAS Sydney Search to manage funding), which was followed by A$500,000 from the Western Australian government and A$250,000 from the government of New South Wales.Mearns, The Search for the Sydney, pp. 110, 252 Several small donations were made by companies and the public, but it was not until the Australian government approved another A$2.9 million in October 2007 that the search could proceed.Mearns, The Search for the Sydney, pp. 113‚Äì5McCarthy, A pr√©cis of search-related events, p. 9 Even so, the money raised only permitted the chartering of the survey vessel SV Geosounder for 45 days.Mearns, The Search for the Sydney, pp. 126‚Äì7 Mearns' plan was to determine a 'search box' for Kormoran by plotting the possible starting points of the two rafts from the raider through a reverse drift analysis.Mearns, The Search for the Sydney, pp. 121‚Äì2 This search box (calculated to be in size) would then be inspected over several days with a side-scan sonar towed by Geosounder.Mearns, The Search for the Sydney, pp. 121‚Äì2, 137 Mearns focused on finding Kormoran first: the German wreck's approximate location could be predicted, and while the same was not true for Sydney, there was a wealth of information indicating her position relative to Kormoran.Mearns, The Search for the Sydney, pp. 121‚Äì2, 150‚Äì1 After locating one or both vessels, Geosounder would return to port and embark a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to film the wrecks. Geosounder was scheduled to depart early on 29 February 2008, but problems and last-minute modifications delayed this until after 16:00, and fuel leaks forced her return that evening.Mearns, The Search for the Sydney, pp. 133‚Äì5 Repairs were made, and the ship reached the south-east corner of the search box just before midnight on 4 March, but the early days of the search were hampered by recurring faults with the sonar and the effects of Tropical Cyclone Ophelia.Mearns, The Search for the Sydney, pp. 136‚Äì43 Kormoran was located during the afternoon of 12 March: the ship had been torn apart by the mine deck detonation, with two large pieces sitting below sea level and apart, with an oval-shaped debris field between them, centred at .Mearns, The Search for the Sydney, pp. 143‚Äì9, 216‚Äì7 The raider's discovery was announced by Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd on the morning of 17 March.Mearns, The Search for the Sydney, p. 157 Using the wreck location and the German observations of Sydney after the battle, a search box for the cruiser was calculated.Mearns, The Search for the Sydney, pp. 150‚Äì1 Sydney was located just after 11:00 on 17 March, only hours after Kormorans discovery was made public.Mearns, The Search for the Sydney, pp. 157‚Äì8 Prime Minister Rudd announced the find a day later.Mearns, The Search for the Sydney, p. 160 Sydneys wreck was located at at below sea level: the bow of the cruiser had broken off as the ship sank, and was located at the opposite end of a debris field stretching north-west from the hull.Mearns, The Search for the Sydney, pp. 158‚Äì60, 204‚Äì5Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney II, vol. 2, p. 217 The two wrecks were apart, with Sydney to the south-east.Mearns, The search for the Sydney, p. 204 On discovery, both wrecks were placed under the protection of the Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976.Mearns, The Search for the Sydney, p. 169 The wrecks were added to the Australian National Heritage List on 14 March 2011.Australian Associated Press, HMAS Sydney makes heritage list Geosounder returned to Geraldton on 20 March, but delays in installing and testing the ROV prevented departure until 29 March, with the ship sailing through the path of Cyclone Pancho.Mearns, The Search for the Sydney, pp. 165, 168, 170‚Äì72 Sydney was the first to be inspected; electrical problems with the ROV set the start of filming back to 3 April.Mearns, The Search for the Sydney, pp. 173‚Äì4 Six ROV dives were made over a five-day period, during which the main hull and debris field were inspected, filmed, and documented.Mearns, The Search for the Sydney, p. 189 The damage found by the search team corresponded with the descriptions given by Kormoran survivors after the battle.Mearns, The Search for the Sydney, pp. 183, 186‚Äì7, 198 After the conclusion of ROV operations near Sydney, Geosounder travelled to the wreck of Kormoran.Mearns, The Search for the Sydney, pp. 216‚Äì7 The search was declared complete just before midnight on 7 April.Mearns, The Search for the Sydney, p. 228 In April 2015, an expedition to the wrecks was made by Curtin University and the Western Australian Museum, with the objective of using 3D imaging to map the wrecksites for further study, and to determine if any deterioration since the 2008 discovery requires the development of a conservation management plan.Mundy, HMAS Sydney wreck to be recorded in safeguard mission During the week-long expedition, 30 hours of video footage and 700,000 still images were generated by two ROVs.Haun, WWII Shipwrecks Photographed off Australia Analysis =Historiography= The first collected historical account of the engagement was published in 1947, in George Hermon Gill's Royal Australian Navy, 1939‚Äì1942, the first of two RAN-oriented volumes in the government- sponsored Australia in the War of 1939‚Äì1945 series.Frame, HMAS Sydney, p. 132Olson, Bitter Victory, p. 74 Because of the scope of the book, the account of the battle itself was brief, and Gill accepts the German interpretation of events while blaming Burnett for endangering his ship. The account is described by naval historian Tom Frame as \\"bland and unemotional\\", and \\"necessarily superficial\\", but Gill's analysis of the battle is attacked by Frame as \\"seriously flawed, inconsistent and contradictory\\".Frame, HMAS Sydney, pp. 132, 152 Several biographical and autobiographical works which touched on the battle (including books by Detmers and former Sydney commander John Collins) were also published around this time: none of these contributed new information.Frame, HMAS Sydney, pp. 129‚Äì35 Michael Montgomery's 1981 book, Who Sank The Sydney?, was the first published work to focus solely on Sydney and the events surrounding her loss, and the first to comprehensively challenge the accepted view of the battle.Frame, HMAS Sydney, p. 135 The son of Sydneys Royal Navy navigator, Montgomery could not accept the ship's loss as described by Gill, and claimed that the true events were being covered up.Frame, HMAS Sydney, pp. 135‚Äì6 According to his book, Kormoran had fired on Sydney while flying the flag of a neutral nation, a Japanese submarine was involved in the battle, and any Australian survivors were killed to hide the involvement of the Japanese.Frame, HMAS Sydney, pp. 137‚Äì8Montgomery, Who Sank The Sydney?, pp. 109, 135‚Äì7, 154‚Äì5, 188, 200‚Äì2 Montgomery also suggests that the British government had foreknowledge of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, which occurred three weeks later, and ordered the Australian government to cover-up the truth of Sydneys loss so the United States would be drawn into the war.Montgomery, Who Sank The Sydney?, p. 205 However, Who Sank the Sydney? is reliant on assertions that had been proved false, unreliable sources (including a 'sailor's report' found to be a translation of an inaccurate Australian newspaper article), and selective use of German accounts that fit the hypothesis, and Montgomery is generally credited with igniting the controversy surrounding the battle.Frame, HMAS Sydney, pp. 135‚Äì9 Although not written as such, the 1984 HMAS Sydney: Fact, Fantasy and Fraud by Barbara Winter served as a reply to Montgomery's work.Frame, HMAS Sydney, pp. 140‚Äì1 Winter used material from German and American archives in addition to Australian sources, with the main thrust of her work comparing the relative experience and competence of Burnett and Detmers, which supported the accepted view of the battle. In her work, Winter also sought to identify and prove false all the rumours and theories that had appeared since the battle.Frame, HMAS Sydney, p. xiii Frame describes her work as \\"reasonable and persuasive... [h]owever, she tried too hard to defend the crew of the Kormoran... at the expense of Sydney\\", while a government report in 1999 observed that Winter's defence of the German accounts saw her become the \\"b√™te noire of those who sought, and continue to seek, darker explanations of the Sydney tragedy.\\"JCFADT, Report on the loss of HMAS Sydney, p. 12 In 1991, the HMAS Sydney Forum was convened by the Western Australian Museum; its goals were to seek a consensus view of the battle, and collect suggestions on how and where searches for Sydney and Kormoran should occur.JCFADT, Report on the loss of HMAS Sydney, p. 14 Interested parties, including Montgomery, Winter, and Frame, were brought together for the three-day forum, but instead of reconciling different views of the battle, the forum only served to further split the participants. Prompted by the outcome, Frame wrote HMAS Sydney: Loss and Controversy. Published in 1993, this was the first book dedicated to the subject authored by a naval officer or a trained historian, and in addition to analysing the battle and its aftermath, looked at the historiography to date and the development of the controversy.Frame, HMAS Sydney, pp. xii‚ÄìxiiiJCFADT, Report on the loss of HMAS Sydney, p. 13 Frame's work was pro-RAN and supportive of Burnett, and while he dismissed many of the alternative claims made regarding the battle, he felt that those involving German duplicity were plausible.Frame, HMAS Sydney, p. xivCole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney II, vol. 2, pp. 3‚Äì5 A second forum was hosted in 1997 by the End Secrecy on Sydney group, but the antagonism between holders of different interpretations of the battle meant the forum \\"degenerated into a partisan verbal melee\\". An Inquiry into the loss of HMAS Sydney was carried out by the Joint Standing Committee for Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade (JCFADT) during 1997 and 1998, and was tabled in March 1999.JCFADT, Report on the loss of HMAS Sydney, p. 1 The JCFADT inquiry received over 400 submissions and compiled over 500 pages of oral testimony. However, the report was indecisive, and despite finding that there was no evidence to support the various controversial claims made about the battle, failed to end debates between holders of the various viewpoints: a debate which was said to have \\"become a dialogue of the deaf\\". Over the next few years, several books about the battle were published. Frame's book was updated and republished in 1998.McCarthy, The HMAS Sydney/HSK Kormoran engagement Wesley Olson's Bitter Victory: the death of HMAS Sydney, published in 2000, was a re-examination of the evidence, including comparisons with similar naval engagements and sinkings, which supported the accepted view of the battle.Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney II, vol. 3, p. 10 Glenys McDonald's 2005 work Seeking the Sydney: a quest for truth did not attempt an analysis of records and interrogation transcripts, but instead used accounts from people who claimed to have observed the battle or been involved in the search, rescue, or interrogation to compile an oral history of the engagement and its aftermath. Her research led her to believe that the battle had occurred much closer inshore than claimed by the Germans.McCarthy, A pr√©cis of search- related events, p. 5 The 2005 book Somewhere below: the Sydney scandal exposed by John Samuels, took an extreme view on the alternative engagement theory by claiming that Sydney was sunk by a Japanese submarine with little or no involvement by Kormoran, and that there was a wide-ranging cover-up of the proof.Lewis, Leaping to conclusions in tale of Sydney's sinking Samuels cites no reliable sources and ignores or dismisses evidence supporting the accepted view as part of the cover-up; one review states that the book only brings suffering to the relatives of those killed, and is on par with the Roswell UFO incident as a conspiracy theory. Also in 2005, Brett Manning used the alternative theories of the battle as the basis for the spy novel Enduring Deception, in which an American agent must cover-up the cruiser's encounter with a Japanese submarine so the Pearl Harbor attack occurs without warning, drawing the United States into the war.Harvey, WA book revives war mystery There were also many deliberate hoaxes, some contributing to the controversies; the most damaging were claims that the wrecks had been located, hindering serious attempts to mount a search while military assets were used to check the sites.McCarthy, A pr√©cis of search-related events, pp. 8‚Äì9McCarthy, An insight into the Genesis and Evolution of the HMAS Sydney Controversy, pp. 11‚Äì14 One not only involved a claim to have located the wreck off Dirk Hartog Island, but it also referred to the location of a grave there.McCarthy, An insight into the Genesis and Evolution of the HMAS Sydney Controversy, p. 12 Military historian Dr Tom Lewis OAM, then a serving naval officer, wrote several analytical articles about the controversies surrounding the battle, all of which argued that the Kormoran account was right. \\"What may the wreck of the Sydney reveal\\", published in Warship Vol 42; the RUSI Journal United Service in Feb 2008, and in the Australian Naval Institute's Headmark in Dec 2007, was the first battle-damage assessment of what the wreck of the Sydney ‚Äì if it was found ‚Äì would look like. Lewis argued if the wreck damage matched the article then it would show the Kormoran account was accurate. Following the discovery of the two ships, the damage did indeed match the article. Lewis also argued in \\"The truth about Sydney ‚Äì conspiracy theorists should crawl back into the bilges.\\" Wartime magazine, Issue 45, that speculation the Sydney crew were massacred was damaging to the well-being of the families concerned. Following the discovery of the wrecks, a second inquiry into the loss of Sydney was held, this time by the Department of Defence.Mearns, The Search for the Sydney, pp. 233‚Äì5 The inquiry was presided over by Terence Cole, an expert in maritime law and a former Deputy Judge Advocate General.Mearns, The Search for the Sydney, p. 234 Cole's findings were published in a three-volume report in July 2009, with one volume focusing specifically on assessing the various controversies and alternative theories surrounding the battle.Nicholson, The truth of their deadly battle The inquiry concluded that Burnett was responsible for placing his ship in danger, but stopped short of claiming negligence, and also found no evidence to support any of the alternative theories investigated. A month later, shipwreck hunter David Mearns published an account of the search for the two ships: The Search for the Sydney: How Australia's greatest maritime mystery was solved.Battle behind Sydney's finding revealed, in The West Australian Dr Tom Lewis published \\"What has the wreck of the Sydney told us?\\" in Warship magazine Issue 44, and \\"Needles and Haystacks ‚Äì Why finding the wreck of the Sydney was so difficult\\" in the Australian War Memorial's Wartime magazine, Issue 43. =Controversy= Rumours that the battle was not what it seemed commenced almost as soon as Sydney failed to reach Fremantle on schedule, some emanating from the highest levels in the administration,McCarthy, M., 2009. An insight into the Genesis and Evolution of the HMAS Sydney Controversy. Prepared for the HMAS Sydney II Commission of Inquiry. Western Australian Museum, Department of Maritime Archaeology, Report No 243. Available in PDF form www.defence.gov.au/sydneyii/WAM/WAM.070.0010.pdf but it was not until Montgomery's Who Sank The Sydney? that a published work collated these rumours and challenged the accepted view of the battle. Frame and Olson both credit Montgomery with igniting the controversy; the former describes Montgomery's work as \\"a polemical, finger-pointing, brawling account\\" which, if not deliberately prepared to create a controversy, had that effect, while the latter claimed that the book only \\"sparked debate [and] opened old and new wounds\\".Olson, Bitter Victory, pp. 74‚Äì5 The controversial views have been maintained and propagated by several organisations, such as the Sydney Research Group and End Secrecy on Sydney, and authors like McDonald and Samuels.Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney II, vol. 3, pp. 5, 10 Much of the controversy surrounding the battle stemmed from disbelief that a modified merchant ship could totally defeat a modern cruiser, with most theories describing how the Germans deceitfully gained the advantage.Goldrick, in The Royal Australian Navy, opp. p. 96 However, the two ships' armament was closer to equal than this matchup implied, and although Sydney normally had the advantage of armour plate and superior range, these were lost by closing with Kormoran.Mearns, The Search for the Sydney, p. 193Jenkins, Did a sub really fire the fatal torpedo? The proximity meant that the advantage would go to the ship that fired first; while Burnett likely assumed that Sydney was dealing with a merchantman, Detmers was ready for Kormoran to surprise the cruiser, and the raider's gun crew knew where to aim for maximum effectiveness. The main theories refer to: Improper use of flags These theories contend that Detmers acted illegally by firing before Kormoran raised her battle ensign, flew a white flag of surrender to trick Burnett into relaxing, or used false signal flags to indicate a medical or engineering emergency and lure Sydney in.Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney II, vol. 3, pp. 259‚Äì61 While it was a war crime for a ship to attack without flying her battle ensign or while flying a surrender flag, false distress signals were considered legitimate ruses.Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney II, vol. 3, p. 279Olson, Bitter Victory, pp. 339‚Äì41 All German accounts indicate that Kormoran lowered the Dutch flag and raised the German war ensign before the order to fire was given, although general distrust of German claims, plus the statement in Detmers' autobiography that it took six seconds to raise the flag, decamouflage, and start firing, led to questions.Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney II, vol. 3, pp. 277‚Äì83 Olson contends that in Detmers' original report, the 'six seconds' figure encompassed only the flag-raising, with the meaning corrupted over time.Olson, Bitter Victory, pp. 241‚Äì3 Conversely, Frame considers the possibility as knowledge of doing so would have been limited to very few people.Frame, HMAS Sydney, pp. 215‚Äì8 He cites other parts of the autobiography, where Detmers repeatedly asserts that he had committed no crime, while stating his fear of court martial, as indicating a guilty conscience.Frame, HMAS Sydney, pp. 216‚Äì24 Winter traces the origin of the \\"surrender or distress\\" theory to a single newspaper article written just after the battle by a reporter with no access to the prisoners or naval intelligence.Winter, H.M.A.S. Sydney, pp. 226‚Äì8 Olson doubts that a surrender flag was used to lure Sydney in, as this would have informed Burnett that Straat Malakka was not what she seemed.Olson, Bitter Victory, p. 340 He considers that the Germans may have used false signals or pretended to scuttle, but only hypothetically. The 2009 Cole inquiry concluded that the German ensign was raised before the first shell was fired.Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney II, vol. 3, p. 285 Cole thought that the use of surrender or distress flags was an \\"invention of those seeking to find a justification\\" for the cruiser's close approach. Japanese involvement The claim of Japanese involvement, specifically a submarine operating with Kormoran, is based on several elements. The German survivors were found with milk bottles bearing Japanese labels.Olson, Bitter Victory, p. 119 Although cited as evidence that a Japanese submarine was supplying Kormoran, the bottles were obtained from the supply ship Kulmerland, which had taken on supplies in Japan. Sketches drawn by one of the interned Germans were believed to contain an account of the battle in the Deutsche Einheitskurzschrift shorthand system.Frame, HMAS Sydney, pp. 158‚Äì60 A civilian working for Australian military intelligence attempted to decode these, and after relying on interpolation and speculation to make sense of the decoded characters and fill in the gaps, came up with a message that included the phrase \\"a Japanese gunfire attack from Japan itself\\". However, several shorthand experts consulted by Winter could find nothing resembling Einheitskurzschrift (or any other shorthand style) in the sketches.Winter, H.M.A.S. Sydney, p. 233 According to Montgomery, the involvement of a submarine is supported by numerous sightings of submarines or submarine-like objects in Australian waters, particularly a sighting off Townsville in late October of six \\"strange boats\\" that surfaced, sprouted wings, and flew off; he interpreted this as a floatplane-carrying Japanese submarine, which may have reached Carnarvon in time to attack Sydney.Montgomery, Who Sank The Sydney?, pp. 186‚Äì8Frame, HMAS Sydney, p. 160 The Cole report noted that false submarine sightings are a common wartime occurrence.Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney II, pp. 208, 210‚Äì1 In addition, the positions of all 46 active Japanese submarines at the time of the battle have been accounted for: 28 were in Japanese waters preparing for the attack on Pearl Harbor, seven were readying for operations in the South China Sea and Philippines, nine were heading for the South China Sea, and two had just departed for patrols in the Pacific.Frame, HMAS Sydney, pp. 170‚Äì2 On several occasions, Japanese broadcasts stated that Sydney had been captured and towed to Japan, or that personnel were interned in Japanese prisoner-of- war camps. Post-war investigations found that these broadcasts were for propaganda purposes only.Olson, Bitter Victory, pp. 120‚Äì2 Claims that items from Sydney (such as cap tallies) were found in Japan after the war have also been aired, but further investigation found these to be based on unfounded speculation.Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney II, vol. 3, pp. 291‚Äì3 There were suggestions over the years the Japanese submarine I-124, sunk off Darwin by HMAS Deloraine on 20 January 1942 ‚Äì some three months after the loss of the Sydney ‚Äì contained information about the real fate of the Sydney, or may even herself have been involved. Dr Lewis, who wrote Sensuikan I-124, and Darwin's Submarine I-124, contributed to the Cole inquiry, arguing strongly that this was impossible. The lack of information about Japanese involvement is attributed to a wide-ranging cover-up of Japanese aggression prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor, in an attempt to draw the United States into the war.Frame, HMAS Sydney, p. 138 Frame dismisses the suggested cover-up as an attempt to draw attention to the alternative interpretation of the battle by linking it to the Pearl Harbor advance-knowledge debate. The JCFADT report concluded that there was no evidence to support the presence of the Japanese.JCFADT, Report on the loss of HMAS Sydney, pp. 63‚Äì4 Cole's report concluded likewise, and stated that the allegations made to 'prove' the presence of a submarine were factually wrong, lacked collaborating evidence, or otherwise did not support the claims.Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney II, vol. 3, pp. 214‚Äì5, 218‚Äì9, 232 No Sydney survivors The alternative engagement theories attribute the lack of survivors, corpses, or debris from Sydney to the need to eliminate evidence of German illegality or Japanese aggression.Olson, Bitter Victory, pp. 339‚Äì40 The recovered carley float‚Äîwith its damage attributed to machine-gun fire‚Äîis often presented as proof. The Australian War Memorial undertook a detailed analysis of the carley float during 1992 and 1993 to determine the nature of the damage.Frame, HMAS Sydney, p. 201Olson, Bitter Victory, p. 322 Metallurgical testing of fragments found in the float showed them to be from German shells, not German or Japanese machine gun bullets.Frame, HMAS Sydney, p. 202 The Chinese survivors are also cited as proof that no machine-gunning of Australian survivors took place, as if they had witnessed or learned of such an act, they too would have been killed to preserve the secret.JCFADT, Report on the loss of HMAS Sydney, p. 96 The accepted view of the battle (based on German damage descriptions) is that the majority of Sydneys personnel were killed during the battle, with the rest dying when the cruiser sank.Olson, Bitter Victory, pp. 309‚Äì11JCFADT, Report on the loss of HMAS Sydney, p. 91Mearns, The Search for the Sydney, pp. 208‚Äì9 The Defence Science and Technology Organisation used Mearns' shipwreck footage for a technical analysis of the damage to Sydney, which showed it to be consistent with German accounts.Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney II, vol. 2, pp. 215, 371 The analysis predicted that up to 70% of those aboard were killed during the battle, either directly, from wounds, or by inhaling smoke and toxic gas.Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney, vol. 2, p. 357 Mearns estimated that once the bow was lost, the rest of the cruiser's hull would have remained afloat for, at most, two minutes, and anyone still remaining aboard would have been killed as the ship sank.Mearns, The Search for the Sydney, pp. 212‚Äì3Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney, vol. 2, pp. 366 The Cole Report stated that Sydneys seakeeping ability would have rapidly deteriorated, hampering any evacuation efforts.Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney, vol. 2, pp. 357‚Äì66 Open watertight doors show that some attempt to abandon ship was made. However, the presence of all but two of the ship's boats in the nearby debris field, plus indications that the davits for the two missing boats were shot away during the battle, led Mearns to believe that evacuation was attempted after the bow snapped off, but there was not enough time or seaworthy boats to do so. The battle damage would have forced any Australian survivors to use carley floats and personal lifebelts, which were only intended as short-term life preservers. Based on survival rates for contemporary warship losses, Olson determined that anyone who survived the sinking would have died from wounds, exposure, or drowning before the search commenced, and corpses would not have floated to the surface until after the search had been terminated.Olson, Bitter Victory, pp. 319‚Äì20 The higher survival rate from Kormoran was because, unlike Sydney, the raider's boats and rafts were well equipped and mostly undamaged.Mearns, The Search for Sydney, pp. 200‚Äì1 Although Sydney is thought of as the only warship lost with all hands, the JCFADT report lists eight other surface warships of similar size lost during the World Wars where none survived, and another six where 95% or more aboard died.JCFADT, Report on the loss of HMAS Sydney, pp. 89‚Äì90 An alternative version of this theory is that authorities were aware of Sydney being attacked at the time of or shortly after the battle, but deliberately delayed organising searches for survivors. There is no evidence that anybody ashore knew of the battle until Trocas found German survivors and informed the authorities. The Sydney Research Group allege that Sydney attempted to radio Darwin to report that the cruiser was on fire and being abandoned.Frame, HMAS Sydney, pp. 187‚Äì8 Other individuals or groups have made claims that they heard or witnessed the receipt of messages (either voice or morse) from Sydney, or saw transcripts of these messages.Olson, Bitter Victory, pp. 347‚Äì8 All claims state that transcripts and other evidence were later destroyed. Sydney was not fitted with voice transmission equipment, so could not have sent any of the reported voice signals.Olson, Bitter Victory, pp. 104‚Äì5 Had the cruiser tried to send morse signals, they would have been jammed by Kormorans wireless operators.Dennis, in Zombie Myths of Australian Military History, p. 126 Several messages were identified as having come from other sources, while associates of the claimants have shown the evidence to be suspect for the rest.Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney II, vol. 3, p. 150 The 2009 inquiry concluded that no messages were sent by Sydney before, during, or after the engagement.Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney II, vol. 3, pp. 150, 186 Sydney not at action stations The claim that Sydney was not at action stations originates from an observation by Detmers; as Sydney approached, the cruiser's guns were unmanned, and sailors in aprons (which he describes as pantrymen), were standing on deck watching the German ship.Olson, Bitter Victory, p. 219 This is interpreted by followers of alternative engagement theories as evidence that Sydney was not at action stations, and therefore unable to react when Kormoran unmasked.Montgomery, Who Sank The Sydney?, pp. 121, 132 Olson lists two groups of sailors that could have been mistaken for pantrymen, but had a reason to be where Detmers saw them.Olson, Bitter Victory, p. 220 Ammunition handlers from the 4-inch guns, who wore protective aprons, could have been standing clear of their weapons because of the planned catapult launch of the Walrus amphibian or the direction \\"X\\" turret was facing when trained on Kormoran, both of which could have injured the unprotected gunners.Olson, Bitter Victory, pp. 220‚Äì3 A second group would have been a cutter party preparing to launch a boat to rescue the Walrus crew if it ditched, or to board Kormoran, with their life jackets mistaken for aprons.Olson, Bitter Victory, pp. 221, 224‚Äì6 The JCFADT report suggests a third group: a damage control party in fire-fighting gear.JCFADT, Report on the loss of HMAS Sydney, p. 39 Conversely, the Cole report stated that Sydney may not have been at action stations: ship's logs for several Australian warships showed that it was not common practice to do so when approaching unidentified merchant vessels in home waters.Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney II, vol. 1, pp. 292‚Äì3 This, combined with Detmers' observation and the belief that Sydneys approach followed procedures for an 'innocent' instead of a 'suspicious' vessel, prompted Cole to conclude that the Australian cruiser was not at action stations.Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney II, vol. 1, pp. 302, 307‚Äì16 =The Christmas Island corpse= On the afternoon of 6 February 1942, lookouts on Christmas Island spotted an object out at sea, which on closer inspection turned out to be a carley float carrying the body of a Caucasian man wearing a blue boilersuit that had been sun-bleached white.Olson, Bitter Victory, pp. 328‚Äì9 The flesh of his right arm had been eaten away by fish, and his eyes and nose consumed by birds. Shrapnel was embedded in the float's outer covering, while the proliferation of marine growth indicated that it had been adrift for some time.Olson, Bitter Victory, p. 329 As the island was under threat of Japanese invasion, after a brief examination, the body was buried in an unmarked grave near Flying Fish Cove. Evacuation began on 17 February with Japanese forces occupying the island on 23 March.Winter, H.M.A.S. Sydney, p. 241Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney II, vol. 2, pp. 324‚Äì6 The island's inhabitants believed that the float and sailor were of naval origin, and had come from Sydney. A post-war RAN investigation determined that as the raft's description did not match those manufactured for the RAN, this claim was incorrect.Olson, Bitter Victory, pp. 329‚Äì30 Subsequent writers on the subject have disagreed: Winter states that a carley float from Sydney would have been propelled by currents into proximity of Christmas Island around the time of its discovery, while Olson claims that the description of the float's rope and markings matched those used on British ships (from whose supplies Sydney could have drawn), the boilersuit indicated a naval rating, and that the quantity of marine growth corresponded with the time such a float would have been at sea.Olson, Bitter Victory, pp. 329‚Äì32 The JCFADT inquiry concluded \\"on the balance of probability, that the body and the carley float ... were most likely from HMAS Sydney.\\", and while Frame was initially sceptical of the raft's origins, the evidence presented to that inquiry changed his mind.JCFADT, Report on the loss of HMAS Sydney, p. 118Olson, Bitter Victory, p. 330Frame, HMAS Sydney, p. 203 The inquiry recommended that the grave be found, the body exhumed, and its DNA compared to relatives of Sydney personnel.Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney II, vol. 2, pp. 331‚Äì2 A 2001 search by the RAN failed to find the grave, but they were more successful during a second search in 2006.Mearns, The Search for the Sydney, p. 112Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney II, vol. 2, pp. 332 During an autopsy, a metal fragment was found embedded in the skull, which was believed to have killed the man through brain trauma: although seized upon by believers in the massacre of Sydneys sailors, the fragment was found to be German shell shrapnel.Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney II, vol. 2, pp. 336‚Äì9 While DNA comparison testing did not produce definite results, as of September 2010 it remained on-going.Dennis, in Zombie Myths of Australian Military History, p. 132 =Why Burnett approached so close= Burnett on Sydneys bridge By manoeuvring in close to Kormoran, Burnett removed the advantage provided by his longer-ranged primary armament, and put Sydney in a position where the raider's main guns could penetrate the cruiser's armour. Because there were no Australian survivors, Burnett's decision is inexplicable; writers on the subject can only speculate on his reasoning, and indicate what factors they believe influenced him.Olson, Bitter Victory, p. 226 Up until the 1980s, most of the material published relating to the loss of Sydney accepted the German interpretation of events (that Burnett was deceived by Kormorans disguise, and placed his ship in a tactically unsound position) and assigned Burnett various levels of blame for his role in the cruiser's demise.Olson, Bitter Victory, p. 112 Gill claimed that because Burnett had taken command of Sydney after a shore posting, and was assigned to relatively calm operational areas, he was incautious when approaching Kormoran.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1939‚Äì1942, pp. 456‚Äì7 He also believed that Burnett was not suspicious of Straat Malakka: had he been, he would have used the Walrus to identify the ship or broken wireless silence and enquired about the ship.Olson, Bitter Victory, p. 183 Olson (among others) believes that Burnett was placed under conflicting orders: raiders were to be destroyed (preferably at range to avoid retaliation), but merchantmen and raider supply ships were to be captured to replace Allied freighters sunk in the tonnage war.Olson, Bitter Victory, pp. 164‚Äì5JCFADT, Report on the loss of HMAS Sydney, p. 41 The suggested method of capture was to quickly manoeuvre in close and deploy a boarding party before the ship could scuttle. Olson thinks that Kormorans actions (turning away from the coast upon seeing an unknown vessel, delays in replying to signals, the distress call transmitted long after Sydney appeared) made Burnett suspicious, and he was trying to position Sydney so he could identify the merchantman's physical features and to facilitate capture.Olson, Bitter Victory, pp. 183‚Äì7, 211‚Äì2 Following the loss of Sydney, Admiralty instructions on capturing merchant ships changed to only encourage attempts if there was no risk of the ship being a raider or accompanied by a U-boat; no such attempts were made for the rest of the war. In March 1941, the heavy cruiser had encountered a tanker supplying a possible raider, which split up and fled when ordered to stop.Frame, HMAS Sydney, pp. 113‚Äì4 Canberra pursued the suspected raider, and fired from maximum range to avoid retaliatory fire, while her Walrus amphibian attempted to stop the tanker with bombs.Frame, HMAS Sydney, p. 114 The cruiser fired 215 shells, with most missing, while all of the Walrus' bombs were used. However, both ships (the raider supply ship Coburg and the captured Norwegian tanker Ketty Brovig) had commenced scuttling once Canberra started firing. Post-action analysis found that if Canberra had moved closer, the same damage could have been achieved for less ammunition, and one or both ships might have been captured: factors that Burnett had commented on during his previous posting as Deputy Chief of Naval Staff, and which Frame and Gill think may have influenced his actions.Frame, HMAS Sydney, pp. 114, 133Frame, No Pleasure Cruise, pp. 166‚Äì8 In the 2009 inquiry report, Cole determined that Burnett was following the approach and challenge procedures for an 'innocent' vessel, instead of a 'suspicious' one.Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney, vol. 2, pp. 387 The other case called for Sydney to stand off at and order the merchantman to stop or be fired upon. Despite the list of ships scheduled to be in the area, Cole believes that Burnett's previous experiences with inaccurate shipping lists caused him to think of Straat Malakkas unexplained presence as a clerical error.Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney, vol. 2, pp. 389‚Äì91 The actions that Olson describes as indicating suspicion are also considered by Cole, who believed that by the time these came into play, Sydney would already be at a disadvantage.Cole, The Loss of HMAS Sydney, vol. 2, pp. 392‚Äì3, 397‚Äì403 Memorials The memorial at Geraldton The main memorial for the loss of Sydney is located on Mount Scott at Geraldton. Planning for the memorial commenced in late 1997, after a speech by researcher Glenys McDonald at the local Rotary club.McDonald, Seeking the Sydney, p. 205 A temporary memorial (consisting of a large boulder, a flagpole, and a bronze plaque), was installed prior to 19 November 1998, and was used in a remembrance ceremony that year. During the playing of the Last Post, a large flock of seagulls flew over the participants and headed out to sea in formation; this inspired the design of the permanent memorial.McDonald, Seeking the Sydney, pp. 205‚Äì6 The memorial included four major elements: a stele of the same size and shape of the ship's prow, a granite wall listing the ship's company, a bronze statue of a woman looking out to sea and waiting in vain for the cruiser to come home, and a dome (dubbed the \\"dome of souls\\") onto which 645 stainless steel seagulls were welded.McDonald, Seeking the Sydney, p. 206 The memorial (minus the stele, which was not completed in time) was dedicated on 18 November 2001, and used the next evening for a commemoration ceremony marking the battle's 60th anniversary.McDonald, Seeking the Sydney, pp. 208‚Äì11 By 2011, the stele had been completed, and a fifth element‚Äîa pool of remembrance containing a map of the region and the marked position of Sydneys wreck‚Äîhad been added.Robertson, HMAS Sydney II Memorial completed in time for the commemorative 70th anniversary Memorial windows recognising the three ships named HMAS Sydney (right) and the aircraft carrier (left) in the Naval Chapel, Garden Island NSW Other memorials commemorating the loss of Sydney include an oak tree planted at the Melbourne Shrine of Remembrance, and an avenue in Carnarvon lined with 645 trees.Winter, H.M.A.S. Sydney, p. 247 The service of Sydney, along with the other ships of the same name, is commemorated by a stained-glass window at the Garden Island Naval Chapel.Olson, Bitter Victory, p. 369 The names of those killed aboard Sydney are inscribed at the Australian War Memorial, while those from Kormoran are inscribed in the Laboe Naval Memorial.Winter, H.M.A.S. Sydney, pp. 247‚Äì8 The \\"HMAS Sydney Replacement Fund\\" was established to help finance the acquisition of a replacement ship.ANAM, Flying Stations, p. 60 The AU¬£ 426,000 raised was used to help purchase Australia's first aircraft carrier in the late 1940s; the Majestic-class carrier was named upon her commissioning in December 1948. The Kormoran name was carried on by the , a Seeadler-class fast attack craft of the Bundesmarine (West German Navy) commissioned in 1959.Winter, H.M.A.S. Sydney, p. 243 East Germany also operated a Kormoran; a small corvette borrowed from the Soviet Navy from 1970 to 1974. Footnotes Citations References ;Books    * * McCarthy, M.

He played in the Scottish leagues for Aberdeen, the Premier League for Sunderland, and the Football League for Plymouth Argyle, Burnley and Derby County. Anderson won 11 caps for Scotland at full international level between 2002 and 2008. Club career =Aberdeen= Anderson was born and raised in Aberdeen and attended Aberdeen Grammar School. He began his career with local club Aberdeen, progressing through the ranks to make his first team debut in 1997; he scored his first goal for the club in a 4‚Äì0 win against Hibernian in 2000. Described as a solid, reliable centre-back (although he played some of his early matches at right-back), Anderson established himself as a first choice player and went on to make more than 300 appearances in his first spell with the club. In 2003, he was appointed club captain, a role he held for four years before moving to Sunderland in 2007. In the 2005‚Äì06 season, he won the most league man-of-the- match awards from BBC Radio Scotland's Sportsound. In 2006, Anderson celebrated ten years at the club with a testimonial match against Everton, a match where the Aberdeen fans showed their respect for his considerable ability and loyalty, with 12,000 fans attending the match. Despite Aberdeen leading 2‚Äì1, Everton won 3‚Äì2. =Sunderland= Despite having stated his desire to remain at Aberdeen for the rest of his career, on 27 June 2007, Anderson completed a ¬£1 million transfer to Premiership club Sunderland, signing a three-year deal. Anderson made his first appearance for Sunderland in a friendly match against Italian side Juventus on 4 August 2007. He came on as a substitute at the Stadium of Light with fifteen minutes of the match remaining. On 18 August 2007, he made his Premier League d√©but as a substitute against Wigan Athletic, where he gave away a penalty for a mis-timed tackle in a 3‚Äì0 defeat. This would prove to be his only Premier League appearance for Sunderland, as his next two years at the club would be blighted by injury. His second and last appearance for the club came against Luton in the League Cup on 28 August 2007. Anderson, making his full d√©but, ruptured his ankle ligaments. After having reconstructive surgery, Anderson was ruled out for three months. On 19 February 2008, Anderson joined Plymouth Argyle on a one- month loan, which was later extended until the end of the 2007‚Äì08 season. He made his d√©but for Plymouth away to Southampton on 19 February 2008, with Plymouth winning 2‚Äì0. Anderson went on to play in all 14 of Plymouth's final league games of the season during his spell at the club. On 26 August 2008, Anderson joined Burnley on loan until the end of the 2008‚Äì09 season. He made his Burnley d√©but on 30 August 2008 in a 0‚Äì0 draw against his former club Plymouth. Anderson played four consecutive league games for Burnley, but in his fifth game for the club, a League Cup tie against Fulham on 23 September 2008, he suffered a serious cruciate ligament injury that ruled him out for the rest of the season. After spending 14 months out injured, Anderson finally made his comeback in a reserve game against Wigan Athletic on 1 December 2009. Anderson's contract was due to expire at the end of the 2009‚Äì10 season. On 31 December, Anderson was reported to be in talks with Hibernian and an \\"unnamed Championship club\\", later revealed to be Derby County. However, Hibernian said they had no interest in signing Anderson, giving Derby County an advantage to win the race. Reports of Anderson leaving were confirmed on 14 January 2010, as Sunderland released him from his contract.\\"Sunderland end Russell Anderson contract\\". BBC Sport. 14 January 2010. After leaving Sunderland, Anderson told MailSport in an interview: \\"It hasn't been a great couple of years and I've spent more time in the treatment room than the dressing-room. But I can't moan about what happened at Sunderland because it won't do me any good.\\" =Derby County= On 15 January 2010, Derby County announced that they had signed Anderson on a contract until the end of the 2009‚Äì10 season. He made his d√©but as a second-half substitute in a 3‚Äì0 win at Peterborough United the following day and appeared sporadically as a late substitute for the club over the next eight weeks, behind the club's first choice pairing of Jake Buxton and Shaun Barker. He finally made his first start for the club in a 2‚Äì2 draw with Middlesbrough on 16 March, in place of Buxton, and kept it for the rest of the season as Derby successfully fought off relegation. Anderson scored his first goal for Derby County, and his first in three years, on 17 April 2010 with the opener in a 1‚Äì1 draw against Crystal Palace which ensured Derby were mathematically safe from relegation. Anderson impressed enough for Derby manager Nigel Clough to confirm his intention to offer Anderson a two-year deal at the end of the 2009‚Äì10 season, seeing Anderson as one of four centre halves for the club's 2010‚Äì11 season alongside Barker, Buxton and Dean Leacock. The deal was signed on 21 April 2010 Anderson started the 2010‚Äì11 season alongside Dean Leacock in the centre of the Derby defence as they earned a 2‚Äì1 win at Leeds United before an injury sustained in training ruled him out for the next two months. He returned to action with a 60-minute appearance in the reserves 3‚Äì1 defeat at Rotherham United. He returned to first team action as an 89th-minute substitute the following Saturday against Preston North End, winning a 93rd-minute penalty which Robbie Savage converted in a 3‚Äì0 Derby victory. He suffered a hamstring injury soon after which ruled him out for another three months before picking up a calf injury in his rehabilitation to rule him out until mid-February 2011. He returned to the side on 2 April with a substitute appearance in a 4‚Äì1 defeat at Cardiff City and featured in the remaining six games of the campaign with a further three starts and three substitute appearances. Following the end of the 2010/11 season, it was reported that Aberdeen had a move for Anderson accepted but the player rejected the chance of a move, preferring to remain at Pride Park. Anderson started the season in Derby's first team but was injured 35 minutes into the first game and missed the first month of the season. Upon returning to the side for a 3‚Äì0 win over Millwall at the end of September, Anderson played a role in seven of Derby's next eight games, often employed at right- back in the absence of first choice John Brayford. However, a hamstring injury sustained in a 3‚Äì0 home defeat to Cardiff City saw him ruled out of action for two months. The injury proved to be the final injury of a blighted spell with the Rams as his contract was canceled by mutual consent on 12 December 2011, with just 19 appearances coming in his 15 months as permanent player at the club. =Return to Aberdeen= Anderson signed for Aberdeen for a second time in January 2012 and was appointed as captain of the team. In an exclusive interview with Daily Record, Anderson expressed return to Aberdeen, so he would overcome his injury. After two months without playing due to an injury, Anderson finally made his first appearance in his second Aberdeen spell, when he came on for Clark Robertson in the 76th minutes as a substitute, as Aberdeen lost 3‚Äì0 against Hearts on 31 March 2012. Despite the loss, Anderson expressed his delight at his return and said he felt that it meant a lot to receive a great welcome from fans. Anderson stated his aim to help the club reach a final for the first time in thirteen years. Having made twenty two appearances so far, Anderson signed a contract extension that will keep him until the next season. Anderson said he was happy at signing a contract extension and delaying his retirement. Anderson's first full season back with Aberdeen wasn't very successful, with the club finishing 8th in the Scottish Premier League. In the 2013‚Äì14 season, Anderson said he had unfinished business at the club and vowed to take them back to where they belong. On 25 January 2014, he scored his first goal for Aberdeen since returning to the club, scoring an injury time equaliser, as Aberdeen drew 2‚Äì2 with Motherwell. After beating St Johnstone 4‚Äì0 to reach the final of the Scottish League Cup, Manager Derek McInnes commented that the final meant many things for Anderson, while Willie Miller compared Reynolds and Anderson's central defense partnership to his own partnership with Alex McLeish during their time at Aberdeen. Anderson was the sixth Aberdeen captain to lift silverware when they defeated Inverness Caledonian Thistle 4‚Äì2 on penalties in the 2014 Scottish League Cup Final. Anderson himself came very close to scoring in the match, hitting the post with a volley. Anderson reacted on Aberdeen winning the Scottish League Cup as an \\"incredible feeling\\". Following the final, Derek McInnes announced he would be giving a new deal to Anderson. The captain's armband that he wore in the final, was snapped up by a fan who paid ¬£500, which later went to charity. On 15 May 2014, Anderson signed a new one-year contract with Aberdeen. Anderson appeared and captained five out of the six for Aberdeen's Europa League matches. During the match against St Johnstone on 23 August 2014, Anderson was limped with a knee injury and was taken off in the 77th minutes. As a result, Anderson was out for the most of the season. On 7 May 2015, Anderson announced that he would retire from playing at the end of the 2014‚Äì15 season. He played his final match on 24 May 2015, as Aberdeen lost 1‚Äì0 at home to St Johnstone. After announcing his retirement, Anderson remained at the club in a business development role. As of September 2017, he continues in this position at Pittodrie, while also supporting brother-in-law, Paul Lawson - in an assistant manager capacity - at Highland League club, Formartine United. International career Anderson played for the Scottish national side on eleven occasions and was both a youth and under-21 international. He won his first cap against Iceland in October 2002, coming on as a late substitute. Anderson went on to win 11 full caps in total, making his last international appearance in March 2008. Awards Anderson won the SPL player of the month award in November 2006. He was nominated for Scottish PFA Players' Player of the Year for the 2006/07 season, and was the only nominee playing for a club other than league champions Celtic. Anderson was also named in the Scottish PFA team of the year for the 2006‚Äì07 season. Personal life His son Jevan is also a footballer. Notes :A. Soccerbase's stats for the match between Nottingham Forest and Derby County on 17 September 2011 fail to count a substitute appearance made by Anderson, instead crediting it to Lee Croft. Therefore, until and unless they correct it, he should have one more appearance for Derby than given on his Soccerbase page.

Its primary mission was command and control of fighter operations within the Eighth Air Force. In the World War II European Theater, its primary mission was air superiority. Its last assignment was with the United States Air Forces in Europe, being stationed at RAF Honington, It was formed at Selfridge Field, Michigan in February 1942. In May, the headquarters moved to England to conduct combat operations over Occupied Europe. After the end of the European War in May 1945, VIII Fighter Command took part in the occupation of Germany until May 1946 while simultaneously coordinating its own demobilization. It inactivated in March 1946 at RAF Honington, the last Royal Air Force station used by the USAAF to be returned to the British Air Ministry. Operational history The VIII Fighter Command was constituted initially as \\"VIII Interceptor Command\\" at Selfridge Field, Michigan on 19 January 1942. Equipped with the 4th and 5th Air Defense wings, the command's mission was air defense over the north central United States. The command's mission was changed as it was ordered to deploy to Britain in February 1942 as first it was reassigned to Charleston AAF on 13 February, then shipped overseas to England where on 12 May it set up headquarters at Bushey Hall, near Watford, Hertfordshire. During much of 1943, bomber escort for VIII Bomber Command was the primary mission for VIII Fighter Command. Fighter groups had a mix of aircraft models of the fighter type plus some administrative utility and liaison types. During 1942‚Äì1943, the assigned fighter groups flew three types of aircraft during 1942‚Äì43: the Supermarine Spitfire, the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt and the Lockheed P-38 Lightning. The Command itself was engaged in command and control, without a complement of aircraft for combat. Eventually the fighter groups were organized into three Fighter Wings. These were the 65th, 66th and 67th. When the Eighth Air Force converted from Bombardment Divisions to Air Divisions, the Fighter Wings came under operational control of the three Air Divisions. =Combat operations= North American P-51 Mustangs of the 375th Fighter Squadron, 361st FG, summer 1944 The effect of the Mustang on the Luftwaffe was swift and decisive. The result was that the Luftwaffe was notable by its absence over the skies of Europe after D-Day, and the Allies were starting to achieve air superiority over the continent. Although the Luftwaffe could (and did) mount effective attacks on the ever-increasing number of Allied heavy bomber formations, the sheer numbers of Allied bombers attacking targets throughout occupied Europe overwhelmed the German fighter force, which simply could not sustain the losses the Eighth Air Force bombers and fighters were inflicting on it. When Lt. Gen. Jimmy Doolittle took command of the Eighth Air Force in January 1944, he initiated a policy change. Previously, fighters were largely tied to the bombers, but Doolittle and General Kepner freed many fighters to go \\"down on the deck\\" and allowed them to become far more aggressive. The fighters were now able to seek out the Luftwaffe and actively attack their airfields. This resulted in Luftwaffe losses rising to unsustainable levels, increasing pressure on the German fighter arm, with an attendant reduction in USAAF bomber losses, while fighter losses inevitably rose. By mid-1944, Eighth Air Force had reached a total strength of more than 200,000 personnel (it is estimated that more than 350,000 Americans served in Eighth Air Force during the war in Europe.) At peak strength, Eighth Air Force had forty heavy bomber groups, fifteen fighter groups, and four specialized support groups. In September 1944, the VIII Fighter Command attached its fighter wings to the Eighth Air Force's Bombardment Divisions. This administrative move allowed each division operational control of several fighter groups to fly escort to their heavy bomb wings. The 65th Fighter Wing was attached to the 2nd Bombardment Division, the 66th Fighter Wing to the 3rd Bombardment Division, and 67th Fighter Wing to the 1st Bombardment Division. This reassignment of the three fighter wings created the Air Divisions within the Eighth Air Force, replacing the Bombardment Divisions. VIII Fighter Command also attacked German transport, logistics centers, and troops during the Normandy campaign, though tactical operations in the European Theater largely were the realm of the Ninth Air Force. During the Battle of the Bulge in late December 1944, several VIII Fighter Command groups were attached to Ninth Air Force Tactical Air Command to relieve the Army's ground forces with close-air support. After the initial German attack was blunted by early January, the units remained attached until February 1945, assisting the counter-attack by Allied forces. First seen by Allied airmen during the late summer of 1944, it wasn't until March 1945 that German jet aircraft started to attack Allied bomber formations in earnest. On 2 March, when Eighth Air Force bombers were dispatched to attack the synthetic oil refineries at Leipzig, Messerschmitt Me 262s attacked the formation near Dresden. The next day, the largest formation of German jets ever seen, most likely from the Luftwaffe's specialist 7th Fighter Wing, Jagdgeschwader 7 Nowotny, made attacks on Eighth Air Force bomber formations over Dresden and the oil targets at Essen, shooting down a total of three bombers. However, the Luftwaffe jets were simply too few and too late to have any serious effect on the Allied air armadas, now sweeping over the Reich with near impunity. V-1 and V-2 rocket sites were gradually overrun and the lack of fuel and available pilots for the new jets had virtually driven the Luftwaffe from the skies. The Me-262 was an elusive foe in the skies for the P-47s and P-51s, outclassing the American fighters. Despite its great speed advantage. Allied bomber escort fighters would fly high above the bombers ‚Äì diving from this height gave them extra speed, thus reducing the speed difference. The Me 262 was less maneuverable than the P-51 and trained Allied pilots could catch up to a turning Me 262. However, the only reliable way of dealing with the jets, as with the even faster Me 163 Komet rocket fighters, was to attack them on the ground and during takeoff and landing. Luftwaffe airfields that were identified as jet bases were frequently bombed by medium bombers, and Allied fighters patrolled over the fields to attack jets trying to land. The Luftwaffe countered by installing flak alleys along the approach lines in order to protect the Me 262s from the ground and providing top cover with conventional fighters during takeoff and landing. Nevertheless, in March and April 1945, Allied fighter patrol patterns over Me 262 airfields resulted in numerous losses of jets and serious attrition of the force. On 7 April, the Eighth Air Force dispatched thirty-two B-17 and B-24 groups and fourteen Mustang groups (the sheer numbers of attacking Allied aircraft were so large in 1945 that they were now counted by the group) to targets in the small area of Germany still controlled by the Nazis, hitting the remaining airfields where the Luftwaffe jets were stationed. In addition, almost 300 German aircraft of all types were destroyed in strafing attacks. On 16 April, this record was broken when over 700 German aircraft were destroyed on the ground. The Luftwaffe was, simply, finished. At war's end the 8th's fighters had claimed 5,280 enemy aircraft shot down and 4,100 more claimed destroyed on the ground. Losses were 2,113 in total. Some 260 VIII FC pilots became aces, each with five or more aerial victories, though the command also recognized planes destroyed on the ground. The top aces were Lt. Col. Francis S. Gabreski (28) and Capt. Robert S. Johnson (28) of the 56th Fighter Group plus Maj. George E. Preddy (26.83) and Lt. Col. John C. Meyer (24) of the 352nd. Gabreski was shot down and captured in July 1944, and Preddy was killed in December. Some 5,000 pilots served with the VIII FC of which 2,156 made at least one part share claim for a kill. Just 57 pilots made claims into double figures.

He is probably best remembered by scientists for his work on the surface tension, and other properties, of liquids.  Life and work  Du No√ºy was a descendant of the French dramatist Pierre Corneille. His mother wrote many novels, one of which, Amiti√© Amoureuse, was translated into 16 languages and ran for 600 editions in France. Born and educated in France, du No√ºy obtained the degrees of LL.B., Ph.B., Sc.B., Ph.D., and Sc.D. He was an associate member of the Rockefeller Institute working in Alexis Carrel's lab from 1920 through 1928, Head for 10 years of the biophysics division of the Pasteur Institute, and the author of some 200 published papers.Ockenga, Harold J., Journal of the American Scientific Affiliation, May 1949. He invented the Tensiometer, a scientific apparatus that used his du No√ºy ring method to measure the surface tension of liquids. Du No√ºy believed that mankind should have confidence in science, but be aware that we know less about the material world than is commonly believed. The following information is taken from one of his books: : \\"Dr. Lecomte du Nouy is an internationally known French scientist. He was born in Paris in 1883, was educated at the Sorbonne and the faculty of Law. He now holds the degrees of LL.B., Ph.B., Sc.B., Ph.D., and Sc.D. In 1915, Dr. du Nouy, then an officer in the French Army, met Dr. Alexis Carrel, and through him became interested in certain problems that appeared to have no solution. His work in developing a mathematical expression of the process of healing of wounds brought him to the attention of the Rockefeller Institute. From 1920 to 1927, as an associate member of that Institute, Dr. du Nouy carried on his research into the properties of the blood. An instrument that he invented brought him an award from the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia. In 1927 he returned to Paris. Until 1937 he acted as head of the important Bio-Physics division of the Pasteur Institute. In that year he was named a director of the \`Ecole de Hautes Etudes' at the Sorbonne. He and his American wife, the former Mary Bishop Harriman, lived in Paris under Nazi domination in the early days of the war, but escaped to the United States in August, 1942, to carry on his work. In the course of his full life, Dr. du Nouy has studied with Sir William Ramsay, and with Pierre and Mme. Curie. He has published some two hundred papers, mostly technical, and seven books on his researches and his philosophy of science. One of these, L'Avenir de L'Esprit, ran to twenty-two editions in France in 1942 and was awarded a prize by the French Academy. Today Dr. du Nouy is known and respected by scientists of every land. In 1944 this respect was signalized by the University of Lausanne, Switzerland, when he was awarded the Arnold Reymond Prize, for his three books Le Temps et la Vie, L'Homme devant la Science, and L'Avenir de L'Esprit, as the most important contribution to scientific philosophy in the past ten years.\\"Lecomte du No√ºy, P., Human Destiny, New York, NY: Longmans, Green & Co., 1947, 17th Printing, back fold-over sleeve of the book dust cover. : Telefinalism Du No√ºy converted from agnosticism to Christianity. He supported a theistic and teleological interpretation of evolution.Simpson, George Gaylord (1964). This View of Life: The World of an Evolutionist. Harcourt, Brace & World, pp. 217‚Äì223. In his book Human Destiny he wrote that biological evolution continues to a spiritual and moral plane. Du No√ºy met Pierre Teilhard de Chardin who shared similar interests in evolution and spirituality.Shuster, George Nauman, and Ralph E. Thorson (1970). Evolution in perspective: commentaries in honor of Pierre Lecomte du No√ºy. University of Notre Dame Press, p. 268. Du No√ºy developed his own hypothesis of orthogenesis known as \\"telefinalism\\".Huggett, Richard (1998). Catastrophism: Asteroids, Comets and Other Dynamic Events in Earth History. Verso, p. 102. According to Du No√ºy evolution could not occur by chance alone and that on an average since \\"the beginning of the world it has followed an ascending path, always oriented in the same direction.\\" He accepted naturalistic evolutionary mechanisms such as mutation and natural selection but believed science could not explain all evolutionary phenomena or the origin of life.Halbach, Arthur Anthony (1948). The Definition of Meaning in American Education. Cath. University of Amer. Press, p. 8.

In statistics, there is a negative relationship or inverse relationship between two variables if higher values of one variable tend to be associated with lower values of the other. A negative relationship between two variables usually implies that the correlation between them is negative, or -- what is in some contexts equivalent -- that the slope in a corresponding graph is negative. A negative correlation between variables is also called anticorrelation or inverse correlation. Negative correlation can be seen geometrically when two normalized random vectors are viewed as points on a sphere, and the correlation between them is the cosine of the arc of separation of the points on the sphere. R. J. Rummel Understanding Correlation from University of Hawaii When this arc is more than a quarter-circle (Œ∏ > œÄ/2), then the cosine is negative. Diametrically opposed points represent a correlation of ‚Äì1 = cos(œÄ). Any two points not in the same hemisphere have negative correlation. An example would be a negative cross- sectional relationship between illness and vaccination, if it is observed that where the incidence of one is higher than average, the incidence of the other tends to be lower than average. Similarly, there would be a negative temporal relationship between illness and vaccination if it is observed in one location that times with a higher-than-average incidence of one tend to coincide with a lower-than-average incidence of the other. A particular inverse relationship is called inverse proportionality, and is given by y = k/x where k > 0 is a constant. In a Cartesian plane this relationship is displayed as a hyperbola with y decreasing as x increases.The derivative \\\\ y \\\\prime = \\\\frac{-k}{x^2} \\\\ is negative for positive real numbers x and as well for negative real numbers. Thus the slope is everywhere negative except at the singularity x = 0.

In this chapter, Jesus goes to Nazareth and faces rejection by his own family. He then sends his Apostles in pairs to various cities in the region where they also face rejection. Finally, Jesus goes back to the Sea of Galilee and performs some of his most famous miracles, including the feeding of the 5000 and walking on water. This chapter also gives an account of the murder of John the Baptist. Text The original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 56 verses. =Textual witnesses= Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: *Codex Vaticanus (325-350; complete) *Codex Sinaiticus (330-360; complete) *Codex Bezae (~400; complete) *Codex Alexandrinus (400-440; complete) *Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (~450; extant verses 1-31) Fragment 7Q5 from Qumran. Dead Sea Scrolls fragment? In 1972, Spanish papyrologist Jose O'Callaghan proposed in his work ¬øPapiros neotestamentarios en la cueva 7 de Qumr√¢n? (\\"New Testament Papyri in Cave 7 at Qumran?\\")Biblica 53 (1972) 91-100. Translated into English by W. L. Holladay in Journal of Biblical Literature 91 (1972) supplement no. 2. that among the Dead Sea scrolls, 7Q5, a small Greek papyrus fragment discovered in Qumran Cave 7 (dated between 50 B.C. and 50 A.D), actually contains the text from Mark 6:52-53, and this was later reasserted and expanded by German scholar Carsten Peter Thiede in his work The Earliest Gospel Manuscript? in 1982. However, the majority of scholars have not been convinced by O'Callaghan's and Thiede's identification. . \\"On the whole, O'Callaghan's thesis has met with scholarly skepticism since the fragments are extremely small, almost illegible, and his strongest case does not agree with known versions of Mark.\\"\\"... Qumran ms. 7Q5 ... is captioned as if it contains a fragment of Mark: it was of course O'Callaghan who made that controversial ‚Äî and now virtually universally rejected ‚Äî identification of this Dead Sea text as a piece of the New Testament ...\\" Elliot (2004), JK, Book Notes, Novum Testamentum, Volume 45, Number 2, 2003, pp. 203.Gundry(1999), p.698. Carlo Maria Martini, S.J., Archbishop of Milan and part of the five member team which edited the definitive modern edition of the Greek New Testament for the United Bible Societies agreed with O'Callaghan's identification and assertions.  Rejection of Jesus at Nazareth  Mark relates the story of Jesus' initial acclaim and later rejection at Nazareth, \\"his own country\\". The account is also found in Matthew 13:53-58 and it is related at an earlier point in Jesus' ministry in Luke 4:14-30. Verse 2 notes that \\"many who heard him\\" were impressed by the wisdom which had been given to him (or, \\"to such a man\\": manuscripts differ in the wording of this verse),Meyer, H. A. W., Meyer's NT Commentary on Mark 6, accessed 25 March 2020 and the \\"mighty works\\" performed by his hands. Since in verse 5, Mark goes on to note that Jesus undertook a minimal amount of healing in Nazareth, it is generally supposed that they had heard of the miracles which Jesus had performed in Capernaum and elsewhere. His neighbours question his authority and do not seem to think much of the Jesus they remember or his family. \\"Isn't this the carpenter (œÑŒ≠Œ∫œÑoŒΩ, tekt≈çn)? Isn't this Mary's son and the brother of James, Joseph, Judas and Simon? Aren't his sisters here with us?\\" Jesus replies with a proverb, Only in his hometown, among his relatives and in his own house is a prophet without honor.Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on Mark 6, accessed 18 November 2017 records the same sentiment: Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country, but in John's account the Galileans received Him, having seen all the things He did in Jerusalem at the feast. Jesus' brothers are here and in Matthew and probably Acts 12:17 mentioned by name, though not his sisters. This chapter, coupled with Mark 3:21,31-35 paint a negative view of Jesus' family relations, though other sources, such as Galatians 1:19 show that James was at least active in the early Church after Jesus' crucifixion. The negative view of Jesus' family may be related to the conflict between Paul and Jewish Christians. \\"Wilson (1992) [Wilson, A. N., Jesus: A life. 1992. New York: Norton & Co.] has hypothesized that the negative relationship between Jesus and his family was placed in the Gospels (especially in the Gospel of Mark) to dissuade early Christians from following the Jesus cult that was administered by Jesus' family. Wilson says: \\"...it would not be surprising if other parts of the church, particularly the Gentiles, liked telling stories about Jesus as a man who had no sympathy or support from his family\\" (p. 86). Butz (2005) [Butz, Jeffrey. The brother of Jesus and the lost teachings of Christianity. 2005. Rochester, Vermont: Inner Traditions.] is more succinct: \\"...by the time Mark was writing in the late 60s, the Gentile churches outside of Israel were beginning to resent the authority wielded by Jerusalem where James and the apostles were leaders, thus providing the motive for Mark‚Äôs antifamily stance... (p. 44).\\" Other prominent scholars agree (e.g., Crosson, 1973 [Crosson, John Dominic. ‚ÄúMark and the relatives of Jesus‚Äù. Novum Testamentum, 15, 1973]; Mack, 1988 [Mack, Burton. A myth of innocence: Mark and Christian origins. 1988. Philadelphia: Fortress]; Painter. 1999 [Painter, John. Just James: The brother of Jesus in history and tradition. 1999. Minneapolis: Fortress Press]).\\" Mission of the Twelve In verses 7-13, Jesus sends the twelve out to the various towns, in pairs, to heal the sick and drive out demons: : And he called the twelve and began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over the unclean spirits. He charged them to take nothing for their journey except a staff ‚Äî no bread, no bag, no money in their belts ‚Äî but to wear sandals and not put on two tunics. (Verses 7‚Äì9). ESV Irish Bishop George Chadwick argues that in the face of rejection, Jesus' response is to accelerate his mission, varying as well as multiplying the means for the evangelisation of the country.Chadwick, G. A. (1896), The Mission of the Twelve, accessed 26 March 2020 The twelve who he sends out are to take only their staffs, and if any town rejects them, they are to \\"... shake the dust off your feet when you leave, as a testimony against them\\" (11), which Robert Miller describes as \\"... a gesture both of contempt and of warning\\".Miller 26 \\"Tunics\\" (, duo chitonas, verse 9) were the long garment worn under the cloak next to the skin.Note [a] on Mark 6:9 in ESV The death of John the Baptist  Supposed head of John the Baptist, enshrined in Rome Mark then tells of the death of John the Baptist at the hands of Herod Antipas. Herod is married to his wife Herodias, former wife of his brother Herod Philip I. John condemns Herod so Herod incarcerates John, although Mark refers to a respectful relationship between Herod and John: \\"a mixture of reverence and superstitious dread towards the prophet and man of God\\".Nicoll, W. R., Expositor's Greek Testament on Mark 6, accessed 27 March 2020 Herodias seeks revenge on John during a birthday party for Herod. Her daughter dances for Herod and persuades Herod to kill John. John's disciples take his body and put it in a tomb. This account is also found in Matthew 14:1-12. The year in which John died is unknown. Josephus reports Herod killing John to quell a possible uprising around AD 36. Herod Philip died in 34 and Herod Antipas died sometime after 40 after being exiled to either Gaul or Spain.  Feeding of the five thousand and walking on water  Walking on water, by Ivan Aivazovsky (1888). Mark 6:30-41 in Uncial 0187 (6th century). Mark then relates two miracles of Jesus. The \\"apostles\\", (ŒøŒπ Œ±œÄŒøœÉœÑŒøŒªŒøŒπ, hoi apostoloi) come back (regroup) and Jesus takes them on a boat to a deserted place where they can rest. Verse is the only time in the received canonical texts where Mark uses \\"ŒøŒπ Œ±œÄŒøœÉœÑŒøŒªŒøŒπ\\": some texts also use this word in Mark 3:14 See the Westcott- Hort text and it is most frequently ‚Äì 68 out of 79 New Testament occurrences ‚Äì used by Luke the Evangelist and Paul of Tarsus. When they land, a large crowd is already waiting for them. Jesus teaches them several unrecorded things, then feeds the entire crowd of 5,000 men (, andres, most frequently meaning 'male adult' in New Testament usage Strong's Greek Concordance: 435) by turning five loaves of bread and two fish into enough food to feed everyone. says there were 5,000 men \\"besides woman and children\\". Jesus sends the disciples in a boat ahead of him to Bethsaida. It is night and they are only halfway across when Jesus walks across the lake and meets them. At first they are scared and think it is a ghost, but Jesus reveals himself and gets into the boat, amazing the disciples. These two miracles occur in John 6:1-24 and Matthew 14:13-36 and the feeding of the crowd is in Luke 9:10-17. The feeding of the 5,000 people and the resurrection of Jesus appear to be the only miracles recorded simultaneously in all four Gospels.  Healing of the sick of Gennesaret  The tzitzis strings of one corner of a tallit They reach Gennesaret and people recognize Jesus. People bring sick people on mats to wherever they hear Jesus is. They beg him to let them touch him, even only touching the \\"fringe of his cloak\\"Jewish Encyclopedia: Jesus: \\"Jesus wore the ·∫íi·∫ìit (Matt. ix. 20)\\"; Strong's Concordance G2899; Walter Bauer's Greek- English Lexicon of the NT, 3rd ed., 1979: \\": 1. edge, border, hem of a garment ‚Äì But meaning 2 is also possible for these passages, depending on how strictly Jesus followed Mosaic law, and also upon the way in which was understood by the authors and first readers of the gospels. 2. tassel (◊¶◊ô◊¶◊™), which the Israelite was obligated to wear on the four corners of his outer garment, according to Num 15:38f; Dt 22:12. ...

Brown argued that this section leaves readers suspecting that such enthusiasm for healing is not the right comprehension of or faith in Jesus.Brown 136 This section is an example of a Marcan summary, in which several stories about Jesus are all wrapped up into one description. They help show the magnitude of his power and perhaps the nature of the danger the authorities see him as presenting to the public order.

His father, William Henry White Jr., abandoned his mother Olivia Lewis White Hill (1888‚Äì1980) shortly after the boy's birth, although W.H. White Jr. briefly returned six months later before leaving Richmond permanently. Though uncommon and difficult to obtain at the time, his mother thus obtained a divorce in 1911. When Oliver was 9 years old, after the deaths of his maternal grandmother and paternal grandfather, W.H. White Jr. returned briefly to Richmond and asked his son if he wanted to live with him in New York City (Oliver declined the offer). pp. xxix, 3. Because Olivia Hill worked at the Homestead Resort in Hot Springs, Virginia, during the spring and fall seasons, and a related resort in Bermuda during the winter, Oliver was raised by his maternal grandmother and grandaunt in a small house on St. James Street in a predominantly African-American section of Richmond. When Oliver was six years old, his mother returned to Richmond for her mother's funeral, and introduced Oliver to her new husband, Joseph Cartwright Hill, who worked as a bellman at the Homestead resort. Oliver's maternal grandmother had moved to Scranton, Pennsylvania, but returned to Richmond shortly before her death. His paternal grandfather William Henry White Sr. had founded Mount Carmel Baptist Church in Richmond, which the family attended and where Oliver attended Sunday school, but Rev. White died on August 13, 1913, not long after grandmother Lewis. His paternal grandmother, Kate Garnet White, was reputedly part Native American, but had little to do with Oliver and his mother. Ancestors of both families had come from Chesterfield County, and at least some were likely enslaved before the American Civil War.Autobiography, pp. 3‚Äì12. Young Oliver got along very well with Joseph Hill, and eventually changed his birth certificate to reflect Hill's surname. Joseph Hill moved his wife and Oliver to Roanoke, where he operated a pool hall until Prohibition made that uneconomic, so he and Olivia resumed their hospitality industry careers. The Hill family lived in the same house as Bradford Pentecost and his wife Lelia (d. 1943), who had no children, but often took in boarders who worked on the Norfolk and Southern Railroad like Mr. Pentecost (a cook). Hot Springs had no schools for black children, so Oliver remained in Roanoke, where he attended segregated schools until the eighth grade (the last offered to blacks in the city at the time). He also obtained his first jobs‚Äîat a local ice cream parlor (until the local police cited it for violating child labor laws), as well as delivering newspapers and ice, finding more strenuous and well-paying work as he grew stronger. During this time, the Pentecost family bought a larger house, 401 Gilmer Avenue. Hill came to consider Roanoke his childhood home. He later specifically remembered not minding serving food to strikebreakers during the Railroad Strike of 1922, because the striking unions were all- white, and sought to limit Negro employees to hard labor. Mrs. Pentecost tried to keep Oliver from working on the railroad, because her brother dropped out of college to work, and never returned, although many of her boarders were taking a year off working to pay for college.Autobiography, pp. 14‚Äì15. In 1916, the Hills moved to Washington, D.C., where Joseph Hill worked at the Navy Yard during the First World War. Oliver was in the sixth grade, but he did not like the D.C. elementary school he attended for a semester, and so was allowed to return to Roanoke and his foster parents, the Pentecosts. In 1923, further education being unavailable to him in Roanoke, Hill moved to Washington D.C. to attend (and graduate from) Dunbar High School, which at the time may have offered the best education available to black children in the country. At first Oliver was behind a semester academically, and also lacked scholarly seriousness. He also played various sports-especially tennis in Roanoke, but baseball, football and basketball at Dunbar (which did not have a tennis team).Autobiography, pp. 36-46. Joseph Hill's brother Samuel worked for the post office in Washington, D.C., and in his off-hours worked as a lawyer handling mostly wills and real estate transactions. Samuel Hill died of a cerebral hemorrhage when Oliver was a college sophomore, and his widow gave Oliver his law books, which piqued his interest in law school. Upon learning that the Supreme Court had taken away many rights of African Americans, and that in the 1920s Congress could not even pass legislation outlawing lynching Negroes, Oliver White Hill determined to go to law school and reverse the Plessy v. Ferguson decision issued slightly before his birth.Autobiography, pp. viii, 73. Hill performed various part-time jobs in D.C. during his college years at Howard University and later the Howard University School of Law. He spent summers earning money for his education at various resorts in the Mid- Atlantic region, including Eagles Mere, Pennsylvania, Pittsfield, Massachusetts, and Oswegatchie, Connecticut, as well as for the Canadian Pacific Railway. After earning his undergraduate degree in 1930, Oliver attended Howard law school. There, Hill was a classmate and close friend of future Supreme Court Associate Justice Thurgood Marshall, although they were leaders of the rival Omega Psi Phi and Alpha Phi Alpha fraternities.Autobiography, pp. 75‚Äì87. Both studied under Charles Hamilton Houston, the chief architect in challenging Jim Crow laws through legal means.Autobiography, pp. viii‚Äìix. Marshall graduated first in his law school class in 1933, and Oliver White Hill second. Hill courted and married Beresenia Ann Walker (April 8, 1911 ‚Äì September 27, 1993) of Richmond on September 5, 1934. She taught school in Washington during his early years of practice in Roanoke, and he soon moved back to Washington.Autobiography, pp. ix, 93. She was the daughter of Andrew J. Walker and Yetta Lee Brown, and niece of Maggie Lena Walker. Their son, Oliver White Hill Jr., was born on September 19, 1949 in Richmond, after Hill returned from his World War II service. Career =Early years= Hill began practicing law in Roanoke during the Great Depression, sharing an office with J. Henry Clayer (a lawyer who once worked in the district attorney's office in Chicago), and a dentist and a physician. It was a general practice and also involved criminal work in surrounding counties, where blacks encountered prejudice. Howard Law School had received funds to challenge segregation of Negroes, but that endowment was nearly wiped out during the 1929 stock market crash. In 1935, Hill helped organize the Virginia State Conference of NAACP branches, with the help of his friend Leon A. Ransom. Printer W.P. Milner of the Norfolk Journal and Guide newspaper was the first President and Dr. Jesse M. Tinsley (a Richmond dentist and president of the Richmond branch) was the Vice-President. When Milner was fired from his job for union activities, Tinsley became the state conference's President (and remained so for 30 years). However, the new general practice did not thrive in Roanoke, and he missed his wife, so Hill returned to Washington D.C. in June 1936. He and his college friend William T. Whitehead frequently took jobs as waiters, and also tried organizing waiters and cooks for the Congress of Industrial Organizations because the American Federation of Labor unions were white or segregated.Autobiography, pp. 102‚Äì103. After some meetings at Howard, Hill returned to Virginia in 1939, thinking to establish a law firm with J. Byron Hopkins (a class above Hill at Howard Law) and J. Thomas Hewin Jr. (whose father had an established practice in Richmond). Hill also traveled with Jesse Tinsley on NAACP errands and speaking assignments, and served the Virginia Teachers Association (because the Virginia Education Association only represented white teachers).Autobiography, pp. 103‚Äì107. He also met and worked some cases in outlying communities with Martin A. Martin of Danville. In 1942, Martin became the first African- American lawyer in the U.S. Department of Justice's Trial Division, but he did not like his assignments and resigned a year later to work in Richmond with Hill and Spottswood W. Robinson III, forming Hill, Martin & Robinson at 623 N. Third Street in Richmond.Autobiography, pp. 109‚Äì111.Richmond Times Dispatch obituary, August 6, 2007, p. A-5. In 1940, working with fellow attorneys Thurgood Marshall, William H. Hastie, and Leon A. Ransom, Hill won his first civil rights case. The decision in Alston v. School Board of Norfolk, Va., 112 F.2d 992 (4th Cir.), cert. denied 311 U.S. 693 (1940) gained pay equity for black teachers. The firm also worked to equalize school facilities and obtain bus transportation for black pupils. On Labor Day, 1942, Hill accompanied five schoolgirls and two fathers to two high schools in Sussex County, Virginia. The county had 23 one-, two- or three- room elementary schools (all lacking indoor plumbing) serving 1,902 children of African-American parents, but offered them education beyond the seventh grade only at a Training School in Waverly, Virginia (and no transportation). As of June 1942, Sussex County also had four new consolidated elementary and high schools for its 867 white students. The surprised principals of Jarrett High School and Stony Creek High School denied the African-American girls admission to their respective schools. Hill politely thanked them, left, and soon filed a lawsuit in the federal district courthouse in Richmond, seeking to declare the disparities between white and black high school students unconstitutional. The suit was dismissed when the county obtained three buses to provide trips to the Training School, and later admitted over 60 black high school students to Waverly High School. However, of those girls, only Helen Owens ever obtained a high school diploma, and that was from Peabody High School in Petersburg; three of her fellow plaintiffs attended the Sussex Training Academy, and another attended but did not graduate from Peabody.Gary M. Williams, Sussex County, Virginia: A Heritage Recalled by the Land (Petersburg, Virginia: The Dietz Press 2014), pp. 231‚Äì233. =Wartime service= In 1943, although Hill was 36 years old, somehow he was drafted during World War II. He chose to join the United States Army, rather than the United States Navy which he thought at the time only allowed black sailors to perform mess-hall duties. Like his partner Samuel W. Tucker and other African-Americans, Hill experienced racial discrimination during his military service, particularly by white officers. Unlike Tucker, Hill was not allowed to enlist in Officer Candidate School, but instead served in a unit of black engineers, and performed mostly support duties as a Staff Sergeant. He credited the unprofessional racist comments of the unit's white chaplain (who tried to stop white English people from fraternizing with the black soldiers) with saving him and his unit from near- certain death during the D-Day Normandy invasion. Hill served in the European Theatre of World War II until V-E Day, when his unit was shipped to the Pacific, from where he was ultimately discharged. =Politics= Returning to his law practice in Richmond, Hill also served as chief of the Virginia branch's legal staff. In 1947, Hill persuaded W. Lester Banks to act as the Virginia Chapter's Executive Director and handle the organization's day-to-day activities. This allowed Hill to make his only attempts for election to public office. In 1947, he first ran for the City Council of Richmond (which had changed its system to nine members elected at-large rather than by districts as before the war), but came in 10th in a race for 9 seats. Hill ran again in 1949 and became the first African American on the City Council of Richmond since Reconstruction. At the time, the city's population was about 30% black, and Hill said he hoped that his election would not only help remove prejudice against blacks in the city, but also give Richmonders a better experience of the responsibilities of citizenship. However, Hill did not win re-election in the next election (1951), failing to make the last available seat by 44 votes,\\"Canvass shows Wilson elected to City Council\\", Richmond Times Dispatch, June 16, 1950 p. 1. because controversy over his legal work discussed below had begun, and because Hill also supported an unpopular highway project.Autobiography, pp. 239‚Äì242. =Civil rights pioneer= As head of the Virginia branch's legal staff, which also included his law partner Spottswood W. Robinson III and a dozen others, Hill filed dozens of lawsuits over the state. They won over $50 million in improvements for black students and teachers.Virginia Lawyers Weekly obituary, August 14, 2007. Hill believed schools could be the crux for desegregation, but he was also a realist, acknowledging that Southern techniques for \\"getting along\\" among races both caused whites to believe most blacks preferred segregation, when in fact they bitterly opposed it.Robbins L. Gates, The Making of Massive Resistance: Virginia's Politics of Public School Desegregation 1954-1956 (University of North Carolina Press, 1964) pp. 141-143 An early case in the Virginia Supreme Court won equal transportation for black school children. In 1951, the team took up the cause of the African-American students at the segregated R.R. Moton High School in Farmville who had walked out of their dilapidated school. The subsequent lawsuit, Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, later became one of the five cases decided under Brown v. Board of Education before the Supreme Court of the United States in 1954. During the 1940s and 1950s, the safety of Hill's life and family were often threatened as a result of his legal work. Crank calls (many with threats) came all through the day and night until the family learned to take their telephone off the hook at night-time (much to the telephone company's displeasure, but then it also refused to trace the crank and threatening calls which had provoked that self- help).Autobiography, pp. 296‚Äì197. Hill's young son was not allowed to answer the telephone, and at one point in 1955 a cross was burned on the Hills' lawn. Nonetheless, Hill and his clients continued their legal battles to assert their civil rights. After the Brown decisions of 1954 and 1955, Virginia's dominant Byrd Organization adopted a policy known as massive resistance to avoid desegregation. A special legislative session in 1956 passed a legislative package known as the Stanley Plan. This included two special legislative committees with enhanced powers, and which came to harass the NAACP. It also permitted the governor (then Thomas B. Stanley, followed by J. Lindsay Almond Jr.)to close schools which desegregated, as well as provided tuition grant support of segregation academies set up to avoid the extant public schools. In 1959, after public schools had been closed in several localities, notably Prince Edward Public Schools, Norfolk Public Schools and Warren County Public Schools, the Virginia Supreme Court and a federal 3-judge panel on January 19, 1959, finally ruled most of the Stanley Plan and Virginia's law prohibiting integrated public schools unconstitutional. Not long after, Governor Almond abruptly dropped \\"Massive Resistance\\" as an official state policy; schools in Norfolk and Arlington integrated peacefully on February 5, 1959, and the schools in Front Royal and all locations except in Prince Edward County reopened. Nonetheless, Prince Edward County schools only reopened in 1964 after the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Griffin v. County School Board of Prince Edward County. After Massive Resistance collapsed, Hill accepted a job with the Federal Housing Administration, putting his private legal practice on hold for five years, but working to desegregate public housing nationwide. The Virginia NAACP's efforts continued, and Hill returned to his Virginia practice and leadership of the state's legal staff in 1965, after passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Those statutes, implementation of new U.S. Department of Health Education and Welfare regulations (which provided additional funds for districts complying with the racial desegregation mandate), as well as Green v. School Board of New Kent County (1968) finally tipped the balance toward integrated Virginia's public schools. Green, the crucial ruling against freedom of choice plans was argued by Hill's law partner Samuel W. Tucker, supported by a young lawyer Hill had recruited, Henry L. Marsh, III. He continued civil rights litigation as a partner of Hill, Tucker and Marsh in Richmond until he retired in 1998. One of the last partners he brought into the firm, Clarence Dunnaville had worked with him in his youth on the school desegregation cases and continued his work through the Oliver Hill Foundation, which seeks to reuse Hill's former home in Roanoke to provide legal services to the poor through third year students at the Washington and Lee School of Law. The firm closed in late 2015 after Henry Marsh III decided to focus on his duties in the General Assembly. Death and legacy Oliver Hill outlived his beloved wife Bernie by more than a decade, and also outlived many of his contemporaries from civil rights struggles. He mourned his partner and former Richmond judge, Harold M. Marsh Sr., gunned down in 1997 while stopped at a traffic light a half mile from the courthouse that would soon bear his and his brothers' names by a tenant behind in rent and facing eviction.Richmond Times Dispatch, May 21, 2016, p. 1A. Hill spent some of his final years working on his autobiography with Professor Jonathan K. Stubbs.The Big Bang: Brown v. Board of Education, The Autobiography of Oliver W. Hill, Sr. It was published in 2000 and reprinted for his 100th birthday in 2007. Hill also gave an oral history interview to Virginia Commonwealth University scholars in 2002. In January 2004, he was a featured panelist during Howard University's celebration of the lawyers who contributed to the Brown decision, on its 50th anniversary. Plaque on Virginia Capitol grounds commemorating Oliver Hill's part in the integration of Virginia schools On Sunday, August 5, 2007, Oliver Hill died peacefully during breakfast at his home in Richmond of natural causes at the age of 100 years. Later that day, Virginia Governor Tim Kaine ordered flags to be flown at half mast to honor Hill and issued a statement: > As a pioneer for civil rights, an accomplished attorney, and a war veteran, > Mr. Hill's dedication to serving the Commonwealth and the country never > failed. And, despite all of the accolades and honors he received, Mr. Hill > always believed his true legacy was working to challenge the conscience of > our Commonwealth and our country. More than 1200 people viewed his body as it rested in the Executive Mansion before his funeral at the Greater Richmond Convention Center, near where his law office had stood for decades. He is survived by his son, Oliver Hill Jr., professor of psychology at Virginia State University and executive director of its research foundation. He is buried in Richmond's Forest Lawn cemetery. His papers are held by Virginia State University, and awaiting processing. =Lifetime honors= In 1959 the National Bar Association named Hill its Lawyer of the Year. In 1980 the NAACP awarded Hill its William Robert Ming Advocacy Award. In 1986 the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund accorded Hill its Simple Justice Award. In 1989, the Richmond Bar Association established the Hill-Tucker Public Service AwardAlan Cooper, \\"Oliver Hill: Civil Rights attorney,\\" Virginia Lawyers Weekly (August 13, 2007) In 1993 the American Bar Association gave Hill its Justice Thurgood Marshall Award. In 1996, Richmond's Oliver Hill Courts Building, housing the Juvenile and Domestic Relations courtrooms, was named for him, and each September remembers Hill. In 1999 President Bill Clinton awarded Hill the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In 2000, Hill received the American Bar Association Medal and the National Bar Association Hero of the Law award. That September (2000), Hill and other NAACP Legal Defense Fund lawyers received the Harvard Medal of Freedom for their role in the landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision. Beginning in 2002, the Virginia State Bar has awarded the Oliver White Hill Law School Pro Bono Award annually to one law student who demonstrates an exceptional commitment to public or community service.\\"Oliver White Hill Law Student Pro Bono Award\\", Virginia State Bar. In 2003, a bronze bust of Hill was unveiled outside the Greater Richmond Convention Center.Richmond Times Dispatch, August 23, 2003, p. B-8. The Black History Museum and Cultural Center of Virginia also has another bust. In 2005 Hill received the Spingarn Medal, the NAACP's highest honor. That October (2005), Virginia Governor Mark R. Warner dedicated the newly renovated Virginia Finance building in Virginia's Capitol Square in Hill's honor. The Oliver W. Hill Building became the first state-owned building as well as the first in Virginia's Capitol Square to be named for an African American. =Posthumous honors= By the time July 2008 had arrived the Virginia Civil Rights Memorial was dedicated in Capitol Square, honoring the legacy of Oliver SR, his fellow attorneys and his clients. The following year, the state's Department of Historic Resources approved four plaques that had honored Oliver SR and his legacy: that, by the Greater Richmond Convention Center marks the former location of his in law office. The memorial in Norfolk recalls his first important legal victory, Alston v. School Board of Norfolk (1940), as well as Beckett v. Norfolk School Board in 1957. The Prince Edward County marker commemorates his victory in Davis V.S School Board of Prince Edward County. The Roanoke marker commemorates Oliver SR's early years in the city and early law practice.Richmond Times Dispatch, January 1, 2009, pp. B-3. A street in Richmond's Shockoe Bottom (a former slave trading neighborhood) named \\"Oliver Hill Way\\" is now one of the proposed boundaries of a redevelopment project.Richmond Times Dispatch, May 28, 2014, p.

Owned by Entercom, the station covers both the Greater San Diego market and the San Diego‚ÄìTijuana transborder agglomeration, and is the flagship station for the San Diego Padres Radio Network, in addition to being the market affiliate for CBS Sports Radio. The KFWN studios are located in San Diego's Stonecrest neighborhood, while the main station transmitter resides in San Diego's Emerald Hills neighborhood; to expand KWFN's overall reach, the station also utilizes a series of booster relays synchronized with the main signal. In addition to a standard analog transmission, KWFN and the booster relay network broadcast over three HD Radio digital subchannels, and is available online via Radio.com. History =The first 50 years, as a country station= 97.3 first signed on as KSEA on January 15, 1964. It was owned by Broodmoor Broadcasting, along with KSON (1240 AM).Broadcasting Yearbook 1965 page B-20 The two stations simulcast their programming. In its early days, KSEA was powered at 25,000 watts, using an antenna at only 220 feet in height above average terrain. Today, KWFN's power and antenna height are double that of KSEA. In 1967, 97.3 began its long run as a country music station, still simulcast with its AM sister station. In 1975, the station call sign was changed to KSON-FM to match its co-owned AM station. KSON-FM had previously been used on stations at 101.5 and at 105.3. In 1985, Jefferson-Pilot Communications acquired KSON-AM-FM.Broadcasting Yearbook 1988 page B-38 The company filed an application in 1989 to construct a single full-on repeater to help improve KSON-FM's coverage in the rapidly growing suburbs of Northern San Diego County. Plans were cancelled in 1991. In 2003, Jefferson-Pilot instead acquired another station at 92.1 FM, licensed to Escondido, and converted it into a simulcast for KSON-FM to cover Northern San Diego County. The new repeater's call sign became KSOQ-FM, similar to KSON- FM's call letters. Jefferson-Pilot became Lincoln Financial Media when it was acquired by the Lincoln Financial Group in 2006. In 2007, KSON-FM was nominated for the \\"Top 25 Markets Country Music Station of The Year\\" award by the Radio & Records magazine. Other nominees included WUSN Chicago, KYGO-FM Denver, WYCD Detroit, KEEY-FM Minneapolis, and WXTU Philadelphia. On March 1, 2009, the station dropped the FM suffix and became KSON, as the AM station was sold and changed its call letters to KNSN. In January 2014, in honor of the January 31 San Diego stop on George Strait's farewell tour, KSON temporarily re-branded as \\"George FM\\". The station added more George Strait music to its playlist, and held on-air giveaways of memorabilia and tickets to the San Diego show. =Entercom ownership= On December 8, 2014, Entercom announced its acquisition of KSON's parent company Lincoln Financial Media. The transaction was approved on July 17, 2015.  Energy  Three years later, Entercom merged with CBS Radio on November 17, 2017. Entercom Completes CBS Radio Merger KSON's simulcast partner KSOQ-FM was spun off to the Educational Media Foundation to comply with FCC ownership caps. The merger placed KSON in common ownership with CHR-formatted KEGY Energy 103.7 ‚Äì which had a better signal in Northern San Diego County, home to most of KSON‚Äôs core audience. Immediately after the merger closed, the country format was moved to 103.7; for the next three days, 97.3 stunted with a message loop redirecting listeners to the new frequency. On November 20, the station assumed 103.7's CHR format and branding as Energy 97.3.. In January 2018, KEGY moved out of its longtime Linda Vista studios and relocated to Stonecrest. The Machine Following the move of Energy to 97.3, KEGY's ratings nosedived, from a 2.2 share to a 1.0 in the Nielsen Audio ratings. In February 2018, Entercom announced it had hired former sports station XEPRS' morning host Dan Sileo; he was slated to host a new program on one of Entercom's San Diego stations, with Sileo saying on social media that he would be able to talk about \\"anything\\". On February 19, the San Diego Padres announced that the team's radio broadcasts would move from sister station KBZT to KEGY for the 2018 season, intensifying speculation that Entercom intended to flip 97.3 to a sports radio format. On March 1, 2018, at 2 p.m., KEGY began stunting with rock music and no imaging, although notably playing \\"Welcome to the Machine\\" by Pink Floyd at the top of each hour. Two days later, KEGY relaunched as 97.3 The Machine, featuring a weekday lineup of hot talk programs including Dan Sileo hosting middays and The Men's Room from KISW/Seattle in afternoon drive. The station would also air San Diego Padres games, including hour-long pre- and post-game shows. Blocks of classic rock music was heard nights and weekends, interspersed with comedy bits. The move marked the return of hot talk to the CBS/Entercom cluster in San Diego, as the 103.7 frequency previously aired a hot talk format as part of CBS Radio's former Free FM network. The former \\"Energy\\" airstaff were moved to KBZT or other co-owned stations across the country.  Kevin Klein Live controversy  The morning show Kevin Klein Live (moving from sister station KITS/San Francisco) was originally scheduled to premiere on KEGY beginning March 29, 2018. On March 26, 2018, Klein and the station posted ads for the show on their social media accounts, which featured the slogan \\"JUMP ... to a new morning show\\". One of the ads featured this caption on a photograph of the San Diego‚ÄìCoronado Bridge. Listeners considered this ad to be insensitive, as the second-largest number of suicide deaths from bridge jumping in the U.S. have occurred on the bridge. Because of the advertisements, there were calls for the Padres to cut their ties with Entercom. The Padres issued a statement the next day, condemning the ad as being \\"offensive, insensitive and completely unacceptable.\\" The team said the expansion of Padres coverage was planned before the team learned the full extent of the format changes, and requested that Entercom apologize for Klein's behavior. Padres chairman Ron Fowler criticized 97.3's new format as being \\"almost shock jock radio\\" and contradictory to his opinion that baseball is \\"family entertainment.\\" Fowler said the team would reevaluate its relationship with KEGY. The photographer of the bridge image also accused the station of having used it without permission. Klein issued a public apology for the ads, stating that \\"I know I've upset many people in America's Finest City, and this is something I regret. The comment was reprehensible and inexcusable. I've failed at making a good first impression, but I hope that you will give me another chance to provide entertainment and good-natured laughs when I go on the air on Thursday morning. Once again, I apologize to all the listeners and the city of San Diego.\\" The program's premiere, meant to coincide with Opening Day, was cancelled, while a promotional party at a local sports bar was also axed by the venue. Neither Entercom or Klein made any public statements regarding the program or if it would premiere at all. The Fan On April 11, 2018, Entercom announced that it would drop The Machine and its hot talk format, and would relaunch KEGY as a conventional sports talk station, 97.3 The Fan, at 5 a.m. the following day. Entercom San Diego market manager Bob Bolinger said the company had used the Kevin Klein controversy as an opportunity to reevaluate KEGY's programming, and explained that \\"the station was always going to be largely about sports and we determined the right thing to do was to go 100% all-in.\\" Padres chairman Ron Fowler was pleased that Entercom was willing to address the team's concerns surrounding the station's content, and that the revamp \\"better reflects the values of the Padres and the San Diego community as a whole.\\" As part of the relaunch, Dan Sileo was moved to mornings, The Men's Room was dropped, and the station also acquired The Jim Rome Show previously heard on XEPRS. The Doug Gottlieb Show was also picked up for the weekday lineup. On May 2, 2018, KEGY changed call letters to KWFN to coordinate with the new branding as \\"The Fan.\\" Many of Entercom's other sports outlets are also branded as \\"The Fan,\\" including original all-sports station WFAN in New York City. In the first three months of the all-sports format, KWFN was among the lowest-rated stations in the market, with Sileo's morning show unable to tabulate a Nielsen Audio rating due to its small number of listeners. The Padres' last-place standing during the 2018 season also hindered the station's ratings. On April 17, 2019, Sileo left KWFN's morning show but remained with Entercom, hosting a weekend program on co-owned WEEI-FM in Boston. Sileo was replaced by \\"Coach\\" John Kentera. The San Diego Union- Tribune speculated that Sileo's departure was tied to listener backlash surrounding plans to have Padres staff members appear on his show for interviews on Friday mornings. Ben Higgins and Steven Woods (formerly of The Mighty 1090 XEPRS) became KWFN's morning hosts on June 10. John Kentera was moved to early afternoons. Boosters In 2019, Entercom received construction permits for five fill-in boosters to improve KWFN's coverage, to be located near La Jolla, Ramona, San Marcos, Escondido, and Encinitas. These signals are expected to be operational by 2022. Programming =Current= KWFN is the flagship station of the San Diego Padres, with The Fan having local rights to Westwood One's NFL and NCAA packages. The station is also a part of the San Francisco 49ers radio network. =Previous= Previous hosts on The Fan include Dan Sileo, who left in April 2019.

After his time with Motorola, he moved to National Semiconductor from 1970‚Äì1983, where he was director of IC design for analog and mixed-signal chips. In 1983 Solomon founded his first company, Solomon Design Automation (SDA Systems), which eventually merged with ECAD to become Cadence Design Systems . Near the end of his time with CDS, he co-founded Smart Machines (in 1994), a company that manufactures direct-drive robots for semiconductor wafer manufacture. The company was acquired in 1999 by Brooks Automation. In 1995, he co-founded Xulu Entertainment, a computer based entertainment venture. In 2001, Solomon unveiled plans for a entertainment center to be named Xulu Universe , which would combine a restaurant/lounge with a simulator of an alien world. According to Solomon, Xulu had invested over $12 million in the project, having hired design and engineering staff from companies such as Lucasfilm and Disney. Solomon was the 1997 recipient of the Phil Kaufman Award \\"for his innovative contributions to design tool technology of benefit to electronic systems and IC designers\\".

Career Sorachi became interested in manga during his childhood. However, during the 4th grade he showed his manga work to his father who immediately laughed at him, after which he abandoned his dream of being a manga artist. After graduating from college, he could not find a job and began drawing manga again to make money. He was able to live from his first work Dandelion, which was featured in the first volume of Gintama, along with a prologue from Sorachi calling it his first official work. When starting serialization the manga was unpopular and was close to being cancelled. Although Sorachi was pleased with the first tank≈çbon selling all of its copies, he later learned Shueisha was afraid of poor sales which resulted in the minimum printed. In order to increase its popularity, the author introduce new characters, the Shinsengumi, who felt memorable to his assistants. Sorachi had little hope on the manga's popularity, as he noted that people used to tell him the manga would not surpass the number of two tank≈çbon volumes. However, once the third volume was released, Sorachi found that he did not have \\"any fresh material to use.\\" During the first year of the series, Sorachi believed that the source of the popularity of Gin Tama was partially connected to the Shinsengumi drama. While the drama ran during the first year of the series, when the manga was mostly shorter stories that established the characters and the world, he felt uncomfortable of making things related to the drama. By the second year and beyond, he became more daring in his stories and concepts, creating longer storylines that included more drama while keeping his sense of humor and satirization of modern Japan by way of his fictionalized past. He finished the manga series in 2019.  Crossovers and appearances  Kenta Shinohara (author of Sket Dance) used to be his assistant, as well as Y≈çichi Amano (author of Akaboshi: Ibun Suikoden). Gintama and Sket Dance had a crossover chapter in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump which was the 349th chapter for Gintama and the 180th for Sket Dance.

It is the larger northern part of the wider Aral-Caspian Depression around the Aral and Caspian seas. The level of the Caspian sea is below sea level, however several places in the depression are even lower, and among them Karagiye near Aktau is the lowest at . The depression lies at the southern end of the Ryn Desert, and is in both Kazakhstan and Russia. Most of the Russian Republic of Kalmykia lies in the Caspian Depression. The Volga River and the Ural River flow into the Caspian Sea through this region. The deltas of the Ural and Volga Rivers are extensive wetlands. The North Caspian depression is part of the continental or semi-arid desert biome. The area receives of rain per year, on average, and less than 10% of the region is irrigated. The Caspian Depression is below sea-level, consisting of large areas of marshlands in the eastern region. It is one of the largest flat lowland areas in Central Asia, covering approximately . The area is very rich in underground oil and gas reserves, and oil and natural gas pipelines cross the depression from north to south and east to west. Many geologists believe the Caspian Sea and the depression were formed by tectonic forces. Some of them also believe that the North Caspian depression became separated from the open ocean in ancient times to form an enormous salt lake. Part of the ancient Silk Road ran through this region. The two largest cities in the depression are Astrakhan in Russia, and Atyrau in Kazakhstan. Today, the region is used mainly for livestock raising. The depression is also noted for salt domes, particularly Volgograd salt. It increases dramatically as one travels from the Ryn Desert toward the Caspian Sea. Russian satellite photos have revealed huge deposits of salt domes (about 1,200), in the Caspian Depression in western Kazakhstan. One dome, called the Chelkar Deposit, covers an area of and is nearly deep. The southern region of the depression, or the north coast of the Caspian Sea, is characterized by large development of damp sites resulting from tidal phenomena. The depression is also home to many insect species, with several thousand different species likely living in the region around the Caspian Sea. Studies have shown that water pollution, mostly coming from the Volga River, poses a serious threat to the biodiversity of the Caspian Depression. Water pollution is contributed mainly by industrial, agricultural, and household discharges.

Elder William Clarke, Sr., was one of the group who withdrew from the \\"Auld Kirk\\" at the Synod Meeting held in Kingston, Canada West in July, 1844; his Minister, Rev. James George, and much of the Presbyterian Church at Scarborough in Connection with the Church of Scotland (now St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church, Scarborough located north of Thomson Memorial Park) remained. The original Knox Congregation (named after Scottish Church reformer John Knox) met first with another congregation located in York Mills, until settling in the developing Scarborough Township village of Agincourt. 40 local residents became the first communicants of Knox Presbyterian Church, originally known as \\"Knox's Church Scarboro\\". In 1853, it became the centre of the \\"Scarborough Township Pastoral Charge\\", along with Melville (formed 1851) in West Hill, Zion Church, Cedar Grove (formed 1855), in Markham Township, Chalmers Church, York Town Line (1863‚Äì1890), and other occasional preaching points. By 1883, Knox Church had grown to become a single-point charge. With a growing membership, the current brick church was built in 1872. This church still stands at the corner of Sheppard Avenue East and Midland Avenue, surrounded by a large cemetery containing many early settlers, and a number of prominent Church leaders. In 1925, this Presbyterian congregation voted 136-106 to be part of the new United Church of Canada. A number of members left to form a \\"Continuing\\" Knox Presbyterian Church, now located nearby at 4156 Sheppard Avenue East. The Christian Education Centre was added in the 1950s.

XESURF airs a Spanish language religious radio format, operated by Zion Multimedia Inc. located in Downey, California. XESURF's transmitter site is located near Tijuana. With 25,000 watts, its signal is heard throughout much of Southern California, including the San Diego and Los Angeles metropolitan areas, as well as northern Baja California. History In the 1940s, AM 540 was home to KFMB San Diego. When KFMB moved up the dial to 760 kHz, the government broadcast authorities in the U.S. and Mexico reserved 540 kHz for a Mexico-based radio station. However, for a few years in the 1980s, there was a U.S.-licensed radio station at this frequency, KSHO in Hesperia, California, and later KNNZ in Costa Mesa, California. It was not until May 13, 1991 that the concession was awarded for XETIN-AM, which was originally licensed as a 5,000 watt daytimer and owned by V√≠ctor Manuel Moreno Torres. Ultimately, a Mexican concessionaire took over operation of XETIN for Los Angeles radio station owner Saul Levine. In 1995, XETIN became an all-news station branded as \\"K-News\\", simulcast with AM 1260 KNNS (now KSUR) in Beverly Hills and AM 540 KNNZ (now 1650 KFOX) in Costa Mesa. The three stations attempted to compete with CBS Radio-owned KNX and Westinghouse Broadcasting's KFWB, both highly rated all-news operations. The all-news format was discontinued two years later. The station became XEBACH-AM in 1997.John Freeman, \\"Classical AM station makes delayed debut\\", San Diego Union-Tribune April 16, 1997 It aired a classical music format. The format flip was spurred by San Diego's original classical station, KFSD, moving from full-powered 94.1 FM to a lower-power suburban station, 92.1 FM in Escondido. A year later, KNNZ moved to 1650 AM, leaving XESURF as the only station in the region broadcasting on AM 540.Broadcasting Yearbook 1999 page D-41 In June 2000, XEBACH became XEJAZZ-AM with a jazz format relayed from KJAZ (1260 AM) in Los Angeles.Robert P.

The station spent much of the mid-2000s simulcasting that standards format until February 2004, then oldies until February 2005, and then adult standards again until October 2006. In October 2006, the station ended its simulcast and flipped to a country music format. Although San Diego had country music on KSON-FM (97.3) and KUSS (95.7 FM), Saul Levine sought to fill the void created when KZLA-FM in Los Angeles dropped the country music format. The XESURF signal reaches Orange County, which Levine called \\"the center of country music listening.\\" The country format was simulcast with KKGO starting on December 1, 2006. When KKGO and the country music format moved to 105.1 FM in February 2007, the format was still simulcast on XESURF. In May 2007, the station split from the simulcast to air classic country music as \\"540 The Zoo.\\" On November 27, 2007, XESURF changed formats yet again, to a news/talk format simulcast from KGIL (1260 AM). After KGIL dropped the talk format on August 27, 2009, XESURF temporarily carried an oldies format until changing to Spanish-language programming that September.

The original lineup consisted of Price Conlan on drums, Stephen McCowage on lead guitar, Tim O'Reilly on bass and vocals, Michael Quinlan on rhythm guitar and vocals. O'Reilly, Quinlan and McCowage had all played in a psychedelic 1960s-styled indie pop band, Prince Vlad & the Gargoyle Impalers. They recorded two extended plays, Lupe Velez (1988) and Elephant (1990); however, they had disbanded late in 1989. History The Mexican Spitfires were an inner-city suburban band which developed a collection of songs about Sydney. They dealt with aspects of local daily life,: \\"Ivy Street\\" about a dilapidated street familiar to Sydney University students who walk to or from Redfern Station; \\"Sydney Town\\" on the moral tightrope found between the city and Kings Cross down Park Street; \\"Town Hall Steps\\" about a meeting out front of Sydney Town Hall; \\"Until\\" on spending time in Katoomba in the nearby Blue Mountains; and \\"Rookwood\\" talks about Rookwood Cemetery. Similar lyrical territory was farmed by contemporaries, Paul Kelly & the Coloured Girls and John Kennedy's Love Gone Wrong. With three songwriters in O'Reilly, Quinlan and McCowage, the band's set lists contained mostly original material. Note: For additional work user may have to select 'Search again' and then 'Enter a title:' or 'Performer:' Harking back to their earlier experiences in Prince Vlad & the Gargoyle Impalers, the band displayed a 1960s pop sensibility with strong harmonies from Quinlan and O'Reilly and also covered tracks by the Beatles' \\"If I Needed Someone\\" and the Monkees' \\"Mary Mary\\". In July 1986 the Mexican Spitfires played their first gig to an audience at the Lismore Hotel, Sydney. They were signed to Red Eye Records. The group were finalists at a talent quest, Battle of the Bands, run by University of New South Wales in October; alongside Bodycore, Things for the Weekend, Merrie Melodies, and the Jive Turkeys. George Braddock of Tharunka saw their performance in October 1987, he observed \\"[they] play original songs with a basis on harmony. Like Paul Kelly an acoustic lays the basis for their arrangement with tasteful electric lead following In and out of powerful pop songs. Sounding somewhere between Lloyd Cole and the Smiths, with a hefty dose of Australian pub sounds, they are an interesting and worthwhile Sydney band.\\" The band's debut six- track 12-inch extended play, Lupe Velez, was released in 1988. The EP was produced by Jon Schofield (of the Coloured Girls), engineered by Phil Punch, and featured a keyboard appearance by Russell Parkhouse (ex-The Riptides). The EP appeared on the independent charts, moving into the top 5 in Sydney and received significant airplay on 2JJ (now 2JJJ), particularly for the \\"Sydney Town\\", \\"You Can't Run\\" and \\"Town Hall Steps\\". Lupe Velez received favourable reviews in English music magazine, NME, and in the Australian music press. \\"Town Hall Steps\\" was described by The Sydney Morning Heralds Michael Kozoil as \\"[an] upbeat ditty... about a summer rendezvous\\" at Sydney Town Hall. According to London-based rock music critic, Andrew Mueller, as quoted in Who's Who of Australian Rock the Mexican Spitfires provided \\"Impressive songs in the Kelly/Kennedy vein with a slightly English sounding pop touch.\\" The EP was favourably received in Germany and Italy, where \\"You Can't Run\\" gained substantial airplay on Radio Marte, Radio Luna and Radio Delfino in Catania. The music video for \\"Sydney Town\\" made its debut on SBS's world music show, Rock Around the World, before being shown on ABC's, rage. The band also performed \\"Ivy Street\\" on the Network TEN programme, Ridgey Didge. After their debut, the Mexican Spitfires returned to the Electric Avenue Studio of Phil Punch to record their second six-track 12-inch EP, Elephant, during 1989 and 1990. That EP has not been released in any format, despite interest from indie pop labels such as Catania's No Tyme Records. Two tracks, \\"Sydney Town\\" and \\"You Can't Run (Forever)\\", were included on a compilation album by Red Eye Records' various artists, Asides and Besides: The First Five Years (1990). Penelope Layland of The Canberra Times described the album, \\"a fun collection, snappily packaged in bright red. The liner notes explain where each track originated, and indicate if they went anywhere on the independent charts.\\" \\"Sydney Town\\" appears on a Sony Music double CD compilation, Somewhere in Sydney: 30 Songs from the Harbour City, which was released in 2000 to coincide with the Sydney Olympic Games. During the mid to late 1980s, the Mexican Spitfires played many local pubs: the Hopetoun, the Sandringham Hotel in Newtown (aka the \\"Sando\\"), Paddington Green, and Harold Park. In 1988 they toured Melbourne with other Red Eye acts the Crystal Set, Curious (Yellow) and the Bhagavad Guitars. The band also played with other bands such as: the Triffids, Roaring Jack, Penguins on Safari (later the Whitlams), the Wet Taxis, the Last Metro, the Upbeat, Billy Baxter and the Hollowmen and John Kennedy of John Kennedy's Love Gone Wrong. Following McCowage's departure in 1989, DJ Pantless joined the band on lead guitar. That line-up supported the Proclaimers on the Sydney and Canberra leg of their 1989 tour supplemented by Dominic Killalea of the Upbeat filling in on drums. O'Reilly has since gone on to perform with the Sydney gospel music choir, the Elementals, and recorded Live at the Basement. Whilst the Mexican Spitfires have not played live as a band since early 1989, their music has been played on radio stations like 88.1 FM WMBR Cambridge, Massachusetts, and fans of their music can be found in Australia, Japan, Germany, Italy and the United States. Since then films have been made about this even in history.

Early life Noble was born in Berlin in 1935 the son of a British diplomat and a Norwegian mother. He received his primary education in Shanghai, Argentina, and at Summer Fields, Oxford, before attending Eton and University College, Oxford. He was the nephew of the Conservative MP Michael Noble and a great-grandson of Sir Andrew Noble, 1st Baronet. The Nobles have been landowners in Dunbartonshire and Argyllshire since the 15th century, often with careers in the military or in business. Career Noble began his own career by establishing a merchant bank, Noble Grossart, in Edinburgh in 1969. When he was bought out, he used the proceeds to buy part of the MacDonald Estates on Skye. This included 20,000 acres of land, most of which was on the Sleat peninsula. Noble subsequently developed many business interests on Skye and elsewhere, including Hotel Eilean Iarmain and the whisky company Pr√†ban na Linne which produces a vatted malt whisky called Poit Dhubh (literally the \\"Black Pot\\" or \\"Illicit Still\\". The company also produces two blends, T√© Bheag nan Eilean (\\"small dram of the islands\\") and Mac na Mara (the \\"Son of the Sea\\"). Although not a native Gaelic speaker Noble became an enthusiastic learner of the language and used his position as landowner to support the language, introducing an employment policy of positive discrimination in favour of Gaelic speakers. He was directly responsible for the erection of the first Gaelic road signs in Scotland, and the holder of the first ever Gaelic cheque book, issued for him by the Bank of Scotland. Noble was the original founder of the Gaelic medium college Sabhal M√≤r Ostaig which is located in Sleat, Skye. The original \\"Large Hall\\" (the Talla Mh√≤r) was part of the MacDonald estates. Noble married Lucilla Mackenzie in 1990. He died at home on Skye on 25 December 2010, and was succeeded in the baronetcy by his brother, Timothy Peter Noble.

It was also used by its successor agency PortsToronto, a federal agency formerly known as the Toronto Port Authority. The lower floor is home to Harbour Sixty Steakhouse.

When built in 1994, it broke many records and held many firsts when it opened. Instead of having a short layout designed to fit into a compact area like Batman: The Ride, Raptor was designed with a larger, 3,790-foot (1,160 m) layout, making it the tallest, fastest and longest inverted roller coaster in the world when it opened. It features six inversions, including a cobra roll, a first for inverted roller coasters. The ride is themed as a bird of prey. History On August 19, 1993, Cedar Fair Entertainment Company filed a trademark for the name Raptor. Raptor was then announced on September 1, 1993 during a press conference. Regarding the design of the attraction, Cedar Point management said: \\"Raptor will be the most exciting and ambitious project ever ... a project that will challenge the boundaries of imagination and change the Sandusky, Ohio amusement park/resort like nothing before it.\\" Construction started after the 1993 season with the site clearing of the Mill Race log flume water ride. The Midway Carousel and Calypso were relocated in October to other areas of the park to make room for Raptor. Footers also began to be poured that month. The lift hill was topped off in December with track construction continuing through January 1994. The first trains were tested about two months later in March. Final preparations were made in March with the entrance plaza being built and of midway replaced. Media day was held on May 6 before the ride opened to the public the next day for the first time. The ride was originally painted with dark green supports, bright green track and unpainted rails. It was repainted for the 2002 season and the rails were painted dark green, matching the supports. It was repainted again before the start of the 2016 season. Ride experience View of Raptor from the Sky Ride Raptor is located on three acres (1.2 ha) at the front of the park near Blue Streak. The ride travels over the pathway to Blue Streak then passes by the Cadillac Cars and Cedar Downs Racing Derby. =Layout= The ride begins with a left-hand turn out of the station to the lift hill that ascends . Riders are pulled up by a 9,000 lb (40 kN) chain lift. At the top, the train dips slightly into the pre- drop before turning 90 degrees to the left as it drops down the first hill. From the bottom the train immediately enters a vertical loop. The train then enters a zero-g roll followed by the cobra roll which inverts riders twice. The cobra roll was a first for inverted roller coasters. After the cobra roll, the train climbs through an upward spiral and enters the mid-course brake run. Next, the train dives down to the right transitioning into a brief straight section of track. Riders then enter the first of two corkscrews which rotates the train 360 degrees to the left. The track straightens briefly again before turning to the right and entering a short dip before taking riders into the second corkscrew. The ride finishes with a 1.5 revolution flat helix where riders encounter strong positive G-forces before making one last left turn into the final brake run. One cycle of the ride lasts about 2 minutes and 16 seconds. =Track= The steel track is approximately in length and the height of the lift is approximately . The first drop is . When the coaster first opened, it was painted with dark green supports, bright green track and unpainted rails. 1,500 gallons of paint were used to originally paint it. Raptor was repainted for the 2002 season and the rails were painted dark green, matching the supports. Most of the 117 sections of track were manufactured by Clermont Steel Fabricators in Batavia, Ohio. The roller coaster was repainted again for the 2016 season with its original colors. =Trains= Raptor operates with three steel and fiberglass trains. Each train has eight cars that have four seats in a single row for a total of 32 riders in Ski lift like trains. Riders are secured by an over the shoulder restraint with a locking belt.

It broadcasts a Sports/Talk radio format, branded as \\"The Mightier 1090\\". Also broadcasting to the San Diego-Tijuana, Los Angeles-Orange County, Riverside-San Bernardino areas of Southern California. XEPRS is a Class A, 50,000 watt clear-channel station using a non-directional antenna in the daytime. Because it must protect other Class A stations on 1090 AM, it uses a three-tower array directional antenna at night. The transmitter is just off of Mexican Federal Highway 1D in Fraccionamiento Rancho del Mar.FCCdata.org/XEPRS The daytime signal can be heard over much of Coastal Southern California and parts of Baja California. At night, the skywave signal extends over much of the West Coast of the United States and Northwestern Mexico. History  Today's 1090 AM started out as 150,000-watt XERB on 730 kHz.RPC: Concession for XERB, 8-31-36 The original concession was awarded to Manuel P. Barbachano, grandson of one-time Governor of Yucat√°n, Miguel Barbachano. The concession was sold to Radiodifusora Internacional, S.A., in 1939. As part of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement in 1941, the station moved from 730 to 1090, powered at 50,000 watts. XERB was sold to Interamericana de Radio, S.A., in 1950.Broadcasting Yearbook 1960 page B-91 In the early 1960s, Robert Weston Smith (a.k.a. Wolfman Jack) was living in Del Rio, Texas and appearing on the 250,000-watt \\"border blaster\\" radio station 1570 AM XERF, just over the Rio Grande in Ciudad Acu√±a. In 1964, after several violent incidents at XERF's transmitter, Smith and partner Marvin Kosofsky (called \\"Mo Burton\\" in Wolfman Jack's autobiography) decided to relocate to an American radio station. They purchased Minneapolis-area daytimer station AM 1570 KUXL. Smith moved to Minnesota and never appeared as Wolfman Jack on KUXL, but rather worked as the station's general manager while shipping Wolfman shows on tape to XERF. In 1965, Smith made an arrangement with the U.S. agent to program another border blaster, 1090 XERB in Tijuana. Smith began selling ad time on the Mighty 1090 and recording Wolfman Jack shows for his new affiliate. Initially, Smith controlled the station's affairs from Minneapolis, but in 1966, Smith, along with fellow KUXL staffers Ralph Hull (a.k.a. Preacher Paul Anthony and The Nazz) and Art Hoehn (a.k.a. Fat Daddy Washington), relocated to Southern California to run XERB full-time. Wolfman and his associates were able to make the station turn a large profit by selling 15-30 minute blocks of time to radio proselytizers. The preachers were able to pay for the time by asking their listeners to send them donations. Because they had such a large following and made so much money, the radio evangelists were willing to pay sizable fees for airtime. In addition to the paid brokered programming, Wolfman began broadcasting his own pre-recorded shows on three different high- powered Mexican stations at different times of the day: XERB, XERF, and XEG 1050 kHz in Monterrey, Nuevo Le√≥n, powered at 100,000 watts. Wolfman courted advertisers who enjoyed his brand of rock and roll music and his howling personality. According to his biography, by 1971, Wolfman was making a profit of almost $50,000 a month. The Mexican company executives that leased XERB noticed this and got greedy. They wanted to throw him out and make all the money themselves. The owners bribed Mexican officials into politically squeezing Wolfman off the air. The Mexican government acquiesced by passing a law prohibiting Pentecostal and Evangelical religious programming on Mexican airwaves. Since XERB made most of its profits from airtime sold to the prayer- cloth preachers, Wolfman could no longer make payments to the owners each month. \\"That was it,\\" Wolfman remembered. \\"In one stroke they cleaned out 80 percent of all the money we were expecting to make.\\" He and Kosofsky had to return control of the station to the Mexican owners. Some years later, the Mexican government repealed that law and allowed radio preachers back on the air. But, without Wolfman Jack howling over the airwaves, XERB never duplicated the fame he had brought it. The XERB call sign was recycled in 1986 for a radio station in Cozumel, in the state of Quintana Roo with no relation to the old XERB. =XEPRS: The Soul Express= With Wolfman out of the way, the station owners tried to duplicate his successful formula. They changed the call letters to XEPRS (‚ÄúThe Soul Express‚Äù), programmed at night with soul music, mostly for the African-American and Latino neighborhoods around Los Angeles. The Wolfman still broadcast for over a year while under the new ownership, until April 15, 1972. Airchecks of that last show are still available online; tapes of old Wolfman shows could be heard on XEPRS as late as 1980. In the summer of 1972, George Lucas filmed Wolfman Jack using the studios of station KRE in Berkeley, California for the film, American Graffiti. (Some artistic license was employed for the movie: Wolfman is shown doing his program live from California, although the Brinkley Act made such broadcasting illegal.) =Daytime Spanish, nighttime oldies= Through the 1970s, '80s and '90s, XEPRS aired a variety of formats in Spanish, in the daytime, while sometimes running English-language programming at night. From 1976 to the early 1980s, Rick Ward and Ron Beaton programmed oldies during the 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. skywave signal. Ron Beaton is now retired in Glendale, California, and Rick Ward is retired, living in Little Rock, Arkansas. Wolfman's old shows were broadcast from 11 p.m. to 1 a.m. on Saturday nights during this period. Early in the 1980s, DJ Sean Green hosted a daily oldies show, from 7 p.m. to midnight, in English. He called it \\"1090 Express Radio.\\" The show's advertisements, announced by Dick \\"Huggy Boy\\" Hugg, were mostly for oldies albums that appealed to the Lowrider culture. The last Spanish-language format was salsa, merengue and other forms of Tropical music as \\"Radio Caliente.\\" From 2000 to 2002, XEPRS was the Spanish-language home of the Anaheim Angels, including its championship year of 2002. =Sports radio= In 2001, another powerful AM station in Tijuana, 690 XETRA (now XEWW), began simulcasting much of the English-language sports programming also heard on AM 570 KLAC in Los Angeles and a few other AM stations around Southern California, with the moniker \\"XTRA Sports.\\" Several of the AM 690 hosts and sportscasters were released, including Bill Werndl, John Kentera, and others. That left the San Diego radio market without a local all-sports station. The former head of programming for XTRA Sports 690, John Lynch, saw the void and formed the Broadcast Company of the Americas, launching a new all-sports station on AM 1090 in March 2003. He brought over most of the on-air talent released from 690 XETRA. John Lynch has another involvement in the world of sports; he's the father of the former NFL defensive back, also known as John Lynch. In addition, John Lynch, Sr., helped introduce Lee \\"Hacksaw\\" Hamilton to San Diego sports radio. In 2004, XEPRS acquired the rights to become the flagship station of the San Diego Padres. XEPRS was the Padres' home station until 2016, when Entercom won the rights and began broadcasting the games on Alternative Rock station 94.9 KBZT. Beginning February 1, 2006, XEPRS started simulcasting its sports talk programming on sister station 105.7 XHPRS-FM, based in Tecate, Baja California. This operation was aimed at improving the station's signal to Eastern San Diego County as well as giving Mighty 1090 listeners the choice of hearing it on FM or AM. The station then became known as \\"XX (Double X) Sports Radio.\\" News updates were produced by San Diego television station KUSI Channel 51. On April 15, 2008 at 9 a.m., XX Sports Radio ended the simulcast on 105.7 MHz. XHPRS-FM became an oldies radio station branded as \\"105.7 The Walrus.\\" This was the first FM oldies station in San Diego since XHOCL-FM flipped to a Spanish language format on September 1, 2005. As a result of the simulcast's break-up (except for Padres games), XX Sports Radio was renamed XX 1090. In 2009, the Padres simulcast was moved to AM 1700 XEPE. On October 6, 2010, XX 1090 became a part-time affiliate of ESPN Radio, simulcasting sister station XEPE 1700 overnights and weekends, dropping the Sporting News Radio affiliation XEPRS held since 2008. The Mighty 1090 previous logo used from 2012 to 2015 XEPRS has also carried San Diego Toreros men's basketball, San Diego State Aztecs college football and basketball, and the San Diego Gulls AHL hockey, and has aired a few games for the Anaheim Ducks, the Gulls' parent club. Beginning with the 2018 season, XEPRS carried Los Angeles Rams football games.Inside Radio \\"L.A. Rams Get San Diego Presence\\" June 7, 2018 =Return of \\"The Mighty 1090\\"= On December 17, 2012, the station re-branded as \\"The Mighty 1090\\" to coincide with the return of the Scott & BR Show. On January 2, 2013, the station became the San Diego outlet for CBS Sports Radio with a line-up featuring Jim Rome's syndicated show on CBS, plus local San Diego hosts heard mornings and afternoons. In 2014, the station signed Dan Sileo to host its morning drive show. In April 2018, XEPRS got new competition on the FM dial when Entercom switched KEGY to a sports format, branded as \\"97.3 The Fan.\\"InsideRadio.com \\"Entercom Unplugs ‚ÄòThe Machine,‚Äô Launches ‚ÄòThe Fan.\\" Apr 12, 2018 It became the San Diego Padres' flagship station, taking over from co-owned KBZT. Dan Sileo, who left XEPRS earlier in the year, joined The Fan for a morning drive time show. As a result, XEPRS gave up its affiliation with CBS Sports Radio, since Entercom owns a stake in that network and began carrying its programming on 97.3 FM. On nights and weekends, XEPRS returned to airing ESPN Radio, also heard on co- owned 1700 XEPE. =Return to Spanish-language programming= In December 2018, it was reported that the Bichara family, owners of Interamericana de Radio, as well as stations in Monterrey and McAllen, Texas, was not happy with its relationship with BCA. The Bicharas began looking for a new operator for the station for $100,000 a month in rent, or $11 million to buy the station. At the same time, Jaime Bonilla Valdez's Media Sports de M√©xico had halted BCA's program supply to two stations it owned in a rent dispute. On April 10, 2019, XEPRS replaced BCA's sports format with a simulcast of one of the Bichara family's McAllen stations, KJAV. The BCA-operated webcast aired ESPN Radio programming for the remainder of the day. The webcast resumed carrying \\"Mighty 1090\\"'s local sports shows on April 11.First Max Now Mighty A Mexican Operators BCA Bounce (Retrieved from Radio and Business Report, rbr.com 12 April 2019)Sports Prograrmming Abruptly Off-The-Air at XERPS (Retrieved 12 April 2019 from All Access Music Group website) In several tweets, Andr√©s Bichara revealed that BCA had not paid its rent for XEPRS in four months and that issues between BCA and the Bicharas had dated back three years. BCA shut down the \\"Mighty 1090\\" audio stream on April 29, 2019. XEPE also halted its broadcasts of ESPN Radio, leaving the San Diego-Tijuana market without an ESPN English-language affiliate. =\\"The Mightier 1090\\"= In April 2020, Bill Hagen, owner of an advertising agency in Flagstaff, Arizona, signed a five- year lease with XEPRS owner Interamericana de Radio and announced plans to relaunch the station as \\"The Mightier 1090\\" with a mix of talk, sports and lifestyle features. On August 12, XEPRS begun stunting a loop of the station's \\"History of 1090\\". The loop features on the history of the frequency and some of the station's eras with Wolfman Jack \\"The Soul Express\\", and its prior \\"Mighty 1090\\" existence, taking pot shots at a previous management running it into the ground. The loop also promoted the newly relaunched station as \\"the first radio station in the cloud, with no studios\\". The station launched at 9 a.m. on August 17.

He is also the father of Sierra Leonean politician Charles Margai.Sir Albert Margai and the Shadow of Thurgood Marshall Worldpress.org  Early life  Albert Margai was born in Gbangbatoke, Banta Chiefdom, in what is now the Moyamba District, Freetown. His stepfather, M. E. S. Margai, who gave him the family name Margai, was a wealthy trader from Bonthe. Margai received a Roman Catholic education at St. Edward's Primary School and went on to be one of the first group of students to attend St. Edward's Secondary School. Margai became a registered nurse and this was his occupation from 1931 to 1944. He later travelled to England and read law at the Inner Temple Inns of Court, where he qualified in 1948. Prior to his political career, he owned a private law practice in Freetown.  Political career  = Colonial era = Margai was elected first Protectorate Member to the Legislative Council in 1951. In 1952 he became a Cabinet Minister and Sierra Leone's first Minister of Education. In 1957 he was elected Member of Parliament for the Moyamba Constituency). He served as Minister of Finance of Sierra Leone in Milton's government after 1962, where he also held positions alternatively in Education, Agriculture, and Natural Resources. After the death of his brother, Sir Albert served from 1964 until 1967.  Sierra Leone National Party  Margai was a founding member of the Sierra Leone National Party, which was formed in 1949 to advocate and aid in the transition to independence for the country.  Sierra Leone People's Party  However, in the years leading up to independence, Margai was allied more closely with Siaka Stevens than his brother. He took leadership of the Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP) in 1957, but stepped down to form the People's National Party with Stevens. A major point of contention between the two groups involved the degree of involvement of traditional chiefs and traditional rules in the modern state. In fact, Margai openly asked traditional rulers to stay out of politics. He was one of a number of leaders (Kwame Nkrumah in Ghana and Milton Obote in Uganda are other examples) who attempted to remove the system of democratic governance enshrined in multi- party democracy as he believed that this would encourage politicians to accentuate the ethnic differences within the state and therefore threaten the viability of Sierra Leone as a country. = Independence = The Crown Colony and Protectorate of Sierra Leone was granted political independence on 27 April 1961. Albert's brother, Sir Milton Margai was appointed first Prime Minister of Sierra Leone. At the time, Albert was serving as a member of parliament for Moyamba.  Minister of Finance  Margai was appointed Minister of Finance of Sierra Leone in 1962. Margai changed Sierra Leone's currency from the British pound to the \\"leone\\", a decimal legal tender roughly equivalent to half a Sterling pound at the time. He also founded the Bank of Sierra Leone and made it the national bank. = Premiership and public image = Albert margai was made Prime Minister on 29 April 1964. He was highly criticized during his tenure. He had a penchant for extravagant pageantry and was accused of corruption and of a policy of affirmative action in favor of the Mende tribe. The tantrum-prone Prime Minister was nicknamed \\"Akpata\\", a Mende word meaning \\"our wild, fat man\\".End of The Exception Time, 31 March 1967 Margai was also nicknamed \\"Big Albert\\" and \\"African Albert\\". Margai endeavoured to change Sierra Leone from a democracy to a one-party state.  1967 elections  Up until the 1967 elections, Sierra Leone had been an exemplary democratic, post-colonial state. However, the campaign strategies of Margai would forever alter this trend. He was against any candidates from the opposition running against candidates from his own party. Margai refused to dignify accusation of corruption with a response. Riots broke out across Sierra Leone and the government had to declare a state of emergency.  Coup d'√©tat  Margai's opponent Siaka Stevens achieved a small parliamentary majority and he was sworn in as the third Prime Minister of Sierra Leone by Governor General Sir Henry Lightfoot Boston. Margai's friend and ally Brigadier David Lansana, who was the Commander of Sierra Leone's Armed Forces at the time, arrested both Stevens and Lightfoot Boston. He declared martial law, dismissed the election results and proclaimed himself the interim Governor General.  Counter coup  In April 1968, a group of noncommissioned officers staged a counter coup in an attempt to restore the democratic process to Sierra Leone. The so-called Sargents Coup was led by Lieutenant Colonel Ambrose Patrick Genda who Margai had fired in 1967. Eight member of the officers formed the National Reformation Council and elected Brigadier John Bangura to the post of acting Governor General. A staunch democrat, Bangura re-instated Siaka Stevens because he had won the election.  Civilian life  Margai warned: \\"If the Stevens government does not do something to elevate the lives of the have-nots, the poor, they would one day rise to demand from the haves, the rich, their own share of the economy.\\"  Death  On 18 December 1980, Margai died in his sleep. He is survived by his son, politician Charles Margai.

Despite never achieving commercial success, the band is often credited ‚Äì alongside Exodus, Testament, Forbidden, Death Angel and Vio-lence ‚Äì as one of the leaders of the Bay Area thrash metal scene of the mid-to-late 1980s, and they have gone through several line-up changes, leaving guitarist Lee Altus as the only constant member. To date, Heathen has released four studio albums: Breaking the Silence (1987), Victims of Deception (1991), The Evolution of Chaos (2009) and Empire of the Blind (2020). History =Early history (1984‚Äì1987)= Heathen was formed in 1984 by guitarist Lee Altus and drummer Carl Sacco (formerly of Metal Church), who later recruited lead vocalist Sam Kress and guitarist Jim Sanguinetti (Who went on to found the band Mordred). Shortly after their first gig in 1985, Kress and Sanguinetti left the group and were replaced by vocalist David Godfrey (formerly of Blind Illusion) and guitarist Doug Piercy (formerly of Anvil Chorus and Control). The band also recruited bassist Eric Wong around this time. This lineup debuted in early 1986 and soon became prolific around the Bay Area. Their early style could be described as the aggression of thrash metal combined with NWOBHM-style vocals and arrangements, acoustic intros or outros, and fast-paced melodic shred solos. Heathen's break came when they released their Pray For Death demo, which in 1987 resulted in their signing by Combat Records. Shortly after their signing Eric Wong left the band to join Piranha, and was replaced on bass by former Griffin guitarist Mike \\"Yaz\\" Jastremski. =Breaking the Silence (1987‚Äì1990)= Heathen's debut album Breaking the Silence was released in 1987. The album was well received critically and featured one very successful single, a cover of the 1970s glam rock band Sweet's song \\"Set Me Free\\". The song got some rock radio airplay and the video received rotation on MTV's Headbanger's Ball. The band embarked on a tour in support of the album. In 1988 Carl Sacco left due to musical differences. He was replaced by Darren Minter. Mike Jastremski left the band shortly after, and the band went through number of bassists and vocalists between 1988 and 1991. In 1989 David Godfrey left the band due to personal and musical differences. For a few months the late ex-Exodus vocalist Paul Baloff became the band's vocalist. They also briefly toured with late Metal Church vocalist David Wayne. In late 1988, Rick Weaver was recruited from The Dispossessed who had opened for the Midwest leg of the Heathen's national tour. He left amicably in 1989 citing creative differences, and Godfrey (now going by David White) returned to Heathen later that year. =Victims of Deception and breakup (1991‚Äì1993)= In order to record their album Victims of Deception, Heathen recruited Blind Illusion mainman Marc Biedermann to play bass in the studio. The album was released in 1991 through Roadrunner Records. Victims of Deception was considerably more technical than Breaking the Silence, featuring odd time signatures, more complex riffs and songs, tempo and key changes, and longer song lengths, and is often described as progressive thrash metal, retaining little of the NWOBHM influence its predecessor had exhibited. It was also highly critically acclaimed, though it was not quite as commercially successful as Breaking the Silence. The band's cover of Rainbow's \\"Kill the King\\" and original ballad \\"Prisoners of Fate\\" were released as singles and had minor rock radio airplay. The band again toured in support of the album, notably touring Europe with Sepultura and Sacred Reich. That year Heathen found a permanent bassist in Randy Laire and toured extensively until the untimely death of Laire and his girlfriend in a car accident. The band replaced him with Jason Viebrooks. Doug Piercy departed from the band in 1992 and was replaced by Ira Black. The band planned to record a covers EP dedicated to Laire and his girlfriend as well as White's deceased brother Jeffery, but the band went on hiatus in 1993. =Reunion (2001‚Äì2008)= Heathen reunited in 2001, its lineup comprising David White, Lee Altus, Ira Black, Mike Jastremski and Darren Minter, to play the Thrash of the Titans benefit concert to help Chuck Billy and Chuck Schuldiner raise funds for Billy's throat cancer treatment and Schuldiner's brain cancer treatment. The concert was a huge success, but in 2004, Jastremski left the band again, and was replaced by Ulysses Siren bassist Jon Torres. An EP, Recovered was released on Relentless Metal Records, consisting of Victims of Deception-era demos and newly recorded cover songs. A new demo was released in August 2005, containing three new songs. Heathen recruited Terry Lauderdale in 2005 to be the second guitarist in the group and toured across Europe. Also in 2005, Lee Altus joined Bay Area thrashers Exodus, but remained a member of Heathen. In November 2007, the band recruited Prototype guitarist Kragen Lum and Mark Hernandez to replace Darren Minter and Lauderdale. Minter returned to the band the following year. =The Evolution of Chaos (2009‚Äì2018)= The band released their first studio album in nearly two decades, The Evolution of Chaos, on King Records in Japan December 23, 2009, on Mascot Records in Europe January 25, 2010, and on Mascot Records USA in America in February 2010. Heathen played at the Rock Hard Festival in Germany 2009 and later supported Testament, Exodus, and Kreator at Thrash Domination in Kawasaki, Japan. In support of The Evolution of Chaos, Heathen toured in April and May 2010 after having to cancel their planned March dates. In 2012, Heathen announced that they had signed a contract with Nuclear Blast Records for future albums. In the spring of 2013, the band announced the departure of longtime drummer Darren Minter. Former Slayer and Testament drummer Jon Dette replaced him on the band's subsequent European tour. Heathen took part in the European Thrashfest Classics 2011 European tour, also featuring Sepultura, Exodus, Destruction and Mortal Sin. The tour concluded in Vienna, Austria on December 18, 2011. =Empire of the Blind (2019‚Äìpresent)= On January 16, 2019, Heathen announced on their Facebook page that they had begun working on new material for their fourth studio album. On February 26, 2020, Heathen uploaded a flyer on their Facebook page, revealing the artwork and Empire of the Blind as the title of their fourth album. This flyer was available at the merchandise table during the European Bay Strikes Back tour featuring Testament, Exodus and Death Angel. On June 26, 2020, Heathen released \\"The Blight\\" as the lead single from Empire of the Blind and announced that the album would be released on September 18. Shortly before the release of Empire of the Blind, guitarist Kragen Lum mentioned that Heathen could work on a fifth album in 2021: \\"Every band on the planet is gonna want a tour next year. I think it's going to be a logistical problem in terms of the number of venues and dates and tour buses available and crew available. It's gonna be a challenge because everybody's gonna want to go out. We're just gonna do the very best that we can, and, and like I said, stay positive and promote the record. And if for some reason next year it proves to be a challenge in terms of touring or it's limited, then we're gonna probably start working on another record. It takes us long enough; we better start the running now!!\\" Discography * Breaking the Silence (1987) * Victims of Deception (1991) * The Evolution of Chaos (2009) * Empire of the Blind (2020) Band members =Current= * Lee Altus - guitars (1984‚Äì1993, 2001‚Äìpresent) * David White - vocals (1985‚Äì1988, 1989‚Äì1993, 2001‚Äìpresent) * Kragen Lum - guitars (2007‚Äìpresent) * Jason Mirza - bass (2019‚Äìpresent) * Jim DeMaria - drums (2020‚Äìpresent) File:W0844-Hellfest2013 Heaven AllanFryer 66937.JPGDave White File:W0846-Hellfest2013 Heaven g1 LaurieMarlow 66869.JPGKragen Lum & Jason Viebrooks File:W0847-Hellfest2013 Heaven g2 66918.JPGLee Altus File:W0848-Hellfest2013 Heaven JoeTurturo 67054.JPGJon Dette =Former= Vocalists * Sam Kress (1984; died 2006) * Paul Baloff (1988; died 2002) * Rick Weaver (1988‚Äì1989) Guitarists * Jim Sanguinetti (1984) * Doug Piercy (1985‚Äì1992) * Ira Black (1992‚Äì1993, 2001‚Äì2004) * Terry Lauderdale (2005‚Äì2007) Bassists * Eric Wong (1984-1985) * Mike \\"Yaz\\" Jastremski (1986‚Äì1988, 2001‚Äì2004; died 2005) * Manny Bravo (1989) * Vern McElroy (1989‚Äì1990) * Marc Biedermann (1990‚Äì1991) * Randy Laire (1991; died 1991) * Jon Torres (2004‚Äì2011; died 2013) * Jason Viebrooks (1991-1993, 2011‚Äì2019) Drummers * Carl Sacco (1984‚Äì1988) * Mark Hernandez (2007) * Darren Minter (1988‚Äì1993, 2001‚Äì2007, 2008‚Äì2013) * Jon Dette (2013) =Timeline= References External links * [ Allmusic Entry] Category:Musical groups established in 1984 Category:Musical groups from San Francisco Category:American speed metal musical groups Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1993 Category:Musical groups reestablished in 2001 Category:Thrash metal musical groups from California Category:Roadrunner Records artists Category:Musical quintets Category:Nuclear Blast artists ","title":"Heathen (band)"},{"id":"3025498","text":"Queen's Quay Terminal is a condominium apartment, office and retail complex in the Harbourfront neighbourhood in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It was originally built in 1927 as a marine terminal with office, warehouse and cold-storage facilities. When shipping to Toronto declined in the 1960s and 1970s, the building was bought by the Government of Canada to be repurposed along with a section of the industrial waterfront. The Terminal Building itself was rebuilt in the 1980s with the addition of four floors of residential above the original facility, which was converted into retail and office uses. The cold storage wing was demolished and its plant building became The Power Plant gallery and Harbourfront Centre Theatre. History Image of Terminal Warehouse from the north in 1929 The building was originally a cold storage warehouse facility, known as the Toronto Terminal Warehouse. It was built by Moores & Dunford of New York City. The first sod was turned in April 1926 and it opened in February 1927. The building was accessible to both CN and CP rail lines and Great Lakes steamships. It was the first poured concrete building in Canada and one of the largest buildings in the country. It had over of floor space. The main storage building was and the cold-storage wing was , both eight stories in height. The floors were designed overly strong to hold per square foot. The ice, heating, and power plants were in a separate building to the west. The building had a state-of-the-art ice plant, ventilation and sprinkler system, and rail sidings right into the building to eliminate trucking. The building was adorned with a neon \\"Terminal Warehouse\\" sign and each wing (\\"Dry Storage\\", \\"Cold Storage\\" and \\"Ice Plant\\") also had a rooftop neon sign. The ($ in dollars) structure was built on a site. The site was a former water lot land-filled by the Toronto Harbour Commission and was sold at $55,000 per acre. It was supported by 10,000 wooden piles driven through landfill to the bedrock of Toronto Harbour. 500 workers were employed in its construction. One worker, Duncan Murray, died during construction from a fall at the site. The building was used for offices, cold storage, bonded storage and light manufacturing. Among its tenants was the Minister of Customs & Excise, the Canadian Doughnut Company Ltd., Elizabeth Arden and Black and Decker. Its use as a marine terminal declined in the 1960s as container facilities opened in the east part of the harbour. Also, although the St. Lawrence Seaway had opened in 1959, shipping to Toronto declined as container shipping ports in Montreal and Halifax took over as ports of entry for international shipments to Canada. According to the renovation architect Eberhard Zeidler, the building had fallen into disrepair, its roof and concrete in poor condition. Its clock tower had not worked in several years due to a rusted clock face. View of freighters at dock and terminal building, 1936 In 1972, the Government of Canada created the Harbourfront Corporation to repurpose of industrial harbourfront lands west of York Street for cultural, recreation, parkland and residential uses. In 1973, it purchased the Terminal Warehouse property for million from the Pittson Co. of New York City. Metro Toronto's Parks Commissioner Tommy Thompson called for the demolition of the building, calling it a \\"monstrosity on the waterfront\\". The southwest cold storage wing was demolished. The area is now Canada Square between Queen's Quay Terminal and the Harbourfront Centre Theatre. The terminal's plant building was converted to house The Power Plant gallery and Harbourfront Centre Theatre. The neighbouring Direct Winters Building, built by early owners of Terminal Warehouse, became the main complex for Harbourfront's recreational activities. It is now known as Harbourfront Centre. A rail siding along the south facade of the building was converted to a public promenade that is also the location of the docks for sight-seeing boat cruises of Toronto Harbour. The remaining building was converted to a residential, office and retail complex in 1983. The million building rebuild was developed by Olympia and York who negotiated a 99-year lease with the government. The renovations by Zeidler Roberts added four floors to the original eight-floor structure, for a total of of space with 72 condominium apartments. The renovation recoated the exterior with new concrete and new glass and added new Art Deco-styled entrances for the office and residential tenants. A feature of the renovation of the interior were several new atriums including the Arcade at the south-east corner, which reaches the full height of the building. The residential section has a garden with a bridge and a swimming pool on the roof. The roof itself has a green patina metal cladding that is similar to the roofs of the nearby Toronto Union Station and Royal York Hotel. The renovation added the million, 450-seat, Premiere Dance Theatre, which is rented by Harbourfront for per year. The stage has a sprung wood floor to be less harsh on dancers. In 2008, the Premiere Dance Theatre was renovated and reopened as the Fleck Dance Theatre. The renovation was awarded a Governor General's Medal for Architecture in 1986 and awarded the Ontario Association of Architects' Architectural Excellence Award in 1989. The New York Times mentioned it as an example of successful revitalization efforts in Toronto during the 1980s. The property was purchased by Brookfield Properties in October 1997 for million. Brookfield renovated the retail floors in 2017. The building is now owned by Northam Canadian Commercial Property Fund and Industrial Alliance Financial Group and managed by Northam Realty Advisors Limited. Facilities and tenants The facility has of retail and office space on eight floors. Yahoo! Canada, DHX Media and Anheuser-Busch InBev's Canadian unit Labatt and PortsToronto have offices in the building. The first floor has a grocery store, some shops and several restaurants. The second floor has offices and the Pearl Harbourfront Restaurant. The third floor is home to the Fleck Dance Theatre. The Terminal formerly was the site of the Museum of Inuit Art.

Major subsystems  Linguists recognize seven major language subsystems: * Phonetics, the sounds of human speech, including their physiological production, acoustic properties, auditory perception, and neurophysiological status; * Phonology, the systematic use of sound to encode meaning in any spoken human language (natural language or constructed language); * Morphology, the structure of meaningful units of a language, such as words and affixes; * Syntax, the principles and rules for constructing phrases, clauses, and the like in human languages; * Semantics, the meaningful content of words, sentences, or other language elements; * Pragmatics, the ways in which context contributes to meaning in natural language use; and * Lexicology, the study of words. This division varies among linguists and authors. For example, phonetics and phonology are occasionally merged into one subsystem. Morphology and lexicology can also be merged.  Sociolinguistics  * The term variety in sociolinguistics is used as a cover term for dialects, registers, and other forms of language, including standard languages. ** Dialect refers to a variety that is used by a particular group of speakers. ** Accent refers to a specific system of pronunciation. ** Idiolect refers to the variety that is used by an individual speaker. ** Register or style refer to a variety that is used in a particular setting or for a particular purpose. ** Standard language is a variety promoted by some social group, either officially or unofficially, as the preferred form. * Abstand and ausbau languages are concepts developed by sociolinguists to describe related language varieties, ranging from dialects of a single language to distinct languages.

Citations: *Paterson's Historical Account of the Fiars in Scotland (Edin., 1852) *Connell, On Tithes *Hunter's Landlord and Tenant The use of fiars prices gradually diminished, and was abolished as part of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. Fiars Prices served as a rule for ascertaining the value of the grain due to feudal superiors, to the clergy or to lay proprietors of teinds, to landlords as a part or the whole of their rents and in all cases where the price of grain has not been fixed by the parties. The practice of \\"striking the fiars,\\" as it is called, was probably was first used to determine the value of the grain rents and duties payable to the Crown. In confirmation of this view it seems that at first the duty of the sheriffs was merely to make a return to the Court of Exchequer of the prices of grain within their counties, the court itself striking the fiars; and from an old case it appears that the fiars were struck above the true prices, being regarded rather as punishments to force the king's tenants to pay their rents than as the proper equivalent of the grain they had to pay. Co-existent, however, with these fiars, which were termed sheriffs' fiars, there was at an early period another class called commissaries' fiars, by which the values of teinds were regulated. They have been traced back to the Reformation, and were under the management of the commissary or consistorial courts, which then took the place of the bishops and their officials. Although long out of use, but they were perhaps of greater antiquity than the sheriffs' fiars, and the model upon which these were instituted. In 1723 the court of session passed an Act of Sederunt for the purpose of regulating the procedure in fiars courts. Down to that date the practice of striking the fiars was by no means universal over Scotland; and even in those counties into which it had been introduced, there was, as the preamble of the act puts it, \\"a general complaint that the said fiars are struck and given out by the sheriffs without due care and inquiry into the current and just prices.\\" The Act in consequence provided that all sheriffs should summon annually, between the 4th and 10 February, a competent number of persons, living in the shire, of experience in the prices of grain within its bounds, and that from these they should choose a jury of fifteen, of whom at least eight were to be heritors; that witnesses and other evidence as to the price of grain grown in the county, especially since 1 November preceding until the day of inquiry, were to be brought before the jury, who might also proceed on \\"their own proper knowledge\\"; that the verdict was to be returned and the sentence of the sheriff pronounced by 1 March; and further, where custom or expediency recommended it, the sheriff was empowered to fix fiars of different values according to the different qualities of the grain. It cannot be said that this act remedied all the evils of which it complained. The propriety of some of its provisions were questioned, and the competency of the court to pass it was doubted, even by the court itself. Its authority was entirely disregarded in one countyHaddingtonshire (now East Lothian)where the fiars were struck by the sheriff alone, without a jury; and when this practice was called in question the court declined to interfere, observing that the fiars were better struck in Haddingtonshire than anywhere else. The other sheriffs in the main followed the Act, but with much variety of detail, and in many instances on principles the least calculated to reach the true average prices. Thus in some counties the averages were taken on the number of transactions, without regard to the quantities sold. In one case, in 1838, the evidence was so carelessly collected that the second or inferior barley fiars were 2s. 4d. higher than the first. Formerly the price was struck by the boll, commonly the Linlithgowshire boll; in later years the imperial quarter was always used. Prices fixed by the Court for \\"Striking the fiars\\" were also used in the settling of contracts where no prices have been determined upon, e.g. in fixing stipends of ministers of the Church of Scotland, and were found useful in other ways.

Pinto figured he could out box and out smart the younger and shorter Cotto, after all he had beaten him before. This proved to be a fatal mistake, as Cotto, hungry and eager to seek revenge and also not let his home crowd down started out beautifully and in the second round Pinto was floored with a right to the chin followed by a vicious left hook to the side of the head. The crowd was ecstatic, but the brave Pinto got up the canvas and survived the round. Pinto, after realizing that he was facing a vast improved Cotto with deadly power in both hands decided he would have to box, keeping Cotto away using his long jab, it worked well for most of the third and fourth rounds however Cotto would occasionally slip in a combination here and there. The fifth round started out the same, and as Pinto's courage started to build up towards the end of the round he moved closer to Cotto and tried to trade with him. This proved to be fatal, and once again Cotto unloaded his artillery with at least five vicious punches including an upper cut that staggered the Brazilian, and on his way to the canvas Cotto's punching power and incredible speed would land one last punch as the Brazilian was dropped for the second time in the fight. Saved by the bell Cotto did not waste any time when they came out for the sixth.

Sorvali gets inspiration from bands like Anthrax, Bal-Sagoth, Bathory, Cannibal Corpse, Darkthrone, Helheim, Maze of Torment, Merciless and Thyrfing. His idols are Frank Zappa, Danny Elfman, and Jeremy Soule. He is the cousin of Ville Sorvali, frontman of Moonsorrow. He has also worked as a music teacher in the Sibelius-lukio (Sibelius High School) in Helsinki. He no longer plays live with Moonsorrow though he remains active with the band through recording in the studio and composing most of their music. Instead, guitarist Janne Perttil√§ plays live in his place.

Project-associated Japanese pop trio led by former Morning Musume and Tanpopo member Rika Ishikawa. Meant to commemorate the band's first anniversary as a unit, the release date actually came 13 months after the release of their first single. It contains all five of the band's single A-sides -- \\"Koi no Nukegara\\", \\"Kacchoiize!

The album caps a prolific year for Ishikawa, who in the 13 months between V-u-den's first single and the release of the album, had also recorded three final singles and one last studio album (Ai no Dai 6 Kan) with Morning Musume, done one-off singles with fellow Morning Musume member Sayumi Michishige under the name Ecomoni, and with Maki Goto, Natsumi Abe and Aya Matsuura under the name DEF.DIVA, and became the de facto host of Hello!

These are both small migratory waders, greyish brown on top and white underneath, with a distinctive stiff-winged flight low over the water. The plumages are very similar, apart from spotted sandpipers' distinctive breeding plumage, and suspected out-of-range vagrants must be carefully observed for identification to species. Both species have short yellow or yellowish legs and a medium bill. These are not gregarious birds and are seldom seen in large flocks. They nest on the ground, and their habitat is near fresh water. These birds forage on the ground or in water, picking up food by sight. They may also catch insects in flight. They eat insects, crustaceans and other invertebrates. Actitis is part of the shank-tattler-phalarope clade and less closely related to the calidrid sandpipers.Paton et al. (2003), Thomas et al. (2004) Based on the degree of DNA sequence divergence and putative shank and phalarope fossils from around the Oligocene/Miocene boundary some 23-22 million years ago, presumably Actitis diverged from its closest relatives in the Late Oligocene; given the much higher diversity of the prehistoric members of the group in Eurasia it is likely that they originated there, possibly being isolated as the remains of the Turgai Sea dried up, which happened just around this time.Ml√≠kovsk√Ω (2002), Paton et al.

He created the first modern Bulgarian primer, known as the Fish Primer (–†–∏–±–µ–Ω –±—É–∫–≤–∞—Ä, Riben bukvar) due to a dolphin drawn in the end of the book. Beron has been called \\"the father of modern Bulgaria.\\" Biography Petar Beron was born around 1800, probably in 1799, in the town of Kotel in a rich family of handcraftsmen and merchants. In Kotel he received his primary education at the church school of Stoyko Vladislavov and Rayno Popovich. He furthered his education in Bucharest, where he entered the school of Greek educator Konstantin Vardalach. The latter, famous pedagogist and encyclopaedist at the time, has significantly influenced Beron's development as a scientist and philosopher. He worked in Bucharest and Craiova, but after several years of general practice quit his job and started a business in merchandise. Fifteen years later, having made a fortune, he went to Paris where he rented an apartment, where he started his real scientific career. His ambition was to study all the human knowledge by that time and to make a nature-philosophical evaluation by creating a new Panepisteme. His encyclopaedism was remarkable. Dr. Beron spoke nine languages and wrote about 30 volumes, not counting two dictionaries, an atlas, his doctoral dissertation (written in Latin), and the Fish Primer. =Scientific work= There are certain facts, which come to show Dr. Beron's standing among scientists of the time. On the session of the Royal Academy of Science in London, held on 20 June 1850, Sir John Lee presented his work On the System of Atmospherology and acknowledged Beron's activity. In 1853 Dr. Beron was invited by the Association of Natural Sciences in Athens where he read an article titled Earth before the Deluge. In 1855 he published his Slavic Philosophy in the German language, where an outline of his Panepisteme is featured. In 1858 Origins of Physical and Natural Sciences and of Metaphysical and Moral Sciences was printed in the French language. The next two years were devoted to a huge cosmographical atlas with descriptions. The maps in the atlas were designed by the famous Bulgarian painter Nicolaus Pavlovich. But the height of his scientific endeavours was the Panepisteme, in seven volumes, which was published in French in the beginning of 1861. Until the end of his life on 21 March 1871 he was devoted to this interesting and creative task. =Philosophical views= Dr. Beron spent some 25 years of his life in Paris and other European cities. He seriously and systematically studied western philosophy and culture, witnessing the endeavours of classical positivism, most notably of his contemporary Auguste Comte, to replace materialism and idealism with a third line in philosophy. However, Beron sincerely believed in the independence of his philosophy Panepisteme. He considered Aristotle to be the ultimate scientific authority. These are the main influences on Beron's beliefs in philosophy and logic. Beron Point on Robert Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named for Petar Beron.

Content developers and web developers When the World Wide Web began, web developers either developed online content themselves, or modified existing documents and coded them into hypertext markup language (HTML). In time, the field of website development came to encompass many technologies, so it became difficult for website developers to maintain so many different skills. Content developers are specialized website developers who have content generation skills such as graphic design, multimedia development, professional writing, and documentation. They can integrate content into new or existing websites without using information technology skills such as script language programming and database programming. Content developers or technical content developers can also be technical writers who produce technical documentation that helps people understand and use a product or service. This documentation includes online help, manuals, white papers, design specifications, developer guides, deployment guides, release notes, etc. Search engine optimization Content developers may also be search engine optimization specialists, or internet marketing professionals. High quality, unique content is what search engines are looking for. Content development specialists, therefore, have a very important role to play in the search engine optimization process. One issue currently plaguing the world of web content development is keyword-stuffed content which are prepared solely for the purpose of manipulating search engine rankings. The effect is that content is written to appeal to search engine (algorithms) rather than human readers.

He was first reported by Reuters to have led the coup, but that same day he went onto the BBC's Focus on Africa to deny that role, claiming instead that he was attempting to negotiate with the mutineers. He was imprisoned by Valentine Strasser, who eventually took power in the coup. Kanu was later executed by Valentine Strasser, Solomon Musa and Idriss Kamara on a beach near Freetown, after being accused of organizing a counter-coup with All People's Congress supporter Bambay Kamara. The pair were at the time interred in the Pademba Road jail in Freetown. The British-trained Kanu had won a reputation as one of the most dynamic battlefront commanders during the war that broke out when Revolutionary United Front rebels of Foday Sankoh crossed into Sierra Leone in 1991 from part of Liberia under the control of the Liberian rebel leader Charles Taylor. After the rebels approached the eastern Sierra Leone city of Kenema in mid-1991, they were pushed back by Kanu's Cobra battalion with the help of Liberian irregular forces, mostly refugees from Samuel Doe's army, who went on to become a component of ULIMO. The combined force quickly routed the rebels from the towns of Gandorhun and Zimmi before reaching the Mano River Bridge crossing into Liberia. These gains were lost later in the war as control of towns frequently changed hands, something that battlefront soldiers often blamed on a lack of resources from Freetown. This was a major factor contributing to the 1992 coup.

Ford, also known as James N. Ford, Sr. the \\"N\\" possibly for Neal (October 22, 1775 ‚Äì July 7, 1833), was an American civic leader and business owner in western Kentucky and southern Illinois, late 1790s to mid-1830s. Despite his clean public image as a \\"Pillar of the Community\\", Ford was secretly a river pirate and the leader of a gang that would later be known as the \\"Ford's Ferry Gang\\". His men were the river equivalent of highway robbers. They would hijack flatboats and Ford's \\"own river ferry\\" for tradable goods from local farms that were coming down the Ohio River. Ford was an Illinois associate of Isaiah L. Potts and the Potts Hill Gang, highway robbers, of the infamous Potts Inn. James Ford also was an associate of John Hart Crenshaw, an illegal slave trader and a kidnapper of free African Americans, and may have taken part in the Illinois version of the Reverse Underground Railroad. At one point, the outlaws used \\"Cave-in-Rock\\" as their headquarters on the Illinois side of the lower Ohio River, approximately 85 miles below Evansville, Indiana. Early life and family history James Ford was born in the Ninety-Six District, Province of South Carolina of the British Empire, now present-day Spartanburg, Spartanburg County, South Carolina a son of Philip and Elizabeth Ford and a grandson of John Ford. He had two brothers, Philip Jr. and Richard. His father died while Ford was still young, and his mother then married William Prince, who brought the family to what would become Princeton in Caldwell County, Kentucky. This marriage provided James with a number of step- and half-siblings who provided important contacts for his future political, business, and criminal career. Marriages and children In the late 1790s, James Ford married Susan Miles, a daughter of William Miles, who was a brother of the ferry keeper at Miles Ferry, between the Kentucky and Illinois banks of the Ohio below Cave-in-Rock, near the location of present-day Rosiclare, Illinois. Susan Ford provided her husband with two sons, Philip (November 25, 1800 - November 23, 1831) and William M. (1804 ‚Äì November 2, 1832), as well as a daughter, Cassandra (1805/1806‚Äì1863). Susan died in the 1820s, and in 1829 Ford married Elizabeth \\"Betsy\\" W. Armstead Frazier (1790-1800 - 1834-1835), a widow whose husband had died suddenly while staying at Ford's plantation, in then Livingston County, Kentucky (now Crittenden County, Kentucky). Elizabeth Ford had one more son, James N. Ford, Jr., (c. 1830 - October 1844). Criminal activities James Ford had settled on the Kentucky side of the Ohio River by the late 1790s, during the time that Samuel Mason's river pirates operated out of Cave-in- Rock. Early writers identified him with the \\"James Wilson\\" who operated a tavern and brothel in the cave in the spring of 1799, but these are now believed to be incorrect, since historical records show that a man named James Wilson lived in the area at the same time as Ford.

Ford *Francis Prince (possible gang member) *Henry C.

Even without any combat experience, serving as a militia officer helped Ford acquire local prestige and created opportunities for him in the political and business affairs of the Ohio River valley of Kentucky and Illinois. Ford was captain of the Livingston County Cavalry company in the 24th Kentucky Militia Regiment between July 1, 1799 to December 15, 1802. While living in Illinois Territory, on January 2, 1810, James Ford became captain of the Grand Pierre area militia company of the 4th Regiment of Illinois Territory Militia, was one of three territorial militia companies in southeastern Illinois. (The other companies based around the frontier settlements of Elizabethtown and Cave-In-Rock were simply local volunteer frontier military units.) The Grand Pierre Company was composed of men from Grand Pierre, a frontier settlement in the area located near the Grand Pierre Creek Watershed, now Rosiclare, Illinois. Grand Pierre was one of three frontier Illinois militia districts in what later became Hardin County, Illinois. The fort used by the Grand Pierre militia company may have been the blockhouse formerly located north of the present-day water tower that was used later by the Sturdivant Gang for counterfeiting in the late 1810s and early 1820s. During the occupation of the fort by the counterfeiters, James Ford held the deed to the land, giving him legal ownership of the fort and making him guilty by association for allowing counterfeiting to takeplace. Ford was also the captain of a company of the Illinois Territorial Militia from July 15, 1811 to August 8, 1811. Ford was later promoted to major being one of two such military ranks available in the 4th Regiment of Militia in the Illinois Territory on November 28, 1811. James Steele, Sr. also spelled Steel who had been a private in Ford's Company succeeded him as Captain of the Grand Pierre militia. In the War of 1812, Steele served as a private in Captain John Cochran's Company of the 1st Regiment of Illinois (Territorial) Militia, under the command of Captain Absolem Cox, at Kaskaskia on September 3, 1812. The residency of James Steele was recorded in the first Illinois State Census in 1818 and the 1820 U.S. Census as living in Pope County, Illinois, now present- day Hardin County, Illinois. At the time the state and federal censuses were conducted, Steele was a criminal member of the Sturdivant Gang of counterfeiters which operated in the Rosiclare area of Hardin County from the 1810s to 1820s. Property holdings James Ford was a substantial land owner who owned a five-hundred acre plantation at his home in Tolu, Kentucky as well as holding numerous other properties on the Kentucky and Illinois sides of the Ohio River. Through his first wife's family he secured the rights to the Miles Ferry, which soon became known as Ford's Ferry, though this is not the infamous one he operated later, upriver from Cave-in-Rock, called Ferry Ohio. Through his second marriage, he secured control of the Frazier Salt Works, at the Lower Lick Great Salt Springs, in the Illinois Salines in Gallatin County, Illinois, during the late 1820s. Slave-holding James Ford owned a considerable number of slaves in Kentucky. He leased out his slaves for salt making operations under a contract with the U.S. government at the U.S. Saline, near Equality, Illinois. The influence of James Ford was felt as far away as Springfield, Illinois, which can be attested to in the Sangamo Journal newspaper, where he ran a fugitive slave notice, with detailed physical descriptions of two runaway slaves he owned. The cruel and ruthless treatment Ford showed toward his slaves was told in numerous stories many true and untrue. In one tale Ford was alleged to have punished one of his slaves by using a vise to secure the head of the slave and cut off their ears and pull out their teeth. The 1832 runaway slave notice Ford had printed in the Sangamo Journal indicated that a slave named \\"Ben\\" had his ears removed for \\"robbing a boat on the Ohio River\\". In another tale James Ford allegedly bound hand to foot an offending slave and dragged him to death behind a mule, through a field of tree stumps. Allegations of illegal slave trading James Ford was also alleged to have had legitimate and criminal associations with John Hart Crenshaw an Illinois businessman operating the Illinois Salines and who kidnapped free blacks to sell into the illegal slave trade as well as practicing illegal slave breeding. The road from the Old Slave House of Crenshaw in Illinois crossing the Ohio River to Ford's Ferry, Kentucky was a heavily traveled route of the infamous Reverse Underground Railroad which sent its victims to a life of enslavement in the Southern United States. Physical appearance Dr. Charles H. Webb, future husband of Ford's daughter Cassandra, described the appearance of James Ford while he was at his plantation in 1822: > He was of about six feet in height, and of powerful build, a perfect > Hercules in point of strength; but he has now grown to corpulent to undergo > much fatigue. His head is large and well shaped; his sandy brown hair, now > thin, is turning gray, for he must be fully fifty years old; his eyes, of a > steel-gray color, are brilliant and his glance quick and penetrating; his > nose rather short and thick; his upper lip remarkably long, his mouth large, > and his lips full and sensuous. He has a broad firm double chin, and his > voice is deep and sonorous. His complexion is very florid, and he converses > fluently. On the whole, when in repose, he gives one the idea of a good > natured, rather than a surly, bulldog; but, if aroused, I should say he > would be a lion tamer. Death James Ford was ambushed and shot dead at Ford's Ferry near his home on July 7, 1833 by members of his own criminal gang. He was buried in the Ford family cemetery in Kirksville, Kentucky on the grounds of the Ford family plantation property, now located on Tolu-Carrsville Road (Kentucky Route 135 - KY 135), in present-day Tolu, Crittenden County, Kentucky, on a farm that was owned by the Brazwell family in the 1980s. Ford's Ferry after James Ford Following the death of James Ford in 1833, Ford's Ferry continued on as an important Ohio River ferry crossing with a high water road which was could be used even when the river flooded. The small town built around Ford's Ferry came to be spelled Fords Ferry and continued to prosper. According to the 19th century Collins' Historical Sketches of Kentucky, Fords Ferry had four stores and two hotels, with a population of about seventy-five people. Eventually, the Ohio River ferry at Cave-In-Rock became the last one in the area, bypassing the road traffic at Ford's Ferry, which caused it to cease operations and be abandoned along with the town.

The relaxation can be stimulated e.g. by slight heating or longwave illumination, not causing emission from untreated samples.

It is obtained from the seeds of Camellia oleifera. Camellia sasanqua is also given as a source of 'tea seed oil. Description The genus Camellia includes several commercially important species - Camellia oleifera is grown mainly in China for vegetable oil. The oil is known as 'camellia oil', 'tea seed oil', or 'camellia seed oil'. As of 2016 of oleifera forest centered on the Yangtze river basin in Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangxi produces 0.26 million tons of oil. Wild Camellia oleifera contains ~47% oil, whilst cultivated varieties have shown oil content from 42-53%.. Oil analysis of cultivated varieties showed : ~76-82% oleic acid; 5-11% linoleic acid; 7.5-10% palmitic acid; 1.5-3% stearic acid - the ratios are similar to that found in wild oleifera. The composition is similar to that of Olive oil. Another analysis of several cultivars found : 82-84% unsaturated acids of which 68-77% oleic acid; and 7-14% polyunsaturated acids.  Uses  With its high smoke point of , tea seed oil is the main cooking oil in some of the southern provinces of People's Republic of China, such as Hunan, especially in mountainous regions; roughly one-seventh of the country's population. The oil has also been used in Chinese traditional medicine - here it has been used as a dietary supplement for the digestive system, as well as to manage cholesterol, as well as strengthen the immune system. It was also used topically as baby lotion, and for burn injuries. Tea seed oil is commonly used to protect carbon steel cooking knives from rust.

Located at 65 Niagara Square, the 32-story Art Deco building was completed in 1931 by Dietel, Wade & Jones. The buildingBuffalo City Hall at emporis.com ( when measured from street level to the tip of the tower) is one of the largest and tallest municipal buildings in the United States and is also one of the tallest buildings in Western New York. It was designed by chief architect John Wade with the assistance of George Dietel. The friezes were sculpted by Albert Stewart and the sculpture executed by Rene Paul Chambellan. Note: This includes and Accompanying six photographs The foyer features a bronze tablet honoring Mayor Roesch, created in 1937 by regional sculptor, William Ehrich. Buffalo City Hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. History =Previous buildings= The 1875 Buffalo County and City Hall In 1851, the city bought the property at the northwest corner of Church and Franklin streets in Buffalo to be used for the Mayor's office and other city offices. On this site, and constructed between 1871 and 1875, the city built a monumental granite structure designed by Rochester architect Andrew Jackson Warner (1833‚Äì1910). The building, now known as the County and City Hall, featured three floors and a large, seven-story clock tower. It held offices for the City of Buffalo and Erie County. Note: This includes and Accompanying five photographs In 1920, the Buffalo Common Council decided, in light of the fact that the population of the city had quadrupled since the construction of County and City Hall forty-five years earlier, that a new building was needed to house the city government of Buffalo. Niagara Square was chosen as it is one of the central components of Joseph Ellicott's original plan of 1804, laid out for the city of Buffalo. From this location, one can see the waterways of Lake Erie and the shores of Ontario in Canada as well as the rest of downtown Buffalo. On September 16, 1929, construction of the new City Hall began and the building was ultimately completed on November 10, 1931 with the dedication taking place the following summer, on July 1, 1932, commemorating the city's Centennial celebration. When the new City Hall opened and the city offices moved to the present building, the former 1875 County and City Hall became Erie County court offices and was used to hold important city records. The former county and city hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. =Construction= View of Niagara Square in the foreground and Lafayette Square in the background from Buffalo City Hall during a snow flurry City Hall was built by the John W. Cowper Company, the same firm who built the Statler Hotel and the Buffalo Athletic Club, also on Niagara Square. The cost of building City Hall was $6,851,546.85 ($ in dollars) including the architect's fees, making it one of the costliest city halls in the country. City Council chambers City Hall was Buffalo's tallest building from its construction until 1970 when One Seneca Tower was built.Buffalo city tour City Hall has 32 stories, 26 of which offer usable office space. The total floor area is and the footprint of the site on Niagara Square is . There are 1,520 windows from the first to the 25th floor. A practical design feature is that all of them open inward, making window washers unnecessary. There are eight elevators to the 13th floor and four to the 25th floor. Curtis Elevator Company furnished the first elevators, with additional elevators supplied later by Otis Elevator Company. There are 5,000 electrical outlets, 5,400 electrical switches and 21 motor driven ventilation fans. Approximately of copper wire weighing 43 tons, and or 180 tons of conduit pipe, serve the building, as well as or five car loads of underfoot conduit. There are either 138 or 143 clocks (counts vary) regulated by a master clock in the basement and 37 fire alarm stations distributed throughout the building. It was originally equipped with 375 telephones and a master switchboard. External illumination was provided from dusk to midnight by 369 flood lights with an average candlepower of 350. City Hall was designed and built with a non-powered air-conditioning system, taking advantage of strong prevailing winds from Lake Erie. Large vents were placed on the west side of the building to catch wind, which would then travel down ducts to beneath the basement, to be cooled by the ground. This cooled air was then vented throughout the building. Winds off the lake were usually strong enough to power air through this system. In the summer of 2006, Buffalo City Hall started undergoing renovations from the 13th floor all the way to the top as the flood lights were replaced; three years later, it was the south wing that started undergoing renovations of its own. Renovations were completed by 2009.  In popular culture  In the American television series Avenue 5, Buffalo City Hall is the new White House.

They are distinguished from various kinds of sponsored results, whether they are explicit pay per click advertisements, shopping results, or other results where the search engine is paid either for showing the result, or for clicks on the result.  Background  The Google, Yahoo!, and Bing search engines insert advertising on their search results pages. By law, advertising must be distinguished from organic results. This is done with various differences in background, text, link colors, and/or placement on the page. However, a 2004 survey found that a majority of search engine users could not distinguish the two.May/June 2004 Tracking Survey Pew Internet and American Life Project Because so few ordinary users (38% according to Pew Research Center) realized that many of the highest placed \\"results\\" on search engine results pages (SERPs) were ads, the search engine optimization industry began to distinguish between ads and natural results. The perspective among general users was that all results were, in fact, \\"results.\\" So the qualifier \\"organic\\" was invented to distinguish non-ad search results from ads. It has been used since at least 2004.Brad Hill, Building Your Business with Google For Dummies, 2004, , p. 308 Because the distinction is important (and because the word \\"organic\\" has many metaphorical uses) the term is now in widespread use within the search engine optimization and web marketing industry. As of July 2009, the term \\"organic search\\" is now commonly used outside the specialist web marketing industry, even used frequently by Google (throughout the Google Analytics site, for instance). Google claims their users click (organic) search results more often than ads, essentially rebutting the research cited above. A 2012 Google study found that 81% of ad impressions and 66% of ad clicks happen when there is no associated organic search result on the first page. Research has shown that searchers may have a bias against ads, unless the ads are relevant to the searcher's need or intent.Jansen, B. J. and Resnick, M. 2006. An examination of searcher's perceptions of non-sponsored and sponsored links during eCommerce Web searching. Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology. 57(14), 1949-1961. The same report and others going back to 1997 by Pew show that users avoid clicking \\"results\\" they know to be ads. According to a June 2013 study by Chitika, 9 out of 10 searchers don't go beyond Google's first page of organic search results, a claim often cited by the search engine optimization (SEO) industry to justify optimizing websites for organic search. Organic SEO describes the use of certain strategies or tools to elevate a website's content in the \\"free\\" search results. Users can prevent ads in search results and list only organic results by using browser add-ons and plugins. Other browsers may have different tools developed for blocking ads.

The studios and transmitters are located at 4800 E. Raymond St. on the southeast side of Indianapolis. 1590 AM is a Regional broadcast frequency. History A search of Broadcasting Magazine's annual Yearbooks shows that WNTS began operation as WGEE on December 10, 1956. A large portion of the station's programming was aimed toward the African American population of Indianapolis. Much of the remainder of the daytime only operated AM station's programming was devoted to Country music. WGEE launched sister station WGEE-FM 103.3 (64 kW at 120 ft.) on May 15, 1964. WGEE & WGEE-FM simulcast in the early 1970s with the \\"WG Parade Of Hits\\". Bob Todd was Program Director and local air talents of Scott Evans, George L. Davis, Mike O'Brien, Scott Wheeler, Jim Fox, Ron Hoffer, and Steve Miller. Dick Shane was News Director. WIRE owner Mid America Radio acquired WGEE-FM in March 1972. The FM adopted a beautiful music format with call letters WXTZ. On May 7, 1972, WGEE was acquired by B & G Broadcasting. The station soon became WNIR \\"The Country Winner\\" with a country format programmed by Bob Todd, with Buddy O'Shay as morning announcer. On April 15, 1974, WNIR was acquired by S & M Broadcasting, and became News Talk Sports 16, WNTS. Sam Smulyan was President of the new company. His son Jeff (now Chairman of the Board, President and CEO of Indianapolis-based Emmis Communications) was appointed General Manager. Operations were handled by Rick Cummings. Other employees after the change to news and talk included a Broad Ripple High School and Ball State University graduate named David Letterman. WNTS moved into an all-news direction in early 1976. After the failed attempt to draw audience with programming from NBC's all-news News and Information Service, WNTS changed format to Religion on January 18, 1977. After the change to Religion, WNTS moved from daytime only operation to full-time operation. To do so, the city of license for WNTS was changed from Indianapolis to Beech Grove. An additional tower was also added at the station's transmitter site. Since the station was sold (reported October 10, 2005 by Indiana RadioWatch), its website has gone down. On October 28, 2019, WNTS changed their format to Spanish oldies, branded as \\"La Pantera 1590\\", swapping formats with WSYW 810 AM Indianapolis.Indianapolis Spanish Stations Swap Signals Raioinsight - October 29, 2019 Station broadcasting information WNTS broadcasts using 5 kW daytime power and .5 kW nighttime power. The station uses a directional antenna at night. More information is available at the FCC query for WNTS. Programming After changing to religious programming, WNTS was originally dedicated to contemporary Christian music. Around 1990 it changed format to Southern Gospel music and talk station. The station was managed by Jim Wilson, and the station had steady programming for over 15 years. DJ's like Larry Dean, Diane Benson, Kevin Wilson, Chris Moore, Nancy Marie, and Tom Elliott were mainstays at the station and well loved by its dedicated audience. One favorite was the \\"Country Gospel Store\\" started by Jim Wilson's wife, Nancy Marie. This was a 4-hour all request music format, where listeners could call in virtually any request of music that was in the station's library. Nancy Marie died from cancer, and the Country Gospel Store continued with Kevin Wilson running the show. In 2003 Daniel Ott started The Edge Broadcast at the station and continued through 2005.

The Great Alaska Nature Factbook. Portland: Alaska Northwest Books, 1996. The leaves are rounded, diameter, with a bluntly toothed margin. The leaves are a darker green on their upper surface. Leaf growth occurs after snow melt and become red in autumn. The wind-pollinated fruiting catkins are erect, long and broad. Distribution Betula nana is native to arctic and cool temperate regions of Greenland, Iceland, northern Europe, northern Asia and northern North America and it will grow in a variety of conditions. Outside of far northern areas, it is usually found growing only in mountains above , up to in Scotland and in the Alps. Its northern range limit is on Svalbard, where it is confined to warm sites. In the UK Betula nana is at its southern range limit, with many populations having declined significantly in recent decades. In southern Sweden the occurrence of Betula nana in Sund, Ydre is deemed a glacial relict. In general, it favors wet but well-drained sites with a nutrient-poor, acidic soil which can be xeric and rocky. B. nana has a low tolerance for shade. Ecology There are two subspecies: *Betula nana subsp. nana. Canada (Baffin Island), Greenland, northern Europe (south to the Alps at high altitudes), northwestern Asia.

It was a variant of Andrew File System (AFS), based on the AFS Version 3.0 protocol that was developed commercially by Transarc Corporation. AFS Version 3.0 was in turn based on the AFS Version 2.0 protocol (also used by the Coda disconnected file system) originally developed at Carnegie Mellon University. DCE/DFS consisted of multiple cooperative components that provided a network file system with strong file system semantics, attempting to mimic the behavior of POSIX local file systems while taking advantage of performance optimizations when possible. A DCE/DFS client system utilized a locally managed cache that would contain copies (or regions) of the original file. The client system would coordinate with a server system where the original copy of the file was stored to ensure that multiple clients accessing the same file would re-fetch a cached copy of the file data when the original file had changed. The advantage of this approach is that it provided very good performance even over slow network connections because most of the file access was actually done to the local cached regions of the file. If the server failed, the client could continue making changes to the file locally, storing it back to the server when it became available again. DCE/DFS also divorced the concept of logical units of management (Filesets) from the underlying volume on which the fileset was stored. In doing this it allowed administrative control of the location for the fileset in a manner that was transparent to the end user. To support this and other advanced DCE/DFS features, a local journaling file system (DCE/LFS also known as Episode) was developed to provide the full range of support options. IBM has not maintained it since 2005: https://web.archive.org/web/20071009171709/http://www-306.ibm.com/software/stormgmt/dfs/ IBM was working on a replacement for DCE/DFS called ADFS (Advanced Distributed File System). One major goal of this project was to decouple DFS from the complexities of DCE's cell directory services (CDS) and security services (secd). Another key feature would have been the elimination of enctype limitations associated with DCE/RPC. No public mention of this effort has been made since 2005, leading many to believe the project has been killed. The DCE Distributed File System (DFS) was adopted by the Open Software Foundation in 1989 as part of their Distributed Computing Environment.

Unlike many later ceratopsians it had no horns, possessing only a small bony frill projecting from the back of its head. Discovery and species A. oshimai skull. A. yujingziensis. Two specimens were found in the Middle Gray Unit of the Xinminbao Group, Gongpoquan Basin of the Mazong Shan area of Gansu Province, north central China. The type species, A. oshimai, was named by Dong Zhiming and Azuma in 1997. It is the first basal neoceratopsian discovered in this area. The type specimen, IVPP V11114, consists of a partially complete skeleton including skull, caudal vertebrae, pelvis, and most of a hind foot. The second specimen (paratype), IVPP V11115, consists of an incomplete skeleton with a relatively well preserved caudal series, a partial hind limb, and a completely preserved foot. It is slightly smaller than the holotype. Classification Archaeoceratops belonged to the Ceratopsia (the name is Greek for \\"horned face\\"), a group of herbivorous dinosaurs with parrot-like beaks which thrived in North America and Asia during the Cretaceous Period. In 1997 Dong and Azuma placed it in a new family, Archaeoceratopsidae. Helioceratops and possibly Yamaceratops have also been found to be members of Archaeoceratopsidae. Diet Archaeoceratops, like all ceratopsians, was a herbivore. During the Cretaceous, flowering plants were \\"geographically limited on the landscape\\", and so it is likely that this dinosaur fed on the predominant plants of the era: ferns, cycads and conifers.

The name means \\"hollow tail\\", referring to its hollow tail vertebrae (Greek Œ∫Œø·øñŒªŒøœÇ, koilos = hollow + Œø·ΩêœÅŒ¨, oura = tail). Although its name is linked to one of the main divisions of theropods (Coelurosauria), it has historically been poorly understood, and sometimes confused with its better-known contemporary Ornitholestes. Like many dinosaurs studied in the early years of paleontology, it has had a confusing taxonomic history, with several species being named and later transferred to other genera or abandoned. Only one species is currently recognized as valid: the type species, C. fragilis, described by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1879. It is known from one partial skeleton found in the Morrison Formation of Wyoming, United States. It was a small bipedal carnivore with elongate legs. Description Restoration Coelurus is known from most of the skeleton of a single individual, including numerous vertebrae, partial pelvic and shoulder girdles, and much of the arms and legs, stored at the Peabody Museum of Natural History; however, the relative completeness of the skeleton was not known until 1980. The fossils were recovered from Reed's Quarry 13 at Como Bluff, Wyoming. Additionally, two arm bones possibly belonging to this genus are known from the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry in Utah. It was not a large dinosaur. Its weight has been estimated at around , with a length of about 2.4 meters (7.9 ft) and a hip height of 0.7 meters (2.3 ft). From reconstructions of the skeleton, Coelurus had a relatively long neck and torso due to its long vertebrae, a long slender hindlimb due to its long metatarsus, and potentially a small slender skull. Coelurus compared in size to an average adult human The skull is unknown except for possibly a portion of lower jaw found at the same site as the rest of the known Coelurus material. Although it has the same preservation and coloring as the fossils known to belong to the Coelurus skeleton, it is very slender, which may mean it does not belong to the skeleton; this bone is 7.9 centimeters long (3.1 in) but only 1.1 centimeters tall (0.43 in). In general, its vertebrae were long and low, with low neural spines and thin walls to the bodies of the vertebrae. Its neck vertebrae were very pneumatic, with numerous hollow spaces on their surfaces (pleurocoels); these hollows were not evenly distributed among the vertebrae and varied in size. The neck vertebrae were very elongate, with bodies four times longer than wide, and they articulated with concave faces on both ends (amphicoely). The back vertebrae were not as elongate, lacked surface hollows, and had less developed concave faces and bodies that were hourglass-shaped. The tail vertebrae also lacked surface hollows. The only bone known from the shoulder girdle is a fragment of scapula. The upper arm had a distinct S-shaped curve in side view and was slightly longer than the forearm (11.9 centimeters [4.7 in] versus 9.6 centimeters [3.8 in]). The wrist had a semilunate carpal similar to that of Deinonychus, and the fingers were long and slender. The only bone known from the pelvic girdle is paired and fused pubis bones, which had a prominent, long \\"foot\\" at the end. The thigh bones had an S-shape when viewed from the front. The metatarsals were unusually long and slender, nearly the length of the thigh bones (the best preserved thigh bone is about 21 centimeters long [8.3 in]). =Coelurus, Ornitholestes, and Tanycolagreus= The three best-known small theropods of the Morrison Formation ‚Äî Coelurus, Ornitholestes, and Tanycolagreus ‚Äî were generalized coelurosaurs, and they have been mistaken for each other at various times. Now that Coelurus and Ornitholestes have been more fully described, it is possible to distinguish them by various characteristics of their anatomy. For example, they had visibly different proportions: Coelurus had a longer back and neck than Ornitholestes, and longer, more slender legs and feet. Coelurus and Tanycolagreus are more similar, but differ in a variety of details. Such details include the shape of the upper arm, forearm, and thigh bones; the location of muscle attachments on the thigh bone, proportionally longer back vertebrae; and, again, the very long metatarsus of Coelurus. Classification Since the growth of phylogenetic studies in the 1980s, Coelurus has usually been found to be a coelurosaurian of uncertain affinities, not fitting with the better-known clades of the Cretaceous. Along with several other generalized coelurosaurians such as the compsognathids, Ornitholestes, and Proceratosaurus, it has had multiple placements around the base of Coelurosauria. The phylogenetic analysis conducted by Rauhut (2003) and Smith et al. (2007) found that Coelurus was more closely related to compsognathids than to other coelurosaurs. Oliver Rauhut (2003) proposed that Coeluridae was composed of Coelurus plus the compsognathids, but he and others have not since found the compsognathids to group with Coelurus. However, a work published by Phil Senter in 2007 following the description of Tanycolagreus found it and Coelurus to be closely related at the base of Tyrannosauroidea. Senter proposed that Coelurus and Tanycolagreus were the only coelurids and were actually tyrannosauroids, but the phylogenetic analysis of Turner et al. (2007b) found that Coelurus was a basal coelurosaur, although more derived than the tyrannosaurids. Zanno in 2010 recovered Coelurus as a basal maniraptoran. Coelurus is sometimes put into its own family, Coeluridae, although the membership of the family has not been stable. Before the use of phylogenetic analyses, Coeluridae and Coelurosauria were taxonomic wastebaskets used for small theropods that did not belong to other groups; thus, they accumulated many dubious genera. As late as the 1980s, popular books recognized over a dozen \\"coelurids\\", including such disparate forms as the noasaurid Laevisuchus and the oviraptorosaurian Microvenator, and considered them descendants of the coelophysids. A wastebasket Coeluridae lingered into the early 1990s in some sources (and appears in at least one 2006 source) but since then it has only been recognized in a much reduced form. Coeluridae received a formal phylogenetic definition in 2015, when it was defined as all species more closely related to Coelurus fragilis than to Proceratosaurus bradleyi, Tyrannosaurus rex, Allosaurus fragilis, Compsognathus longipes, Ornithomimus edmontonicus, or Deinonychus antirrhopus by Hendrickx, Hartman and Mateus. It remains unclear whether or not this group contains any species other than Coelurus itself, and while Tanycolagreus is often included, support for this relationship has been weak in most of the studies that recovered it. Below is a cladogram placing Coelurus in Coelurosauria by Cau et al. in 2015. History Othniel Charles Marsh's illustration of Coelurus vertebrae from 1884 Coelurus was described in 1879 by Othniel Charles Marsh, an American paleontologist and naturalist known for his \\"Bone Wars\\" with Edward Drinker Cope. At the time, he only described what he interpreted as vertebrae from the back and tail, found at the same location as the type specimen of his new genus and species Camptonotus dispar (later renamed Camptosaurus because Camptonotus was already in use for a cricket). Marsh was impressed with the hollow interiors of the thin-walled vertebrae, a characteristic that gave the type species its name: Coelurus fragilis. He thought of his new genus as an \\"animal about as large as a wolf, and probably carnivorous\\". Coelurus would prove to be the first named small theropod from the Morrison Formation, although at the time Marsh was not certain that it was a dinosaur. He returned to it in 1881 and provided illustrations of some bones, along with putting it in a new order (Coeluria) and family (Coeluridae). From there, the story becomes more complex. Apparently, the skeleton was scattered throughout the quarry, with the remains being recovered from September 1879 to September 1880. Marsh elected to place some of the material in a new species, C. agilis, on the strength of a pair of fused pubic bones he thought belonged to an animal three times the size of C. fragilis. He returned to the genus in 1888 to add C\\". gracilis, based on unknown remains only represented today by a single claw bone pertaining to a small theropod from the Early Cretaceous Arundel Formation of Maryland. This species is not currently accepted as representing Coelurus in reviews of the genus, but has not been given its own genus. Despite their professional animosity, Cope also assigned species to Coelurus; in 1887, he named fossils from the Late Triassic of New Mexico as C. bauri and C. longicollis. He later gave them their own genus, Coelophysis. In 1903, Henry Fairfield Osborn named a second genus of small theropod from the Morrison Formation, Ornitholestes. This genus was based on a partial skeleton from Bone Cabin Quarry, north of Como Bluff. Ornitholestes became intertwined with Coelurus in 1920, when Charles Gilmore, in his influential study of theropod dinosaurs, concluded that the two were synonyms. This was followed in the literature for decades. The two genera were not formally compared, however, nor was there a full accounting of what actually belonged to Coelurus, until John Ostrom's study in 1980. Gilmore had suspected that C. fragilis and C. agilis were the same, but Ostrom was able to demonstrate this synonymy. This greatly expanded the known material pertaining to C. fragilis, and Ostrom was able to demonstrate that Ornitholestes was quite different from Coelurus. At the time, Dale Russell had proposed that C. agilis was a species of Elaphrosaurus based on the incomplete information then published; Ostrom was also able to demonstrate that this was not the case. Additionally, he showed that one of the three vertebrae Marsh had illustrated for C. fragilis was actually a composite of two vertebrae, one of which was later shown to come from another quarry and belonged not to Coelurus but to another, unnamed small theropod. This unnamed genus would not be the last small theropod from the Morrison Formation to be confused with Coelurus; a later discovery (1995) of a partial skeleton in Wyoming was first thought to be a new larger specimen of Coelurus, but further study showed it belonged to a different but related genus, Tanycolagreus. =Species= Only one species of Coelurus, the type species C. fragilis, is still recognized as valid today, although six other species have been named over the years. C. agilis, as discussed, was named by Marsh in 1884 for what turned out to be additional parts of the skeleton of C. fragilis. Cope's C. bauri and C. longicollis, named in 1887 from Late Triassic fossils from New Mexico, were transferred by Cope in 1889 to his new genus Coelophysis. C. daviesi was named by Richard Lydekker in 1888 for Harry Seeley's Thecospondylus daviesi, a neck vertebra from the Early Cretaceous of England, but this species was later transferred to its own genus, Thecocoelurus. C. gracilis, another Early Cretaceous species, was also named in 1888. It was coined by Marsh for what seems to be an assortment of limb remains, but Gilmore could only find a single claw when he reviewed the species in 1920. This species has been proposed as outside Coelurus since the 1920s (when Gilmore assigned it to Chirostenotes), and has been regarded as a dubious species outside of Coelurus in recent reviews. Finally, during the period when Ornitholestes was thought to be the same as Coelurus, its type species was recognized as distinct by Steel, as C. hermanni. Paleobiology and paleoecology =Provenance and occurrence= The type specimen of Coelurus agilis, YPM 2010 (now considered a synonym of Coelurus fragilis) was recovered in the Brushy Basin member of the Morrison Formation, in Albany County, Wyoming. The specimen was collected by Reed in gray sandstone and brown/green claystone that were deposited during the Kimmeridgian stage of the Jurassic period, approximately 157 to 152 million years ago. This specimen is housed in the collection of the Yale Peabody Museum in New Haven, Connecticut. =Fauna and habitat= The Morrison Formation is interpreted as a semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons, and flat floodplains. Vegetation varied from river-lining forests of conifers, tree ferns, and ferns, to fern savannas with rare trees. It has been a rich fossil hunting ground, holding fossils of green algae, fungi, mosses, horsetails, ferns, cycads, ginkgoes, and several families of conifers. Other fossils discovered include bivalves, snails, ray-finned fishes, frogs, salamanders, turtles such as Uluops, sphenodonts, lizards, terrestrial and aquatic crocodylomorphans like Fruitachampsa, several species of pterosaur like Kepodactylus, numerous dinosaur species, and early mammals such as docodonts, multituberculates, symmetrodonts, and triconodonts. Such dinosaurs as the theropods Ceratosaurus, Allosaurus, Ornitholestes, and Torvosaurus, the sauropods Apatosaurus, Brachiosaurus, Camarasaurus, and Diplodocus, and the ornithischians Camptosaurus, Hesperosaurus, Drinker, Fruitadens, Dryosaurus, and Stegosaurus are known from the Morrison. Coelurus is regarded as a small terrestrial carnivore, feeding on small prey items like insects, mammals, and lizards. It is thought to have been a fast animal, certainly faster than the similar but shorter-footed Ornitholestes. Coelurus is present in stratigraphic zones 2 and 5 of the Morrison Formation.Foster, J. (2007). \\"Appendix.\\" Jurassic West: The Dinosaurs of the Morrison Formation and Their World. Indiana University Press. pp. 327-329.

The sole species is Cryptosaurus eumerus. The femur was found by the geologist Lucas Ewbank and donated by him to the Woodwardian Museum at Cambridge in 1869. Cryptosaurus was the same year named by British paleontologist Harry Seeley; the type species is Cryptosaurus eumerus.H.G. Seeley, 1869, Index to the Fossil Remains of Aves, Ornithosauria, and Reptilia from the Secondary System of Strata, arranged in the Woodwardian Museum of the University of Cambridge. III, Cambridge University Press The genus name is derived from Greek kryptos, \\"hidden\\", a reference to the rarity of the find. The specific name means \\"well-formed thigh\\" in Greek, a reference to the stout build of the bone. The description of 1869, part of a catalogue of the Cambridge University collection, was rather minimal, consisting of the single sentence \\"On Shelf g is temporarily placed the femur of a Dinosaur from the Oxford Clay, Cryptosaurus eumerus\\". From this it is sometimes concluded that the name remained a nomen nudum until a full description by Seeley in 1875. The holotype, CAMSM J.46882,http://www.3d-fossils.ac.uk/fossilType.cfm?typSampleId=20006898 was discovered in the Great Gransden brick pit, in strata of the Ampthill Clay Formation (Oxford Clay), dating from the upper Oxfordian. The right femur is about 33 centimetres long and has a thick shaft. It belonged to an adult or at least subadult individual, meaning that the species was rather small. Seeley thought that Cryptosaurus was a relative of Iguanodon, the first such discovered from the Oxford Clay ‚Äî hence the generic name. Friedrich von Huene classified it in the Camptosauridae in 1909. The work of Peter Galton however, showed that Cryptosaurus is an ankylosaurian of unknown affinities.P.M. Galton, 1983, \\"Armored dinosaurs (Ornithischia: Ankylosauria) from the Middle and Upper Jurassic of Europe\\", Palaeontographica Abteilung A 182(1-3): 1-25 Today it is commonly considered to be a nomen dubium because of the limited remains. Cryptosaurus was for a long time known as Cryptodraco, which is an unnecessary replacement name. In 1889, Richard Lydekker renamed Cryptosaurus as he believed the name Cryptosaurus was already previously in use for another animal (Cystosaurus Geoffroy, described in 1832). This was in error, a mistake originally caused by a wrong spelling of Cystosaurus in the French Biblioth√®que universelle des sciences, belles-lettres, et arts, and the name Cryptosaurus has precedence.

In the context of search engine optimization, keyword density can be used to determine whether a web page is relevant to a specified keyword or keyword phrase. In the late 1990s, the early days of search engines, keyword density was an important factor in page ranking. However, as webmasters discovered how to implement optimum keyword density, search engines began giving priority to other factors beyond the direct control of webmasters. Today, the overuse of keywords, a practice called keyword stuffing, will cause a web page to be penalized. Many SEO experts consider the optimum keyword density to be 1 to 3 percent; more could be considered search spam. The formula to calculate your keyword density on a web page for SEO purposes is (Nkr / Tkn) * 100, where Nkr is how many times you repeated a specific keyword, and Tkn the total words in the analyzed text. The result is a keyword density value. When calculating keyword density, ignore html tags and other embedded tags which will not appear in the text of the page once published. When calculating the density of a keyword phrase, the formula would be (Nkr * Nwp / Tkn) * 100, where Nwp is the number of words in the phrase. So, for example, for a four-hundred word page about search engine optimization where \\"search engine optimization\\" is used four times, the keyword phrase density is (4*3/400)*100 or 3 percent. From a mathematical viewpoint, the original concept of keyword density refers to the frequency (Nkr) of appearance of a keyword in a dissertation. A \\"keyword\\" consisting of multiple terms, e.g. \\"blue suede shoes,\\" is an entity in itself. T frequency of the phrase \\"blue suede shoes\\" within a dissertation drives the key(phrase) density. It is \\"more\\" mathematically correct for a \\"keyphrase\\" to be calculated just like the original calculation, but considering the word group, \\"blue suede shoes,\\" as a single appearance, not three: Density = ( Nkr / Tkn ) * 100. 'Keywords' (kr) that consist of several words artificially inflate the total word count of the dissertation. The purest mathematical representation should adjust the total word count (Tkn) lower by removing the excess key(phrase) word counts from the total: Density = ( Nkr / ( Tkn -( Nkr * ( Nwp-1 ) ) ) ) * 100. where Nwp = the number of terms in the keyphrase. This general formula allows that the total word count will be unaffected if the key(phrase) is indeed a single term, so it acts as the original formula. Beyond the formulas, keyword density can be measured in a push of a button online with tools that count the number of instances a keyphrase has been mentioned. However, with the release of the Hummingbird update changed how Google evaluates content. Instead of that looking for exact-match keywords, Google now attempts to understand the intent behind a user‚Äôs query, and finds pages that match that intent. For example, rather than looking for instances of ‚Äúice cream parlor‚Äù on pages online, Google looks for pages that demonstrate qualities that an ice cream parlor would have, speaking contextually about ice cream parlors using natural, conversational language. This implies that keyword inclusion isn‚Äôt nearly as important as simply writing about the right subjects‚Äîand relying on natural language to take care of the rest.

At the time of its completion, the Liberty Building was the largest office building in downtown Buffalo and was built for Liberty National Bank to serve as their headquarters. Liberty National Bank was originally called the German American Bank but its name was changed to Liberty National Bank after World War I to remove any connection to that war's main enemy. In order to illustrate the bank's new image, the building was christened with three replicas of the Statue of Liberty sculpted by Leo Lentelli in 1925. Two statues on the roof, one facing west, and the other facing east, represent Buffalo's strategic location on the Great Lakes. A third statue was placed over the Main Street entrance. Only the rooftop statues remain today. They stand 36 feet tall and are illuminated at night. An addition to the building, designed by Lyman & Associates was completed in 1961. Present Day Didier Pasquette's tightrope walk On September 23, 2010 French tightrope walker Didier Pasquette completed a successful 150 ft walk across a high-wire suspended between the two statues atop the building.

Although women on crowded trains in Japan are the most frequent targets of chikan, sexual predators in Japan can take advantage of people of either sex in other situations as well. One such situation (warned against in the sign pictured) is bicycle parking lots, where a molester will wait until a woman or man is bent over, unlocking their bicycle lock, and then grope them from behind.

He discovered the Lactobacillus bulgaricus bacillus, which is the true cause for the existence of natural yogurt. Life Stamen Grigorov was born in the village of (lit. \\"Cold Spring\\"), Tran, Pernik Province, Bulgaria. He completed his secondary education in natural sciences in Montpellier, France and medical science in Geneva, Switzerland. In 1905, at the age of 27, Dr. Grigorov made the discovery, for which he is best known. In the microbiological laboratory of Professor L√©on Massol in Geneva, he discovered that a certain strain of bacillus is the true cause for the existence of natural yogurt.Grigoroff, Stamen, 1905. √âtude sur une lait ferment√©e comestible. Le ‚ÄúKiss√©lo ml√©ko‚Äù de Bulgarie. Revue M√©dicale de la Suisse Romande. Gen√®ve. Georg&G.;, Libraires- √âditeurs. Librairie de L‚ÄôUniversit√©. In recognition the strain was called by the scientific community Lactobacillus bulgaricus. His further research carried out in many institutes worldwide proved that Bulgarian yogurt helps in the treatment of various diseases and conditions like infections, otic-rhino- laryngeal diseases, tuberculosis, stomach and intestine conditions, ulcers, some gynecologic diseases, fatigue, etc. These prophylactic and curative properties of Bulgarian yogurt are due to the rich vitamin content including B1, B2, C, A, D, E, PP, B12, as well as lactose, proteins, and other important stimulating substances. Yogurt in its original variety can be produced only in Bulgaria and in some neighboring regions on the Balkan peninsula. In other natural climatic conditions the bacteria quickly degenerate, lose their qualities and die. Apart from the discovery of Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Dr. Grigorov made a major contribution to the creation of an anti-tuberculosis vaccine [the vaccine is a main work of Albert Calmette and Camille Gu√©rin in the Institut Pasteur de Lille]. On 20 December 1906, in Paris in issue No. 104 of the ‚ÄúLa Presse M√©dicale‚Äù medical journal, was published his scientific report ‚ÄúThe Anti-tuberculosis vaccine‚Äù, which informed the scientific community about the results of his research into the application of penicillin fungi for the treatment of tuberculosis [important to clarify that the term vaccine is actually quite different from treatment, that is what the article is talking about]. After the publication, the scientific community expressed serious interest in Dr. Grigorov's vaccine [treatment]. Through his scientific experiments ‚Äúin-vitro‚Äù and ‚Äúin-vivo‚Äù on lab animals and later on human patients, Dr. Grigorov clearly demonstrated and described the healing effect of penicillin fungi in the treatment of tuberculosis.

Originally a college exclusively for women, it is now coeducational. It is the oldest Catholic college in Indiana and is known for the Mari Hulman George School of Equine Studies.  History Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College was founded as an academy for young women by Saint Mother Theodore Guerin, who reached the site on October 22, 1840 after three months of travel. She led five Sisters of Providence, who had traveled from their convent in Ruill√©-sur-Loir, France. Mother Theodore had not been the first to step forward when the Bishop of Vincennes asked the Sisters of Providence to establish an academy for young women in Indiana. Although she had been decorated by the French Board of Education as a highly gifted and efficient teacher, Mother Theodore felt unworthy of the task of founding an institution of learning. Her superiors convinced her to accept the assignment. Saint Mother Theodore Guerin was canonized on October 15, 2006, by Pope Benedict XVI, and is Indiana's first saint. In 1846, Saint Mary-of-the- Woods College was granted the first charter for the higher education of women in the state of Indiana. SMWC conferred its first bachelor of arts degree in 1899. It was the first women's college to offer journalism courses and the first to offer degree work in secondary education, home economic, and secretarial science. As the careers open to women expanded, the College expanded into areas such as business, computer information systems, equine studies, psychology and nursing. SMWC now offers associate and bachelor's degrees in over 30 majors on campus and online. In 2015, Saint Mary-of-the- Woods College announced that the Board of Trustees voted unanimously to become fully coeducational at its May 1, 2015 meeting. Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College is recognized as a pioneer in the area of distance education. In 1973, the College introduced one of the first independent study programs in the nation, the Women's External Degree (WED) program. This program served adult women who needed flexible schedules to earn a degree while balancing important family and job responsibilities. In 2005, the College expanded access to its undergraduate distance and adult programs to men, while maintaining its longstanding mission for the advancement of women's education. Today, through the renamed Woods Online program, women and men can earn a college degree in a wide variety of majors. In August 2012, the Indianapolis Business Journal recognized SMWC as having one of the largest online degree programs in the state. More than 800 are currently enrolled in the program from 33 states and all across the globe, including England, Greece, Hong Kong and Jamaica. In 2015, all programs, including the campus-based resident undergraduate degree program, were opened to both men and women. Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College also offers three master's degree programs, open to both women and men, in the hybrid format. In 2000, the College created the Master of Arts in Art Therapy (MAAT) program, designed for persons who use or plan to use art in therapy or art as therapy, and the Master of Arts in Music Therapy (MAMT) program, which welcomes qualified music therapists seeking an advanced understanding of the therapeutic uses of music. In 2007, the College introduced the Master of Leadership Development (MLD) program. This program explores culture and creativity, leadership identity, ethical decision-making and critical analysis of research. All three master's degree programs use distance learning and intensive campus-based residencies. =Motto= \\"Virtus cum Scientia,\\" translated as \\"Virtue with Knowledge United,\\" appears on the SMWC seal and/or coat of arms. =Coat of arms= The College's coat of arms is a shield divided vertically in halves. The left field is blue, showing in the center a poplar tree on a hill or terrace in natural colors, with the first letter of the name of Mary; these latter devices are in gold. The right field is gold and shows three eaglets with open wings in blue, and beak and talons in red. The right half of the shield shows the arms of Madame du Roscoat, the foundress of the Sisters of Providence at Ruille-sur-Loir, France. The three eaglets are emblematic of the Holy Trinity, the motto of the du Roscoat family being \\"Trino Soli sit honor et gloria\\" (\\"To the Triune God alone honor and glory\\"). The left field is charged with devices symbolic or significant of some fact connected with the history of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods. The rayed star, charged with the letter \\"M\\" in blue, is an emblem of Mary Mother of God, the Stella Matutina, under whose protection Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, represented by a tree, places all its hopes for growth and life. The Latin crosses are emblems of Redemption and Catholicity. The crest is the count's coronet of the du Roscoat family and the motto \\"Virtus cum Scientia,\\" is the one chosen by Mother Theodore Guerin, foundress of the Sisters of Providence in America. =Aspire Higher initiative= on October 18, 2013, Saint Mary-of- the-Woods College launched a brand initiative focused on advancing its image and reputation. Called \\"Aspire Higher\\", it expresses the College‚Äôs mission and values, and also reflects its recent advances and vision. The initiative speaks to every aspect of the College ‚Äì academics, campus life, athletics, community and faith. Academics The curriculum of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College is based on a traditional liberal arts education. All campus students are required to complete an extensive curriculum of general studies in addition to their major(s) and/or minor(s). SMWC is a member of the College Consortium of Western Indiana. This membership allows students who are full- time at their home institution to take one class at the other member institutions of Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology and Indiana State University without additional tuition.  Athletics  Saint Mary-of-the- Woods College is a member of the United States Collegiate Athletic Association (USCAA) and the Intercollegiate Horse Show Association (IHSA).IHSA SMWC athletes make up nearly 30 percent of all campus students. The College currently offers seven sports: basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, hunt seat and western equestrian teams. With the hiring of a new coach in January 2014, SMWC will reinstate its volleyball program beginning Fall 2015. Recruiting is actively underway. =Crosstown Classic= The Crosstown Classic is a hometown rivalry winter basketball game between SMWC and Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. This annual competition has resulted in a 13-7 record favoring the Pomeroys. It was formerly called Clabber Girl Classic, named for the famed Clabber Girl trophy presented by the Clabber Girl of Hulman and Company. The College changed the name of the longstanding competition in 2016. =USCAA National Championships= The SMWC softball team won four consecutive USCAA National Softball Championships (2002‚Äì2005). The SMWC Equestrian Team competes throughout the year in both Western and English, traveling to about 20 shows per season. SMWC has been the site for regional horse shows, managed by the SMWC equestrian team members. In 2007, the SMWC Western Team was named IHSA Reserve National Champions. In 2009, the Pomeroy soccer team experienced a \\"Cinderella\\" season, in which they entered the USCAA National Championship Tournament as the 8th seed (the lowest seed) and advanced all the way to the national championship before being defeated by Marygrove College. Just days before the soccer team brought home the silver cup from Burlington, Vermont, the first-year cross-country squad won the USCAA National Championship in New Hampshire. Also in fall 2010, the cross-country team won a second USCAA National Championship.

It is an enduring symbol that honors academic success and sacrifice while demonstrating the pride and loyalty all Woods alums share. This distinctive ring is a captivating reminder of personal growth and unforgettable friendships. It represents a tangible bond linking generations of alumnae and students to The Woods. The top of the ring displays a deep black onyx and gold. On the rectangular onyx stone is carved an SMW emblem. Along its side of the gold is an oak leaf base, six acorns representing the College's founders, and the class year. The oak represents strength, knowledge and durability of character. When one receives the ring as an undergraduate, it is worn with the logo facing the heart to inspire and motivate continued academic achievement. Upon graduation, rings are turned so that the SMW faces outward. The ring then becomes visible for the world to see the SMW and that the wearer of the ring is forever connected to The Woods. Students Margaret Williams Mead '22 and Dorothy Helm Geisel '23 designed the ring in 1922. They worked with Herff Jones Jewelers to create the ring. It was first given to the seniors in 1922. Since the ring was intertwined with academic achievement, students wore caps and gowns to receive their rings during a special ceremony. They continue to do so during this day. Through 1928, only seniors were eligible to receive the ring. However, in 1929, juniors were granted the opportunity to receive the ring as long as they met the academic requirement. Ever since, it has evolved into a cherished tradition for the junior class. Ring Day Today students receive their Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College Ring through a special ceremony held each year in March. Students earn their participation in the ceremony through academic success in their junior year at SMWC, or for graduate students, when they are three-quarters of the way toward completion of their degrees. While most students purchase their rings new, all students have the opportunity to apply for a Legacy Ring, a ring donated back to The Woods by its previous owner. Recipients are chosen, based on academic standing and financial need, by a selection committee. Wearing caps and gowns, each student receives a ring from the president of the College during the Ring Day ceremony. To students at SMWC, Ring Day is the most highly anticipated day of their college career, even above graduation for most, because of the significance and symbolism of the ring. A popular tradition associated with Ring Day is called \\"pounding\\" in which the current junior class counts down to their own Ring Day ceremony. In this tradition, a group of students will pound on a table in the dining hall while chanting a count down. This typically occurs several times throughout the year leading up to Ring Day. Oakleaf Ceremony The Oakleaf ceremony is a tradition between faculty and campus seniors. During this commemoration, seniors are inducted into the alumnae association, by turning their rings around. This is an eloquent symbol of growing from an acorn into an oak tree. =Big/Little= Freshmen are taken under the wing of a member of the junior class. They are taught the values and traditions of the College and are guided through their first two years. This mentorship gives new students a sense of empowerment, community and pride. Big's are traditionally revealed to their Little's either on the marble steps of Le Fer Hall, or in a creative way, such as a scavenger hunt or at a secret meeting place. Historic architecture In addition to other structures, the campus includes six historic buildings owned by the college that date from 1913 to 1969: Guerin Hall (1913), Conservatory of Music (1913), Le Fer Hall (1924), Owens Hall (1960), Rooney Library (1964), and Hulman Hall (1969). The campus's are also home to the motherhouse of the Sisters of Providence of Saint-Mary-of-the Woods, whose buildings date from the 19th and 20th Centuries. The Indianapolis architectural firm of D. A. Bohlen, Architect, and its successors, D. A. Bohlen and Son; Bohlen and Burns; and Bohlen, Meyer, Gibson and Associates, completed \\"more than sixty projects\\" for the Sisters of Providence, including all six of the historic buildings.Four successive generations of Bohlen architects worked at the Indianapolis firm (Diedrich A. Bohlen, its founder; Oscar D. Bohlen, D. A.'s son; August C. Bohlen, Oscar's son; and Robert L. Bohlen, August's son). See More than twenty of the firm's projects, including Foley Hall (1860, 1897) at Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Foley Hall was demolished in 1989. Campus architects retained its pastoral setting, while a \\"French influence reminiscent of Georges-Eug√®ne Haussmann\\" is visible in the \\"straight walkways and open views\\". The historic buildings on campus were representative of popular architectural styles at the time of their construction. From 1894 until the 1970s, three generations of the Joseph Bisch family supervised maintenance of the campus. =Guerin Hall (1913)= Anne Therese Gu√©rin Hall, designed by Oscar D. Bohlen in a Renaissance Revival style, is named in honor of the foundress of the Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods. Construction for the four-story brick building began in 1911; it was dedicated on October 12, 1913. Guerin Hall was the college's first residence for students. Its lower floor contained offices, classrooms, and a chapel, while its upper floors offered semi-private rooms, a new trend in student housing at that time. The ornate front entrance features heavily-carved Corinthian capitals on pilasters, made of Indiana limestone. Guerin Hall surrounds an open courtyard and a veranda extends across the front of the building. =Conservatory of Music (1913)= Saint Cecilia Conservatory of Music was designed by Oscar D. Bohlen and constructed between 1911 and 1913, the same time as Guerin Hall. The Conservatory is located \\"on the site of the second Saint Mary-of-the-Woods village church and cemetery.\\" The three-story, Italian Renaissance Revival-style Conservatory was constructed of light brick and Bedford limestone. It has Ionic details and Beaux-Arts influences. The Conservatory was dedicated along with Guerin Hall on October 12, 1913, and contained music studios, practice rooms, classrooms, and offices.Madden, The Path Marked Out, pp. 384‚Äì85. Cecilian Auditorium, which \\"seats up to 720 people on the main floor and balcony\\", provides a theatrical space that includes a proscenium stage and theatrical lighting. =Le Fer Hall (1924)= Le Fer Hall, named in honor of Sisters Saint Francis Xavier and Mary Joseph Le Fer, two of Saint Mother Th√©odore Gu√©rin's companions, serves as a residence hall for students. The Indianapolis architectural firm of D. A. Bohlen and Son designed the four-story, French Renaissance Revival-style building. Construction began in 1921. The yellow brick residence hall contains classical balustrades on its stone and decorative metal balconies; its twin towers and tile roof reflects the Spanish Revival architectural style. Le Fer Hall's main floor initially included classrooms, offices, and a social hall/ballroom; rooms for students were on the upper floors.Madden, The Path Marked Out, p. 519. Residence hall rooms contain large windows and hardwood floors; more than 75 percent of them are suites with a connecting bathrooms. =Owens Hall (1960)= Robert Bohlen, the last of D. A. Bohlen's descendants, designed Owens Hall in 1960 as a novitiate building for the Sisters of Providence.Madden, The Path Marked Out, pp. 573 and 583. Its modern design includes \\"spandrel panels of brushed aluminum\\" between the windows of its \\"vertical central bay\\". =Rooney Library (1964)= The Mary and Andy Rooney Library, a contemporary structure built at a cost of $1.28 million, was designed in 1961 by Indianapolis architects August C. Bohlen and Melvin B. G. Meyer of Bohlen and Burns. This modern interpretation of a Classical-style building includes an offset entrance with a vertical bay. =Hulman Hall (1969)= Mary Fendrich Hulman Hall, was designed by Melvin B. G. Meyers, president of Bohlen, Meyer, Gibson and Associates, in a Mid-century modern style. Its design is similar to Owens Hall and Rooney Library. The building's vertical design includes \\"spandrel panels and use of aluminum.\\" The exterior's rough-cut stone in spandrel panels is classically inspired. Military From 2010 to 2013, SMWC has been named a Military Friendly School by Victory Media, a media entity for military personnel transitioning into civilian life. The 2013 Military Friendly Schools list honors the top 15 percent of colleges, universities and trade schools that are embracing America's military service members, veterans and spouses, ensuring their success in higher education. The 1,739 institutions on the list exhibit leading practices in the recruitment and retention of students with military experience. SMWC provides scholarships for up to 50 percent of the cost of tuition and fees that exceed the standard education benefit. The United States Department of Veterans Affairs will match the amount of the scholarship - completely covering tuition for qualified veterans.

Coat of arms of Henry Fiennes Pelham-Clinton, 2nd Duke of Newcastle, KG, PC Sir Francis Wheatley depicting The Duke of Newcastle, his friend Colonel Litchfield and the Duke's gamekeeper, Mansell along with four Clumber Spaniels. Henry Fiennes Pelham- Clinton, 2nd Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyne, KG, PC (16 April 1720 ‚Äì 22 February 1794) was born in London, the second son of the 7th Earl of Lincoln. Henry's father died in 1728, and his brother, the 8th Earl of Lincoln, died in 1730, making Henry the 9th Earl of Lincoln. As he was still a minor, his guardian was his uncle, the 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Newcastle was childless, and soon regarded Lord Lincoln as his heir. Newcastle, and his brother Henry Pelham, were the two most powerful men in England, and both would serve as Prime Minister. Newcastle controlled political patronage of Parliament and the Crown, and so Lord Lincoln was showered with sinecure posts which brought him a large income. Chief among these sinecures was the lifetime appointment as Controller of Customs for the port of London. After graduating from university, Lord Lincoln was sent abroad to complete his education. At Turin, Italy, where he was studying fencing, he was joined by his schoolfriend, Horace Walpole. Walpole was in love with Lord Lincoln, and Walpole biographer Timothy Mowl believes the two men were lovers. Lord Lincoln was exceedingly good-looking, and would later have the reputation as the most handsome man in England. While still on his Grand Tour, Walpole and Lord Lincoln quarreled and separated. He returned to England. On 16 October 1744, Lord Lincoln married his cousin Catherine Pelham (24 July 1727 ‚Äì 27 July 1760), the daughter of his uncle Henry Pelham, who was at that time prime minister. An agreement was signed whereby Lord Lincoln became the heir of both his uncles, Henry Pelham and the Duke. Through his uncles, Lord Lincoln was also given a place at court, being made a gentleman of the King's Bedchamber. In 1752, he was made a Knight of the Garter. In 1756, his uncle, who was already Duke of Newcastle- upon-Tyne, requested from King George II to also be created Duke of Newcastle- under-Lyne with a special remainder to his nephew, Lord Lincoln. George II granted the request, and when the Duke died in 1768, Lord Lincoln became the 2nd Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyne. The new duke steered clear of most politics, except in two instances. He had considerable influence because of the parliamentary seats he controlled. He used his influence to promote the career of his cousin Sir Henry Clinton, a career army officer. The Duke lobbied successfully for Sir Henry to be appointed commander-in-chief of the British forces in America during the American Revolution. The Duke's son, Thomas, was the aide-de-camp to Sir Henry Clinton. In 1768, the Duke was appointed to the Privy Council. In December 1783, the Duke was asked by King George III to support the new ministry of William Pitt the Younger, who was facing difficulty in mustering support in parliament for his premiership. Henry ordered the six MPs under his control to support Pitt, helping Pitt gain enough votes in parliament to form a ministry. The Duke died in 1794 in Westminster. The Duke is mainly known today as the creator of Clumber Park, his country seat in Nottinghamshire, and the dog breed the Clumber Spaniel, named after the estate. Clumber Park was begun in 1768 on the large estate the Duke had inherited from his uncle. Four thousand acres (16 square kilometers) of barren heath were landscaped into one of the most beautiful private parks in England, complete with a large man-made lake. The great mansion built there was demolished in 1938, but the park is today owned by the National Trust and is open to the public. He had also been a Bailiff on the board of the Bedford Level Corporation Fenland reclamation scheme from 1742 to 1764. The papers of the 2nd Duke are now held by Manuscripts and Special Collections at the University of Nottingham. Family life Before his wife's death at the age of 33, the Duke had four sons with her: *George Pelham-Clinton, Lord Clinton (26 November 1745 ‚Äì 19 August 1752) *Henry Fiennes Pelham-Clinton, Earl of Lincoln (5 November 1750 ‚Äì 18 October 1778), who married Lady Frances Seymour- Conway (4 December 1751 ‚Äì 11 November 1820) on 21 May 1775 and had issue. *Thomas Pelham-Clinton, 3rd Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyne (1 July 1752 ‚Äì 18 May 1795), who married Lady Anna Maria Stanhope (31 March 1760 ‚Äì 18 October 1834) on 2 May 1782 and had issue. *Lord John Pelham-Clinton (died 1781) Titles and styles *The Hon.
