The film was first screened at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2010, followed by the Venice Film Festival after it played in several festivals worldwide including the South Asian International Film Festival. The commercial release however took place a year later in September 2011, both in India as well as in the U.S. Plot Ruth (Kalki Koechlin) is a British woman who lost her sister to suicide a couple of years ago. She comes to India, to search for her father, who is of Indian descent, a man she hardly knew but cannot forget, due to a letter he had written to her, asking her to seek him out. Without a work permit, desperation drives her to work at a massage parlour, where she offers both standard massages and \\"happy endings\\". Torn between schisms, Mumbai becomes the alien yet strangely familiar backdrop for Ruth's quest. She struggles to find her independence and space as she is sucked deeper into the labyrinth of the city's underbelly. She also dates a drug addict Prashant (Prashant Prakash), who is simultaneously her saviour and tormentor. A city that feeds on her misery, a love that eludes her. In what is possibly also seen as a commentary on the cult of godmen in India, her father is shown to be a follower of one such religious cult. The film ends with Ruth hanging up her yellow boots, and quitting her job at the massage parlour and also presumably leaving the country to go back to Britain; her quest having come to a shocking end. Cast * Kalki Koechlin as Ruth * Naseeruddin Shah as Diwakar * Gulshan Devaiya as Chittiappa * Shiv Kumar Subramaniam * Mushtaq Khan * Ronit Roy (Cameo) * Makrand Deshpande (Cameo) * Piyush Mishra (Cameo) * Rajat Kapoor (Cameo) * Divya Jagdal as Divya * Kumud Mishra as Lynn * Prashant Prakash as Prashant * Pooja Swaroop as Maya * Kartik Krishnan Production =Development= Lead actress Kalki Koechlin who also co-wrote the film with Anurag Kashyap mentioned, \\"A lot of these characters were based loosely on figures that I had seen growing up in India ...Growing up as a white-skinned woman in India, I was always the odd one out ‚Äì there was a certain alienation that came with that, and you end up alienating yourself because everyone comes to you like the white girl, the easy, \\"Baywatch,\\" loose-moraled white girl.\\" Anurag Kashyap asked Koechlin to write the first scene, to get a female perspective on the treatment of white women at Indian government offices as she personally experienced the objectification. He also wanted to explore the theme of child abuse; he had previously played the role of child abuser in I Am (2010) by Onir, and he himself had been a victim of child abuse for 11 years. At the writing stage Koechlin and Kashyap disagreed on the ending initially, as Koechlin wanted an optimistic ending, unlike Kashyap who wanted to portray that \\"...you don't always get solutions to your problems\\". The film had difficulty finding funding because it dealt with controversial themes like child abuse and drug addiction and \\"differed so vastly from his previous work\\". As Kashyap put it, \\"I wanted to break the formula that many directors and actors find themselves in.\\" =Filming= The film was shot in just 13 days. It was primarily framed in tight spaces, like apartments, massage parlours, and rickshaws leading to a \\"claustrophobic sense of unease that permeates the entire film\\". Many of the cast members had previously worked together in theatre productions; this familiarity allowed the director to shoot the film in a shorter period of time. He admitted that he never \\"directed\\" any of the actors during the filming, \\"I've never told any actor what to do, only what not to do. You have to trust your actors, and I know mine inside and out.\\" He found the entire filming emotionally draining and tough, especially because it was made mostly on borrowed money. Release After travelling to 2010 Toronto International Film Festival, 67th Venice International Film Festival in September 2010 and International Film Festival of Los Angeles (IFFLA), at its New York premiere on 24 August 2011, at the Asia Society, director Anurag Kashyap said, \\"I hope you feel the film, because you will not enjoy it.\\" The film's commercial release, however, took over a year as it was delayed to coincide with its US release to avoid internet piracy. Indian distributors were not keen on the film, as without big Bollywood stars they did not find it viable for an international release; they mainly cater to an NRI (Non-resident Indian) audience. Finally US based- distributor IndiePix Films came on board for paving the way for a US release with 30 prints, all in non-NRI theatres, a rare feat for a Bollywood film. Meanwhile, the film was also sold in Scandinavian countries, Turkey, Southern Europe, and New Zealand. Its satellite rights were sold in many countries. The film thus became Kashyap's first worldwide release, as it was released in 40 US theatres on 2 September by IndiePix Films, on the same day of its India release. Previously, after its showing at the London Indian Film Festival, Britain-based Mara Pictures picked up the film there for UK release in last quarter of 2011. Kashyap later told BBC News that he received a negative backlash from financial backers because of the film's sexual content: \\"A lot of people involved with the film were embarrassed about the film. A lot of people we thanked in the film who actually lent us money, they said, 'Please take our names from the film,' because they don't want somebody to see and say 'You gave the money to make this film!'\\" That Girl in Yellow Boots is one of the few Indian films released without an interval.https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Intermission- without-permission/articleshow/9896882.cms =Marketing= Prior to its India release, the first look of the film was unveiled to the press on 11 August 2011. MTV India started a \\"That Girl with Yellow Boots contest\\" asking for audition tapes from aspiring actors, the winner of which would act in future Anurag Kashyap's films. In the run up to the film, its lead Kalki Koechlin appeared at an event, colour-coordinated, complete with yellow boots. =Critical reception= The film opened to mostly positive reviews. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-times gave it 3.5 out of the 4 stars, and he also noted that ' The film's value is in its portrait of Ruth, and her independence as a solo outsider in a vast, uncaring city. ' In his Huffington Post review, Kia Makarechi wrote, \\"an unnervingly realistic portrait of unimaginable pain ‚Äì is one with an ending you'll wish you could forget.\\" Nupur Barua of fullhyd.com rated it 7 out of 10, and said that besides the Kashyap-esque tone of despair and melancholy, That Girl in Yellow Boots is Anurag Kashyap's best until date, adding that you can watch it \\"only if you can handle the unspeakable\\". Parmita Borah, on EF News International, wrote, \\"Kalki Koechlin carries That Girl in Yellow Boots on her shoulders and does so with great panache and √©lan.\\" Shivesh Kumar of IndiaWeekly awarded the movie 3.5 out of 5 stars.

Sometimes considered a backlash against global capitalism or economic globalization, fiscal localism affords voluntary, market structures that help communities trade more efficiently within their communities and regions. Fiscal localism Local Farmer's Market \\"Buy local\\" or local purchasing is the most visible face of fiscal localism. There are more complex institutions (both new and well established) that contribute to a community's ability to flourish. Institutions like credit unions, CDFI's (Community Development Financial Institutions), and local currency or complementary currency all can contribute to making communities more resilient and wealthy. Local currency has been in the news most, with journalists citing the Berkshares in Massachusetts, and the Ithaca Hours in Ithaca, New York. Beyond these salient examples, there are thousands of local currencies all over the world. Fiscal localism is rooted in the concept of decentralization. The creation and maintenance of a regional economy is supported by communities who believe that their community is economically better off sustaining itself rather than being part of and relying upon a larger economy, such as a national economy or the global economy. This is a movement against the increasing globalization of all economies around the world. The main tenets of fiscal localism include buying products that are made locally and using a currency that is unique to that local economy. This allows a community to grow at a controllable and sustainable rate by supporting farmers, shopkeepers, and service providers of a community. Consumers in these communities are more informed about how their foods and products are grown and made. Using a unique form of currency allows a community to determine its economic growth and health more accurately than using metrics of a national economy to gauge economic health. Taxation in these communities is emphasized at the local level and low importance is put on national taxes. These communities want to separate themselves from the larger national economy so they must rely on revenue generated from local taxation. Banking is also preferred to be done on a local level. Communities that follow fiscal localism would rather have one local bank than be customers of a massive bank that does business across the country as well as internationally. Local currency Unique currencies used by local economies are often backed by a national currency. The town of Totnes, England, from 2007 to 2019 used the Totnes Pound, which was backed by the British Pound sterling at a one-to-one ratio. The idea behind using a unique, local currency is to keep money flowing through the community while preventing money from leaving or relying on money to enter the community. This allows a community to become self-sufficient, have enough funds to create an energy source for the community to use, and eliminate transportation costs for bringing products into the community. A large reason Totnes wanted to become self-sufficient is to decrease its dependence on the use of oil; the town believed that it would be better off in the long run if it were able to operate without relying on oil, which is a finite resource. Following in Totnes' footsteps, several other English townsBrixton, Stroud, Bristol, and Exeterhave established currencies of their own. A few towns in the United States have also adopted unique currencies. Berkshire, Massachusetts and Ithaca, New York have implemented Massachusetts BerkShares and the HOUR, respectively. While a BerkShare is worth $.95 US dollars, the HOUR is not convertible to US dollars or any other type of national currency. Calgary Dollars, created in 1996 as the Bow Chinook Barter Community, has not been backed by or exchangeable with national currency, Canadian dollars. Their belief is that the valuation of 1:1 without exchangeability allows exchanges to be simplified but reduces the linkages to the problems associated with national currency that complementary currencies are seeking to address such as currency speculation and interest-bearing design. This concept is to \\"complement\\" the national currency with unique Calgary Dollars economic activity and increasing the local multiplier of both the Calgary Dollars and the associated percentage of national currency that is often included in the transactions. A British Quaker colony in Pennsylvania created and used the Pennsylvania Pound in the 18th century, but fiscal localism failed for the colony and the currency was abandoned. Lorenzo Fioramonti, director of the Centre for the Study of Governance Innovation at the University of Pretoria in South Africa, believes that the European Union would be more stable if it used multiple local currencies combined with a \\"digital euro\\". Taxes Proponents of fiscal localism argue that paying higher local taxes and lower national taxes will help communities grow and thrive. A report from The TaxPayers' Alliance states that a decentralized form of taxation leads to a more efficient public sector. This report references a German econometric study which found that \\"government efficiency increase with the degree of fiscal decentralization\\". Reasons used to support local taxation include responsiveness, cost efficiency, incentives, and accountability. The Spanish Institute of Fiscal Studies conducted a study over a period stretching from 1972 to 2005 using data from 23 countries regarding taxes. The study found that \\"reducing the share of central government in total tax revenue by one percentage point boosts long-run GDP growth by about 0.06 per cent per annum\\". Setting local taxes is complicated, because too high a tax rate will lead to taxpayers refusing to pay while too low a rate will not give the local government enough funds to function and operate effectively. These taxes are separate from state and federal taxes and are not set at the state or federal level. Increasing local taxes allows a community to reinvest revenue generated from the taxes into public institutions or programs that help the local community. Residents are able to physically see and experience where their tax money is going and how it improves their lives. Banks Modern banks have become monolithic institutions with thousands of branches in their respective countries of service. This globalization of banking institutions and the banking practices used by these organizations is the antithesis of what fiscal localism is about. Toby Blume argues for a shift in the banking system in his essay \\"Changing the Debate: The Ideas Redefining Britain.\\" Blume writes, \\"A more localised banking system - which is more common in other countries but we don't have in the UK - provides a way to connect surplus capital with productive purpose (for the mutual benefit of savers/investors and borrowers).\\" Advocates for fiscal localism argue that the banking system should be restructured to accommodate the needs of smaller, local communities. These communities that are built around the tenets of fiscal localism want to have local banks that have consumer bases which are limited to the population that is geographically located around the bank. This allows the bank to know its customers on a personal level in order to determine the risk of giving a loan out to someone who lives in the community. It also allows the bank to use its excess capital to invest in services and businesses that are located in these towns, which in turn spurs the local economy at a consistent growth rate. Local exchange trading systems A local exchange trading system (LETS) is composed of local members that want to trade goods and services with other members in the group. These LETS use a unique local currency on which all trade is based upon. Those who are in LETS believe that they benefit both the members and the local community due to the organized nature of these LETS. The five core traits of a LETS include ‚Äúcost of service, consent, disclosure, equivalence to the regional currency, and interest-free.‚Äù Member transactions through a LETS do not have to be solely monetary. A purchase can be repaid through a service performed for the other member involved in the transaction. Brexit A recent, and perhaps the most widely known, push for fiscal localism occurred when the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union in 2016. The European Union is an economic union that was formed in order to allow free movement of resources and capital between the countries that compose the organization. Discussions of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union have gone on for many years, but was not made official until the public of the United Kingdom voted to leave. Many of those who were proponents of leaving the European Union wanted to do so for economic reasons. Nigel Farage, one of the most prominent endorsers of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union, wrote, \\"We know that the European Union is hell bent on further, deeper centralisation.\\" The disdain that Nigel Farage has for centralization is rooted in both economic and political reasons, but the economic reasons lie in his desire for increased fiscal localism. Many citizens of the United Kingdom share the same negative view of centralization. This resulted in the voting populace choosing to leave the European Union. This historic decision of the United Kingdom is an example of a community choosing to reject the increasing globalization of economic institutions and policies. However, many citizens of the United Kingdom did not want to leave the European Union. These opponents of Brexit preferred to remain in an organization that encouraged wealth and services to move freely among countries within the union. Then Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May said in April 2016 that if the United Kingdom left the European Union, \\"There would be little we could do to stop discriminatory policies being introduced, and London's position as the world's leading financial centre would be in danger.\\" See also *Barter *Credit union *Cooperatives *CDFI *Community currency *Community-based economics *Informal sector (aka informal economy) *Local multiplier effect *New Economy movement *Time-based currency *Time banking *Transition Towns References External links   Category:Localism (politics) ","title":"Fiscal localism"},{"id":"28212999","text":"Hessa or Hussa is an Arabic feminine given name, which means big, pure, white pearl, also \\"destiny.\\" The name may refer to: *Hessa Al Jaber (born 1959), Qatari engineer and politician *Hussa bint Ahmed Al Sudairi (1900‚Äì1969), Saudi Arabian princess *Hessa bint Salman Al Khalifa (1933‚Äì2009), Bahraini queen References Category:Arabic feminine given names ","title":"Hessa (name)"},{"id":"28213003","text":"Dan Macaulay is a Contemporary Christian music recording artist and contemporary worship leader from Brantford, Ontario, Canada.

She attended college at Oglethorpe University and the University of California. After graduating college she returned to Georgia and wrote columns for both the Atlanta Constitution and Atlanta Journal, at the same time she began her public relations career by handling publicity for the Woman's Club of Atlanta. In the late 1920s, she moved to New York City to develop a dual career in public relations and advertising. She was contracted by various New York City department stores to develop advertising by staging various types of publicity events. In 1932, she was hired by Brooklyn-based Hearn's as a fashion promoter and publicist. Among the publicity events she staged at the store were a fashion contest emceed by gossip columnist and society figure Elsa Maxwell and a Thanksgiving Day circus in Central Park. Bemis wrote the press releases for the events she staged and occasionally made the front page of New York City newspapers herself. In 1938, Bemis resigned from Hearn's to do free-lance public relations for a variety of diverse companies, including the Ford Motor Company, which she worked to promote at the 1939 New York World's Fair, and the Claire Wolff modeling agency. In 1943, Bemis enlisted in the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps and was stationed in Daytona Beach, Florida, giving radio addresses and coordinating entertainment at the local U.S.O. She was honorably discharged with the rank of corporal. She then coordinated a wartime fashion show in New York City sponsored by The New York Times, entitled \\"Fashions of the Times\\". She then went to Atlanta to become Director of Special Events at Rich's Department Store (1946‚Äì1947), then back to New York to take a position as Director of Feature Events at Abraham & Straus Department Store, where she worked until 1954. In 1956, Bemis semi-retired to St. Augustine, Florida, where she engaged in charitable work for various causes, worked as a publicist for the city and wrote for several local newspapers. On January 23, 1974, her friend and close neighbor on Marine Street, fellow socialite Athalia Ponsell Lindsley (once engaged to Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr.), was hacked to death with a machete on Lindsley's front porch. Another neighbor was indicted and tried for the crime but was acquitted. The investigation into the crime was wrought with controversy and no one else was charged in the murder. Bemis, who may have been gathering information for a book, alluded to the fact that she had information pertinent to the case. On November 3, 1974, she went out for her evening walk and never returned. Her body was discovered about 7 p.m. a block and a half from her house, her skull crushed by a cement block. Her murder, like Ponsell Lindsley's, remains unsolved. References External links * Frances Bemis papers from the 1930s to the 1950s, at Sophia Smith Collection, Smith College.

He played at the fullback position for the University of Michigan from 1957 to 1959. He was chosen as the Most Valuable Player on the 1959 Michigan Wolverines football team. A native of Lombard, Illinois, he attended Chicago's St. Philip High School where he played fullback for the St. Philip Gaels football team. Rio received a football scholarship to attend the University of Michigan and played fullback for the Michigan Wolverines football teams from 1957 to 1959. As a sophomore in 1957, Rio appeared as a back-up fullback in games against Indiana and Ohio State, gaining 33 yards in 6 carries. As a junior in 1958, Rio played in the Wolverines' first five games, including two games as the starting fullback. He scored his first collegiate touchdown on October 11, 1958, against the Navy Midshipmen. Two weeks after scoring his first Michigan touchdown, Rio was arrested by campus police on charges of engaging in an illegal occupation. Six other students were also arrested, including Rio's roommate, Jack Lewis, who was the captain of Michigan's basketball team, and Carl Riseman, associate sports editor of the campus newspaper. Rio was accused of being part of a \\"$10,000-a-week football gambling ring\\" involved in selling \\"football spot cards\\", in which the purchaser bet on a series of football games and won prizes if he did better than the spread on a certain number of games. Michigan's athletic director Fritz Crisler immediately suspended both Rio and Lewis from their respective teams until the criminal charges were resolved. The story drew national media attention, including a photo-story in Life, noting that the informant, an editor at The Michigan Daily, had been hung in effigy. After initially pleading not guilty, Rio and Lewis pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge in November 1958 and were placed on probation by the university for the remainder of the academic year. The university announced at the time that Rio and Lewis could appear before the university's dean of men and the joint judiciary council to seek to restore their athletic eligibility, but a \\"high university source\\" said it was doubtful the two would receive \\"a clean bill of health.\\" Newspapers reported that there was \\"only a remote possibility\\" that their eligibility would be restored. In August 1959, the university restored Rio's athletic eligibility, allowing him to play football in his senior year. Bump Elliott, in his first year as Michigan's head football coach, announced that Rio had been invited to join 75 others when practice opened and added, \\"As far as I'm concerned the whole thing is past.\\" Rio responded to his reinstatement with the best year of his football career, starting all nine games at fullback for the 1959 Michigan Wolverines football team. He gained 58 yards on 12 carries in an 18-7 win over Oregon State and had a career-long 50-yard run in a 14-7 win over Minnesota. In his final game for Michigan, Rio scored two touchdowns in a 23-14 win over Ohio State. His first touchdown came 70 seconds into the game on a pass into the end zone from quarterback Stan Noskin. The second came on a one-yard run in the third quarter. At the conclusion of the 1959 season, Rio was named the Most Valuable Player on the 1959 Michigan team. Rio tried out with the New York Titans of the newly formed American Football League in the summer of 1960, but he was cut by the Titans on July 19, 1960. In June 1987, Rio died at age 49.

Based at College Field, Merthyr Tydfil were one of the first professional Welsh teams, and folded in 1911 after the failure of the Welsh League. Merthyr Tydfil produced five players who would go on to represent the Wales national rugby league team, and in the 1908-09 season finished eighth in the Northern League, the best result achieved by any of the first six professional Welsh teams. Club history =Formation= At the beginning of the 20th century, rugby union was the sport of choice for most villages and towns in Wales.R League: The day Wales made history Wales Online, 23 December 2007 The sport was strictly amateur, and players were not expected to receive any monies for taking part in the sport. If players were discovered taking payments, they and their club could be permanently suspended. The problem facing Welsh rugby was the rise of the professional Northern Union (later rugby league) in the North of England, where several clubs had split away from the International Rugby Board and formed their own league where players were paid to play. Many rugby union clubs found their star players poached from them by the new Northern League. At the start of the 20th century the most successful rugby team in Merthyr was Merthyr Alexandria. At the club's AGM in July 1907, E.M. Rees, the former secretary of Aberdare RFC, alleged that Merthyr was involved in professionalism.Lush (1998), pg. 19 He stated that not only had the secretary of Merthyr Alexandria, W.T. Jones, demanded ¬£7 5s. to bring his team to play Aberdare, but also Merthyr paid players per match. These allegations prompted an investigation by the Welsh Rugby Union, the governing body of rugby union in Wales. At the AGM a proposal was made for Merthyr Alexandria to adopt professionalism and join the Northern Union, but this was overwhelmingly rejected by the committee. Even though Merthyr Alexandria remained true to the amateur sport, within a week of the AGM it was reported that fixtures had been arranged, players signed and guarantors found for a new professional rugby club in Merthyr. In July 1907 a Merthyr Tydfil rugby league team joined the Northern Union and the Northern Rugby League. =1907-08 season= Dai \\"Tarw\\" (\\"Bull\\") Jones Merthyr Tydfil played their first Northern Union match on 7 September 1907, a home game to Oldham which Merthyr lost 25-6.Lush (1998), pg. 257 Merthyr continued to struggle against the more established northern teams, losing ten games in succession, though they had close matches with Batley (4-5), Broughton Rangers (10-14) and Bradford Northern (6-8). During their ten match losing run, they lost their first ever all-Welsh encounter, when Ebbw Vale beat them 2-0, and on 2 November they were beaten by the very first touring New Zealand side. Merthyr's first victory came on 16 November 1907, when they beat Runcorn at home. By the end of 1907 they had picked up more points in the Northern Rugby League, with wins over Widnes and Ebbw Vale, and a draw with Huddersfield. On 1 January 1908, the first true international rugby league match took place. Played on Ynys Field in Aberdare, the game was contested by Wales and New Zealand. Merthyr supplied two of its players to the first Wales team: David \\"Dai\\" Davies, and Dai \\"Tarw\\" Jones,Gate (1986), pg. 141 a former rugby union international, who scored the winning try to give Wales their first victory. As the season continued, Merthyr's performances on the pitch improved, with wins over Huddersfield, York, Leigh, Wakefield Trinity and a high-flying Hunslet. All the wins came at home, and their away form was poor. They finished the season with only eight wins and one draw out of thirty games, coming 23rd out of 27 clubs; but the League run was still seen as a success for a first season.Lush (1998), pg. 257 Merthyr also managed to progress to the third round of the Challenge Cup after wins over Beverley and Whitehaven. A more worrying matter for the club than their league position was the gate receipts. The season opener against Oldham attracted between 2000 and 3000 spectators, a disappointing number, though the weather was poor and the admission price a bit high.Lush (1998), pg. 20 The more established Northern teams such as Broughton attracted a crowd of 4000, while the clash between Merthyr and the New Zealand national team brought in between 8000 and 12,000 people. Crowd control was sometimes an issue, and the College ground was suspended for two weeks after the Rochdale Hornets game, after the referee reported he had been 'molested' by the spectators. =1908-09 season= Duncan McGregor The 1908-09 season saw the first real attempt to bring rugby league to Wales: four new Welsh teams were formed, Aberdare, Barry, Mid-Rhondda and Treherbert. This allowed the formation of the Welsh League, but that in turn meant fewer games against the Northern opposition, as the ten fixtures of the Welsh League replaced ten matches against English teams. Merthyr started the season with one of their biggest signings when they acquired the services of Duncan McGregor, an ex-New Zealand dual-code rugby international. Unfortunately for Merthyr, he injured his ankle in his d√©but match, and was an infrequent member of the first team. The club was then forced to recruit local amateurs to fill their ranks, though they did gain the services of Tom Thomas from Wigan for ¬£60 (based on increases in average earnings, this would be approximately ¬£21,100 in 2013), an amount the club treasurer claimed he paid himself. The season was of mixed fortunes for Merthyr: it was the club's most successful in the Northern Rugby League, but they were average at best in the matches in the Welsh League. Merthyr still struggled away from home, though they achieved their first away victory over English opposition when they beat Barrow in November 1908. Merthyr had a good Northern League season through their victories over their fellow Welsh clubs, winning nine matches out of eleven encounters. In comparison, they only won twice and drew once out of seven matches against the Northern clubs. These results left Merthyr eighth out of 31, the best result achieved by any Welsh club in the early 20th century. The results in the Welsh League were not as impressive, winning five and losing five. The most telling results were the home and away losses to both Ebbw Vale and Mid-Rhondda, the teams that ended first and second respectively, leaving Merthyr third out of six teams. Wales played just one international match during the season, away to England. Merthyr provided two players to the game Thomas Paddison and David Davies. Merthyr also faced their second international opposition during the season, when the touring Australian team came to College Park.Kangaroo Tour: 1908-1909 Sean Fagan, rl1908.com Merthyr beat the tourists 15-13, and also supplied eight players to a Welsh League XIII who defeated the Australian team on 16 January 1909.Proud Victory Merthyr Express, 15 January 2009 Crowds for the season were between 3000 and 4000 for most matches; even the touring Australian team mustered a gate of 4000. The best crowd of the season was when Ebbw Vale visited in December for their Northern League encounter, when 5000 people watched the match. =1909-10 season= With the collapse of half of the Welsh teams before the start of the season, the Welsh League now consisted of just Merthyr, Ebbw Vale and Treherbert. Further problems emerged when Merthyr began losing some of their best talent to the Northern clubs. J. Cowmeadow, a prolific winger who scored the winning try for the Welsh League XIII against Australia, was signed to York City Knights.Lush (1998), pg. 21 He was followed later in the season by forward player Dan Lewis, before David \\"Dai\\" Davies and Palmer Griffiths were signed by Swinton. The season also saw a marked decline in attendance figures, with many supporters switching their allegiance to local association football team Merthyr Town. Matters were made worse when Merthyr Tydfil switched grounds from College Park to the Rhydycar Ground on the outskirts of the town. Despite a change of venue, the crowds were still boisterous, and after a defeat to Dewsbury the supporters pelted the referee with clinker, cutting his head. The Rhydycar Ground was suspended for four weeks, and the club treasurer was also suspended when he claimed the club had no money to pay the referee. On the pitch, the team failed to build on the previous season's success, and struggled to win matches. In the Welsh League they finished second from three, and in the Northern League they managed only two wins, both at home, over Treherbert and Warrington. Their away record was awful, losing all encounters, some very heavily, including 0-56 to Warrington and 0-67 to Wigan.Lush (1998), pg. 258 They ended the Northern League with two wins, a draw and 18 losses, finishing 27th out of 28 clubs, one place ahead of Treherbert. Wales played in two international games during this season, both against England. In the first game on 4 December 1909, Wales travelled to Belle Vue, Wakefield, Merthyr saw David \\"Dai\\" Davies collect his fourth consecutive cap. The second encounter was played at Ebbw Vale's Bridge End Field; three Merthyr players were selected: Rhys Rees, David \\"Dai\\" Davies and Dan Lewis. =1910-1911= With Treherbert folding during the mid-season break, Merthyr and Ebbw Vale were the only remaining Welsh clubs, so the Welsh League was abandoned. The season began with four straight losses in September, followed by an away defeat to Warrington. On 8 October, Merthyr were humiliated 13-70 by Hull Kingston Rovers. It was reported that the team 'cut a ridiculous figure' during the match, and the club officials 'realised that if they were to retain public support the tide of defeats would have to be stemmed'. Merthyr rose to the challenge briefly, beating Barrow and Bradford Northern in the next two games, but their form slipped again and these results were followed by four more losses. By the end of December Merthyr had played 18 games, with five wins and 13 losses. On 31 December 1910, the team faced Coventry in the Challenge Cup, and lost 18-3. This was the club's last game: in January, with finances spiralling out of control and the season only half played, the club ceased to exist. =Club demise= Although Merthyr Tydfil was facing a bleak future due to competition from Merthyr Town AFC, its demise was hastened by poor administration. In December 1909 it was reported that 'as usual several selected players failed to turn up' for a match against Treherbert, and as players were paid to play, this pointed at problems with the payment of salaries.Lush (1998), pg. 22 Unlike other clubs, Merthyr never set themselves up as a limited company, and there was confusion as to who employed the players. Further evidence of the general managerial confusion behind the club was revealed when Messrs Ellison & Co. took legal action against the club about an unpaid bill for hiring of turnstiles. At the hearing at Merthyr County Court in December 1910, the judge asked the club secretary who was running the club; the secretary replied that he did not know. In January 1911, after the club's final game, the former club secretary J.B. Evans reported to the Merthyr Express that the club had been initially backed by two bonds totalling ¬£760, but by the end of the second season the club was in debt for ¬£473. It was then decided to float the club as a company, but although directors were appointed, no flotation took place. Players of note Players earning international caps while at Merthyr Tydfil RLFC *J.

The colliery was around northwest of Hatfield, South Yorkshire, adjacent north of the railway line from Doncaster to Scunthorpe (former South Yorkshire Railway, or Barnsley to Barnetby Line) northeast of Hatfield and Stainforth railway station. The colliery opened in 1916. The pit was stopped in 2001, and restarted 2007; the mine passed through a number of different owners in the early part of the 21st century, with subsequent operators entering receivership. During the same period the site was proposed as the location for high-technology coal burning power stations schemes which did not proceed. In 2013 the major Doncaster- Thorne railway line which connected South Yorkshire to the Humber ports and Scunthorpe was blocked by a landslip at the colliery spoil for around 6 months. From late 2013 the mine was employee owned by the 'Hatfield Colliery Partnership Limited'. Due to lack of demand for coal products the colliery shut down at the end of June 2015. History =1910‚Äì2001= In December 1910 the Hatfield Main Colliery Company was formed by Emerson Bainbridge. On 11 September 1916 the first main shaft was completed, followed on 1 April 1917 by the second shaft. The pit exploited coal from the High Hazel coal seam (see Coal Seams of the South Yorkshire Coalfield). In January 1927 it was bought by the Carlton Main Colliery Company. In January 1947 it became part of the National Coal Board. In 1967 the Hatfield and Thorne collieries were merged, becoming separate again in February 1978. They were merged again on 1 February 1986. On 18 November 1993, a time of many pit closures, it was announced the combined pit would close, which took place on 3 December 1993, when under ownership of British Coal. On 4 January 1994, a team from the pit's management announced they wanted to re-open the pit, forming Hatfield Coal Company Ltd on 25 January 1994. The first coal was dug on 7 July 1994. In its first year of operation the company made a profit of ¬£2.4 million. On 9 August 2001 the pit closed, resulting in the loss of 223 jobs; the site was mothballed with funding from the Department of Trade and Industry. =2001‚Äì2015= In October 2001, Richard Budge, former owner of RJB Mining, took control of the pit, under ownership of the company Coalpower Ltd. In 2003 Coalpower published plans for a 450 MW power station at the site. In late 2003 Coalpower went into administration, in part due to geological problems at the coal face affecting production. The pit closed in early 2004. In 2006 Richard Budge restarted the colliery, and started planning for a carbon capture and storage (CCS) coal burning powerstation at the site, via company Powerfuel. Russian coal company Kuzbassrazrezugol (KRU) acquired a 51% stake in Powerfuel. Coal production at the pit was restarted, producing coal in 2007; with production made economically viable through a doubling in the price of coal between 2004 and 2008. The CCS project was approved to receive ¬£180 million of EU funding in 2009. The CCS project failed to obtain enough investment to proceed. In 2010 Powerfuel entered administration, in part due to coal production problems. Hatfield Colliery while still open in June 2014In 2011 2Co Energy Ltd. (via holding Entero BV, backed by ING Bank) acquired the company, and announced it would continue and rename the CCS project as Don Valley Power Project. The colliery was then managed under contract by Hargreaves Services plc. In 2013 70 of approximately 700 employees were made redundant after a return to a three shift pattern due to production issues. In December 2013 the employee controlled company Hatfield Colliery Partnership Limited (HCPL) purchased the mine from ING Bank. In late 2014 the National Union of Mineworkers provided the pit with a ¬£4 million bridging loan whilst the pit move production to a new pit face. In June 2015 the colliery ceased production, unable to sell its coal due to increases in the UK carbon tax. Hatfield landslip Landslip, 16 February 2013 In February 2013, a landslide occurred on a spoil tip used by the colliery. The landslide displaced and blocked the main railway line (Barnsley to Barnetby, or Doncaster to Thorne Line, formerly the South Yorkshire Railway) north-east of Hatfield and Stainforth railway station. The closure affected rail services between Doncaster and Goole (to Hull) and Scunthorpe (to Cleethorpes). The route is also a major freight line, with around 20% of UK rail freight using the section, and freight services had to be diverted over lines via Brigg and Lincoln. The slipped material consisted of excavated mudstone waste enclosing a well of of multi-roll filter slurry, which has a moisture content of 40% and is produced during the process of washing and reclaiming coal fines. The movement of the spoil displaced the four running lines, and a siding, approximately vertically and horizontally, over a distance of . The recovery operation required the movement of around of material in total and the replacement of around of quadruple-track railway. The line reopened in early July 2013, with a return to a full timetable on 29 July. Movement of the colliery waste continued for several months after the reopening of the railway. The slip was thought to have been caused by rainfall soaking the spoil heap, which was still being added to, allowing the heap to overcome the resistance of the surrounding loose natural soil lying over a sandstone base.

Original vision As originally envisioned by the plan, the Yellow Line would conjoin with the existing Baltimore Light Rail at the BWI Business District Station, and remain connected until Camden Yards, where the two lines would spur to create a loop around Downtown Baltimore. In this small loop, the lines would both contain the stations of: Inner Harbor, Charles Center, Mt. Vernon, and Pennsylvania Station.

Vacancy The by-election was caused by the resignation of the sitting Liberal MP, Sir John Austin.The Times, 17 June 1899 p13 Austin had been MP for Osgoldcross since 1886 but he found himself in dispute with his constituency Liberal Association when he voted against certain measures in Parliament which were supported by the Liberal Party nationally. Some of these issues were on religious questions and Sir John Austin was a Roman Catholic. In some quarters the dispute with Sir John Austin was seen as an attack on him because of his religion, although he had a record of getting on well with his traditionally nonconformist constituency.The Times, 30 June 1899 p10 However one of the issues that Austin championed was opposing the power of local authorities to impose a veto on liquor sales and this brought him into conflict with many of his pro-temperance chapel Liberals. A meeting of the Osgoldcoss Liberal Association was held at Pontefract on 15 June 1899 and a vote of no confidence in Austin was passed. A further motion of regret at his actions was also passed but, no doubt in an effort to heal the breach between MP and local party, it was declared that Austin had broken no pledges made in his election addresses.The Times, 17 June 1899 p13 Candidates =Austin= Following the vote of censure against him Sir John Austin decided to resign his seat and appeal directly to his constituents on the points at issue.The Times, 17 June 1899 p13 He chose to contest the election as a Liberal and was sometimes also referred to in the press as a Radical.The Times, 7 July 1899 p10 However, in view of his breach with the official party Austin is referred to here as an Independent Liberal. =Liberals= The local Liberal Association were divided in loyalty, with some believing Austin‚Äôs record required their support. A meeting at Castleford on 23 June 1899, chaired by Mr Arthur Hartley the chairman of Osgoldcross Liberals, at which Austin declared himself to be a loyal supporter of Liberal leader Sir Henry Campbell- Bannerman, selected Austin as Liberal candidate to fight the by-election.The Times, 24 June 1899 912 However another meeting of Liberals at Pontefract the same day adopted Charles Henry Roberts, the son-in-law of Lady Carlisle, as an Independent Liberal or Radical to contest the seat and this decision was endorsed by a further mass meeting at the Market Hall at Goole later that night, chaired by the president of the Osgoldcross Liberals, Frederick Andrews. Roberts declared that he supported the entire Liberal programme as formulated by William Ewart Gladstone and the meeting endorsed his candidacy saying they wanted a man who was a Liberal ‚Äúall along the line‚Äù.The Times, 24 June 1899 p12 He also described himself as the Local Veto (i.e. pro- temperance) candidate. For this reason, Roberts is described here as the official Liberal candidate. =Others= There had been a history of contested elections in Osgoldcross in recent years. In 1885 there had been a Conservative candidate. In 1886 Austin had taken the seat off the sitting Liberal Unionist MP, and in 1895 another Conservative had tried his luck. However this time, perhaps preferring not to intrude on the private grief of the Liberal Party, no other party put forward a candidate to take advantage of the Liberal split.The Times, 7 July 1899 p10 The result Sir John Austin retained his seat by a clear and comfortable majority, increasing his majority from 1,065 to 2,925, having obtained well over 50% of the poll. It seems likely that Sir John received many votes from Conservative supporters who had no candidate of their own to vote for The Times, 7 July 1899 p9 and who wanted to discomfort the Liberal Party nationally.

Early life and education Deutch was born in southern California, on October 21, 1963. At the age of 11, she was the first girl in California to play in an all-boys Little League team. Deutch obtained a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in Pre-Law and Ethnic Studies from the University of California, Berkeley, a Juris Doctor (J.D.) from Western State University College of Law, and a Master of Laws (LL.M.) from the University of the Pacific, McGeorge School of Law. She was a member of the State Bar of California and the Sacramento County Bar Association. Career In 1991, Deutch launched her law office in a one-bedroom condominium in Sacramento, California and in 2004, the firm was incorporated. She then launched her own retail tax preparation company in 2006 and one year later, she created RDTC, Inc., her tax preparation franchise company, and began selling retail tax preparation franchises under the name \\"Roni Deutch Tax Center.\\" In 2009, Entrepreneur.com listed Roni Deutch Tax Center as one of the fastest growing franchise companies in the country. There are currently around 80 Roni Deutch Tax Center locations in 23 U.S. states, with a concentration in California, Nevada, and Arizona. The national headquarters are in Sacramento. The Professional Tax Corporation focuses on resolving U.S. federal tax issues for people who have problems with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The firm's specialty is facilitating settlements in the IRS programs Offer in Compromise, Installment Agreement, and Currently Not Collectible. Deutch is a frequent columnist and television show guest on matters of taxation and personal finance. She is also the author of The Tax Lady's Guide to Beating the IRS and Saving Big Bucks on Your Taxes. Her second book, Surviving the Coming Tax Disaster, was published in October 2010. Deutch also keeps a blog focusing on fiscal issues as well as her hobbies of baseball and surfing. In 2010, she worked with a SIMZ Productions, a Sacramento-based production company, to film a documentary, \\"Death or Taxes\\". The film focuses in on the American taxation system and several stories of individual taxpayers who when overwhelmed by the debt and IRS collection tactics, took drastic steps - including even suicide - in response. It was received by multiple film festivals and won awards at the Los Angeles Movie Awards and Los Angeles Cinema Festival of Hollywood in 2010 and 2011. =Law practice closed= On May 12, 2011, Deutch announced that she was closing her law practice and that she would be surrendering her license to practice law. The California State Bar announced that it was conducting an investigation of Deutch. She denied allegations made against her by the State of California.Darrell Smith & Dale Kasler, \\"'Tax Lady' Roni Lynn Deutch closes law firm, says she's 'completely broke'\\" May 13, 2011, Sacramento Bee Deutch formally resigned from the California State Bar on May 20, 2011, after the State Bar Court recommended that she be disbarred. Deutch is no longer eligible to practice law. Controversy New York City Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA) brought a lawsuit charging Deutch with misleading advertisements that allegedly fail to include key eligibility requirements in order to resolve back taxes with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) under its Offer in Compromise program. The Offer in Compromise program enables taxpayers to resolve debts by entering into an agreement with the IRS for reduced payments, in which a majority of people do not qualify ‚Äì a fact allegedly not evident in the Deutch advert. In 2006, she agreed to pay $300,000 to settle the lawsuit for deceptive advertising practices. A total of $200,000 was apportioned to affected victims of her deceptive practices, and $100,000 in fines. On August 23, 2010, the office of the Attorney General of California announced that it would be filing a $34 million lawsuit against Deutch for allegedly \\"orchestrating a 'heartless scheme' that swindled thousands of people facing serious and expensive tax collection problems with the IRS.\\" Roni Deutch responded to the charges by stating California Attorney General Jerry Brown is \\"engaging in election year politics\\" (Brown was running for governor in the November 2010 election at the time of the lawsuit, an election he ended up winning) and that she intends to fight the lawsuit. A court in California has frozen all the assets of Roni Deutch. The \\"tax lady\\" as she was known and her company were sued for $34 million by several attorneys general. In April 2011, the California attorney general's office asked a court to hold Roni Deutch in contempt of court and to imprison her for shredding millions of documents and withdrawing money to pay other outstanding debts. In May 2011, her attorney asked to be removed from the case because of nonpayment. Prosecutors state that instead of repaying creditors and former clients, per a recent court order, Deutch withdrew $241,000 from bank accounts and used that money for personal expenses, meanwhile failing to make the $435,000 repayment to the victims of her alleged fraud. On August 7, 2015, the Office of Attorney General announced a settlement of the civil and criminal actions against Deutch. Per the terms of the settlement, the state of California withdrew its criminal contempt of court charges and dismissed its civil lawsuit. In exchange, Deutch agreed to pay a fine of $2.5 million and perform 350 hours of volunteer work.

It was located to the west of the town, on what is now Welsh Row, within the parish of Acton. St Lawrence's later became a hospital for the infirm poor. Dissolved in 1548, the hospital's land and property was purchased by the Wright family. One of its buildings was subsequently used for dwellings. History Few records of the Hospital of St Lawrence remain, and its founder and date of foundation are unknown. It was originally a lazar house or house for lepers, who were not permitted to enter the town.Hall, pp. 53‚Äì54Garton 1983, p. 13 The Hospital of St Lawrence was one of two medieval hospitals in or near Nantwich, the other being the Hospital of St Nicholas at the east of the town. Founded in 1083‚Äì84 at the end of Hospital Street to provide for the needs of travellers, it gave the modern street its name.Garton 1972, pp. 6‚Äì9Hall, pp. 48‚Äì53 The Hospital of St Lawrence is known to have been situated around ¬Ω mile west of the bridge over the River Weaver, well outside the medieval town of Nantwich and then within the adjacent parish of Acton. It stood on a road leading from the town bridge to Lawrence Well, now Welsh Row. Joseph Partridge, author of the first history of Nantwich published in 1774, associated the hospital with an area then occupied by a malthouse (now demolished) adjacent to the former Wilbraham's Almshouses, and it is traditionally considered to have been located on or near the site of the Tollemache Almshouses.Lamberton & Gray, p. 12 However, little or no direct evidence survives as to its precise location. Partridge also states that a priory once existed close to the hospital; no other evidence for such a foundation now survives. Medieval treatment for leprosy involved cleanliness and washing in healing springs, and St Lawrence's was presumably at or near the brine spring known as Lawrence Well. By the late 14th century, leprosy was in decline in Cheshire; in around 1348, at the time of an outbreak of Black Death in the county, St Lawrence's became a hospital for the infirm poor. The first record of the hospital is shortly afterwards in 1354‚Äì5, which states: Local historian Eric Garton considers that the long interruption of services and apparent lack of an incumbent chaplain suggest that the previous chaplain had been a victim of the Black Death. The 1354‚Äì5 document is interpreted by local historian James Hall as stating that Combermere Abbey claimed ownership of St Lawrence's, and Hall believes that a document of 1498‚Äì9 confirms this claimed ownership. Garton considers, however, that this claim is difficult to reconcile with the institution being described as a free Chapel, which would not have been under the jurisdiction of any parent church or abbey. The 1498‚Äì9 document also contains the earliest recorded name of a chaplain, one John ffowler. The right to appoint the hospital's chaplain, or the advowson, had been acquired in part by the Lovell family some time before 1485;Garton, 1972, p. 55 they had also owned the advowson of the Hospital of St Nicholas from around 1350.Hall, pp. 48‚Äì51 It is unknown who was originally responsible for appointing the chaplain. The advowson subsequently passed to the Crown. In 1525, the chaplain was a Doctor Incent. At this date, the hospital's income was described: In 1536, just over a decade before its dissolution, the hospital's income was still estimated at ¬£4.Garton, 1972, p. 63 Dissolution At the dissolution of the Chantries in 1548, the hospital and its chapel closed and became the property of the Crown. At this date, the institution was valued at 76 shillings a year, and was recorded as having bells to the value of 2 shillings, but no plate, jewels, goods, ornaments or lead. The last chaplain was Richard Wright, who was awarded a pension of ¬£3 8s 4d, which he continued to receive until at least 1562; he died in 1585. The Wright family was prominent in Nantwich from the mid-16th century. Wright's will shows him to have been a relatively wealthy man, who is known to have also been the owner of Nantwich's Bell Inn. He was the great-uncle of Sir Edmund Wright, Lord Mayor of London, who founded Wright's Almshouses in the town. The building, lands and possessions of the former hospital were purchased from the Crown on 7 September 1548 by William Warde of London and Richard Venables, sergeant at arms, together with the site of the former Chapel of St James of Newall, also in the parish of Acton, and other properties in Nantwich, for a total of just over ¬£1111. Richard Wright was then the tenant.Garton, 1972, pp. 66‚Äì67 The building, lands and tithes of St Lawrence's appear to have later been purchased by Wright. According to the 1589 post mortem inquisition of his son, also Richard Wright, the hospital's lands included \\"another pasture called Chapel-croft, and half of another pasture called the Chapel-field adjacent, lying in Acton\\".Hall, pp. 486‚Äì8, 493 The tithes were transferred by the younger Wright's daughters and heirs, Margaret Woodnoth and Elizabeth Davenport, to the minister of St Mary's Church in Nantwich on 1 May 1639. One of the buildings of the hospital is mentioned in a document of 1653: \\"a messuage called the Hospitall now divided into three dwellings in/near the Welsh Row in Wich Malbanke\\".

Best known for his work with Ducks Deluxe and Tyla Gang, he also played with Help Yourself, Joan Jett, and Deke Leonard, and appeared solo. Early career He initially toured with Geno Washington & The Ram Jam Band, but made his first record \\"Miracles\\" with a band called Third World (not the reggae band Third World formed in 1973) which was released on CBS in 1970, He also recorded an unreleased album with Maynard Ferguson. Help Yourself In 1971, Tyla became a roadie with Help Yourself, who based their psychedelic instrumental number \\"All Electric Fur Trapper\\" on a fantasy tale Tyla was writing, part of which appeared in the sleeve of their Strange Affair album. He played on Help Yourself's Sounds of the Seventies broadcast and co-wrote \\"American Mother\\" on their Beware the Shadow Album. He also recorded part of their fifth album, recorded in 1973, but the album was shelved until it was finally completed and released as 5 in 2004. Ducks Deluxe In February 1972, Tyla formed Ducks Deluxe, initially with Help Yourself's bassist, the late Ken Whaley, guitarist Martin Belmont and percussionist Michael Cousins. Cousins was replaced by drummer Tim Roper and Nick Garvey also joined. Ducks Deluxe were one of the founding acts of the Pub rock circuit, with more up-tempo, energetic performances than many other pub rock acts. They recorded three albums, made one appearance on The Old Grey Whistle Test and recorded two Peel Sessions. Ducks Deluxe split in 1975. Tyla Gang Following the break-up of Ducks Deluxe, Sean Tyla formed Tyla Gang in late autumn of 1975 with his brother Gary, Phil Nedin (drums) and Peter O'Sullivan (bass) from Welsh band Jack Straw. In the spring of 1976, Richard Treece from Help Yourself joined the band. Within a few months Gary Tyler and Treece left the band and Welshman Tweke Lewis, formerly of Man, became the new guitarist. They went into Pebble Beach studio in Worthing, and under the guidance of producer Tony Platt recorded 6 tracks including \\"Suicide jockey\\" and \\"Cannons of the Boogie Night\\" as well as \\"Styrofoam\\" and \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre Boogie\\". These latter two tracks were released as the \\"double B-side\\" 4th single on the legendary Stiff Records label. Tyla also produced Stiff's eighth single Plummet Airlines' \\"Silver Shirt\\" / \\"This Is The World\\". In April 1977, two further tracks from that session were released (\\"Cannons of the Boogie Night\\" and \\"Suicide Jockey\\") on Skydog records. In 1977 the second Tyla Gang band were formed consisting of guitarist Bruce Irvine, bassist Brian \\"Kid\\" Turrington and drummer Mike Desmarais; Turrington and Desmarais having played together in The Winkies. Although unsigned, the Gang attracted critical attention and played two Peel Sessions in 1977 (30 May and 4 October). They eventually signed a contract with the California-based Beserkley label in 1977 and released their first album, Yachtless in 1978. Reviewing the LP in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau wrote: \\"Punk has not been good for former Duck Deluxe Sean T. because it's meant urbanization. I have nothing against the slick, hooky power chords his pub-rock has evolved into, not in theory. But when his charming if overly mythic tales of fireballs and West Texas running boards evolve into 'The Young Lords' (give me a break, Bruce Springsteen) and 'On the Street' (give me a break, Bob Geldof), I begin to crave recognizable human detail.\\" Part way through recording their next album Moonproof, Turrington left and Whaley joined to finish the album; this line-up recorded a Peel Session on 9 August 1978. Richard Treece also rejoined but Beserkley's UK operation went bankrupt in 1979, and Tyla disbanded the Gang shortly after. In 2010, the Tyla Gang reformed in their original line-up, touring Sweden during the fall. In 2013, they added John McCoy of Gillan and Mammoth fame to replace original member, Brian Turrington who had taken a leave of absence for personal reasons. The Gang have released two albums since their reformation, 2010's \\"Rewired\\", a compilation of lost studio and live recordings and as of 18 March 2013, a new studio album, Stereo Tactics. In 2015 The Tyla Gang released a live set, Live In Stockholm recorded at the Akkurat Bar in Stockholm, Sweden in 2013 on Angel Air Records and will be releasing a 3-CD anthology, Pool Hall Punks through Cherry Red Records in May 2016 to coincide with Sean's 70th Birthday Tour. Solo career Tyla embarked on a solo career, encouraged by Roger Daltrey who allowed him use of The Who's Ramport Studio. He recorded in California with Mike Nesmith and signed a five-album deal with Polydor, although he only released three albums. The first album, Just Popped Out, was recorded with assistance from many musicians, including several former bandmates such as Nick Garvey, Micky Groome, Malcolm Morley, Tim Roper and Pete Thomas. Just Popped Out included Tyla's first US hit single, \\"Breakfast in Marin\\", which also became a top ten single in Germany in 1980, but the single had to be withdrawn after Tyla was sued \\"for supposedly plagiarising the title from a play.\\" Tyla guested on Joan Jett's eponymous 1980 album, re-released as Bad Reputation in 1981, and I Love Rock 'n' Roll in 1981. Tyla's second solo album, Redneck in Babylon (1981), was critically less acclaimed than the first, and used a smaller band comprising Tyla, Paul Simmons, Gerald Moffett, Micky Groome, John Earle, Carlene Carter and Rebop Kwaku Baah, whilst his third album, Rhythm of the Swing, was released in 1983. The Force In 1981, in addition to recording his solo albums, and guesting with Joan Jett, Tyla and Man guitarist Deke Leonard formed The Force, together with Micky Groome (bass) and Paul Simmons (drums). After extensive touring, they recorded an eponymous album, The Force, recorded and released in Germany, and the single \\"Close to a Headline\\". In 1982, Tyla suffered severe stage fright at Dingwalls in Camden \\"in the middle of the set Sean shuffled up to me and whispered in my ear, 'I'm just going off'... When we got backstage Sean was a real mess, said he couldn't face it any more.\\" Tyla stopped performing live and The Force mutated into another Deke Leonard's Iceberg. Tyla retired from the music business in 1985, and became a web-designer. According to his autobiography, he had a spell as a pig farmer and also became a professional cricket coach. Return In 2007, Tyla resumed public performances with a new Gang comprising Vaughan Lonsdale and Mick Yarre (guitars), Dave Rickaby (bass) and Ken Ward (drums). They recorded a CD Back in the Saddle which was released in 2008 on Tyla's own label; Hawkhead Records. Following a move south, another Tyla Gang line up was formed from Bournemouth-based band Relentless, consisting of Howard Gillespie on Lead Guitar and Vocals, Gary Gahan on Bass Guitar and Vocals and Dave Ironside on Drums. This line up performed a limited number of gigs with the intention of touring but it wasn't long before Sean was offered the opportunity to work once more with his former bandmates from Ducks Deluxe. The band also co-wrote two new tunes with Sean. A riff driven comment on modern life called Runaway and a classic Tyla call to arms Lock and Load. There is a live recording of this line up at Mr Kyps taken from the mixing desk and the show was recorded in HD video. Tyla also played with Ducks Deluxe, when they reformed in October 2007, to celebrate the 35th anniversary of their original formation. Tyla rejoining Martin Belmont, Micky Groome and Billy Rankin. The success of this anniversary gig led to further concerts in France and Spain in 2008 and a tour of Sweden in 2009, by when the line up was Tyla and Belmont with bassist Kevin Foster (of Hank Wangford and The Lost Cowboys) and drummer Jim Russell (of Stretch and The Inmates) They released a mini CD of new tracks Box of Shorts in 2009 and a full album, Side Tracks And Smokers in 2010, comprising a mixture of unreleased early recordings and current material. They then released a live set recorded in 2009 in Monte Carlo entitled Riviera Shuffle but this was only available through eBay. A live album, Rockin' At The Moon recorded at the Half Moon in London in September 2012 was released in May 2013 on Mystic Records. Tyla toured with both Tyla Gang and Ducks Deluxe in 2013, but Ducks Deluxe were disbanded \\"for good\\" that Christmas. Tyla, Billy Bremner and 2 Swedish musicians, were founder members of Stockholm-based band Trouble Boys, who released an album Bad Trouble in September 2012, and toured extensively throughout 2013 and 2014. Tyla left the band in 2015. Death Tyla died on 17 May 2020. According to an appreciation by British music journalist Will Birch, Tyla had chronic liver disease. Book Sean Tyla's autobiography Jumpin' In The Fire () was published by Soundcheck Books on 20 October 2010. It features jacket artwork by the famous Stiff Records designer Tobbe Stuhre, and a foreword by Will Birch. The final volume of the autobiography was available in 2016.

It is the home stadium of Bedford Blues. As of 2019 the stadium holds 5,000 people (down from 6,000). The stadium also has two hospitality boxes, \\"The Larry Webb Room\\" and \\"The Lifesure Suite,\\" which can cater for 12 to 20 people respectively in addition to \\"The Blues Marquee.\\" There is one stand (the Charles Wells Stand) with the remaining areas being standing room - There is an uncovered temporary stand in the south east corner of the ground. History Following an amalgamation between Bedford Rovers (1876) and Bedford Swifts (1882), both with connections to Bedford School and Bedford Modern School, there were two main sites where pitches could be made available. One was known as 'The House of Industry' ground in Goldington Road. This was the field in front of the House of Industry -now known as the North Wing Hospital. This is approximately where Bedford play now. The other site was known as Midland Road Ground, an area near the Queen's Park railway bridge. The first matches in 1886‚Äì87 were in Goldington Road, where the Bedford Swifts had played, but during the next few seasons several pitches near the railway station were used. The railway and industry required this land and Bedford Rugby returned to the Goldington Road area before an agreement in 1895 was reached with Bedford Cricket Club who actually held the lease. The pitch was laid out in virtually the same spot as it is now. The First World War threatened the club's existence when the ground was taken over by the Military Authorities for use as an Army Camp. Things did improve very quickly and by the late-1920s and early-1930s further improvements had been made at the ground, the biggest being the stand opened in 1933 which is still in use today. Following intervention by the RFU in October 1999 a consortium of Bedford businessmen headed by David Ledsom (SDC), Geoff Irvine (Irvine- Whitlock), and David Gunner with assistance from Bedford Borough Council and other professional people, the transfer of the club to Bedford Blues Ltd. was organised. Several thousand supporters and businesses in the town bought shares and the club is now viable. Bedford have been playing on virtually the same pitch for over 100 years and 32 players have gained International honours whilst playing for the club at the time of being honoured. Stands The main stand at Goldington Road Towards the end of the 2005‚Äì06 season, two new temporary stands were built for the big home tie against Harlequins, at one point these stands were made a long term part of the stadium, along with the grounds public house and original stand. As of the 2006-07 season the extra stands have been removed. Future With the introduction of the RFU Championship, clubs will benefit from financial input although it is unknown if Bedford will be in a financial situation to improve the ground or meet the entry requirements into the Premiership since its last entry in 2000. Pitch The pitch at Goldington road features a dip in the eastern corner which causes difficulties to visiting teams who struggle to read the surface. Furthermore, there is a gradient again going down from west to east.

Located in the Great Sound, near to the shore of the parish of Pembroke, it was owned by billionaire James Martin, and was historically a secret munitions store, part of the Bermuda Garrison of the British Army. Bermuda had become the primary base, dockyard, and headquarters of the North America and West Indies Squadron of the Royal Navy following the independence of the USA. The British Army had consequently garrisoned and heavily fortified the colony. In the 1790s, when the Royal Navy had begun planning what would become the Royal Naval Dockyard on Ireland Island, it had purchased most of the smaller islands in the Great Sound and Hamilton Harbour. Although the Royal Navy made occasional use of these smaller islands, it was to be the army that would carry out the greatest development on them. Many were used to compose a Prisoner-of-War camp during and after the Second Boer War. Agar's, however, was to see another use. Although the ring of fortresses operated by the Royal Garrison Artillery held munitions stores in their magazines, central supply depots were also operated by the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, which operated a depot on Ordnance Island, dangerously close to the King's Square of St. George's town. In 1870, a secret, underground powder magazine was built on Agar's Island, reputed to be the largest in the world at that time, although the army remained highly secretive of its existence. The magazine still exists, restored by James Martin, although it is not open to the public.The Telegraph: The $100 man: Why philanthropist James Martin gave away his fortunePrivate Island News: Futurist James Martin‚Äôs Historic Bermudan Isle During the final year of the First World War, the United States Navy was permitted to establish a supply station on Agar's Island, as well as a Naval station on White's Island.

It was designed prior to the outbreak of the Second World War to operate from the aircraft carriers of the French Navy, but only a single example was completed, with development ended by France's defeat by Germany in June 1940. Design and development In 1937, the French Air Ministry drew up a specification for a twin-engined torpedo bomber to operate from the French Navy's two planned new aircraft carriers, the Joffre and Painlev√©. The Soci√©t√© nationale des constructions a√©ronautiques du Midi (SNCAM) submitted a design (which was developed by the design team formerly of Dewoitine), that became part of SNCAM when it was established in 1937.Green 1967, p. 23. SNCAM's design, the Dewoitine D.750 was a low-winged monoplane of all-metal stressed skin construction, powered by two Renault 12R air-cooled V12 engines. It was fitted with a retractable tailwheel undercarriage and a twin tail. The fuselage, of similar layout to the competing SNCAO CAO.600 housed the crew of two or three required by the specification in separate cockpits. The bombardier/navigator sat in the nose, with the pilot sitting behind him, above and to the left of the navigator. The radio operator/gunner sat aft of the wing, operating Darne machine guns in dorsal and ventral positions.Green 1967, pp. 23‚Äì24. Operational history Two prototypes of the D.750 were ordered by the French Air Ministry on 26 June 1939, the first example making its maiden flight on 6 May 1940 with SNCAM's chief test pilot Marcel Doret at the controls.Green 1967, p. 24. A few days later, however, Nazi Germany invaded France and the Low countries, and the first prototype had not completed manufacturers tests before France surrendered on 25 June. This caused development of the D.750 to be abandoned, with the second prototype incomplete. Specifications (D.750)  See also Notes References *Green, William.

Early life Kobalia was born in 1981 in Sukhumi in the disputed Georgian region of Abkhazia. In 1996, her family emigrated to Canada because of the instability brought about by the Georgian‚ÄìAbkhazian conflict. She attended King George Secondary School, and subsequently the British Columbia Institute of Technology in Burnaby, British Columbia, where in 2004 she graduated with a degree in business administration and informational technologies. Political career Kobalia lived in Canada until late 2009 where she worked for European Breads Bakery, the Vancouver- based company started by her father in 2001, after which she moved back to Georgia. In February 2010, Kobalia co-founded the Coalition for Justice, an organization dedicated to the preservation of the rights internally displaced persons within Georgia, and to increase public awareness of the problems of Georgian IDPs around the world. In June 2010, Kobalia was appointed by President Mikheil Saakashvili as the Minister of Economy and Sustainable Development in the Cabinet of Georgia, and her appointment was confirmed by the Parliament of Georgia on July 2, 2010. Kobalia said that agriculture and tourism would be the two biggest priority sectors of her tenure, and she vowed to reorganize her department under the slogan \\"no nepotism\\" to help purge institutional corruption in government. Kobalia's appointment raised eyebrows because of Kobalia's young age (she was only 28 at the time of her appointment) and lack of political experience. She first came to President Saakashvili's attention four months before her appointment when a delegation of Vancouver's Georgian community met with the president while he was in town for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. Nodar Javakhishvili, the former head of the Georgian National Bank, was quoted as saying that Kobalia had been appointed \\"without having either the necessary education or any experience whatsoever.\\" Other pundits have noted that President Saakashvili, himself only 36 when he came to power, has a habit of appointing young ministers and openly claims that pulling the younger generation into positions of power is a deliberate strategy to build a new Georgia free from the legacy of Soviet domination. ‚ÄúWorld Economic Forum‚Äù named Minister of Economy and Sustainable Development of Georgia, Vera Kobalia as Young Global Leader 2012.

She has had a notable collaboration with director Bernardo Bertolucci. Early in her career she assisted editor Franco Arcalli on two of Bertolucci's films, Last Tango in Paris (1972) and 1900 (1976). Arcalli was the \\"supervising editor\\" on a 1977 film, Berlinguer, I Love You, that was one of Cristiani's first feature editing credits; the film was directed by Giuseppe Bertolucci - Bernardo's brother. Arcalli was to have edited Bernardo Bertolucci's next film, La Luna (1979), but he died during production; Cristiani, who was assisting, then took over as editor. Cristiani edited Bernardo Bertolucci's 1982 film Tragedy of a Ridulous Man. She won the Academy Award for Best Film Editing for The Last Emperor (1987), which won a total of 9 Oscars (including Best Picture and Best Director (for Bertolucci)) as well as numerous other honors. Cristiani's work on Bertolucci's next film, The Sheltering Sky (1990), is noted for a technical innovation, which was the \\"nonlinear\\" editing of the film using digital techniques.

It was part of the land leased to the United States Government in 1941 for ninety-nine years for the construction of the Naval Operating Base Bermuda, a joint shipping base and naval air station. Morgan's Island was joined by infilling to nearby Tucker's Island, and the two were connected to the Main Island by a narrow infilling, creating a peninsula. The base, by then designated the Naval Air Station Bermuda Annex, was closed in 1995 along with other US bases in Bermuda. After a delay while the issue of toxic waste deposits was argued between the British/Bermudian and US Governments, the land was handed back to the Government of Bermuda and allowed to return to nature pending the clean-up of toxins and a decision on its future. The only user of the area was the Royal Bermuda Regiment, which had begun training there when it was still a US base. Following public outrage at plans to develop a Jumeirah resort hotel at Southlands, then a wooded private estate on the South Shore, the government traded the former US naval base to the developers in exchange for Southlands, most of which was designated as parkland. Morgan's Point, as the former naval base is now called, is currently being cleared to make way for the new resort.Morgan‚Äôs Point land swap deal signed. By Sam Strangeways.

It was a herbivore about in length, and was optionally quadrupedal.  Description  Chromogisaurus was first named by Mart√≠n Daniel Ezcurra in 2010, and the type species is Chromogisaurus novasi. The generic name is derived from Greek chroma, \\"colour\\", and g√®, \\"earth\\", a reference to the Valle Pintado, the \\"Painted Valley\\". The specific name honours Fernando Emilio Novas. The holotype, PVSJ 845, was found in the Cancha de Bochas Member of the Ischigualasto Formation, dating to the Carnian. This makes Chromogisaurus one of the oldest known dinosaurs. The specimen consists of a partial skeleton lacking the skull, with elements of the front and hind limbs, as well as the pelvis and two caudal vertebrae. A cladistic analysis by Ezcurra indicated that Chromogisaurus was a member of a clade basal sauropodomorphs, the Guaibasauridae, together with Guaibasaurus, the disputed Agnosphitys, Panphagia and Saturnalia. Within Guaibasauridae, it forms a smaller clade with its sister taxon Saturnalia, the Saturnaliinae.

From its foundation in 1955 through the 1980s it was an elite club producing numerous national and Olympic champions. For a time in the 1970s it was called the Tobias Striders for sponsorship reasons. From the 1990s to 2006 the club was restricted to masters athletics and still produces national champions in older age classes. After 2006 it became a nonprofit open to all ages. History The club was formed originally in the fall of 1955 by five elite athletes; Olympic multiple Gold Medalists Mal Whitfield, George Rhoden, silver medalist Meredith C.\\"Flash\\" Gourdine, NCAA Champions Lang Stanley, and George Brown. In its day it laid claim to being \\"largest and strongest multiracial track-and- field club in the history of the sport.\\" They were also called a collection \\"America‚Äôs finest Olympic Track and Field Stars.\\"http://www.johnborksales.com/new_page_4.htm Between 1957 and 1965 the team won 8 AAU National Team Championshipshttp://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/HELMS/Track/HelmsTrackAnnual1965.pdf LA 84 by attracting a who's who of elite track athletes of the day. Among the people to wear the Striders uniform were: Rafer Johnson, Ralph Boston, Bill Toomey, Mike Larrabee, Bob Seagren John Rambo, John Smith, Fortune Gordien, Ronnie Ray Smith, Larry Stewart, Marshall Clark, Otis Burrell, Charles Dumas, Ed Caruthers, Bob Avant, Leon Coleman, Don Quarrie, Adolph Plummer, Chuck Smith, Ulis Williams, Rex Cawley, Wayne Collett, Ralph Mann,http://www.legacy.usatf.org/statistics/champions/OlympicTrials/HistoryOfTheOlympicTrials.pdf Ron Whitney, Geoff Vanderstock, Jim Cerveny, Jim Dupree, Jerome Walters, Bob Seaman, Paul Wilson, Ron Morris, Dick Railsback, John Pennel, Dave Volz, Art Walker, Parry O'Brien, Dallas Long, Peter ShmockPete Shmock at Sports Reference Rink Babka, Ben Plucknett, Ed Burke, Hal Connolly Larry Young, Mike Manley and Max Truex. All (listed) were USA National Champions, most were also Olympians across the full range of disciplines in the sport. The last of these National Champions appears to be Ben Plucknett, winning his championship in 1981. Plucknett set the still standing United States record in the Discus while wearing the Southern California Striders uniform. At the 1978 Sun Devil Relays, USC Trojans set a 4 √ó 200 m world record (1m 20.26s) despite losing to the Tobias Striders: the Striders' mark (1m 20.23s) was ineligible as a record because the team was of mixed nationality: Guy Abrahams (Panama), Michael Simmons (USA), Don Quarrie (Jamaica), and James Gilkes (Guyana). By 1980 Tobias Striders had absorbed Angel's Flight Striders and resumed the name SoCal Striders. With the egalitarian attitude professed at its inception, the team catered almost exclusively to male athletes. This is because in the era of their successes, prior to Title IX, women athletes were not common and usually segregated. The President of the Striders during the 60's was Dr. Jerry Bornstein, who put together a team of fellow doctors to provide medical care, and sometimes airline tickets, for the athletes out of their own pockets. Doctors Whitmore, Silver, Mels and Barnes and trainer Paul Schechter were part of this team. Now retired, Dr. Bornstein continues to be involved in sports medicine leading the team of athletic trainers at LAUSD sporting events. Just as the team had the finest talent, it also attracted the finest coaches. Several people have laid claim to coaching the team. Charlie Coker joined in 1962. Joe Mangan also coached for the team. Later John Bork became the Coach and Athletic Director Other coaches and managers included Pete Petersons, Hank Erlich, Carl Ito, and Whitey Taylor. The club continues today, primarily in Masters track and field, though some elite athletes continue to represent the team. The club now has a sizable female membership and the club's president for the better part of a decade was female Masters World Champion Brenda Matthews.http://www.world-masters- athletics.org/files/results/Kamkoops_Results_2010.htm The club hosts an annual meet, the Southern California Striders Meet of Champions.

The book collects several fishing stories and was first published by Harper Brothers and was later republished in 1990 by Derrydale Press. In the book Grey describes catching a marlin weighing 1,040 pounds and the catch was credited as being the first 1,000 pound fish ever caught. Keith Elliott of The Independent called Tales of Tahitian Waters along with Tales of Swordfish and Tuna, and Tales of Fishing Virgin Seas \\"even today, among the finest works on big-game fishing\\". Synopsis Tales of Tahitian Waters describes Grey's fishing expeditions to the Tahitian Islands in 1928, 1929, and 1930. In the book, Grey claims to be the first big game fisherman to fish these waters and there is little cause to doubt his claim. He had passed through Tahiti en route to other fishing expeditions in Australia and New Zealand, and had heard of marlin and sharks. Grey held many fishing records for these species and was determined to pursue these fish. In Tales of Tahitian Waters, he claims a special affection for these waters, and he visited them several times afterward, although those visits were not the subject of this book. Grey believed that these were the most difficult waters he had fished. Amongst other trials, Tales of Tahitian Waters records an 83-day span during which Grey did not catch a single billfish. It is believed that this provided inspiration for Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea.This claim is made in the cover notes to the 1990 reprint, written by Grey's son Loren. Carlton Jackson wrote in his 1989 book Zane Grey: > On the eighty-fourth day, he caught, with rod and reel, a giant Tahitian > marlin that weighed 1,040 founds. Although Grey tried desperately to get the > creature ashore, the fish was ravaged by a shark. Some Grey fans today > credit Grey's experience with inspiring Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea. > See Zane Grey, Tales of Tahitian Waters (1931), and The Zane Grey Collector, > 3:1:12‚Äì13. Grey's Tahiti expeditions were months at a time, and he built a permanent camp at Vairao, a beach he describes in superlatives. Tales of Tahitian Waters also includes descriptions of a number of previously uncatalogued species, some of which Grey caught and recorded, some of which were hooked but were too big to bring to the boat, and some of which were merely seen in the water. The book includes many photographs taken by Grey and his crew, as well as a few watercolors painted by artists who stayed at Grey's fishing camp.

The film is based upon the 1989 novel Daddy written by Danielle Steel.  Plot  Oliver Watson has never been luckier: he is a successful advertising executive, shares a marriage of eighteen years with Sarah, and has three loving kids: 17-year-old Ben, 15-year-old Melissa, and 9-year-old Sam. His perfect life suddenly falls apart when his wife Sarah announces that she wants to enter a graduate school 200 miles away from home, as she regrets that she gave up her bohemian protester's life and promising writing career to become the wife of a conservative traditionalist. A devastated Oliver tries to prevent her from going and even offers to move with her, but Sarah has made up her mind: she will enroll in college and does not want any company. The children are just as displeased when they find out about their mother's decision, for which Ben and Melissa hold their father responsible. They start acting out as a reaction, which mostly affects Ben. Instead of attending classes and getting good grades, he spends most of his time with promiscuous teenager Bobbi Carver, whom he impregnates. Meanwhile, Oliver unsuccessfully tries to save his marriage, until Sarah announces that she is seeing someone else. Meanwhile, his mother's health is worsening, and after months of being kept alive through machines, his father George decides to pull the plug. At the funeral, Sarah shows up to reveal her plans on filing for divorce. Feeling that his life has no purpose there anymore, Oliver accepts a job in Los Angeles. Melissa and Sam move with him, but Ben stays behind with Bobbi and their newly-born son Alexander. In California, Oliver falls in love with Charlotte Sampson, a successful actress in a popular TV series who dreams of a Broadway career. After a short romance, during which she also connects with the children, they become engaged. However, when she is offered a role on Broadway, Oliver fears the past will repeat itself. Rather than seeing his partner slip away due to a long distance relationship, he breaks off their engagement. Meanwhile, Bobbi has suddenly left Ben and took Alexander with her. Desperate, Ben turns to Oliver, and together they fight successfully for sole custody. Afterwards, Ben visits Charlotte, and finds out that she has rejected the Broadway role. Although she is still mad at Oliver for cutting her out of his life, she agrees on visiting him, and they reconcile in the end.

West Virginia, 217 U.S. 1 (1910), is a 9-to-0 ruling by the United States Supreme Court which held that the boundary between the American states of Maryland and West Virginia is the south bank of the North Branch Potomac River.. The decision also affirmed criteria for adjudicating boundary disputes between states, which said that decisions should be based on the specific facts of the case, applying the principles of law and equity in such a way that least disturbs private rights and title to land. Background On June 20, 1632, Charles I, King of England, made a land grant in North America to Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore which became the Province of Maryland (later the state of Maryland). This grant set the boundary of Maryland at the low-water mark of the southern bank of the Potomac River.Scott, James Brown. Judicial Settlement of Controversies Between States of the American Union. Oxford, England: Oxford University Press, 1919, p. 473; Risjord, Norman K. Jefferson's America, 1760-1815. Lanham, Md.: Rowman & Littlefield, 2002, p. 217. On September 27, 1688, King James II made a land grant in North America to Thomas Colepeper, 2nd Baron Colepeper which became the Colony of Virginia (later the commonwealth of Virginia).Harrison, Fairfax. Virginia Land Grants: A Study of Conveyancing in Relation to Colonial Politics. Westminster, Md.: Willow Bend Books, 1998, p. 75. This grant designated \\"the Potomac River\\" as the boundary of Virginia.Whyte, W. Pinkney and Jones, Isaac D. Boundary Line Between the States of Maryland and Virginia. Before the Honorable Jeremiah S. Black, Honorable William A. Graham, and Honorable Charles J. Jenkins, Arbitrators Upon the Boundary Line Between the States of Virginia and Maryland. Baltimore, Md.: 1874, p. 75. The conflicting grants led to a long- running border dispute between Maryland and Virginia. The two states settled navigational and riparian water rights in a compact in 1785, but the boundary dispute continued.Scott, James Brown. Judicial Settlement of Controversies Between States of the American Union. Oxford, England: Oxford University Press, 1919, p. 484.Zimmerman, Joseph F. Interstate Disputes: The Supreme Court's Original Jurisdiction. Albany, N.Y.: State University of New York, 2006, p. 131-132.The success of the compact led directly to calls for hold a series of meetings to improve the Articles of Confederation, then the constitutional document of the United States. This meeting turned into the Philadelphia Convention, which subsequently drafted the United States Constitution. See: Dellapenna, Joseph W. \\"Transboundary Water Allocation in the Twenty-First Century: Colloquiam Article: Interstate Struggles Over Rivers: The Southeastern States and the Struggle Over 'Hooch.\\" New York University Environmental Law Journal. 12:828 (2005), p. 867, n.216. Maryland entered into a separate dispute with Virginia regarding the placement of its true southern boundary in the west. The land grant given to Lord Baltimore stated that the Potomac River to its headwaters was to be the southern boundary of Maryland.Wroth, Lawrence C. \\"The Story of Thomas Cresap, A Maryland Pioneer.\\" Maryland Historical Magazine. March 1914, p. 34]; Arnett, Earl; Brugger, Robert J.; and Papenfuse, Edward C. Maryland: A New Guide to the Old Line State. Baltimore, Md.: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1999, p. 586. From that point, a north-south meridian set the state's western border. At that time no one realized that the Potomac River split into a North Branch and South Branch just east of Green Spring in what is now Hampshire County, West Virginia. The South Branch extended westward for many more miles than the North Branch. The question arose as to which branch constituted the main branch of the Potomac River. For many years, the North Branch was considered the main bed of the river, and Maryland's southern boundary was set there.Clark, William Bullock. The Geography of Maryland. Baltimore, Md.: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1918, p. 46.] In 1746, Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron sent a party of surveyors to find the headwaters of the Potomac River.Conway, Moncure Daniel. Barons of the Potomack and the Rappahannock. New York: Grolier Club, 1892, p. 235-236. On October 23, 1746, they located what they believed to be the headwaters at what is now Fairfax Stone Historical Monument State Park. They carved the letters \\"Ffx\\" and Lord Fairfax's coronet into a large pyramidal rock and placed it at the center of these headwaters.Ogilvie, Philip W. Along the Potomac. Charleston, S.C.: Arcadia, 2000, p. 11. In 1748, the Fairfax Stone and the meridian north of it were approved by the Virginia House of Burgesses and the King in Council as the boundary between Virginia and Maryland.Kercheval, Samuel; Faulkner, Charles James; and Jacob, John Jeremiah. A History of the Valley of Virginia. Woodstock, Va.: W.N. Grabill, 1902, p. 165.] The Maryland Assembly passed legislation in April 1787 to formally establish this north-south meridian. Francis Deakins was appointed surveyor, and in 1788 established what became known as the \\"Deakins line.\\" The Deakins line became the de facto border of Maryland. Unfortunately, the Deakins line was not straight, and it was not a true meridian but rather drifted to the east (intersecting the border with Pennsylvania about three-quarters of a mile east of where it should have done).Morton, Oren Frederic and Cole, J.R. A History of Preston County, West Virginia. Kingwood, W.Va.: Journal Publishing Co., 1914, p. 162. The current Fairfax Stone (a replacement for the vandalized and worn original). Maryland and Virginia passed legislation in the early 1850s asking the federal government's help in establishing the true border in the area. In 1859, the United States Secretary of War John B. Floyd ordered Lieutenant Nathaniel Michler of the United States Army Corps of Topographical Engineers to establish a true meridian boundary.Morton and Cole, A History of Preston County, West Virginia, 1914, p. 162-163. Virginia refused to accept this line as the true boundary, arguing that the Deakins line had long been accepted as the border between the two states. In the interim, both states had been busy creating counties in the area and selling this land to private citizens. The state of Virginia created Monongalia County in 1776 out of what was then the unincorporated territory of the District of West August.Newman, Betty Cunningham. Adam and 500 More Cunninghams of the Valley of Virginia, c. 1734-c. 1800. Bowie, Md.: Heritage Books, 2000, p. 253. In 1780, two parts of then-Augusta County were also added to Monongalia County. In 1818, the Virginia state legislature created Preston County out of a portion of Monongalia County.Morton and Cole, A History of Preston County, West Virginia, 1914, p. 10. The state of Maryland in 1789 created Allegany County from a portion of Washington County, and then split Garrett County off from Allegany County in 1872. Each state claimed the narrow triangular strip of land between them, leaving landowners in the area angry and confused. During the American Civil War, Virginia attempted to secede from the United States in 1861 over the issue of slavery. Voters in 41 northwestern counties of Virginia (including Preston County) voted to secede from Virginia the same year, and in 1863 the new state of West Virginia was admitted into the union with the United States.Rice, Otis K. and Brown, Stephen Wayne. West Virginia: A History. Lexington, Ky.: University Press of Kentucky, 1993, p. 113-114, 116-123, 140-153. Virginia challenged both actions in the U.S. Supreme Court after the war ended, but the Court ruled in West Virginia's favor in Virginia v. West Virginia, 78 U.S. 39 (1870). The new state of West Virginia also claimed the old Deakins line as its true boundary with Maryland. On October 12, 1891, the state of Maryland filed suit against the state of West Virginia to settle a dispute regarding the nature of the true boundary between Garrett County, Maryland, and Preston County, West Virginia. By now, the South Branch had been determined to be the main source of the Potomac River, and Maryland began to claim the South Branch as its true southern boundary. In 1897, the state of Maryland appointed a team of surveyors to locate the headwaters of the South Branch of the Potomac River. A marker named the \\"Potomac Stone\\" was placed there, and a new survey line north to the Pennsylvania border established, which Maryland claimed as its new border.Teter, Don and Green, John L. \\"Finding the Potomac Stone.\\" The American Surveyor. 10:10 (September 27, 2013). Accessed 2013-10-24. Opinion of the Court Associate Justice William R. Day wrote the decision for the unanimous Court. Justice Day wrote extensively about the background of the boundary dispute, which was detailed, lengthy, complex, and fact-specific.Maryland v. West Virginia, 217 U. S. at 22-38. Justice Day dismissed Maryland's claim to the South Branch and the meridian running north of the Potomac Stone, as the state of Maryland had not pressed the issue in its briefs and arguments before the Court.Maryland v. West Virginia, 217 U. S. at 24. As to whether the Deakins line or Michler line was the correct meridan, Justice Day conceded that the Michler line more truly reflected the intent of the land grant to Lord Baltimore.Maryland v. West Virginia, 217 U. S. at 26. But Day also noted that maps in that era were inaccurate at best, and little surveying of the land had been done. The location of the Fairfax Stone, however, was known and clearly had been referred to as a boundary marker by both states.Maryland v. West Virginia, 217 U. S. at 30-35. Indeed, the constitution of Maryland even referred to it as such.Maryland v. West Virginia, 217 U. S. at 31. Day concluded that custom and law both accorded the Deakins line the status of official boundary, even if the state of Maryland routinely contested that line as such.Maryland v. West Virginia, 217 U. S. at 38. \\"...the evidence contained in this record leaves no room to doubt that after the running of the Deakins line the people of that region knew and referred to it as the line between the state of Virginia and the state of Maryland.\\" Day cited numerous examples in which both states and the people of both states treated the Deakins line as the boundary between the two states.Maryland v. West Virginia, 217 U. S. at 39-41. Such evidence determined the true boundary under principles of equity, Day said. He referred to Virginia v. Tennessee, 148 U.S. 503 (1893), and quoted the holding in that case:\\"'...a boundary line ... which has been run out, located, and marked upon the earth, and afterwards recognized and acquiesced in by the parties for a long course of years, is conclusive, even if it be ascertained that it varies somewhat from the courses given in the original grant...'\\"Maryland v. West Virginia, 217 U. S. at 41-42, quoting Virginia v. Tennessee, 148 U.S. 503, 522-523. Day traced the lineage of this decision rule back through Penn v Baltimore (1750), State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 37 U.S. 657 (1838), State of Rhode Island v. State of Massachusetts, 45 U.S. 591 (1846), State of Indiana v. State of Kentucky, 136 U.S. 479 (1890), and State of Louisiana v. State of Mississippi, 202 U.S. 1 (1906). Day acknowledged Maryland's attempts over the past 150 years to dispute the boundary. But he concluded that Maryland's legislative statements were unpersuasive in the face of a de facto boundary treated as such by landowners. \\"True it is, that, after the running of the Deakins line, certain steps were taken, intended to provide a more effectual legal settlement and delimitation of the boundary. But none of these steps were effectual, or such as to disturb the continued possession of the people claiming rights up to the boundary line.\\"Maryland v. West Virginia, 217 U. S. at 44. Citing State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts again, Day noted that \\"a right in its nature prescriptive has arisen, practically undisturbed for many years, not to be overthrown without doing violence to principles of established right and justice equally binding upon states and individuals.\\" As for West Virginia's cross-claim that its boundary was the high-water mark on the far shore of the Potomac River, Day found Morris v. United States, 174 U.S. 196 (1899), conclusive and dismissed the claim. He held that Maryland's border ran to the low-water mark on the southern bank of the river.Maryland v. West Virginia, 217 U. S. at 45-46. The majority held that a commission of surveyors should be appointed to permanently mark the Deakins line from the Fairfax Stone to the Pennsylvania border.Maryland v. West Virginia, 217 U. S. at 45, 46-47. Subsequent developments The Supreme Court appointed a team of surveyors to survey the new boundary, and establish it by placing granite slabs every half-mile.Morton and Cole, A History of Preston County, West Virginia, 1914, p. 163. In Maryland v. West Virginia, 225 U.S. 1, decided May 2, 1912, the Supreme Court accepted the report of the commissioners, overruled in a per curiam decision the exceptions filed by the state of Maryland, and ordered the boundary set. The case clearly established that West Virginia's riparian water rights to the Potomac River are the same as Virginia's, as established in Morris v. United States.. However, in New Jersey v. New York, 523 U.S. 767 (1998), the U.S. Supreme Court held that a state can acquiesce in the regulation of its water rights by another state and still maintain its sovereign authority over those rights only so long as it protests the regulation. In Virginia v. Maryland, 540 U.S. 56 (2003), the Court dealt with a situation in which the state of Virginia sought to exercise its riparian rights over the Potomac River. Maryland statute and regulation did not permit this exercise of rights, and Virginia sued. The U.S. Supreme Court held that Virginia had maintained its sovereignty over its riparian rights by continuously protesting Maryland's assertion of jurisdiction. This has led some legal observers to conclude that West Virginia, too, must begin protesting Maryland's assertion of regulatory jurisdiction in order for West Virginia to maintain sovereignty over its riparian rights. The Supreme Court in Maryland v. West Virginia also applied a legal principle known as \\"prescription\\" to the boundary dispute. The concept of prescription is based on the idea that a state or individual's uninterrupted possession to land creates a claim on that land.Dixon, Martin. Modern Land Law. Florence, Ky.: Routledge Cavendish, 2005, p. 263-264. The assumption of the courts has been that a state or person will seek to possess that which is his, and that silence and/or neglect to regain possession indicates the original owner's intent to relinquish the land. Maryland v. West Virginia is considered a classic case where the doctrine of prescription is applied.. Although some legal scholars have attempted to provide criteria which would trigger prescription (e.g., 50 years of uninterrupted possession), in Maryland v. West Virginia the Supreme Court held that such decisions must be intensively fact-specific.. Maryland v. West Virginia is also a classic case of the high court applying the legal rule of de minimis non curat lex. This Latin phrase translates into English as \\"the law does not concern itself with trifles.\\" The de minimis rule was commonly used by the U.S. Supreme Court in the 19th century in areas such as contract, admiralty, and property law.. The de minimis rule was used in Maryland v. West Virginia as well, and this is considered one of the most important uses of the rule in the early 20th century. See also * Morris v.

It was released in North America on August 16, 2002. Gameplay The yeti battles with a police officer on a street. The plot of Urban Yeti! focuses on a yeti's quest to find a yeti mate in a large city populated with humans. The game plays from a top- down perspective similar to the early Grand Theft Auto games. The player must make their way through the city in order to come across missions, which take the form of separate minigames, such as when the yeti must get a job in order to earn the money to pay a toll to cross a bridge. As the yeti walks around the city, he is attacked by townspeople and must try to avoid being killed. The game features four minigames and four missions to complete. Once minigames are completed, the player is unable to go back and play them again unless they type in the password for the section of the game they are in. Reception Urban Yeti! received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the game's humor but criticized its technical problems. On Metacritic it has a score of 67% based on 6 reviews. GameRankings gives it a score of 68.71%.

The first major activity organized was the Work Horse Parade held on Memorial Day in 1907 in New York City. In 1909 the Women's Auxiliary decided to establish a dispensary and out-patient clinic for all animals whose owners could not afford to pay for medical treatment. The clinic opened in 1910 on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Veterinarians volunteered their services on a part-time basis. The clinic treated 6,028 animals in the first full year. On May 12, 1910, the Women's Auxiliary separated from the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and they incorporated themselves as the \\"New York Women's League for Animals\\". The \\"Hospital of the New York Women's League for Animals\\" was established in 1914 at 350 Lafayette Street in New York City with Bruce Blair as the resident veterinarian . The hospital was renamed the Ellin Prince Speyer Free Hospital for Animals in 1921 after the death of the founder. In 1959 the League voted to change the name to the \\"Animal Medical Center\\".

The battle took place over two days and was a result of increasing tensions between the Mughal government and Guru Hargobind. Background After persecution from the Mughal government the Sikhs began organizing regular training exercises and became a rallying point for people disaffected by the Mughals. Increasing tensions erupted during a clash between a group of Sikh and Mughal hunting parties. On Bhaisaki day, a hunting party of Sikhs set their hawk upon a royal hawk and brought it down. When the Mughal hunting party came to retrieve their hawk they used abusive language and the Sikhs then refused to part with it. This altercation led to blows and the Mughals were forced to leave after their party suffered losses. The incident with the hunting parties was used as an excuse to send out 7,000 soldiers with Mukhlis Khan to attack Guru Hargobind. The Sikhs were unprepared to face the Mughal force because of the impending marriage of Guru Hargobind's daughter. Battle The battle took place at Amritsar over two days. The day before the Mughals attacked, the Sikhs received information that they would be attacking and evacuated Lohgarh, a small mud fort on the outskirts of the city, except for a small garrison. On the first day, the Mughals overwhelmed the garrison at Lohgarh but did not get further. The Mughal force also attacked the house where Guru Hargobind had been staying but did not find anything because it had been evacuated earlier. The second day of the battle saw fierce fighting where Khalsa College, Amritsar is located now. Bhai Bhanno was killed in the fighting and Guru Hargobind took up command when he died. The battle ended when Mukhlis Khan's head was \\"cleft in twain\\" by a blow from Guru Hargobind. Aftermath This was the second conflict between the Mughals and Sikhs and legitimized the affirmation of Guru Hargobind's efforts to militarize his followers. In addition, the Sikh victory destroyed the idea of Mughal invincibility and increased the Guru's support among peasants in Punjab.

The SPCS is a lighter alternative to the IOTV, with increased mobility and comfort.  History  In 2009 the U.S. Army began testing various commercial, off-the- shelf plate carriers for issuing to troops deploying to Afghanistan as a lighter and more comfortable alternative to the IOTV. The KDH Defense Systems Magnum TAC-1 plate carrier was chosen over other competitors. An initial contract worth $18.6 million was signed with KDH for 57,000 plate carriers. Contractors include KDH Defense Systems (first generation), and Carter Enterprises (second generation).  Design  Ballistic protection is provided by the Small Arms Protective Insert (SAPI) family of plates (also used in the IOTV), and soft armor behind the plates. Enhanced Side Ballistic Insert (ESBI) plates can be optionally attached with soft armor behind them as well. Initially the SPCS offered only a side plate pouch, however a cummerbund is now available as an alternative. Alternatively, a set of straps can be use in place of the side plate pouch and cummerbund if no side armor or MOLLE webbing is needed. The standard IOTV groin protector and lower back protector can be optionally mounted. Several sizes of the SPCS are available, and the fitting can be adjusted using the friction adapters on the cummerbund and padded shoulder straps. Modular Lightweight Load-carrying Equipment (MOLLE) webbing is located on the front and back pieces, and also the cummerbund/side plate pouch for mounting a variety of pouches and equipment. A quick release cable is located on the front of the collar for rapidly doffing the vest in an emergency. Initially the SPCS was issued in the Universal Camouflage Pattern, which was later replaced with MultiCam. A medium SPCS with ESAPI and ESBI plates weighs about 22 pounds. An improved version of the SPCS known as the Generation II features a completely new quick release system based on that of the Generation III IOTV, which uses 4 buckles (2 for the shoulder straps, and 2 to connect each cummerbund to the front carrier) connected to the quick release handle with a steel cable. This results in quicker doffing, easier reassembly and more options for taking the plate carrier on and off.

The point marks the western limit (on the English side) of the Bristol Channel with the Atlantic Ocean continuing to the west. Trinity House, the lighthouse authority for England and Wales, have a lighthouse on the tip of the peninsula. History Drawing of the lighthouse, dating from 1884. Designed by Sir James Douglass, construction began in November 1873 by contractor Mr Yerward of Wales under the supervision of resident engineer Henry Norris, Douglass and Norris having completed Souter Lighthouse in 1871. The tower is tall with the lamp being above mean sea level. It was blessed by Frederick Temple, Bishop of Exeter, who later became Archbishop of Canterbury, and the light was lit for the first time by Lady Stucley of Hartland Abbey during the opening ceremony on 1 July 1874. The optic, a first-order rotating catadioptric array designed by James Chance, had been installed earlier that year. It flashed alternately red and white, the pattern being two white flashes followed by one red flash every thirty seconds. The optic had ruby glass panels mounted over three of its nine lens panels, these panels being around double the width of the other six (to compensate for the loss of intensity of light passing through coloured glass). The light could be seen up to away from the coast. The lighthouse was initially provided with a reed fog signal, sounding once every two minutes, which was replaced by a two-tone fog siren later in the 19th century; both installations were powered by caloric engines. In 1911 this was replaced with a new reed horn, and oil engines replaced the caloric ones. The fog signal was sounded from a small building a little to the north-west of the lighthouse. The lighthouse was built with accommodation for four keepers and their families; it was protected by a long sea wall which was built in 1925 to prevent erosion of the rocks on which it stands. The large concrete structures immediately to the south of the lighthouse were to provide the keepers with fresh water. The light was electrified in 1927, when the optic was replaced by a biform (i.e. two-tier) third-order sextuple-flashing rotating catadioptric optic, designed and built by Chance Brothers; the light had a range of and displayed six quick flashes in 7.5 seconds. It was lit by two 3 kW filament lamps, one on each tier (the lower lamp was fitted to a turntable lamp changer, which automatically lit a standby lamp (either electric or acetylene) in the event of a bulb or power failure). At the same time a new diaphone fog signal was installed, sounding three blasts every 75 seconds. In January 1959 the lighthouse was connected to mains electricity; the generator formerly in use was retained for emergency use. Some years afterwards the fog diaphone was replaced with an LIE300 electric horn. The lighthouse in 2012. The tower was automated in 1984 and controlled from Trinity House Operations Centre at Harwich in Essex. The keepers' dwellings have since been demolished to make room for a Helipad to be constructed. This was necessary due to the precarious nature of the access road which is liable to frequent rock falls and landslips. Vehicular access is now very difficult and the gates tend to remain locked. The fog signal was discontinued in 2010. Having carried out a thorough assessment of the requirements for Aids to Navigation off Hartland Point, Trinity House determined that the light at this location could be reduced to a nominal range of 8 nautical miles. This light can be more economically provided by a modern LED beacon in front of the original lighthouse, with no detriment to the safety of the Mariner. Consequently, the old light was decommissioned in 2012. The Lighthouse was marketed and sold by Trinity House at a ¬£500,000 guide price, consisting of \\"the former lighthouse, three bedroom living accommodation over two storeys, various stores, a helipad and access via a surfaced road that leads up the cliff to the gated entrance. The site in total amounts to about 16 acres of cliff and coastline, and has the best sea views in the area.\\" See also * List of lighthouses in England References External links * Trinity House Category:Lighthouses completed in 1874 Category:Hartland, Devon Category:Lighthouses in Devon Category:Bristol Channel Category:Grade II listed buildings in Devon Category:Grade II listed lighthouses ","title":"Hartland Point Lighthouse"},{"id":"28214913","text":"Chaim Kiewe, 1975 Chaim Kiewe (Hebrew: ◊ó◊ô◊ô◊ù ◊ß◊ô◊ï◊î; born October 8, 1912 in Dlottowen, German Empire ‚Äì died May 12, 1983 in Bat Yam, Israel) was an Israeli artist.

She had recently inherited the agricultural fields now known as Bloomsbury from her father. Francis Russell, 5th Duke of Bedford (1765‚Äì1802) came of age in 1786. He was a spendthrift gambler, with an interest in farming on the Woburn estate. However, he was not interested in Bedford House in Bloomsbury, instead living in the West End. In 1800, the contents of Bedford House were put up for auction and the house was demolished. It was replaced by a wide avenue, Bedford Place, leading north to the large Russell Square, with Montague Street running parallel to the west. Francis Russell commissioned James Burton, the pre-eminent property developer of Georgian London, to develop the land into a residential area in which Russell Square would be the focal point, and which would be landscaped by Humphrey Repton, who had impressed Francis Russell with his work on the Woburn estate. The development of Bloomsbury was continued by Francis Russell's brother, John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford (1766‚Äì1839). The firm of Thomas Cubitt (1788‚Äì1855) were involved towards the end of the development. Eventually, the entire estate north of Russell Square was filled with squares and houses. John Russell was also responsible for the building of the Covent Garden Market to the south of the main estate.The Bedford Estate: Covent Garden and the seven acres in Long Acre. In F. H. W. Sheppard (editor), Survey of London: volume 36: Covent Garden, pages 19‚Äì21. British History, English heritage, 1970. Herbrand Russell, 11th Duke of Bedford (1858‚Äì1940) succeeded to the title in 1893. By then, there was a move against the owners of large estates. Herbrand Russell began to sell off the estates under his control. The sale contract for Covent Garden was signed in 1914 and finalised with Sir Thomas Beecham (1879‚Äì1961) in 1918.  The Bedford Estates  The British Museum and the University of London replaced large parts of the estate and the remnants are owned by The Bedford Estates,What we do , The Bedford Estates, , Bloomsbury, London, UK. mainly residential property that has been converted for office and hotel use, together with private residential property. The company is the largest private landowner in Bloomsbury and is managed from the Bedford Office in Montague Street, within the estate.  Geography  The main Bedford Estate originally extended between Tottenham Court Road, Euston Road, Southampton Row, and New Oxford Street. There were also two separate parts on the other side of Tottenham Court Road and Euston Road. To the south, the Covent Garden Estate north of the Strand was also part of the Bedford Estate. Garden squares in the main Bedford Estate include: * Bedford Square * Bloomsbury Square * Gordon Square * Russell Square * Tavistock Square * Torrington Square * Woburn Square In the northern separate part of the Bedford Estate is Harrington Square.

Engraving by Charles Barbant The 1881 Chios earthquake occurred at 13:40 local time (11:30 UTC) on 3 April. It caused severe damage on the island of Chios and also affected √áe≈üme and Ala√ßatƒ± on the coast of Turkey. The earthquake had an estimated magnitude of 7.3 and there were an estimated 7,866 casualties. The devastation from the earthquake was the last of the three 'catastrophes' that affected the island of Chios in the 19th century. Tectonic setting The Aegean Sea is an area of mainly extensional tectonics caused by the subduction of the African Plate beneath Aegean Sea Plate. Damage The town of Chios was devastated, causing many casualties, partly due to the narrowness of the streets. In the rest of the island, 25 out of the 64 villages were destroyed with another 17 badly damaged. In both √áe≈üme and Ala√ßatƒ± about 40% of the houses were destroyed. The number of casualties on the Turkish mainland was low, possibly due to most of the inhabitants leaving their houses to watch the passage of the passenger ship Aya Evangelistra from the shore. Characteristics The epicenter of the earthquake was in the southeastern part of Chios where intensities reached IX (Violent) on the Mercalli intensity scale. Isoseismal maps show an elongation west to east with an area of intensity VIII (Severe) affecting the western end of the Karaburun Peninsula of the Turkish mainland. Vertical movements of up to were observed. Magnitudes ranging from = 6.5 to = 7.3 have been estimated for this event. A minor tsunami was reported, based on the presence of fresh sand in a garden in Chios, but there is no other information available. There were many strong aftershocks, the most damaging being on 5 April, 11 April (2), 12 April, 13 April, 18 April, 20 May, 9 June and 26 August. Aftermath After the earthquake many of the inhabitants of Chios left the island. This followed the trend set by the other two 'catastrophes' of the 19th century that devastated the island, the massacre of Chios in 1822 and the failure of the orange crop in 1833. Together these events left most of Chios in a state of poverty and severely underpopulated.

It is located in Keokuk, Iowa, United States. It was listed, together with the parish hall, on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. History St. John's Church was begun by the Rt. Rev. Jackson Kemper, Missionary Bishop of the Northwest, on April 20, 1850. The Rev. Otis Hackett served as the first rector of the church from 1850 to 1853. The first frame church for the parish was built under his direction in 1851. The property, on which the present church also stands, was a gift from Josiah Spalding of St. Louis. Services were held in parishioners' homes until it was completed. St. John's was one of five founding parishes that established the Diocese of Iowa in 1853. It also established five Episcopalian missions in and around Keokuk. That number includes St. Barnabas in Montrose and St. Mary the Virgin in Keokuk. The latter was the first black Episcopal Church established in Iowa. None of the missions exist today. with During the Civil War several St. John parishioners left to serve in the Union Army. Included in their number were Generals Samuel Ryan Curtis, who was serving as a congressman at the time, Hugh Thompson Reid, James C. Parrott, and William W. Belknap, who was later Secretary of War under President Ulysses S. Grant. Other parishioners included Colonels William H. Worthington and John A. McDowell. \\"No other city in Iowa furnished as many high ranking officers as did Keokuk, and no other church could boast as many regimental commanders and generals from (its) membership.\\" The present church building was designed by Boston architects Daniel Appleton and H.M. Stephenson. It was built by F. W. Menke of Quincy, Illinois. The Rev. Robert C. McIlwain was rector at the time. Work was begun on the structure on June 5, 1884, and the first services were held in the church on February 12, 1888. The church was consecrated on January 4, 1891 by Bishop William Stevens Perry. The parish hall was constructed in 1895. It was designed by the same architects and built by the same contractor as the church. It contains space for parish offices, education, and social uses. The rectory, located next to the church, was completed in 1913. It was completed by the Rev. John C. Sage, who would become the bishop of the Diocese of Western Kansas. Architecture The church is a combination of Gothic Revival in its style and Richardsonian Romanesque in its form and massing. The building measures long and high. The nave is wide with a transept that measure in total width. The corner bell tower is high and contains the bell from the original church. Both the church and the hall are built of Bedford limestone and they have a slate roof. The interior of the church contains hand-carved furnishings by William Bartels of Carthage, Illinois. He carved the reredos, altar, altar rail, chancel screen and the ends of the pews. The three panels on the front of the altar depict grapes and wheat to represent the Eucharist, and a bas relief of Christ carrying the cross. The baptismal font, carved by William Bawden in limestone, is the only item in the interior from the original church. The church has more than forty stained glass windows. Most were installed at the time of construction; others were added over the years. The most recent window was installed in the 1970s. Seven different companies provided windows for the church, including Franz Mayer & Co. of Munich, Germany, Tiffany Studios of New York City, and the J. Wippell & Company of Exeter, England. The pipe organ was built in 1965 by the Temple Organ Company of Lamoni, Iowa. It contains 22 registers, 27 ranks, and 1,520 pipes. There is a processional organ in the rear of the nave.

Like OpenSim, with which the project collaborates and from which it derives much of its code, realXtend is intended to allow individuals and groups to set up and browse their own virtual worlds without having to be connected to much larger worlds like Second Life. Operations It is created by the realXtend Association, which was founded in April 2011, and is funded by both realXtend Foundation and Oulu Innovation of Oulu, Finland, as a cooperation by three Oulu based companies Evocativi, LudoCraft and Playsign. Viewer Initially, in early 2008, realXtend published a custom viewer derived from Linden Labs's own SL viewer; a free, open-source client (or viewer) software application for Microsoft Windows which allows for viewing and accessing both Second Life and multiple OpenSimulator-based virtual world grids, the realXtend viewer is licensed under the GNU GPL. The realXtend viewer uses the OGRE engine, and it provides real-time shadows, improved lighting simulation, meshes and realistic avatars. The official Second Life physics engine is the proprietary Havok engine. The viewer connects to the OpenSim codebase trunk via the separate ModRexModRex utility. =Future= Beginning in 2009, the project began to work on a newer, original viewer, codenamed Naali, which is licensed under the BSD license and coded to implement a more robust viewing architecture. The new viewer and its SDK are now known as Tundra. It makes use of OpenSim's contributions policy, and, like Taiga, is relicensed under the Apache License v2.

This recipe, which was originally produced under the name Torino Gran Classico, had been purchased in 1925 from a Turin-based distillery by the small Swiss distillery E. Luginb√ºhl, located near Bern. It is made by soaking a mixture of 25 aromatic herbs and roots including wormwood, gentian, bitter orange, rhubarb, and hyssop in an alcohol/water solution in order to extract their flavors and aromas. This process is similar to that which was originally employed to make medicinal tinctures. The maceration creates a natural golden-amber color, although many other producers, such as Campari and Cynar that use Turin-style recipes dye their product carmine red. The final liquid is then filtered, reduced in alcoholic strength and sweetened with sugar before bottling. Gran Classico Bitter is consumed straight or with ice, mixed with seltzer water or beer, and as an ingredient in cocktails, in the same fashion as other bitters or amaros. It is most frequently chosen as an alternative to Campari in the Negroni cocktail and its variations.

It was the result of a conversion of existing EMD SD50 locomotives. This involved replacing the original EMD 645 prime mover with a pair of Caterpillar engines, a 12 cylinder C175 engine and a C18 engine. The locomotive was jointly designed by Progress Rail and Norfolk Southern Railway. Development began in 2008. Three locomotives were built; they were manufactured at Progress Rail's Mayfield, Kentucky factory. Two operated in revenue freight service on Norfolk Southern, while a third operated as a demonstrator unit for Progress Rail. At one time Norfolk Southern had four more PR43Cs on order. The locomotives operated by Norfolk Southern worked on freight trains in central Illinois, leading to speculation that they were being tested, as Caterpillar's headquarters are located in Peoria, Illinois. The process of converting an SD50 to a PR43C altered the external appearance of the locomotive; the original radiator section was replaced with a larger one similar in appearance to that of an EMD SD70ACe or SD70M-2. As a result of repeated failures, the locomotives were retired in 2017, and all were cut up for scrap in 2018.

It is one of only four buildings constructed for the Eastern Star organization, and the only one still surviving and in active use. The building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places as a fine example of Romanesque Revival architecture, and a rare example of local buildings devoted to a women's organization. The building was designed by the architectural firm of Coffman, Salsbury & Stafford in the Romanesque Revival style. An architect's drawing of the building includes five people in front of the building, all women. The women in the sketch were dressed in contemporary 1920s fashions, with bobbed hair and knee-length skirts, and one behind the wheel of an automobile. This sketch provides insight into the changing role of women in the 1920s, and reflects the intended purpose of the building as the home of a women's organization. The building was completed in 1928, and used for both public and private functions. Many local schools used the hall's grand ballroom for dances and social functions. A fire in December 1936 temporarily closed the hall, but it was quickly repaired and reopened. Located directly across from the reconstructed Sutter's Fort, the hall became one of many social institutions around the Fort's perimeter on the eastern end of K Street.

It preys on the feet of nesting seabirds. Its numbers have been reduced significantly by introduced weka, and the entire remnant population of the leech is now living beneath a single boulder.  Discovery  The leech was discovered when botanist Leonard Cockayne and Walter Dunlop (an analytical chemist from Orepuki) visited Taumaka, the largest of the Open Bay Islands, in February 1903. Dunlop was looking for wƒìtƒÅ in muttonbird burrows when he was bitten on the wrist. As Benham put it, in his description of the new species, \\"Fortunately Mr Dunlop is keenly interested in natural history, and he carefully withdrew his hand and found a leech attached thereto‚Äù. Subsequently, weka (Gallirallus australis) were introduced to the Open Bay Islands, and by 1969 these were thought to have driven the leech to extinction. The species was rediscovered in 1987, however, living in waterlogged penguin burrows underneath a large (5 m √ó 2 m) glacial boulder. Repeated surveys of the boulder over the next decade confirmed that the leeches, the entire world population known at that time, were surviving and breeding.  Biology  Terrestrial leeches require damp or wet environments to keep their skin moist and dispose of excreted ammonia, and so are normally found in forest. On the Open Bay Islands, H. antipodum was found in wet burrows or in waterlogged piles of sticks. Terrestrial leeches primarily feed on mammals, though the New Zealand species have adapted to rely on birds. The Open Bay Islands leech feeds primarily on the feet of nesting seabirds, especially Fiordland penguins (Eudyptes pachyrhynchus). Leeches are able to ingest several times their body weight in blood, and can take months to digest it. Outside of the breeding season, H. antipodum may feed opportunistically on other vertebrates, such as fur seals, or even earthworms. New Zealand terrestrial leeches may have once been opportunistic feeders of even active forest birds, such as the extinct moa. The cocoon of H. antipodum, from Benham (1904) Leeches are hermaphrodites, with both male and female genital pores. Those in the order Arhynchobdellida lay 5‚Äì10 eggs in cocoons. When Cockayne and Dunlop discovered this species, their initial search located six more individuals and two empty cocoons, which were oval, 14 mm long, and dark brown with a horny texture.  Conservation  The main cause of decline in numbers of this leech is suspected to be predation by weka (Gallirallus australis), as the Open Bay Islands have no mammalian predators such as rats and mice. Although a New Zealand native bird, weka were introduced to the islands from both the North and South Island in the 1900s. They prey on nesting seabirds, their eggs, the Open Bay Islands gecko (Mokopirirakau sp.), Open Bay Islands skink (Oligosoma taumakae), and invertebrates in general. Because H. antipodum is active during the day and will cross areas of open ground, it is very susceptible to weka predation. Proposals by the Department of Conservation to eradicate weka from the islands have been opposed by the islands' owners, MƒÅori of the iwi Poutini Ngai Tahu, who were partly responsible for introducing the birds. DOC have also suggested maintaining a captive population of the leeches in case they are driven extinct on the island. One problem with conservation of this species is that it is not as charismatic as a bird or fur seal; as biologist Colin Miskelly put it, \\"‚Ä¶trying to get community buy-in for protecting the Open Bay Island leech ‚Äì it‚Äôs just not going to happen, because who gives a stuff about a leech.\\" References  External links  *Photographs of H. antipodum by Rod Morris Nature Photography *H. antipodum discussed on RNZ Critter of the Week, 5 February 2016 Category:Leeches Category:Worms of New Zealand Category:Animals described in 1904 ","title":"Hirudobdella antipodum"},{"id":"28215332","text":"Rachel Ashwell (born Rachel Greenfield on 30 October 1959, in Cambridge, England) is an author, designer and entrepreneur who was raised in London.

Life Born probably about 1490, he is said to have been a native of Lincolnshire or Lancashire. He was educated first at Oxford and then at Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1511, and M.A. in 1514. In 1525 he was made canon of Cardinal College, Oxford, and on 9 March 1526 he supplicated for incorporation in Oxford University, and for the degrees B.D. and D.D. About the same time he was appointed chaplain to Henry VIII. On 7 March 1528 he was presented to the prebend of Wigginton in the collegiate church of Tamworth, but resigned it in the following July, and was appointed master of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, London. He resigned the latter post in July 1532 on being instituted to the vicarage of Thaxted, Essex. Meanwhile, in 1530, at Henry's request, Pope Clement VII provided Staples to the bishopric of Meath. In that capacity he took a prominent part in the government of Ireland, and in the strife between the various factions of the official class. In 1534 he was compelled to flee to England before the rebellion of Thomas Fitzgerald, 10th Earl of Kildare. He returned in the following year, when he and Archbishop George Browne became Henry VIII's principal instruments in introducing the Protestant Reformation into Ireland. His relations with Browne, however, were always hostile. Staples clung to the mass, though he was strongly for the Royal Supremacy, and it was partly owing to his advice that Henry assumed the title of King of Ireland. His quarrel with Browne became such a scandal that on 31 July 1537 Henry wrote to Browne threatening to remove him for his lightness of behaviour and pride, and to Staples censuring his neglect of his ecclesiastical duties. Little effect seems to have been produced, and on one occasion in 1538, while preaching before Browne in Kilmainham church, Staples denounced him as a heretic. This sermon was examined by the Privy Council of Ireland, and both Staples and Browne complained to Thomas Cromwell, but the quarrel was patched up. In 1544, as a reward for his zeal, Staples was allowed to annex the archdeaconry of Kells though he lost the same benefice by 1547. After Edward VI's accession, Staples's Protestant opinions became more pronounced, On 7 April 1547 he was granted the parsonage of Ardbraccan, and soon after was made judge of faculties. About this time he married, and preached a strong sermon against the mass, which rendered him intensely unpopular in his diocese. In June 1552, in a discussion at St. Mary's Abbey, Dublin, he maintained the Protestant cause against George Dowdall, archbishop of Armagh. In August 1553 he took part in the proclamation of Queen Mary, but on 29 June 1554 he was deprived on account of his marriage. He remained in his diocese, destitute and disliked, and on 16 December 1558, after Elizabeth's accession, he wrote to William Cecil relating his woes and seeking preferment. He was not, however, restored to his see, and, as no subsequent mention of him occurs, he is believed to have died soon after.

It is often described as the climax of Poulenc's early period. The composer wrote to the Belgian musicologist Paul Collaer: \\"You will see for yourself what an enormous step forward it is from my previous work and that I am really entering my great period.\\"1 October 1932 letter in Francis Poulenc, Correspondance 1910‚Äì1963, Myriam Chim√®nes, ed. (Paris: Fayard 1994) p. 32, note 19 (Poulenc 1991, no. 121) The concerto was commissioned by and dedicated to the Princess Edmond de Polignac, an American-born arts patron to whom many early 20th-century masterpieces are dedicated, including Stravinsky's Renard, Ravel's Pavane pour une infante d√©funte, Kurt Weill‚Äôs Second Symphony, and Satie‚Äôs Socrate. Her Paris salon was a gathering place for the musical avant-garde. Premiere The premiere was given on September 5, 1932, at the International Society for Contemporary Music in Venice. Poulenc and his childhood friend Jacques F√©vrier were concerto soloists with the La Scala Orchestra, with D√©sir√© Defauw (later conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra) conducting. Poulenc was gratified by the warm acclaim his work received, and later performed the concerto with Benjamin Britten in England in 1945. Inspirations The concerto's recurring moto perpetuo, modally inflected figurations are clearly inspired by Poulenc's encounter with a Balinese gamelan at the 1931 Exposition Coloniale de Paris.Carl B. Schmidt, Entrancing Muse: A Documented Biography of Francis Poulenc (Pendragon Press, November 2001), p. 196. Additionally, the work's instrumentation and \\"jazzy\\" effects are reminiscent of Ravel's G major Concerto, which was premiered at Paris in January 1932. Inevitably, comparisons have been drawn with Mozart's Concerto in E-flat for two pianos, K. 365, but the Larghetto's graceful, classically simple melody and gentle, regular accompaniment is reminiscent of the Andante of Mozart's C major Piano Concerto, K. 467. The composer admitted that he chose for the opening theme to go back to Mozart because \\"I have a veneration for the melodic line and because I prefer Mozart to all other composers\\". Poulenc wrote in a letter to Igor Markevitch, \\"Would you like to know what I had on my piano during the two months gestation of the Concerto? The concertos of Mozart, those of Liszt, that of Ravel, and your Partita\\".Fragment of Poulenc‚Äôs Sept. 1932 letter to Markevitch in Poulenc (1994) p. 368, note 1. Instrumentation The concerto is scored for two pianos and an orchestra of flute, piccolo, two oboes (second doubling cor anglais), two clarinets, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, two trombones, tuba, snare drum, shallow snare drum, bass drum, castanets, triangle, military drum, suspended cymbal, and strings. Style and form The concerto features simple ABA form in the first and second movements, but suggests a more complex rondo form with intervening episodes in the finale. The concerto is in three movements as follows: #Allegro ma non troppo ‚Äì in D minor. Poulenc chooses to bypass the conventions of sonata allegro in the opening movement in favor of ternary form, with a slower middle section. If this first movement is meant to evoke Mozart, it is the blithe composer of the delightful Divertimenti and Serenades. The general effect is ‚Äúgay and direct,‚Äù words Poulenc often used to describe his own music. #Larghetto ‚Äì in B-flat major. In the gently rocking, consciously naive Larghetto, Poulenc evokes the famous Andante from Mozart's D Minor Concerto, K. 466. The increasingly sonorous, steadily building middle section echoes the spirit of Camille Saint-Sa√´ns, who, though indefatigably French, could in his serious moments be among the most Mozartean of 19th- century composers. Poulenc commented, \\"In the Larghetto of this Concerto I permitted myself, for the first theme, to return to Mozart, because I have a fondness for the melodic line and I prefer Mozart to all other musicians. If the movement begins alla Mozart, it quickly diverges at the entrance of the second piano, toward a style that was familiar to me at the time.\\"Claude Rostand, Entretiens avec Claude Rostand (Paris: Rene Juillard 1954) p. 83. #Allegro molto ‚Äì in D minor. Poulenc's finale is a syncretic Rondo that merges the insouciance of a Parisian music hall and the mesmerizing sonorities of a gamelan orchestra. Its scintillating patter and energetic rhythms produce a vivacious, effervescent effect. As did his idol Mozart, Poulenc favors us with profligate melodious invention, featuring a new theme for nearly each succeeding section. His biographer Henri Hell has observed, \\"the finale flirts with one of those deliberately vulgar themes never far from the composer‚Äôs heart.\\"Henri Hell, Francis Poulenc (trans. from the French and introduced by Edward Lockspeiser, 1959), p. 61. As brilliant as it sounds, the Poulenc Concerto for Two Pianos demands of its piano soloists more skills of ensemble than of technique. Although the pianos intersperse conversational interludes, conventional cadenzas are absent. Throughout the concerto, the pianists play nearly continuously, sometimes unaccompanied by the orchestra.

Rendered redundant by the car ferry revolution, she was sold to Greek owners in 1975. She caught fire in 1997 and was left to decay. History Maid of Argyll was the second of a quartet of passenger vessels ordered in 1951 to modernise the Clyde fleet. Built by A & J Inglis of Glasgow, it was launched on 4 March 1953.Third New BR Clyde Steamer Launched Railway Gazette 10 April 1953 page 439 She was the only ship of the quartet to survive unaltered into the Caledonian MacBrayne era with the new livery. This only lasted one season and she made her last Clyde sailing on 12 September 1973. After a lay-up through the winter, she was sold to Cycladic Cruises of Piraeus on 1 March 1974. As City of Piraeus, she sailed from Flisvos marina on day cruises to the Saronic Islands, Aegina, Poros and Hydra. Her landing platform was extended to make a little upper deck and by 1978, it ran almost to the stern, serving as a sun deck. She was relieving City of Hydra, the former MacBrayne's . About 1989, she moved to Corfu, sailing for Aronis Coastal Cruises. As City of Corfu, she ran excursions to the island of Paxos, and the port of Parga on the Greek mainland. In 1997, City of Corfu suffered a serious fire and did not sail again. In 2002, she was partially submerged and decomposing at her berth. Layout Maid of Argyll had a forward observation lounge and an aft tearoom, both with large windows. A lower deck lounge was later converted to a bar. Open deck space available for passengers was limited. The bridge was forward on the promenade deck, with a landing platform above, for use at very low tides. She had two masts and a single funnel, above the central engines, with the galley aft. Service Maid of Argyll was initially based at Craigendoran, with runs to Gourock, Dunoon, Innellan and Rothesay. On Saturdays, she took the Lochgoilhead/Arrochar leg of the \\"Three Lochs Tour\\", releasing to carry larger numbers of passengers to Dunoon and Rothesay. In the late 1950s, the Maids lost their fixed routes and all operated across the Clyde network. From February to May 1970, Maid of Argyll was the Kyles of Bute/Tarbert Royal Mail ship. She acquired the locked mail-room partitions and parcel/luggage shelter first fitted on her sister, on the same duty, which CSP had assumed from David MacBrayne Ltd the previous October.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. The building is now called St. Barnabas Wedding Chapel. History The congregation was founded as Grace Church and initially shared space with the local Methodist Episcopal Church. with Land for the present church was secured in 1867 and funds were raised for the building. Construction began in 1869 and the main part of the sanctuary was completed in 1871. Local craftsmen built the church in blue-gray limestone, which was quarried away. Matthew Richardson, J.S. Lakin, and J.N. Ballou finished the interior, which included its furnishings. The name of the congregation was changed to St. Barnabas in 1881. The women of the parish raised the money for the bell tower and narthex, which were built c. 1902. A second-hand bell had been given by a St. Louis parish and hung on a frame structure at the Methodist Church until this tower was built. St. Barnabas was never a parish in its own right, but was a mission that was served from St. Luke's in Fort Madison or St. John's in Keokuk. The church remained in use until it closed in 1960. An attempt was made to move the town library to the old church in 1974. The church was deconsecrated and some of its contents were given to active churches. The building was also vandalized and the churchyard was used to graze horses for a time. The old church sat empty until the Montrose Township Historical Society was formed in 1981 and began to restore it. In addition to serving as a wedding chapel, the facility hosts annual Memorial Day and Christmas programs. Architecture The rectangular structure measures about .

The lesson of Jutland for Germany had been the vital need for reconnaissance, to avoid the unexpected arrival of the British Grand Fleet during a raid. On this occasion four Zeppelins were deployed to scout the North Sea between Scotland and Norway for signs of British ships and four more scouted immediately ahead of German ships. Twenty-four German submarines participated off the English coast, in the southern North Sea and off the Dogger Bank. Background Although Jutland had been officially claimed as a success, the German commander Admiral Reinhard Scheer felt it important that another raid should be mounted as quickly as possible, to maintain morale in his severely battered fleet. It was decided that the raid should follow the pattern of previous ones, with the battlecruisers carrying out a dawn artillery bombardment of an English town, in this case Sunderland. Only two battlecruisers were still serviceable after Jutland, and , so the force was bolstered by three battleships, , and . The remainder of the High Seas Fleet, comprising 16 dreadnought battleships, was to carry out close support behind. The fleet set sail at 9:00 p.m. on 18 August from the Jade river. Attack =Intelligence= Information about the upcoming raid was obtained by British Intelligence in Room 40 through intercepted and decoded radio messages. Admiral Sir John Jellicoe, commander of the British fleet, was on leave so had to be recalled urgently and boarded the light cruiser at Dundee to meet his fleet in the early hours of 19 August off the river Tay. In his absence, Admiral Cecil Burney took the fleet to sea on the afternoon of 18 August. Vice-Admiral David Beatty left the Firth of Forth with his squadron of six battlecruisers to meet the main fleet in the Long Forties. The Harwich Force of 20 destroyers and 5 light cruisers commanded by Commodore Tyrwhitt was ordered out, as were 25 British submarines which were stationed in likely areas to intercept German ships. The battlecruisers together with the 5th Battle Squadron of five fast battleships were stationed ahead of the main fleet to scout for the enemy. The assembled fleet now moved south seeking the German fleet, but suffered the loss of one of the light cruisers screening the battlecruiser group, , which was hit by three torpedoes from submarine at 6:00 a.m. and sank. =Finding the opposition= Town-class cruiser , sunk after torpedo attacks from two submarines At 6:15 a.m. Jellicoe received information from the Admiralty that one hour earlier the enemy had been to his south east. However, the loss of the cruiser caused him to first head north for fear of endangering his other ships. No torpedo tracks or submarines had been seen, so it was unclear whether the cause had been a submarine or entering an unknown minefield. He did not resume a south-easterly course until 9:00 a.m. when William Goodenough, commanding the light cruisers, advised that the cause had been a submarine attack. Further information from the admiralty indicated that the battlecruisers would be within of the main German fleet by 2:00 p.m. and Jellicoe increased to maximum speed. Weather conditions were good, and there was still plenty of time for a fleet engagement before dark. The German force had received reassurances about Jellicoe's position, when a zeppelin had spotted the Grand Fleet heading north away from Scheer, at the time it had been avoiding the possible minefield. Unfortunately for the British, the Zeppelin L 13 sighted the Harwich force approximately east-north-east of Cromer, mistakenly identifying the cruisers as battleships. This was precisely the sort of target Scheer was seeking, so he changed course at 12:15 p.m. also to the south-east and away from the approaching British fleet. No further reports were received from zeppelins about the British fleet, but it was spotted by a U-boat just north of Scheer. Scheer turned for home at 2:35 p.m. abandoning his potential target. By 4:00 p.m. Jellicoe had been advised that Scheer had abandoned the operation and so turned north himself. = Other engagements = Nassau-class battleship damaged by a torpedo from A second cruiser attached to the battlecruiser squadron, , was hit by two torpedoes from at Falmouth managed to raise steam and made slowly for Humber, escorted by four destroyers, in the early hours a tug arrived and took the ship in tow. Taking the shortest route to the Humber put the ship on a bearing which took it along the Flamborough Head U-boat line. At noon, the ship, now escorted by eight destroyers, was hit by two torpedoes fired by (commander: Otto Schultze). Falmouth remained afloat for another eight hours then sank south of Flamborough Head. By the Harwich force had sighted German ships but was too far behind to attack before nightfall and abandoned the chase. The British submarine (Lieutenant-Commander R. R. Turner) managed to hit the German battleship north of Terschelling at on 19 August but the ship was able to reach port. Aftermath On 13 September, the British held a conference on Iron Duke to discuss recent events and to obtain a directive from the Government about rules of engagement. It was decided that it was unsafe to conduct fleet operations south of latitude 55.5¬∞ North (approximately level with Horns reef and where the battle of Jutland had taken place). Jellicoe took the view that a destroyer shortage precluded operations further south but that it was feasible to operate west of Longitude 4¬∞ East should there be a good opportunity of engaging the German fleet in daylight. The fleet should not sail further south than the Dogger Bank until a complete destroyer screen was available, except in exceptional circumstances, such as the chance to engage the High Seas Fleet with a tactical advantage or to intercept a German invasion fleet. On 23 December, the Admiralty endorsed the conclusions of the meeting due to the effect of submarines and mines on surface ship operations. Scheer was unimpressed by the Zeppelin reconnaissance, only three had spotted anything and of their seven reports four had been wrong. This was the last occasion on which the German fleet travelled so far west into the North Sea. On 6 October, the German government resumed attacks against merchant vessels by submarine, which meant the U-boat fleet was no longer available for combined attacks against surface vessels. From 18 to 19 October, Scheer led a brief sortie into the North Sea which British intelligence gave advance warning; the Grand Fleet declined to prepare an ambush, staying in port with steam raised, ready to sail. The German sortie was abandoned after a few hours when was hit by a torpedo fired by (Lieutenant-Commander J. de B. Jessop) and it was feared other submarines might be in the area. Scheer suffered further difficulties when in November he sailed with Moltke and a division of dreadnoughts to rescue and , which had become stranded on the Danish coast. British submarine (Commander J. Laurence) managed to hit the battleships and . The failure of these operations reinforced the belief, created at Jutland, that the risks were too great for such tactics, because of the danger from submarines and mines.

Production was considered but only one was completed. Design and development The F in the designation of the Pasotti built F.6 Airone stood for its designer, Stelio Frati, who was responsible for several fast light wooden aircraft powered by either piston or turbine engines. The Airone (Heron in English) was a low-winged, twin piston engine driven, four seater. It was intended as a general light four seater for private or executive use, or as an air ambulance. The Airone's wings were built around a one piece single wooden spar and clad with stress bearing plywood. They carried differential ailerons and trailing edge flaps. The fuselage structure and that of the conventional tail unit was similar, though the rudder and elevators were fabric covered. The fuselage was built in two sections, bolted together behind the wing trailing edge. The rear section tapered towards the tail, where the tailplane was fitted on its top and the fin blended in with a curved leading edge. The front section included the enclosed cabin with two pairs of seats. Dual controls were fitted. There were wide doors on either side into the cabin; the baggage compartment behind it could be accessed from inside the cabin or by a separate external hatch. The only Airone completed carried its fuel in a tank ahead of the cabin, though production aircraft would have used wingtip tanks instead. The Airone had a conventional retractable tricycle undercarriage with its trailing idler (knee action) main gear legs mounted below the engines. The prototype was powered by two flat 4-cylinder Continental C90 engines of 90 hp (67 kW) each, driving fixed pitch propellers. Production aircraft would have been powered by two 105 hp (78 kW) Walter Minor IV inverted inline engines with variable pitch airscrews, though there were other possible engine choices in the range. In February 1958 there was a report that Aeromere would produce the Airone powered with unspecified engines in place of the Walters. As with other proposals to produce the Airone, this too came to nothing.

During 1941 and 1942, he commanded the 221st Security Division in the Army Group Centre Rear Area. Under Pflugbeil's command, the division took part in Nazi security warfare and was responsible for numerous war crimes and crimes against humanity. World War II On June 27, 1941, the 221st Security Division held the Polish city of Bialystok, which had been in the Soviet zone of occupation. That day, the 309th Police battalion started a pogrom on the Jewish community: Jews were arrested, beaten, beards were cut, and people were shot. The Jewish community chiefs went to see general Pflugbeil, and asked him to stop that pogrom. They were in his office, on their knees to implore him. A policeman of the 309th Police Battalion urinated on them; the general offered his back, to see elsewhere. After that \\"meeting\\", the pogrom became slaughter and massacre: the Jews on the market place were shot in front on a wall, until the night; the synagogue, where 700 Jews were piled up, was set on fire with petrol and grenades. The Jews who tried to escape were shot. On June 28, general Pflugbeil asked Major Weis (309th Police battalion) the cause of the fire. Weis made a false report on the causes.Browning (Christopher R.), Des hommes ordinaires : le 101e bataillon de r√©serve de la police allemande et la solution finale en Pologne, pp.25-26 In March of 1942, the division under Pflugbeil command embarked on large scale Nazi security warfare in the Yelnya-Dorogobuzh area east of Smolensk. The so-called anti-partisan operations in \\"bandit-infested\\" areas amounted to destruction of villages, seizure of livestock, deporting of able- bodied population for slave labour to Germany and murder of those of non- working age. The tactics included shelling villages not under German control with heavy weapons, resulting in mass civilian casualties. Pflugbeil directed his troops that the \\"goal of the operation is not to drive the enemy back, but to exterminate him\\". During the operation, the unit recorded 278 German troops killed, while 806 enemies were reported killed in action and 120 prisoners were handed over to Wehrmacht's Secret Field Police for execution. Only 200 weapons (rifles, machine-guns and pistols) were seized. Awards * Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 12 August 1944 as Generalleutnant and Kommandant von MilauFellgiebel 2000, p. 275.

Kalish debuted in the major leagues in 2010, and at the end of the season was voted the Red Sox Rookie of the Year. He missed almost the entire 2011 and 2013 seasons, as a result of an injury that led to shoulder/neck surgeries. He started the 2014 season on the Opening Day roster of the Chicago Cubs, and split it between the major league team and Triple-A Iowa. Early life Kalish is the son of Steven and Eileen Plata Kalish, who were both born in Dorchester, Massachusetts, and grew up in the Boston area. He was born in Northridge, Los Angeles, and grew up in Shrewsbury, New Jersey. His brother Jake Kalish is a pitcher in the Kansas City Royals system, and played for Team Israel at the 2017 World Baseball Classic. He is Jewish, and his father is Jewish and his mother is Catholic. His maternal grandfather was born in Nowy SƒÖcz in southern Poland. High school and draft Kalish was one of New Jersey's top high school baseball players. Pitching and playing outfield as a four-year starter for Red Bank Catholic High School, he won all-conference and all-division honors. As a freshman in April 2003, in his first varsity pitching start, Kalish struck out ten batters in six innings. As a sophomore, in May 2004 he pitched a seven-inning no-hitter. For the season, he batted .507 with 32 stolen bases, and on the mound he had a 6‚Äì1 won-lost record with a 1.60 ERA. In his senior season he hit .422 with 30 stolen bases. Baseball America reported that it may be \\"apocryphal\\", but that \\"legend has it that Kalish didn't swing and miss at a single pitch as a high school senior.\\" Confirming that, Red Sox scout Ray Fagant, who followed him in high school, said: \\"He went his entire senior year without a swing and miss once. He made hard contact every time.\\" He batted .466 in high school, leading his team in batting his last three years. As a pitcher, he threw an 88‚Äì89 mph fastball, and what his coach called \\"a good curveball [and] ... a real nice change-up\\", and had 190 career strikeouts. Kalish was also a standout high school football player, playing quarterback, strong safety, and punter for his school's football team, and leading it to a division championship. The team's head coach said: \\"He's as talented a player as we‚Äôve had at the QB position.\\" In October 2005, his 42-yard pass under pressure helped seal the school's upset victory over Manasquan in the Shore Conference Liberty Division. In December 2005, he was voted First-Team All-Shore League. In addition, he played forward for the school's basketball team. In the summer of 2006, he played for the Middletown Monarchs in the Atlantic Baseball Confederation, a summer collegiate baseball league. In 2006, he was named the Jersey Shore Sports Hall of Fame High School Male Athlete of the Year. Coming out of high school, Kalish was rated the # 76 baseball prospect in the U.S., and the # 2 prospect in New Jersey by Baseball America. He considered going to Rutgers, and playing both baseball and football there. But he committed to attending the University of Virginia, with whom he signed on scholarship with the understanding that at least for his freshman year he would only play baseball. Given his commitment to college, he was not drafted until the 9th round of the 2006 Major League Baseball draft, when he was picked by the Boston Red Sox. The Red Sox signed him, for $600,000‚Äîan amount that was consistent with what second-round draft prospects received, but well over the norm for a 9th-rounder. Major League Baseball's Commissioner's Office held up his signing initially, as the amount of money exceeded his draft slot, but approved it by late August. The signing was not without other problems, however. Kalish explained: \\"My girlfriend, but especially her dad, are Yankees fans. It was brutal. She was like, \\"I can't believe I have to wear a Red Sox hat now!\\" Minor leagues =Boston Red Sox organization= By July 3, 2007, Kalish's \\"game-changing speed\\" had him leading the New York‚ÄìPenn League with 12 stolen bases for the short season Lowell Spinners and he was named the Red Sox organization's Base Stealer of the Month for June. He followed that up by being named New York Penn-League Player of the Week, for the week beginning July 9. Kalish batted .800 for the week with a 1.533 slugging percentage, set a team record with three hits in each of the four games, and tied a team record by reaching base in 11 consecutive plate appearances. The Lowell Sun opined, \\"Ryan Kalish, Lowell's dynamic center fielder, is putting together a stretch perhaps not seen in the Spinners' history.\\" His .476 on-base percentage was fourth-best in the league, and his batting average was fifth-best. On July 16, 2007, Kalish was hit by a pitch which broke the hamate bone in his right (non-throwing) wrist. At the time, he was leading the league in both stolen bases and runs scored, and batting .368 with a .471 on-base percentage and a .540 slugging percentage. The injury ended his season. After waiting to see if his wrist would heal on its own, he had surgery late in the season. He was voted a New York Penn- League All Star, and Baseball America still ranked him the 6th-best prospect in the league. Lowell manager Gary DiSarcina compared him to former major leaguer Darin Erstad, noting their common intensity. \\"Speed and guts\\", said DiSarcina. \\"I love him. He's my favorite player.\\" In January 2008, Peter Gammons called Kalish one of the three top hitting prospects in the Red Sox organization, and Baseball America rated him the 6th-best player in the organization and projected him as the parent team's starting left fielder in 2011. In February 2008 Baseball America rated him # 96 in its annual list of the Top 100 Prospects in baseball. He struggled in 2008 while coming back from his surgery, as he split the season between the Single-A Greenville Drive and Lancaster JetHawks, despite being awarded the Red Sox organization Player of the Month Award for July and being fifth in the Red Sox system with 19 stolen bases. After the season, he played for the North Shore Honu, in the Hawaii Winter League. In early 2009 he had a slow start, despite being named the organization's Base-stealer of the Month in April for stealing 7 bases in 8 attempts over 19 games while playing for Single-A Salem Red Sox, and being named the Carolina League's # 9 prospect. In the second half of the season, which he ended with the Double-A Portland Sea Dogs, with his wrist finally healed, he batted .302, with a .384 on-base percentage and a .561 slugging percentage. The Red Sox named him their 2009 Minor League Offensive Player of the Year, as for the year he led Red Sox minor leaguers in walks (68), runs (84), and total bases (231), and was second in homers (18), fourth in RBIs (77), and tied for fifth in stolen bases (21). His 21 stolen bases came in 27 attempts. After the 2009 season, he played in the Arizona Fall League for the Mesa Solar Sox, batting .301 with a .384 on-base percentage. In December 2009, Baseball America ranked him the organization's # 5 prospect. Starting 2010 with the Sea Dogs, in 41 games Kalish batted .293, leading the team in runs (35), home runs (8), and stolen bases (13; fifth in the league), while he was fourth in the Eastern League in walks (28) and on-base percentage (.404). He also became the ninth player in team history to have five hits in one game. He moved up to the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox, and between the two teams in 2010 he batted .294/.382/.502 with 25 steals, while being caught 3 times. Pawtucket manager Torey Lovullo said: \\"He's as close as any player I‚Äôve ever managed to being a superstar.\\" Kalish developed a reputation in the minor leagues for being solid, fast (stealing bases through 2009 at an 82% success rate), aggressive and hard-nosed on defense and on the bases, and patient at the plate. Kalish began 2011 with Pawtucket. He injured his left shoulder making a diving catch on April 21, after 14 games. He was slated to play his first rehab game for Short-Season Lowell on August 4, playing DH and outfield. =Toronto Blue Jays organization= On December 17, 2014, Kalish agreed to a minor league contract with the Toronto Blue Jays that included an invitation to spring training. However, the deal was not completed.Deal between Kalish and Blue Jays falls through, sportsnet.ca; accessed March 25, 2016. =Comeback attempt= In the winter of 2015‚Äì16, Kalish began playing for Criollos de Caguas in the Puerto Rican winter league, hoping to attract the interest of scouts after his recuperation from multiple surgeries.Peter Gammons, \\"A healthy Ryan Kalish starts comeback in Puerto Rico\\", Gammons Daily, November 29, 2015.Peter Abraham, \\"Despite offseason strides, Hanley Ram√≠rez's presence still an issue,\\" Boston Globe, January 5, 2016. On February 18, 2016, he signed with the Sioux City Explorers of the American Association, an independent league.\\"Explorers sign former big leaguer Kalish\\" Sioux City Journal, February 18, 2016 =Canberra Cavalry= During the winter of 2017-2018, Kalish played for the Canberra Cavalry of the Australian Baseball League. =New Britain Bees and retirement= On February 6, 2018, Kalish signed with the New Britain Bees of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. After playing in a spring training game on April 20, Kalish determined that his knee was not healthy enough to continue his playing career, and he subsequently retired. Major leagues =Boston Red Sox= 2010 Observing Kalish in spring training in February 2010, Gordon Edes of ESPN wrote: \\"Remember the name. This may be his first big league camp, but Kalish ... gives off the vibe of someone on a collision course with bigger things.\\" Red Sox manager Terry Francona lauded his bat speed, and compared his intensity and aggressiveness to that of former Red Sox right fielder Trot Nixon. Kalish was promoted to the Red Sox from Pawtucket on July 31, 2010, and immediately began playing almost every day. At 22 years of age, he was the eighth-youngest ballplayer in the AL in 2010. He got his first major league hit in his first at bat, and later in the game notched his first RBI. He was fast and aggressive on the basepaths. He finished the season with 10 steals‚Äîwhich led the Red Sox, and tied for the lead among AL rookies‚Äîin 11 attempts, including a steal of home on the back end of a double steal. But the raw aggression of his running game was evidenced on August 2, in a game against the Cleveland Indians, when Kalish came racing home from second base on a single to right field. The throw from right beat him to the plate, which Cleveland's rookie catcher Carlos Santana had blocked with his legs. Kalish attempted to slide through Santana's legs, sliding \\"cleanly\\" but violently into Santana's left knee, knocking him completely out of his left cleat. Santana was carted off the field with his knee in an air cast, and three days later had season-ending surgery to repair a torn lateral collateral ligament in the knee. Kalish hit his first major league home run into the right-field bullpen at Yankee Stadium off Javier V√°zquez, on August 6. On August 17, Kalish hit his first career grand slam off Jered Weaver, in a game against the Los Angeles Angels in Fenway Park. He then hit another grand slam on September 6 at Fenway Park against the Tampa Bay Rays, which tied a Red Sox rookie record, previously accomplished by Bob Zupcic in 1992. As of September 29, he was tied for second among American League rookies with 15 RBIs in September, and after his major league debut he was second among AL rookies with 16 extra- base hits, and tied for second with 23 RBIs. He was also patient at the plate, fourth among AL rookies in pitches-per-plate-appearance, at 4.16. While he batted .252 for the season, he batted .313 with two out and runners in scoring position, and .360 in games that were late and close. He also made some sensational catches on defense, as he started most of his games in center field and a handful in left and right fields. Playing center field in late August, sprinting at full speed and then diving sideways he made an eye- opening, somersaulting catch of a ball in mid-air that concluded, as The Providence Journal described it, with him \\"tucking his elbow for an acrobatic, elegant landing on the Tropicana Field turf, looking like a character from the movie The Matrix\\" (see video). It was designated the best play in American sports for the night by ESPN's SportsCenter. He showed off his arm nabbing Coco Crisp at third base (see video), and made another spectacular, diving, rolling catch on September 26, against the Yankees (see video). After the season, Kalish was voted the 2010 winner of the Harry Agganis Award as Red Sox Rookie of the Year, by the Boston chapter of the BBWAA. 2011 Bill James predicted that in 2011 Kalish would bat .271, with 20 home runs and 43 stolen bases. By comparison, James anticipated that Carl Crawford would steal one fewer base. J. P. Ricciardi, special assistant to the Mets general manager, predicted that Kalish will be \\"a star\\". Peter Gammons said during spring training that comparisons of Kalish and Trot Nixon may underestimate Kalish's potential: > I have great respect for Trot Nixon, but Ryan Kalish is a totally different > athlete. He is a great athlete. I see him being a guy, he doesn‚Äôt swing and > miss a lot, who's going to hit somewhere between .280 and .300, hit 25 home > runs. He can run. I think he's going to be a really exciting player. Through March 25, Kalish was leading the team in stolen bases in spring training, with 5, and tied for second in walks, with 6. However, as a result of the crowded Red Sox outfield resulting from the acquisition of Carl Crawford, the returns of Mike Cameron and Jacoby Ellsbury, and the presence of J. D. Drew, Kalish was optioned that day to start the season in Triple-A Pawtucket. He would suffer an injury crashing into the wall at McCoy Stadium in late April, causing him to miss the entire 2011 season, except for 8 games in August. 2012 Through July 7, 2012, Kalish hit .217 with no home runs and five RBIs. He was optioned to the Pawtucket Red Sox on July 7 to make room for fellow outfielder Ryan Sweeney. 2013 On January 29, 2013, Kalish underwent arthroscopic surgery in his right shoulder to repair a posterior labrum tear. As a result, Kalish missed all of spring training and began the 2013 season on the 60-day disabled list.Alex Speier, WEEI, Ryan Kalish on Surgery: ‚ÄòI am Feeling Pretty Down About This All Right Now‚Äô, January 26, 2013 In response, the Red Sox re-signed Ryan Sweeney, who had been non-tendered in December.Gordon Edes, ESPN Boston, Shoulder again ails Ryan Kalish, January 25, 2013 (Sweeney was released following spring training and signed a minor league contract with the Chicago Cubs.)Andrew Martin, Bleacher Report, Chicago Cubs Sign Outfielder Ryan Sweeney to Minor League Deal, April 3, 2013 Kalish underwent cervical fusion surgery in August, which included the removal of a disc in his neck, the use of his own bone to replace it, and the insertion of a metal plate to fuse it together. Kalish was told rehab would take 3‚Äì6 months. NFL quarterback Peyton Manning had a similar procedure. It was his fourth surgery in under two years. In November, the Red Sox reinstated Kalish from the 60-day disabled list. On December 2, 2013, Kalish was non- tendered by the Red Sox, making him a free agent. =Chicago Cubs= 2014 On December 13, 2013, Kalish signed a minor league deal with an invitation to spring training with the Chicago Cubs. On March 27, 2014, the team announced Kalish would be on the Cubs' opening day roster. Kalish hit .275 with 6 stolen bases in 7 attempts during spring training. He was sent down to Triple-A Iowa on August 8, so that he could have more at bats, and recalled in early September.Ryan Kalish Starts in Center Field, Chicago Tribune, September 10, 2014 In 2014, Kalish batted .248 in 121 at bats, playing all three outfield positions. He cleared waivers and was sent to Iowa outright in October, which removed him from the Cubs' 40-man roster. In November, Kalish declined the assignment to Iowa, making him a free agent. =Second stint with Cubs (2016-2017)= On March 6, 2016, Kalish signed a minor league deal with the Chicago Cubs. He was assigned to the Triple-A Iowa Cubs to begin the 2016 season. The Cubs purchased his Iowa contract on May 3, and he was brought up to the major league teams's 25-man roster. On May 7, 2016, Kalish entered a game against the Washington Nationals as a pinch hitter in the 6th inning. With the bases loaded, two outs, and the Nationals leading 4 to 3, Kalish hit a two-run single to left field to give the Cubs the lead. The Cubs went on to win the game 8 to 5. He hit .286 for the Cubs in seven games. On May 14, the Cubs designated him for assignment; on May 15, they announced that Kalish had cleared waivers and had been sent to the AAA minor league Iowa Cubs. He batted .368/.471/.509 for Iowa in 21 games. In July Kalish went on the disabled list with a knee injury and planned to undergo surgery; he anticipated that recovery would take a year, and that he would be unable to play until mid-2017. Kalish was re-signed to a minor league deal with the Cubs on April 4, 2017. He spent the season with the Iowa Cubs, and elected free agency on November 6, 2017. Personal life Kalish is a co- owner of Birdman Bats along with former Red Sox teammate Lars Anderson. Kalish has been an owner of Birdman Bats since 2018.

His brothers-in-law and first cousins were Edmund Boyle, 8th Earl of Cork, and Vice-Admiral Sir Courtenay Boyle. He was educated at Christ Church, Oxford.

There are different kinds of post hole diggers. A post hole pincer (pictured) is jabbed into the ground in the open position until the blades are buried. At that point the handles are pulled apart to close the tool and grab the chunk of soil loosened. They are then pulled out of the ground with the chunk of soil. The process is repeated until the hole is deep enough, or until the hole is so deep and narrow that the handles can no longer be pulled apart fully. This is one of the weaknesses of this kind of post hole digger. There are also auger type post hole diggers. These are generally easier to use, and they can be used to a much greater depth, as the hole can be dug as deep as the entire length of the shaft. More importantly, they form a much neater hole, with a well-defined circumference. However, the very fact that the person doing the digging is guaranteed a perfect hole with an auger post hole digger is also its greatest weakness: any given auger style post hole digger can only dig one size hole‚Äîa hole with the same diameter as the auger's screw.  History and patent info  Reports of the creation of the first post hole digger/auger can be dated back to 250 B.C in Greece to remove water from large ships. However, it wasn‚Äôt until the 19th century that the first patents were being created and factories began to produce these manual diggers. The first patent was developed by a man named Mead M. Hubby of Maysfield, Texas on November 2, 1880. This design was made to be used in any soil type by twisting a screw- like blade into to ground to remove dirt and have a uniform hole. The next major patent was filed by Jacob H. Lawry of Lenior City, Tennessee on April 7, 1908. His design incorporated the traditional clam-shell diggers bolted together and attached to wooden handles to create an easier way to penetrate the ground and remove dirt to create a neat and uniform hole. Modern post hole diggers/augers can be power by gas or electric motors. The post hole diggers/augers are either hand-driven or attached to machines like tractors or skid steers. These attachments reduce the time it takes to dig post holes. Kansas prairie farmers claim that the new digger only takes them a minute to dig two and a half foot hole.  Materials and uses  There are two types of post hole diggers, a clam-shell post hole digger, and the auger style post hole digger. Both styles use metal for the head of the tool and bolts that hold it together. Often the shovel-like head of the clam-shell diggers is sharpened at the end to penetrate the dirt and cut a hole that is round and even. The Auger style post hole diggers have metal screw-like heads that cut into the dirt and a shaft that goes up to a wooden handle for turning manually. They may also have a steel plate for attaching to a tractors PTO shaft or with a skid steer being attached with pins and hydraulic lines.

Biography Aarsleff was born on 14 August 1852 in Nyborg on the island of Funen. He trained as a wood carver with his father before going to Copenhagen where he studied at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts from 1872 to 1876, at the same time working in the studios of Theobald Stein, Vilhelm Bissen and Jens Adolf Jerichau. In 1876, he won the Academy's Small Gold Medal and in 1880, its Large Gold Medal. In 1881, he went abroad on a travel grant to further his studies, visiting Paris, Italy and Greece. Aarsleff's production of own works was relatively slow to get off the ground. He is best known for a number of statues and statuettes of young adults in a style influenced by Bertel Thorvaldsen and particularly bt Jens Adolf Jerichau. He also made decorative works for several large architectural projects, including the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek. From 1900 to 1912, he was engaged with the restoration of the sarcophagus of Margaret I of Denmark at Roskilde Cathedral.

During most of that period (1923-1934) it was the ruling party in the country making it the third longest-ruling party in the country after the Bulgarian Communist Party and the People's Liberal Party.  History  After the 9 June coup d'√©tat in 1923 its organizers from the Military Union and the People's Alliance tried to create a new party in order to ensure stable political and parliamentary basis for the new government. For that purpose they relied on the member parties of the Constitutional Bloc whose leaders were imprisoned by the government of Aleksandar Stamboliyski. After the dissolution of the Constitutional Bloc in the end of July and the beginning of August, the Democratic, the Radical Democratic and the United People's Progressive Party created a coalition Union for Democracy. On 10 August it united with the People's Alliance and formed the Democratic Alliance. In the next few months grew the discontent within the Democratic and the Radical Democratic parties caused by the centralization of the organization and its conversion into a single party and in the beginning of 1924 many of their members left the Alliance and reestablished the two parties. During its whole existence there were three distinct groups. One of them, led by Aleksandar Tsankov was connected with the formed People's Alliance, while the other two, headed by Andrey Lyapchev and Atanas Burov were linked to the traditional parties - the Democratic and the United People's Progressive parties. Those fractions were often in open conflict between one another which threatened the stability of the government several times. After the loss of the 1931 elections those contradictions became stronger and in the spring of 1932 the fraction of Aleksandar Tsankov left the party. After the ban of the political parties following the 19 May coup d'√©tat in 1934 the Democratic Alliance ceased to exist although some of its leaders remained politically active.

Japanese economic history, 1930‚Äì1960, v. 5. New York: Routledge, 2000. pp. 113‚Äì114 Three major proletarian parties emerged during 1926, all closely linked to trade union movements and the divisions between the trade unions were largely replicated in divisions between the political parties. The pro-communist trade union centre Hy≈çgikai backed the Labour- Farmer Party. The centrist Japan Labour Union League backed the Japan Labour- Farmer Party. The moderate Sodomei trade union centre backed the Social Democratic Party.Mackie, Vera C. Creating Socialist Women in Japan: Gender, Labour and Activism, 1900‚Äì1937. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. p. 132 All these three parties were constructed on the notion of a worker‚Äìpeasant class alliance. Another proletarian party in the fray, the Japan Farmers Party differentiated themselves from this pattern by declaring themselves as a party 'by farmers, for farmers'.University of Chicago. Economic Development and Cultural Change. [Chicago]: University of Chicago Press, 1952. p. 197 There were also some local proletarian parties.Large, Stephen S. Organized Workers and Socialist Politics in Interwar Japan. Cambridge [Cambridgeshire]: Cambridge University Press, 1981. p. 124 In 1927, all three major proletarian political founded separate women's organizations. The Kanto Women's League, linked to the Labour-Farmer Party, was however disbanded after a few months on orders from the party leadership.Mackie, Vera C. Creating Socialist Women in Japan: Gender, Labour and Activism, 1900‚Äì1937. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. p. 134 The proletarian parties took part in the 1927 prefectural assembly elections, and their participation was closely watched. Together they had launched 216 candidates, out of whom 28 were elected (representing 1.9% of the elected assembly members). The Labour- Farmer Party garnered most of its vote from rural areas, whilst the Social Democratic Party and the regional proletarian parties got most of their votes from urban areas.Banno, Junji. The Political Economy of Japanese Society. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997. p. 239 The Labour-Farmer Party won 13 seats, the Japan Farmers Party four seats, the Social Democratic Party three seats, the Japan Labour-Farmers Party three seats and different local proletarian parties five seats. In the 1928 national Diet election, roughly half of the urban votes for proletarian parties went to the Social Democratic Party whilst roughly half of the rural votes for the proletarian parties went to the Labour-Farmer Party.Banno, Junji. The Political Economy of Japanese Society. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997. 242 The proletarian parties managed to win eight seats in the Diet. Overall, the election result was disappointing for the proletarian parties. Many of their prominent leaders failed to get elected. There are different possible explanations to the limited success of proletarian parties in 1928. They lacked the lavish electoral campaign budgets of the established parties. Nor were their leaders, with a few notable exceptions, very well known. Moreover, socialist ideas and movements were treated with a great deal of suspicion by many Japanese voters, limited the appeal of the proletarian parties. Furthermore, the electoral campaigns of the proletarian parties suffered from direct sabotage by state authorities. Police wound disperse electoral meetings, or arrest campaign workers arbitrarily.Large, Stephen S. Organized Workers and Socialist Politics in Interwar Japan. Cambridge [Cambridgeshire]: Cambridge University Press, 1981. p. 125 Considering the fact that each constituency elected 3 to 5 parliamentarians, the fierce competition between the different proletarian parties often resulted in none of them getting elected. Noticing the lack of coordination as an inherent weakness of the proletarian parties, the Social Democratic Party took the initiative to form a joint parliamentary committee. In July 1928, the Proletarian Masses Party was formed, by one former Labour- Farmer Party faction.Scalapino, Robert A. The Japanese Communist Movement, 1920‚Äì1966. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1967. p. 35 In December 1928 the Japan Labour-Farmer Party, the Proletarian Masses Party, the Japan Farmers Party and four regional political parties merged, forming the Japan Masses Party.Beckmann, George M., and Genji Okubo.

Mizutani criticized Oyama Ikuo for being too open towards a merger with the centrist sectors of the socialist movement. The Labour-Farmer Masses Party was largely confined to Kyoto. The party was one of the founders of the United Proletarian Party Front in 1929.

The invasion was carried out by Free French Forces supported by British and American ships and aircraft. According to the testimony of captured Germans, Allied activity had been observed on Corsica, thus the defenders were aware of the impending invasion 24 hours in advance. They resisted for two days before being given permission to withdraw to the mainland. Background The Allied 15th Army Group, commanded by General Sir Harold Alexander, captured Rome on and forced the German 14th and 10th Armies to withdraw into northern Italy.Tomblin, p. 379. This success was followed by orders for the invasion of southern France, Operation Dragoon. The 15th Army Group was asked to supply the majority of the troops for the landings. This reduced the U.S. 5th Army to five divisions. The whole of the 15th Army Group now only consisted of 18 divisions, and the reduction in strength put on hold any plans Alexander had of reaching the Gothic Line by August 1944. One operation they could still carry out was the invasion of Elba, which had initially been scheduled for 25 May, at the same time as Operation Diadem.Bimberg, p. 36. The landings had then been postponed because of the shortage of support aircraft and to allow the inexperienced French troops more time for training.Tomblin pp. 379‚Äì380. The objectives of the invasion were to prevent the Germans using the island as a forward outpost and to provide a gun position for Allied artillery to interdict traffic through the Piombino channel. It is not known if the Germans were aware of the Allied plans, but Adolf Hitler \\"attached great importance to holding Elba as long as possible.\\" On 12 June, the German commander in Italy‚ÄîField Marshal Albert Kesselring‚Äîwas informed that \\"Elba must be defended to the last man and the last cartridge.\\" On 14 June, German reinforcements started to arrive on Elba from Pianosa. The decision to reinforce Elba was not known to the Allies who believed the naval activity between the island and the mainland was in fact an evacuation.Tomblin, p. 380. Planning Rear-Admiral Thomas Hope Troubridge of the Royal Navy was in command of Force N, which would be responsible for landing the assault division. The division chosen for the assault was the French 9th Colonial Infantry Division, comprising the 4th and 13th Regiments Senegalese Tirailleurs, the Bataillion de Choc Commando, a Moroccan Goumier battalion and 200 mules. Because of the shallow waters large naval and transport ships could not be used. The only naval gunfire support would be provided by landing craft and and . The naval force would be formed into three groups: # Comprised Motor Torpedo Boats and PT boats. They would initially create diversions and land the French Commandos on the northern side of the island. Their objective would be the gun batteries located there. # Comprised five Landing Craft Infantry (LCI) and eight Motor Launches each towing a Landing Craft Assault (LCA). Their objective was four beaches on the south coast. # Comprised the main force, in nine LCIs, four Landing Ship Tanks (LSTs), and three Motor Launches towing Landing Craft Support (medium). The main landings would be on two beaches codenamed Kodak Amber and Kodak Green at 04:00. They would be followed at 04:30 by another 28 LCIs and after dawn by 40 LCTs, bringing in heavier equipment. In the briefing immediately prior to the landing, Troubridge said he expected the shore batteries to have been taken out by aerial bombardment and the commandos. He also said the garrison only consisted of about 800 men, mostly of non-German nationalities who were unlikely to put up much resistance. Invasion French 9th Colonial Division landing on Elba, 17 June 1944. On 16 June, the day before the invasion, German reconnaissance aircraft spotted two flotillas of invasion ships, but thought they were just the normal naval convoys between Naples and Bastia.Tomblin, pp. 380‚Äì381. To preserve the surprise, there was no pre-invasion bombing until the night of 16‚Äì17 June, when 26 Vickers Wellingtons bombed Portoferraio and Porto Longone.Craven, p. 400. The 270 ships of the invasion fleet arrived off Elba just after midnight on 17 June,Bimberg, p. 75. when ships from Group 1 disembarked 87 men from the Bataillon de Choc Commando in rubber dinghys half a mile (800 m) offshore of Cape Enfola. The naval group then started laying a smokescreen to create a diversion. At 03:15, three other boats started laying smoke north of Portoferraio. With the German gun batteries engaging a retreating PT boat, four others made toward Portoferraio to simulate landing craft approaching, firing salvos of rockets and dropping dummies overboard to give the impression of troops wading ashore.Tomblin, p. 381. In the south, the main invasion force was approaching the island when, at 03:38, a signal flare was fired and the Germans opened fire on the landing craft. The Royal Navy Commandos of Able 1 and Oboe 3 Commando with Able 2 in reserve landed at 03:50. They approached the beach toward their objective: the heavily armed German flak ship K√∂ln, which was berthed at Marina di Campo and had a commanding view of both beaches. This made its capture or destruction vital to the landings. The A1 Commando were assigned the task of capturing the ship, while O3 Commando would defend the jetty from any attack by German reinforcements. The two landing craft of the Royal Navy Commandos entered the bay of Marina di Campo and made for the flak ship. They came under heavy fire before one landing craft was hit and ran aground; the landing craft managed to get alongside the flak ship before also being hit by gunfire. The men of A commando quickly captured K√∂ln while O Commando secured the jetty. Both commandos now waited for the French to secure the village. The LCVPs carrying the French division beached right on time to be met by heavy machine gun and fire. By 07:00, the German defences in the hills above Kodak Amber beach had forced the incoming landing craft to lay smoke and withdraw. The heavy defensive fire forced the follow-up waves of landing craft to divert to Kodak Green beach, which caused some congestion on the beachhead. Delays and German gunfire kept some landing craft off shore until 14:00.Tomblin. p. 382. French troops enter Portoferraio, 18 June 1944 The Royal Navy Commandos‚Äîunaware of the diversion to the other beach‚Äîhad to wait some hours before the French cleared the village and reached them. It was during this time that the Royal Navy Commandos suffered their greatest losses. The commandos were under continuous artillery and small arms fire, which is believed to have set off two demolition charges on the jetty, blowing a hole in the concrete structure. The force of the explosions killed almost all the commandos and their prisoners. It also set fire to K√∂ln and exploded the ammunition stowed on board.Fevyer pp. 96‚Äì97. Within two hours of the landings, French commandos had reached the crest of the Monte Tambone Ridge overlooking the landing areas. Portoferraio was taken by the 9th Division on 18 June, and the island was largely secured by the following day. Fighting in the hills between the Germans and the Senegalese colonial infantry was vicious, with the Senegalese employing flamethrowers to clear entrenched German troops.de Tassigny, p. 45. On 19 June, the German commander asked for permission to evacuate what was left of his forces. By the evening on 20 June, they had successfully evacuated 400 men to the mainland.Tomblin, p. 383. Aftermath The invasion of Elba was of doubtful necessity. The advance of the U.S. 5th Army past Grosseto had made the continued occupation of the island by the Germans untenable. The Germans defended Elba with two infantry battalions, fortified coastal areas, and several coastal artillery batteries totalling some 60 guns of medium and heavy calibre. In the fighting for the island, the Germans lost 500 dead, with another 1,995 becoming prisoners of war. French losses were 252 killed or missing, and 635 men wounded, while the British lost 38 killed and nine wounded. General de Tassigny went on to command the French 1st Army in the invasion of southern France. This force fought through Europe to the Austrian border by the end of the war.Tucker, p. 76. There were attacks on civilians by French colonial forces after the invasion. According to Carabinieri reports, there were 191 rapes, 21 attempts including one on a boy, 11 murders and widespread looting; these events are known in Italy as \\"Marocchinate\\".

Rendered redundant by the car ferry revolution, she was sold to Italian owners in 1973. After conversion to stern-loading, she operated, as Ala in the Bay of Naples for 20 years. History Maid of Skelmorlie was the third of a quartet of passenger vessels ordered in 1951 to modernise the Clyde fleet, the second to be built by A. & J. Inglis, of Pointhouse. In September 1969, she was fitted out for the winter Kyles of Bute/Tarbert mail run from Gourock, acquiring small mail rooms forward of her saloon, and a temporary shelter over the galley for parcels and luggage. CSP took over this historic route from David MacBrayne Ltd from 1 October 1969. Her sister, was similarly modified. Layout MV Maid of Skelmorlie had a forward observation lounge and an aft tearoom, both with large windows. A lower deck lounge was later converted to a bar. Open deck space available for passengers was limited. The bridge was forward on the promenade deck, with a landing platform above, for use at very low tides. She had two masts and a single funnel, above the central engines, with the galley aft. Between 1973 and 1976, she was converted to a stern-loading ferry. Service MV Maid of Skelmorlie initially assisted on Gourock - Rothesay duties and developed the afternoon cruise programme. She often did Wemyss Bay - Innellan runs and, on Mondays and Fridays took late afternoon sailing from Craigendoran to Rothesay. She ran various weekend connections to Tighnabruaich and a Saturday cruise to Lochgoilhead/Arrochar. She became increasingly associated with Wemyss Bay and Largs and their connexions to Rothesay and Millport. In the late 1950s, the Maids lost their fixed routes and all operated across the Clyde network. They became progressively redundant as the car ferry revolution swept all before it. Maid of Skelmorlie spent more and more time laid up and was finally withdrawn at the end of the 1972 season and never wore the CalMac colours. In April 1973, she was sold to an Italian concern and sailed for the Mediterranean. She was converted to a stern-loading car ferry, and renamed the Ala. She had considerable success operating in the Bay of Naples, maintaining the Sorrento to Capri route for almost twenty years from early 1976. After the 1995 season, the Ala was laid up and took various charters: from 1997 to 1999 a winter cargo service to the Tremiti Islands in the Adriatic and in the summer of 2001 between Pozzuoli and the island of Procida, in the company of Capri Express, (ex ). As late as 2004 she provided scheduled ferry service between Naples and Sorrento for the Navigazione Libera del Golfo line. As of October 2014, she was laid up at the San Vincenzo wharf in central Naples.

A legal rule can be \\"clearly established\\" without commanding precedent existing. For example, in the United States, a governmental official is generally protected by qualified immunity if his acts were objectively legally reasonable, but such protection may not apply if, in light of pre-existing law, the unlawfulness of his conduct would have been apparent to a reasonably competent official, even if no commanding precedent applicable to his specific behavior existed. Such a precedent is called on all fours when all four parts of the instant (or present) case are essentially the same as the mandatory precedent, or are very similar: # The parties are the same, or have such great similarities as to have exactly the same standing. # The circumstances involving the two cases are materially the same, or are so similar as not to matter. # The issue is exactly the same, or if more than one issue exists, they are materially the same types. # The remedy the plaintiff or petitioner seeks is of the same kind as in the past case. By comparison, a case on point is one in which a case has factual circumstances and issues similar to the case being researched, but which has different parties seeking somewhat different remedies.

It was reissued in 1986 by Alpha Omega and ported to the Acorn Electron, BBC Micro, Commodore 16, Plus/4, and ZX Spectrum. Alpha Omega changed its name to The Power House shortly after publishing the game. Gameplay Lion of Nemean labour (C64) As Hercules, the player must complete the Twelve Deathly Labours of Hercules. The player traverses from each screen's starting point to its goal by jumping between platforms, moving along them, and climbing ropes. The platforms are not as they seem when the level begins. Some turn to fire when walked on (killing the player) and others cannot be seen until walked on. The game can begin with any one of eleven of the twelve labours (the twelfth is always kept until the end) and then every time the player dies or completes a labour, a different random labour begins. There are fifty screens in total. Release The original Commodore 64 version was first released in 1984 by Interdisc. Although it received good reviews, the publisher was short-lived and the game was not widely promoted. It was later picked up by Alpha Omega (part of the CRL Group) and reissued in 1986 (at the ¬£4.99 price point) when it was reviewed more widely. In late 1986, Alpha Omega became The Power House selling at the lower budget price point of ¬£1.99. The game was ported and released by The Power House for the ZX Spectrum in 1986 and the Acorn Electron, BBC Micro and Commodore 16/Plus/4 in 1987. The Power House release includes an audio track by H.E.X. on the cassette after the game data. Reception Personal Computer Games reviewed the Commodore 64 version on original release.

He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Princeton University in 1925 and a Bachelor of Laws from Columbia Law School in 1927.  Career  After graduating from law school, Wailes joined the United States Foreign Service. As a Foreign Service Officer, he alternated between field appointments and desk jobs at the United States Department of State in Washington, D.C. Overseas, he was posted in Nanking 1930-33; in Brussels 1936-39; in Ottawa 1942; and in London 1943-45. He married Cornelia Lyon on December 30, 1933. In 1945, he served as Special Assistant to the Director of the State Department's Office of European Affairs, and then as chief of the Division of British Commonwealth Affairs 1945-48. He became a Foreign Service Inspector in 1948, and Chief Inspector of the Foreign Service Inspection Corps in 1951. In 1953, President of the United States Harry Truman nominated Wailes as Assistant Secretary of State for Administration and, after Senate confirmation, he held this post from May 29, 1953 until June 22, 1954. President Dwight Eisenhower named Wailes United States Ambassador to South Africa on September 15, 1954, with Ambassador Wailes presenting his credentials on November 29, 1954 and holding that post until August 11, 1956. Eisenhower then named Wailes United States Ambassador to Hungary, with Ambassador Wailes receiving his commission on July 26, 1956. At the time of this appointment, the People's Republic of Hungary was ruled by the Hungarian Communist Party, under Prime Minister of Hungary Andr√°s Heged√ºs. The Hungarian Revolution of 1956 began on October 23, 1956, with crowds demanding the return of former Prime Minister Imre Nagy, who had pledged to lead Hungary out of the Warsaw Pact and promised democratic reforms. The next day, Nagy took over as Prime Minister. On the advice of Soviet Ambassador to Hungary Yuri Andropov, Heged√ºs fled to the Soviet Union and signed papers asking for Soviet intervention in Hungary to stop Nagy. Wailes arrived in Hungary on November 2, 1956. Soviet tanks entered Budapest on November 4, Nagy fled, and the pro-Soviet J√°nos K√°d√°r became Prime Minister of Hungary. The Hungarian Revolution ended on November 10, with the Soviets having succeeded in blocking any movement towards democratic reforms in Hungary. Wailes refused to present his credentials to the new government, stating that the government \\"did not represent the people.\\" Shortly thereafter he was \\"recalled for consultations\\" and left Hungary on February 27, 1957. Wailes spent 1957-58 as Deputy Commandant of the National War College. President Eisenhower then named him United States Ambassador to Iran and he served in that post 1958 to 1961. President John F.

After Nuremberg gained piecemeal independence from the Burgraviate of Nuremberg in the High Middle Ages and considerable territory from Bavaria in the Landshut War of Succession, it grew to become one of the largest and most important Imperial cities, the 'unofficial capital' of the Empire, particularly because Imperial Diets () and courts met at Nuremberg Castle. The Diets of Nuremberg were an important part of the administrative structure of the Empire. The Golden Bull of 1356, issued by Emperor Charles IV (reigned 1346‚Äì78), named Nuremberg as the city where newly elected kings of Germany must hold their first Imperial Diet, making Nuremberg one of the three highest cities of the Empire. The cultural flowering of Nuremberg, in the 15th and 16th centuries, made it the center of the German Renaissance. Increased trade routes elsewhere and the ravages of the major European wars of the 17th and 18th centuries caused the city to decline and incur sizeable debts, resulting in the city's absorption into the new Kingdom of Bavaria on the signing of the Confederation of the Rhine in 1806, becoming one of the many territorial casualties of the Napoleonic Wars in a period known as the German mediatisation.  Middle Ages  Nuremberg in 1493 (from the Nuremberg Chronicle). Old fortifications of Nuremberg Imperial Castle at Nuremberg St. Lorenz Church of the old city hall First evidence of a settlement in the Nuremberg area can be detected as early as the year 1050 BC. Later the Celts settled in the Nuremberg area, 400 BC. The area of the city of Nuremberg itself ‚Äî and especially today's old town ‚Äî has detectable traces of a settlement as early as the 9th century. At that time, present-day Nuremberg was on the border between the Bavarian and the stem duchy of Franconia. Nuremberg was probably founded around the turn of the 11th century, according to the first documentary mention of the city in 1050, as the location of an Imperial castle between the East Franks and the Bavarian March of the . From 1050 to 1571, the city expanded and rose dramatically in importance due to its location on key trade routes. King Conrad III established a burgraviate and the first administration and courts over the surrounding Imperial territories. The first burgraves were from the Austrian House of Raab but, with the extinction of their male line around 1190, the burgraviate was inherited by the last count's son-in-law, of the House of Hohenzollern. From the late 12th century to the Interregnum (1254‚Äì73), however, the power of the burgraves diminished as the Staufen emperors transferred most non-military powers to a castellan, with the city administration and the municipal courts handed over to an Imperial mayor () from 1173/74. This castellan not only administered the imperial lands surrounding Nuremberg, but levied taxes and constituted the highest judicial court in matters relating to poaching and forestry; he also was the appointed protector of the various ecclesiastical establishments, churches and monasteries, even of the Prince-Bishopric of Bamberg. The privileges of this castellanship were transferred to the city during the late-14th and early-15th centuries. The strained relations between the burgraves and the castellan finally broke out into open enmity, which greatly influenced the history of the city. Nuremberg is often referred to as having been the 'unofficial capital' of the Holy Roman Empire, particularly because Imperial Diets () and courts met at Nuremberg Castle. The Diets of Nuremberg were an important part of the administrative structure of the empire. The increasing demands of the royal court and the increasing importance of the city attracted increased trade and commerce to Nuremberg, supported by the Hohenstaufen emperors. Frederick II (reigned 1212‚Äì50) granted the (\\"Great Letter of Freedom\\") in 1219, including town rights, Imperial immediacy (), the privilege to mint coins, and an independent customs policy, almost wholly removing the city from the purview of the burgraves. Nuremberg soon became, with Augsburg, one of the two great trade centers on the route from Italy to Northern Europe. In 1298, the Jews of the town were accused of having desecrated the host and 698 were slain in one of the many massacres. Behind the massacre in 1298 was also the desire to combine the northern and southern parts of the city, which were divided by the river. Jews had been settled in that flood-prone area, but as the city leaders realised, this center of town was crucial to its future development. Hence, they decided that the Jewish population had to be removed. This area is now the place of the city market, the and the . The largest gains for Nuremberg were in the 14th century, with Louis the Bavarian (reigned 1314‚Äì47) and Charles IV (reigned 1346‚Äì78) expanding the city's powers and granting improved customs privileges. Charles's Golden Bull of 1356 named Nuremberg as the city where newly elected kings of Germany must hold their first Imperial Diet, making Nuremberg one of the three highest cities of the Empire, along with Frankfurt, where kings were elected, and Aachen, where Emperors were crowned and which had been the capital of the old Frankish Empire. The royal and Imperial connection was strengthened when Sigismund of Luxembourg (reigned 1411‚Äì37) granted the Imperial regalia to be kept permanently in Nuremberg in 1423. These remained in Nuremberg until 1796, when the advance of French troops required their removal to Regensburg and thence to Vienna, where they found a new home. Charles IV had strong ties to Nuremberg, staying within its city walls 52 times and thereby strengthening its reputation amongst German cities. Charles was the patron of the , built between 1352 and 1362 (the architect was likely Peter Parler), where the Imperial court worshipped during its stays in Nuremberg. Until the mid-13th century, the Lesser, reigning, Council consisted of 13 magistrates and 13 councillors; towards the end of the century 8 members of the practically unimportant Great Council were added, and, from 1370, 8 representatives of artisans' associations. The members of the council were chosen by the wealthier class; this custom led to the establishment of a circle of \\"eligibles\\", to which the artisan class was strongly opposed since it excluded them politically. With the increasing importance of handicraft, a spirit of independence developed among the artisans, and they determined to have a voice in the city government. In 1349 the members of the guilds unsuccessfully rebelled against the patricians in the (\\"Craftsmen's Uprising\\"), supported by merchants and some councillors. This uprising was mainly political, with the agitators siding with the Wittelsbachs in the dispute over the German kingship between Louis's Bavarian heirs and the patricians, who sided with Emperor Charles. The result of this uprising was a ban on any self-organisation of the artisans in the city, abolishing the guilds that were customary elsewhere in Europe; the unions were then dissolved, and the oligarchs remained in power while Nuremberg was a free city. Charles IV conferred upon the city the right to conclude alliances independently, thereby placing it upon a politically equal footing with the princes of the empire. The city protected itself from hostile attacks by a wall and successfully defended its extensive trade against the burgraves. Frequent fights took place with the burgraves without, however, inflicting lasting damage upon the city. After the castle had been destroyed by fire in 1420 during a feud between Frederick IV (since 1417 margrave of Brandenburg) and the duke of Bavaria-Ingolstadt, the ruins and the forest belonging to the castle were purchased by the city (1427), resulting in the city's total sovereignty within its borders; The castle had been ceded to the city by Emperor Sigismund in 1422, on the sole condition that the Imperial suite of rooms be reserved for the Emperor's use. Through these and other acquisitions the city accumulated considerable territory. In 1431, the population was about 22,800 including 7146 persons qualified to bear arms, 381 secular and regular priests, 744 Jews and non-citizens. As an emerging regional power, however Nuremberg soon came into conflict with the old dynasty, the former burgraves, who had brought large areas of the region around the city under their control as the Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach and Elector of Brandenburg. This conflict came to a head in the First Margrave War in 1449‚Äì50, when Albert III Achilles, Elector of Brandenburg, tried in vain to restore his former rights over the city. The Hussite Wars, recurrence of the Black Death in 1437 and the First Margrave War had reduced the city's population to 20,800 by 1450.  Early modern age  Albrecht D√ºrer's House Print of The Angel with the Key of the Bottomless Pit. Made by Albrecht D√ºrer in Nuremberg, 1498. Map of Nuremberg, 1648 The cultural flowering of Nuremberg, in the 15th and 16th centuries, made it the center of the German Renaissance. The years between 1470 and 1530 are generally regarded as the city's heyday. Nuremberg traded in virtually all of the then-known world: (\\"Nuremberg trinkets go all through the land\\") and Nuremberg's wealth was known as \\"the Imperial Treasure Chest\\". The city's revenues were said to have been greater than those of the whole kingdom of Bohemia., referenced in History of the City of Nuremberg on the German Wikipedia. Nuremberg cities maintained trade offices in many cities, such as the in Frankfurt. The city government was exclusively run by about 50 wealthy patrician families who had an exclusive access to the \\"inner city council\\", such as the famous Tucher, Imhoff and Haller, a branch of the Welsers from Augsburg, and others, while newer families were also successful in trading. By the 15th century, more than half of the older families had extinguished and 22 new families were admitted to the \\"inner council\\". With the enactment of the dance statute of 1521, the circle of councilable families was finally established and the patriciate of then forty-two families was closed. Later, only very few further families were admitted. Among the ruling patricians were also the Behaim, Ebner von Eschenbach, F√ºrer von Haimendorf, Geuder von Heroldsberg, Grundherr, Gugel, Harsd√∂rffer (Harsdorf), Hirschvogel, Holzschuher, Koler, Kress von Kressenstein, L√∂ffelholz von Kolberg, Muffel, N√ºtzel, Oelhafen, Paumgartner, Peller, Pfinzing, Pirckheimer, P√∂mer, Rieter, Rummel, Scheurl, Sch√ºrstab, Stromer, Volckamer. Many of these wealthy families became important patrons of art. At that time, many notable artists lived and worked in Nuremberg, such as Albrecht D√ºrer (1471‚Äì1528), Martin Behaim (1459‚Äì1507) built the first globe and Peter Henlein ( 1485‚Äì1542) produced the first pocket watch. Also notable from this period are the woodcarver Veit Stoss (1447‚Äì1533), the sculptor Adam Kraft ( 1460‚Äì1508/09) and the master founder and sculptor Peter Vischer the Elder ( 1460‚Äì1529). Only literature was not as dominant as the other arts, but (lyric poet), playwright and shoemaker Hans Sachs (1494‚Äì1576) provides at least one major literary figure who lived at this time in Nuremberg. Nuremberg was one of the founding 27 territories of the Franconian Circle at the Diet of Augsburg on 2 July 1500. At the beginning of the 16th century, siding with Albert IV, Duke of Bavaria-Munich, in the Landshut War of Succession led the city to gain substantial territory, resulting in lands of , becoming the largest Imperial city in the Empire, acquisitions confirmed by Maximilian I in 1505. In 1525, Nuremberg accepted the Protestant Reformation, and in 1532, the religious Peace of Nuremberg, by which the Lutherans gained important concessions, was signed there. During the 1552 revolution against Charles V in the Second Margrave War, Nuremberg endeavoured to purchase its neutrality by the payment of 100,000 guilder; but Albert Alcibiades, Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach, one of the leaders of the revolt, attacked the city without declaring war and forced the conclusion of a disadvantageous peace. At the Peace of Augsburg, the possessions of the Protestants were confirmed by the Emperor, their religious privileges extended and their independence from the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Bamberg affirmed, while the 1520s' secularisation of the monasteries was also approved. The state of affairs in the early 16th century, Columbus's discovery of the New World and Dias's circumnavigation of Africa and the territorial fragmentation in the Empire led to a decline in trade and, thus, the city's affluence. The ossification of the social hierarchy and legal structures contributed to the decline in trade; under Leopold I (reigned 1658‚Äì1705) the patriciate was converted to a hereditary corporation, leading the merchant class to appeal to the Imperial counsellor, albeit unsuccessfully. During the Thirty Years' War it did not always succeed in preserving its policy of neutrality. Frequent quartering of Imperial, Swedish and League soldiers, war-contributions, demands for arms, semi-compulsory presents to commanders of the warring armies and the cessation of trade, caused irreparable damage to the city. The population, which in 1620 had been over 45,000, sank to 25,000. In 1632 during the Thirty Years' War, the city, occupied by the forces of Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, was besieged by the army of Imperial general Albrecht von Wallenstein. The city declined after the war and recovered its importance only in the 19th century, when it grew as an industrial center. Even after the Thirty Years' War, however, there was a late flowering of architecture and culture ‚Äî secular Baroque architecture is exemplified in the layout of the civic gardens built outside the city walls, and in the Protestant city's rebuilding of the , destroyed by fire at the beginning of the 18th century and considered a significant contribution to the baroque church architecture of Middle Franconia. After the Thirty Years' War, Nuremberg attempted to remain detached from external affairs, but contributions were demanded for the War of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years' War, the former amounting to 6.5 million guilder. Restrictions of imports and exports deprived the city of many markets for its manufactures, especially in Austria, Prussia and Bavaria, eastern and northern Europe. In 1790/91, the Bavarian elector, Charles Theodore, appropriated part of the land obtained by the city during the Landshut War of succession, to which Bavaria had maintained its claim; Prussia claimed and occupied part of the territory in 1796. Realising its weakness, the city asked to be incorporated into Prussia but Frederick William II refused, fearing to offend Austria, Russia and France. At the Imperial diet in 1803, the independence of Nuremberg was affirmed, but on the signing of the Confederation of the Rhine on 12 July 1806, it was agreed to hand the city over to Bavaria from 8 September; its population was then 25,200 and its public debt totalled 12.5 million guilder, with Bavaria guaranteeing their amortisation.

Nuremberger coat of arms at the entrance to Lichtenau castle. The Imperial City comprised some , making it one of the largest imperial cities territories; after the Imperial City of Bern left to join the Old Swiss Confederacy in 1353, only the Imperial Cities of Ulm and Strasbourg had anything like the same amount of land. The area was divided into the Old and New Districts ( and ). The Old District, which also included Imperial forests (), was a conglomeration of lordships and possessions of Nuremberg burghers, monasteries and social facilities. That high justice (Zentgericht and Freigericht) was administered by the burgraviate ‚Äî and subsequently the margraviates of Brandenburg-Ansbach and Brandenburg-Bayreuth ‚Äî was a source of constant conflict. The New District is made up of the territory gained by Nuremberg in the Landshut War of Succession; in this territory, the city had full sovereignty. In 1790, around 25,000 lived with city walls and a further 35,000 in the extramural territories of the city. The territorial expansion of imperial cities since the mid-14th century had several general causes, all found in the case of Nuremberg ‚Äî the weakness of imperial power and an inability to maintain law and order; the debt crisis of neighbouring landed and knightly nobles in comparison with the capital income of the burgeoning urban middle classes; and the growing need for cities to secure an adequate supply of food for its inhabitants, raw materials for its craftsmen, and military self-protection. Before the end of the 18th century, with Bavarian and Prussian annexation of Nuremberger territory, the city territory was as described below: = Old District = The Old District was located mostly between the (\\"border waters\\") of , and . It included the suburbs of (since 1342 a burgravial fief of the family of Nuremberg, since 1477 a Nuremberg protectorate) and (part of the burgravial of , over which Nuremberg gained jurisdiction in 1427) as well as the and Imperial forests and the ; the forests were territory directly belonging to the Empire (). The fiefdom in the southern () Imperial forest was jointly held by the Nuremberg families of (acquired by Nuremberg in 1396) and (acquired in 1372); the northern () forest, including the , was held by the burgraves and, thus, was acquired by Nuremberg in 1427 when it purchased the burgravial holdings, including the castle and, importantly, the right of high justice. Whilst this was later disputed by the Hohenzollern margraves, the (\\"Imperial Chamber Court\\") confirmed these rights to Nuremberg in the in 1583, though it remained a constant source of friction. Before 1790, Nuremberg held the and seigneurial rights for both woodland of and in the Old District, the of and the of the fortress with the judicial office of . At the time, the high courts held jurisdiction over the Nuremberg farmers' courts, the forest courts of the two Imperial forests and the beekeepers' courts in . Within but especially outside of the Old District, there were also exclaves () that were indirect estates and possessions of Nuremberg citizens and of former religious institutions (such as the monasteries secularised by the city in the 16th century) and charitable institutions (in particular the ). These territories extended geographically from the and Franconian Switzerland in the north to the region of and in the south, from in the west to the arc of the Franconian Jura in the east. The (\\"Nuremberg rural alms \\") alone ‚Äî responsible, amongst other things, for the land of the former Nuremberger monasteries ‚Äî managed around 1790 properties in over 500 locations. In 1497, excluding the exclaves, the Old District available to Nuremberg, there were over 28,000 people, living in 5780 households in 780 towns. These tenants owed to the Imperial city allegiance, obedience, military service and tax obligations. = New District = In 1504/05, the New District comprised in the following places, all now in except where indicated: * * with , now in  , bought in 1503 now in ) * and , bought in 1505 and 1511 * , and * , now in * (now in ) was successively acquired, in 1347 by Nuremberger families and in 1536 by the city itself * , purchased in 1406, now in The structure of the Nuremberg resembles the administrative structure of the Electoral Palatinate and the duchies of Bavaria office structure prior to 1504. In 1513, the Nuremberg were placed under the newly created as an intermediate authority. In contrast to the Old District, the of the New District were demarcated with stones showing the limits of the city's judicial, financial and administrative powers exercised by the district. Only in the of and and extending into parts of the Imperial forests, did the margraviate deny high justice to the city authorities; the self-government of cities (from 1575 including the University of Altdorf), , , , and remained under Nuremberger administration. = Gradual mediatisation from 1790 = Prussian provinces of and in 1805, with Nuremberg just south of center, showing most of the city's erstwhile possessions now in hands. \\\\---- In both Margraves' Wars (1449/50 and 1552‚Äì54) and in the Thirty Years' War, the city's territory and its population were violently affected by quartering of troops, looting, troop movements and disease. After the ducal line of Bavaria fell extinct and the Electorate of Bavaria was inherited by Charles Theodore, Count Palatine of Sulzbach in 1777, the Electorate began to claim Nuremberg's exclaves in the Upper Palatinate as well as counting the of and into the County Palatine of for judicial and tax purposes. In 1790/91, the Electorate used its historic claim from before the Landshut War of Succession to occupy Nuremberger territories in what became known as the Bavarian Sequestrations (). Large parts of the , and and were now occupied, which led to corresponding tax losses for Nuremberg; protests to the Emperor and the Empire were in vain, due to the military-political situation at the time. The power-play over the Nuremberger legacy saw the Electorate providing goodwill and support to Revolutionary France in competition with Prussia, to whom the two Franconian margraviates had fallen in 1791. Since then, the Minister President of Prussia, (1750‚Äì1822), had been trying to create an integral Prussian Province of Franconia. When Prussia, in the course of her , had already claimed the margravial rights of high justice () over the Old District in 1796, Nuremberg was all but restricted to the territory circumscribed by town walls; Nuremberg retained the right of high justice only over the reduced and the exclaves within the Prince-Bishopric of Bamberg, also diminished by annexation by the Electorate. In 1972, most of the former territories of Nuremberg ‚Äî particularly those in the New District ‚Äî were reunited into the Bavarian of .

These rules set a high priority on attempts to resolve all matters able to be resolved by the parties, prior to hearing (or trial). The pleadings are contained in various Statements of Case - usually the Claim and any associated Particulars of Claim, the Defence, and an optional reply to the Defence. The Claim, Particulars of Claim, and Defence, are broadly equivalent to the Summons, Complaint and Answer filed in some other jurisdictions). The pleadings set out succinctly the claims made by each side, and their legal basis, and provide a basis to explore the issues in the case. They must specify the basic facts which are alleged, but need not evidence those facts or any extensive legal argument (these are addressed at later stages of the process). Some types of allegation must be expressly stated in the appropriate statement of case, if they will be alleged or relied upon at a later stage. Civil Procedure Rules The Civil Procedure Rules (\\"CPR\\") and their accompanying Practice Directions provide, within the framework of legislation, the detailed rules about how courts and cases are conducted. Mediation and other resolution efforts Formal proceedings should be preceded by an initial exchange of correspondence in accordance with the Practice Direction on Pre- Action Protocols. mediation and legally binding offers to resolve are also strongly encouraged and the applicable rules are set out within CPR. Such exchanges are not technically part of the pleading process, and parties are not encouraged to take points on any discrepancy between pre-action correspondence and the formal statements of case. Their function is to facilitate out-of-court approaches to resolving the dispute, or identifying the issues that divide the parties. The courts consider the genuineness of attempts to resolve the case by dialogue, when considering how costs will be bourne by the parties. Pleading in court There are three initial documents upon which a case is founded: a Claim and (in most cases) the Particulars of Claim, and the Defence. These are broadly equivalent to the Summons, Complaint and Answer filed in some other jurisdictions. They set out the case to be presented by each party, briefly but in sufficient detail to understand the legal issues in dispute and claims made by each party as a result. = Value of claim= The stated \\"value\\" on the Claim form excludes any costs and interest. It is generally worded to match one of the standard sums addressed in different kinds of court (\\"Not more than ¬£X\\" or \\"Not less than ¬£X and not more than ¬£Y\\", or \\"Cannot be said\\"). This statement of value is more administrative in purpose: it is generally used by the Court and other parties to gain an idea of the size of the case and how it should be administered (its \\"track\\"). The amount stated does not limit any award that the Court may decide to grant, or any other remedies that may be given, when the case is heard.PD 16.2 (5) and PD 16.3 (7) =Matters to be stated or included= The Rules and their Practice Directions (principally CPR 16 and its related Practice Direction 16) also set out various items which must be included in or served with statements of case in particular circumstances.

Defence The Defence (equivalent to an Answer) must state which allegations of the Particulars of Claim are admitted, which allegations are denied, and which allegations the defendant is unable to admit or deny, but which the claimant is required to prove.CPR 16.5(1) A defendant must give reasons for any denial, and must put forward his or her own version of events if different from the claimant's version.CPR 16.5(2) The Rules do not speak to affirmative defences (save that CPR PD 16 paragraph 13.1 requires the defendant to give details of the expiry of any limitation period relied on), but a concise statement of any facts relied on in support of any affirmative defence should be included in the Defence. The claimant may, but need not, respond to the Defence by means of a Reply. Further statements of case following a Reply are possible, but require the court's permission.CPR 15.9 Counterclaim Counterclaims, claims for contribution or indemnity against another party, and third party claims (collectively referred to as 'additional claims') are governed by CPR Part 20.

The idea is that a plaintiff and their attorney who have a reasonable but not perfect case can file a complaint first, put the other side on notice of the lawsuit, and then strengthen their case by compelling the defendant to produce evidence during the discovery phase. The FRCP does not entirely eliminate code pleading. The FRCP still requires that certain pleadings state facts with particularity. An example is Federal Rule 9(b) which states that \\"in alleging fraud or mistake, a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake\\".Federal Rules of Civil Procedure This is considered a special pleading rule. The purpose of this rule is to help prevent a person from abusing the judicial process to defame another without spelling out the specific circumstances surrounding the alleged fraud. Additional special pleading rules are set out in Rule 9 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The leniency of the modern notice pleading system sometimes resulted in poorly-drafted complaints with vaguely phrased, incoherent and conclusory allegations. The Supreme Court eventually responded in 2007 with a decision in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, and again in 2009 with a decision in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, which together imposed new standards for specificity and \\"plausibility\\" in pleadings.Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007).Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009). Iqbal reaffirmed and broadened Twombly's ruling that a court need not accept a \\"legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation\\" or \\"naked assertions devoid of further factual enhancement\\". In Twombly and Iqbal, the U.S. Supreme Court sought to clarify the deceptively simple mandate of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), which states that a \\"pleading that states a claim for relief must contain...a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitle to relief[.]\\"Fed. R. Civ. P. 8. The Court interpreted Rule 8(a)(2) in Twombly to mean that a complaint must contain sufficient factual allegations to allow a district court to find that the claim is plausible. The Twombly court criticized the modern notice pleading standard derived from the landmark 1957 Conley v. Gibson decision, which had ruled that a complaint should not be dismissed at the pleading stage, \\"unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief\\".Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41 (1957). It is still not clear whether Iqbal will reduce federal court caseloads by allowing frivolous or weak lawsuits to be thrown out at the pleading stage, prior to the commencement of potentially expensive discovery. The Twombly and Iqbal decisions (often referred to collectively as Twiqbal) have the potential of denying plaintiffs with meritorious claims their day in court by raising insurmountable hurdles at the pleading stage.

It occurs in the drier rainforests, often on sandy soil derived from granite or sandstone, and is sometimes seen on old sand dunes. Taxonomy Petalostigma triloculare was first described by the Swiss botanist Johannes M√ºller Argoviensis in 1864. Petalostigma refers to the stigma which can be broadly flattened like a petal. \\"Triloculare\\" is derived from Latin and means three chambers, which in this case is obscure, as the fruit usually has four chambers. This species occasionally hybridises with Petalostigma pubescens.  Description  Petalostigma triloculare grows as a small tree up to 15 metres (50 ft) tall with a stem diameter of 25 cm (10 in). The trunk is somewhat swollen at the base, and the bark is a dark grey with some vertical cracks and fissures. The inner bark is very bitter to taste. Small branches are greyish brown, relatively thin with silky hairs. New leaf buds are furry, as are the leaf stems which are grey and about 5 to 7 mm long. The leaves are arranged alternately on the stem, 3 to 9 cm long, and 1 to 3.5 cm wide. They are a narrow elliptic shape, and smooth green above, and a felty dull grey below. The leaf veins are more easily seen above the leaf. = Flowers and fruit = Close up of leaves and fruit of long leaved Bitter-Bark Green or fawn coloured flowers form from October to January, though occasionally as early as July. Male and female flowers are on different trees. The male (but not female) flowers have a strong lemon scent. Three to five male flowers form on clusters from the leaf axils. Female flowers form singly. Flowers lack petals. The fruit is an orange/brown drupe, 10 to 17 mm in diameter with usually eight faintly seen vertical grooves. Inside is a (usually) four celled endocarp. There are one or two flattened orange/brown seeds in each of the four cells. Seeds are 5 to 7 mm long. Fruit matures from March to October. = Regeneration = The fruits open explosively, throwing out parts of the fruit as far as four metres away, and scattering the seeds more than two metres away. Germination starts after around five weeks and is complete after seven weeks, with a success rate of about 23%. Distribution and habitat This tree is distributed as far south as Woolgoolga in New South Wales, which has an average annual rainfall of 1,657 mm. However, it is also seen west of the Great Dividing Range near Coolatai and Yetman where the average rainfall is only around 640 mm. It grows as far north as Shoalwater Bay near the Tropic of Capricorn in central east Queensland.

Plot  After a long shift at the bar, which included serving a drunk demanding of sexual favors, art student Brianne O'Neill returns home longing for a good night's rest. Little does she know that she is being watched by a mysterious stalker, who even breaks into her house without her knowing. Around the same time, Justin Price arrives, a friendly psychiatrist from the bar who claims that he followed her home because she was being followed by the drunk. Believing that he scared away the stalker, Brianne shows her gratitude by taking on volunteer work at his hotline practice, despite her busy schedule. She makes a good start at the hotline, helping several people with their problems, and thereby impressing Justin and her colleague Rick Hernandez. However, it does not take long before she is receiving scary phone calls from a mysterious person admitting to recent murders from the newspaper headlines and instructing her with game rules. Brianne is worried about the situation, but Justin and Rick believe that she is the victim of prank calls. Nevertheless, she follows the instructions of the psychotic caller, who calls himself 'The Barber', and tries to unravel his clues, which provides her a list of his victims. Despite other people's claims that she is reading too much into it, Brianne becomes obsessed with solving The Barber's clues. She starts to record his calls and another hint leads her to a deranged murder suspect in Reno, Charlie Jackson. Without gaining any information, she returns to the airport for a flight back home, and there she receives another call from The Barber. Failing to see a familiar face, Brianne returns home, where she concludes that the only ones who knew she was in Reno were Justin, bartender coworker Barnie and her boss Kyle Durham. Kyle is close friends with Tom Hunter, an actor who has been in love with Brianne for a long time. Afterwards, Brianne is fed up with The Barber's games and gets mad when he makes another call to her private number, which leads him to threatening to kill her. To prevent this from happening, she steps to the police, but The Barber informs her he knows about this and that he is not satisfied with it. Justin suspects Tom as the guilty one and collects evidence to prove it. Brianne is initially unwilling to believe Justin, until she one night at the bar concludes that Tom was on the spot during one of the murders. Suddenly, after the shift, Kyle reveals himself as The Barber. She struggles to escape, but he easily overpowers her and tells her that he wants to kill her because of the pain she is putting Tom through by not responding to his love for her. As Kyle starts cutting her hair and preparing to murder her, Brianne is able to run away and fires at him with a harpoon, which killed him. Finally, a frightened Brianne embraces Justin, the scene freeze frames then, the credits roll.

He played at the halfback position for the University of Michigan from 1952 to 1955. He was chosen as the Most Valuable Player on the 1953 Michigan Wolverines football team. He was the first sophomore to win the award. He also led the Wolverines in rushing in both 1953 and 1955. Early years in Flint Branoff grew up in Flint, Michigan, and played football for Flint Central High School in 1950 and 1951. He scored two touchdowns, including a 75-yard punt return against Kalamazoo Central High School as a senior. He was selected by the Associated Press to its All-Michigan football team in 1951. He tore cartilage in his left knee against Saginaw Arthur Hill during his senior year in high school, an injury that would affect Branoff throughout his football career. He was always outstanding in the Flint Northern Thanksgiving games. University of Michigan =1952 season= Branoff enrolled early at the University of Michigan in January 1952. As a second-semester freshman, he appeared in all 9 games for Michigan's football team on both defense and offense, including 6 games as the team's starting right halfback. He broke into the starting lineup after Frank Howell was injured. He scored his first touchdown in a 28-13 win over Indiana on October 11, 1952. The Associated Press noted, \\"Tony Branoff, Michigan's burly second semester freshman from Flint, Mich., came alive after the intermission and scored the touch down, that gave momentum to the Wolverines and a 14-6 lead.\\" In early November, he added a defensive touchdown as he recovered a fumble in the end zone against Illinois. He also scored a rushing touchdown in a come-from-behind win over Purdue in mid-November 1951. Branoff's best performance of the 1952 season came in a 49-7 win over Cornell on November 8, 1952; Branoff gained 88 yards on 14 carries for an average of 6.3 yards per carry. =1953 season= Branoff running with ball, 1953 As a sophomore in 1953, Branoff started all nine games for Michigan at the right halfback position. He also handled punting duties for the 1953 team. In the opening game of the 1953 season, Branoff ran for two touchdowns in a 50-0 win over Washington. In the second game of the season, Branoff ran for two rushing touchdowns and kicked two extra points to lead Michigan to a 26-7 victory over Tulane. At the end of October 1953, Branoff proved his value as a triple threat man as he \\"unreeled a spectacular 66-yard pass play\\" to Bob Topp. In the final game of the 1953 season, Branoff led the Wolverines to a 20-0 win over Ohio State with a career-high 113 rushing yards on 17 carries for an average of 6.7 yards per carry. Branoff outgained all five Ohio State backs in the game, and also scored a touchdown on an interception return against Ohio State. Branoff was the Wolverines' leading rusher in 1953 with 527 yards (averaging 5.2 yards per carry) and their leading scorer with 39 points (6 touchdowns and 3 extra points). Branoff also added 151 receiving yards and 1 receiving touchdown, 113 passing yards and 1 passing touchdown, 130 yards on kickoff returns, and 90 yards on punt returns. At the end of the 1953 season, Branoff was selected as the team's Most Valuable Player. His selection marked the first time that a sophomore was selected for Michigan's Most Valuable Player award. =1954 season= As a junior in 1954, Branoff was slowed by a knee injury. He played in the first two games of the season, but gained only 28 yards in 10 carries. He did not play in the Iowa and Northwestern games. Head coach Bennie Oosterbaan said the loss of Branoff would be \\"a big blow\\" but noted that he would not permit Branoff to play against Iowa because, \\"we'd rather lose all our games this season than have him injured for the rest of his life. His bad knee will heal all right if we give him enough time to rest.\\" Branoff attempted to come back from the injury in Michigan's homecoming game against Minnesota, gaining 38 yards on 6 carries and scoring his only touchdown of the 1954 season. The Chicago Daily Tribune described Branoff's performance against Minnesota as follows: > \\"For the brief visits he made to the workyard, Tony Branoff, senior right > half back who has been plagued with an ailing knee most of the season, was > outstanding. Tony scored the first touchdown on successive smashes on 9 and > 4 yards in the first quarter.\\" Branoff carried the ball only twice the following week against Indiana. In early November 1954, Branoff hospitalized due to his injured knee, and Michigan coach Oosterbaan announced that Branoff was lost for the season. Branoff believes he was the first football player to receive an injection of cortisone. However, the cortisone did not resolve the cartilage problem in his knee, and he underwent knee surgery after the 1954 season. =1955 season= As a senior in 1955, Branoff returned to the lineup, starting all 9 games for the Wolverines at the right halfback position.(\\"Branoff, playing with his left ankle still wrapped in protective tape, slammed his way to a pair of touchdowns Saturday to lead the Wolverine first stringers to a 47-6 scrimmage victory over the scrubs.\\") However, his mobility was limited because his knees were so heavily taped. He later recalled, \\"I was not the fastest player in the world, so I had to rely on being shifty. But you sort of lose your speed after you have operations and your knees need to be taped.\\" At the end of October 1953, Branoff helped lead the Wolverines to a come-from-behind win against Iowa. Iowa led 21-13 in the fourth quarter, but Michigan scored three touchdowns in the final nine minutes of the game. Branoff scored the final touchdown on a play described by the Chicago Daily Tribune as follows: \\"Tony Branoff, whose knees are wrapped like an Egyptian's mummy's, rounded out a fine performance with a 31 yard touchdown run that was only so much frosting on this triumph.\\" In early November 1955, Michigan lost its first game to Illinois by a score of 25-6. Branoff scored Michigan's only points with a 17-yard touchdown run in the second quarter and compiled 105 rushing yards on 17 carries for an average of 6.1 yards per carry. Despite the reduced mobility, Branoff was Michigan‚Äôs rushing leader for the second time in three years with 387 rushing yards, an average of 4.5 yards per carry, and 3 rushing touchdowns. After the 1955 season, Branoff was selected by the United Press as a first-team All-Big Ten halfback. He was also selected to play in the East‚ÄìWest Shrine Game and scored a touchdown on a 7-yard run left end run in the fourth quarter. Professional football Branoff was selected by the Chicago Cardinals in the 23rd round of the 1956 NFL Draft and signed with the Cardinals in May 1956. He was also offered $16,000 to play in the Canadian Football League, but he chose not to play professional football, because of worry over the condition of his knees. He eventually had both knees replaced at age 65. Later years After graduating from Michigan, Branoff worked in sales for 10 years. In 1966, he accepted a job with Cushing-Malloy book printers in Ann Arbor. He remained with the company for 37 years, retiring in 2003. In June 1956, Branoff was married to Marilyn Jane Frankensteen, daughter of former United Auto Workers leader Richard T. Frankensteen. Branoff and his wife had three sons, Anthony Branoff, Jr., and twins, Terry and Timothy. He was divorced from his wife in 1972 and did not remarry. Branoff died at his home in Saline, Michigan on December 20, 2012, at the age of 78. He was buried at the Sunset Hills Cemetery in Flint.http://www.obitmichigan.com/Obituary/14772/Antonios%20%22Tony%22-Branoff References Category:1934 births Category:Michigan Wolverines football players Category:Living people Category:American football halfbacks Category:Players of American football from Michigan Category:People from Flint, Michigan ","title":"Tony Branoff"},{"id":"28217035","text":"Everett Clarence \\"Dizzy\\" Nutter (August 27, 1893July 25, 1958) was a former professional baseball player.

The first pioneer to Spanish Guinea was Elise Lynelle (then Elise Schreiber) who arrived in Bata, Spanish Guinea (as it was called then), on 17 May 1954, and was recognized as a Knight of Baha'u'llah. In 1968 the first Local Spiritual Assembly of Equatorial Guinea was elected in Santa Isabel, (later renamed Malabo). The community has elected a National Spiritual Assembly since 1984. The community celebrated its golden jubilee in 2004. The Association of Religion Data Archives estimated some 3,500 Bah√° º√≠s in 2005. Beginnings = ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s Tablets of the Divine Plan=  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° wrote a series of letters, or tablets, to the followers of the religion in the United States in 1916‚Äì1917; these letters were compiled together in the book Tablets of the Divine Plan. The eighth and twelfth of the tablets mentionedAfrica and were written on 19 April 1916 and 15 February 1917, respectively. Publication however was delayed in the United States until 1919‚Äîafter the end of the First World War and the Spanish flu. The tablets were translated and presented by Mirza Ahmad Sohrab on 4 April 1919, and published in Star of the West magazine on 12 December 1919.  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° mentions Bah√° º√≠s traveling \\"...especially from America to Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia, and travel through Japan and China. Likewise, from Germany teachers and believers may travel to the continents of America, Africa, Japan and China; in brief, they may travel through all the continents and islands of the globe\\" and \\" ...the anthem of the oneness of the world of humanity may confer a new life upon all the children of men, and the tabernacle of universal peace be pitched on the apex of America; thus Europe and Africa may become vivified with the breaths of the Holy Spirit, this world may become another world, the body politic may attain to a new exhilaration....\\" =Establishment of the community= After the initiation of the Ten Year Crusade, initiated by Shoghi Effendi, head of the religion after the death of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, coordinated efforts to expand the religion across Africa. The first pioneer to Spanish Guinea was Elise Lynelle (then Elise Schreiber) who arrived in Bata, Spanish Guinea (as it was called then), on 17 May 1954, and was recognized as a Knight of Baha'u'llah. Because of legal segregation she was unable to meet black Africans. Instead she was able to introduce the teachings of the religion, to a Spaniard, Jose Ramos Espinosa, who accepted the religion. With his assistance she was able to stay in the country longer and in June she sailed to the island of Corisco as part of her new job. Here she met the elderly King of the island, Santiago Uganda Mdelo and his nephew, Edward Robinson, both of whom readily accepted the religion. King Uganda told Lynelle that he had had a premonition about someone who would come to him with a message. The Bah√° º√≠ Community in Equatorial Guinea came under the responsibility of the regional National Spiritual Assembly of North West Africa in 1956. In 1964 the constituent Bah√° º√≠ communities were reorganized as the regional assembly of the Bah√° º√≠s of West Central Africa, with its seat in Victoria, comprising the Bah√° º√≠s in the countries and places of Cameroon, Spanish Guinea, St. Thomas Island, Fernando Po Island, Corisco Island, Nigeria, Niger, Dahomey, Togo, and Ghana. Then in 1967 the National Spiritual Assembly of Cameroon Republic was elected with its seat in Victoria and oversaw the neighboring regions of Spanish Guinea, Fernando Po, Corisco, and S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe Islands. This was during a period of wide scale growth in the religion across Sub-Saharan Africa near the end of the period of Colonisation of Africa. Pioneers continued to arrive like Joseph Enonguene and Johanna Ngompex, who came from the Bah√° º√≠ community in Cameroon in the 1960s. In 1967 in Santa Isabel (later renamed Malabo), pioneer Hassey Ime lived and helped a community in Fernando Poo island (later renamedBioko) and reported an estimated community of at least twenty there. In 1968 the first Local Spiritual Assembly of Equatorial Guinea was elected there. American pioneers Mr. and Mrs. George Karch were also members of the community.

The national assembly was dissolved in 1975-6 by government action. The first citizen on Annabon a tiny island of Equatorial Guinea, joined the religion in early 1982. Jose Maria Fierro Cueto (also known as Dr. Pepe), came from Mexico to Equatorial Guinea in the 1980s to assist the Baha'i community. Following a change in government the national assembly was reformed in 1984. That same year it was invited to participate as an observer at the first \\"International Hispanic Congress of Culture\\" in Bata sponsored by UNESCO. The Bah√° º√≠ community also contributed a statement on topics of the congress like of the role of women in society and the importance of education and unity. The congress was designed to define a cultural aim for Equatorial Guinea and to help make that country better known around the world. Joseph Sheppherd was a pioneer to Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea, whose circumstances were woven into a book he later wrote which presents the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in a context of global change (see Bah√° º√≠ Faith in fiction) and delves into the dynamics of pioneering as a method to gain understanding of spiritual issues compared to social issues, to struggle with a cultural naivete. He served for two years as anthropological adviser to the government and curator of the National Ethnological and Archaeological Museum in Malabo., see also Modern community Since its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern. That involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics even then. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bah√° º√≠s were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bah√° º√≠ teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bah√° º√≠ socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. The modern Bah√° º√≠ community of Equatorial Guinea has multiplied its interests internally and externally along these lines. It sponsored a functional literacy course for women in Malabo and Bata starting in November 1996. Working with the Ministry of Women and Social Affairs, the community used Bah√° º√≠ Centers in Malabo, Baney, Luba, and Bata for the courses, which taught literacy as well as reproductive health, nutrition, and basic mathematics. In 2004 the community celebrates its golden jubilee celebrations. The national television channel, Radio Television Malabo, covered the event. A monthly magazine, La Gazzetta, later published an article about the celebrations. Bah√° º√≠ citizens of Equatorial Guinea were among those to gather in Yaounde, Cameroon, in a conference called for by the Universal House of Justice in 2008. =Demographics= In 2001 Operation World estimated 0.38%, or 1,720 people were Bah√° º√≠s‚Äîand growing at an annual rate of +4.2%. In 2004 there were four local assemblies in Equatorial Guinea.

Per Paul Eastham in the accompanying DVD for the album \\"'10'\\", Coast was originally intended to be a studio-only project. But due to the positive online reaction to the title track, a live lineup was soon assembled. Coast performed their first live show at the Storm Club in Leicester Square, London, on 12 March 2008. In May 2009, Coast was asked to record the official single for \\"Saints Aid\\", a charity event organized by Southampton Football Club fans to raise funds to keep the club from going into liquidation.

Dancing With Satellites was officially released on 21 July 2014. Later that year, Eastham collaborated with opera singer Tony Henry to compose, record and produce the EP Percosi. In 2015, Eastham released, in CD format only, the solo album Iron Horse. Windmills In The Sky On 6 March 2016, the band announced that they had started work on a third studio album, to be called Windmills in the Sky. The album was planned for release in early 2017. At the same time, the band announced that ex-Wolfstone drummer Graeme \\"Mop\\" Youngson had joined the band. It was also announced that they were relocating from Southampton, England to Oban, Scotland. In August 2016, Murray left the band to concentrate on other musical projects. Finlay Wells took over on lead guitar in the band while also playing bass guitar on studio recordings. On 3 January 2017, Coast released a radio edit of the track \\"River\\" for radio airplay only, from their forthcoming album Windmills in the Sky. On 31 January 2017, Windmills in the Sky, was pre- released to their fan base who had signed up for pre-order. An official public release was planned for later in 2017. Coast embarked on a tour of Denmark in January and February 2017 with Midge Ure bassist Dave Williamson joining the live lineup. Youngson and Williamson departed the band in early 2018. 10 In late 2018, the band began laying the groundwork for a special album and DVD package to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the release of their debut eponymous album. The album, entitled 10, featured two brand new tracks, \\"Who Loves You Now\\" and \\"Drift Away\\". Two of the tracks, though not new, had never before been featured on a Coast full-length album (\\"I Wanna Sing With The Boss\\" and the Finlay Wells-penned \\"Lament For Nick\\"). The rest of the tracks were new recordings of previous songs reflecting how they were now being played live. Coast toured in the summer and fall of 2019 in Germany, Denmark and Sweden in support of the album. By now, the permanent members of the band were Paul Eastham, Chris Barnes and Finlay Wells.

A licensee of the Daft System, the line struggled with difficult terrain, required expensive bridges, and failed financially within just 3 years of opening.  History  Chartered June 22, 1886, the Pittsburgh, Knoxville and St. Clair Street Railway Company began at Carson Street, followed South 13th south to a ramp http://www.lifeinwesternpa.org/viewDetail.asp?SpecSub=Cars%2CStreetcars&title;=Transportation+-%3E+Cars%2FStreetcars&ID;=119 which included a toothed rack system, and after crossing the Pittsburgh, Virginia and Charleston Railroad, ran to the top of the hill, then along the ridge line on Arlington Avenue to the city line at Brownsville Road. A contemporary account during construction put construction costs at between $140,000 and $150,000 per mile. While the line opened June 25, 1888, it was already in financial trouble, and promptly stopped operating. 5 12-ton motors with the Daft propulsion design drew 16 foot trailers to haul passengers over a line with a maximum grade of 15.48%. The operation proved troublesome from the start. A motor failed and ran away with a car in tow, before derailing, wrecking at Pius Street near St. Michael's Church. At least one of the injured passengers suffered wounds which were initially considered possibly fatal. The line had not as yet been formally accepted from the Daft and Company firm which had been involved in its construction, and engineers from that company laid the incident at failure to lower the sprocket wheel to the rack system when the motor failed. Additionally, the route's terrain made its operation fragile: Snow was known to put it out of operation. While problematic, the line was considered to be a demonstration of the Daft system, and so it was little surprise that a number of pictures were posed. Of 7 pictures known to exist, six appeared in the Street Railway Review, and showed the rack system and the motor-trailer operation of the system. The line was locally considered to have failed by January 1890, due to issues with the conduit which ran down the center of South Thirteenth Street.. But by the end of the month, when the Knoxville Incline was planning to apply for the charter, the line had according to contemporary accounts just managed to resume normal operations.. By the time that incline opened in the summer of 1890, they had acquired a controlling interest in the St. Clair Electric Railroad. By December 26, 1890, the line failed, leaving the connecting Suburban Rapid Transit Co., another Daft system, without power, as that system lacked its own substation. At the demands of the creditors, the line was sold in 1892. The line was purchased by Murray Verner for $2,500 plus $60,000 due on the mortgage and $18,000 in receiver certificates. The Arlington Avenue portion of the line was subsequently used by the Pittsburgh & Birmingham Traction Company to provide service to the hilltop communities of Knoxville, Allentown and Beltzhoover. The line was abandoned on the hillside below Washington (now Warrington) Avenue. Verner was the president of the Birmingham Traction Company at the time of the purchase. At about the same time this line was acquired by Birmingham Traction, the adjacent Mount Oliver Incline was acquired, triggering a lawsuit over the legality of company with a street railway charter owning an inclined railway. This suit, combined with the purchase of the Pittsburgh, Knoxville & St. Clair Electric Railroad property which was then not operated, suggests the possibility that if the suit failed, the Birmingham Traction company would have an alternate connection to its extant hilltop lines prior to those lines being directly connected by rail down the side of the hill to the river valley below, but there is no documentation of this plan.

They are mostly made possible by the terms of the Open Game License and System Reference Document, which allows the use of much of the proprietary terminology of D&D; that might otherwise collectively constitute copyright infringement. While these rules lack the name D&D; or any of the associated trademarks, their intent is to have a playable experience similar to those older editions. History A portion of long-time D&D; fans prefer earlier editions to more recent ones and continue to play them. In addition, new games have been published which address the perceived inability of newer editions to preserve the tone of classic D&D; while still fixing some of the perceived rules issues of older versions. Castles & Crusades is one such example, utilizing the unified d20 mechanic from 3rd edition while dropping what the developers perceived as complications (Feats, Skills, Prestige Classes, etc.). Role-playing game publisher Matthew Finch was involved in the development of Castles & Crusades, serving as editor of the Player's Handbook, and was the initial author of OSRIC, which was afterward taken up by Stuart Marshall and released to the public in 2006 as a retro- clone of the first edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (1977‚Äì1989). The release prompted another game designer, Daniel Proctor, to write and release Labyrinth Lord in 2007, a more complete retro-clone of the 1981 version of the Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set and its accompanying Expert Set. The following year, Finch announced the release of Swords & Wizardry, a retro-clone of the original Dungeons & Dragons game. Many variants have appeared since the original release of OSRIC, as well as restatements of other editions of D&D; and other adventure role-playing games. The games are fostered and supported online by various forums and blogs, sometimes collectively referred to as the Old School Revival (OSR), but are also increasingly finding their way into brick and mortar game stores. Notable retro-clones =OSRIC= OSRIC, short for Old School Reference and Index Compilation, is a recreation of the first edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, and one of the most successful retro-clones. The initial version of OSRIC was released in 2006. The latest version, OSRIC v. 2.2, was released in 2013. =Labyrinth Lord= Labyrinth Lord (LL) is a retro-clone written and edited by Daniel Proctor and published by Goblinoid Games in 2007. LL takes its inspiration from the 1981 Basic Set edited by Tom Moldvay and the accompanying Expert Set by David \\"Zeb\\" Cook. Any adventure written to be played with classic D&D; can be run using LL with little or no adjustment. However, there are a few differences between the two games. It extends the rules so characters can advance to 20th level (the 1981 Expert Set only included levels up to 14). In addition, in a nod to Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, clerics receive spells at first level. =Basic Fantasy= Basic Fantasy is a retro-clone written by Chris Gonnerman that emulates, and is largely compatible with, the 1981 Basic and Expert sets. Its differences from B/X D&D; include d20-style ascending armor class and separation of character race and class.

Retrieved on 2008-08-09. =Swords & Wizardry= Swords & Wizardry (S&W;), developed by Mythmere Games, emulates the original 1974 edition of Dungeons & Dragons. Swords & Wizardry won the Silver for the 2009 ENnie Award for Best Free Product. There are three different versions of the game available. * White Box, a streamlined game emulating the rules and options of just the original 1974 boxed set without expansions, creating a play style omitting many elements that were later introduced to D&D.; * Core, which uses some expanded rules to include most classic game elements. * Complete, including nearly all of the rules and options added to the original game from supplements and articles. =Dark Dungeons= Dark Dungeons has as its primary inspiration the 1991 Dungeons & Dragons Rules Cyclopedia, with secondary inspiration (particularly for the cosmology of the default game setting) coming from the 1989 Spelljammer campaign setting. The name Dark Dungeons and the names of the sample characters (and their players) found in examples throughout the text are used in parody of the Chick Tract of the same name. Because Dark Dungeons emulates the Dungeons & Dragons Rules Cyclopedia, which itself contains collected and edited rules from the Basic, Expert, Companion, and Master sets published from 1983‚Äì1985, it is strongly compatible with most adventures and supplements designed for those sets. However, while Dark Dungeons does include rules for immortal level play, those rules are primarily inspired by the 1993 Wrath of the Immortals supplement to the Rules Cyclopedia and are therefore not readily compatible with adventures and supplements designed for the 1985 Immortals Set. =Mazes & Perils= Mazes & Perils RPG (M&P;) is a retro-clone developed by Wild Games Productions, emulating the 1977 version of the Basic Set edited by John Eric Holmes.

West Virginia, 78 U.S. (11 Wall.) 39 (1871), is a 6-to-3 ruling by the Supreme Court of the United States which held that where a governor has discretion in the conduct of the election, the legislature is bound by his action and cannot undo the results based on fraud. The Court implicitly affirmed that the breakaway Virginia counties had received the necessary consent of both the Commonwealth of Virginia and the United States Congress to become a separate U.S. state, and explicitly held that the counties of Berkeley and Jefferson were part of the new State of West Virginia. Background At the beginning of the American Civil War, Virginia seceded from the United States in 1861 over slavery,As one historian has noted: \\"[Southern soldiers] entered military service to defend rights that the Constitution bequeathed to them, the very same basis upon which their home states of Virginia and Alabama seceded from the Union: They acted to protect the institution of slavery. The Army of Northern Virginia fought for many reasons, but the events that led to its formation clarified the key factor of the Civil War: It was fought over slavery.\\" Glatthaar, 2009, p. 10. James M. McPherson agrees: \\"The claim that [Lincoln's] call for troops was the cause of the upper South's decision to secede is misleading. ... Scores of [pro- secession] demonstrations took place from April 12 to 14, before Lincoln issued his call for troops. Many conditional unionists were swept along by this powerful tide of southern nationalism; others were cowed into silence.\\" McPherson, 1988, p. 278. (emphasis in original) See also Freehling, 2007, p. 511-513, 526 (discussing pro-secession majority in the Virginia secession convention prior to U.S. President Abraham Lincoln's call for troops). but many of the northwestern counties of Virginia were decidedly pro-union.Rice and Brown, West Virginia: A History, 1993, p. 112.McPherson, Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era, 1988, p. 298. At a convention called by the governor and authorized by the legislature, delegates voted on April 17, 1861, to approve Virginia's secession from the United States.Rice and Brown, West Virginia: A History, 1993, p. 116. Although the resolution required approval from voters (at an election scheduled for May 23, 1861), Virginia's governor entered into a treaty of alliance with the Confederate States of America on April 24, elected delegates to the Confederate Congress on April 29, and formally entered the Confederacy on May 7. For President Abraham Lincoln, these actions proved that rebels had taken over the state and turned the machinery of the state toward insurrection. These individuals had not acted with popular support, and thus Lincoln felt justified later in recognizing the Reorganized Government. Unionist sentiment was so high in the northwestern counties that civil government began to disintegrate, and the Wheeling Intelligencer newspaper called for a convention of delegates to meet in the city of Wheeling to consider secession from the Commonwealth of Virginia.Rice and Brown, West Virginia: A History, 1993, p. 117-118. Delegates duly assembled, and at the First Wheeling Convention (also known as the May Convention), held May 13 to 15, the delegates voted to hold off on secession from Virginia until Virginia formally seceded from the United States.Rice and Brown, West Virginia: A History, 1993, p. 118-120.Randall, Constitutional Problems Under Lincoln, 1951, p. 438-439. Concerned that the irregular nature of the First Wheeling Convention might not democratically represent the will of the people, elections were scheduled for June 4 to formally elect delegates to a second convention, if necessary. Virginians voted to approve secession on May 23. On June 4, elections were held and delegates to a Second Wheeling Convention elected. These elections were irregular as well: Some were held under military pressure, some counties sent no delegates, some delegates never appeared, and voter turnout varied significantly.Rice and Brown, West Virginia: A History, 1993, p. 121.Randall, Constitutional Problems Under Lincoln, 1951, p. 441. On June 19, the Second Wheeling Convention declared the offices of all government officials who had voted for secession vacant, and reconstituted the executive and legislative branches of the Virginia government from their own ranks.Rice and Brown, West Virginia: A History, 1993, p. 121-122; Randall, Constitutional Problems Under Lincoln, 1951, p. 443-444. The Second Wheeling Convention adjourned on June 25 with the intent of reconvening on August 6.Rice and Brown, West Virginia: A History, 1993, p. 122. Francis Harrison Pierpont, Reorganized Governor of Virginia. The new Reorganized Governor, Francis Harrison Pierpont, asked President Abraham Lincoln for military assistance, and Lincoln recognized the new government. The region elected new U.S. Senators and its two existing Representatives took their old seats in the House, effectively giving Congressional recognition to the Reorganized Government as well.Randall, Constitutional Problems Under Lincoln, 1951, p. 453. After reconvening on August 6, the Second Wheeling Convention again debated secession from Virginia. The delegates adopted a resolution authorizing the secession of 39 counties, with the counties of Berkeley, Greenbrier, Hampshire, Hardy, Jefferson, Morgan, and Pocahontas to be added if their voters approved, and authorizing any contiguous counties with these to join the new state if they so voted as well.Rice and Brown, West Virginia: A History, 1993, p. 123. On October 24, 1861, voters in the 39 counties plus voters in Hampshire and Hardy counties voted to secede from the Commonwealth of Virginia. In eleven counties voter participation was less than 20%, with counties like Raleigh and Braxton showing only 5% and 2% voter turnout.Curry, Richard O., A House Divided, Statehood Politics & The Copperhead Movement in West Virginia, Univ. of Pittsburgh Press, 1964, pgs. 149-151Rice and Brown, West Virginia: A History, 1993, p. 140; McPherson, Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era, 1988, p. 298-299; Randall, Constitutional Problems Under Lincoln, 1951, p. 451-452. The ballot also allowed voters to choose delegates to a constitutional convention, which met from November 26, 1861, to February 18, 1862.Rice and Brown, West Virginia: A History, 1993, p. 140-141. The convention chose the name \\"West Virginia,\\" but then engaged in lengthy and acrimonious debate over whether to extend the state's boundaries to other counties which had not voted to secede.Rice and Brown, West Virginia: A History, 1993, p. 141-143. Added to the new state were McDowell, Mercer, and Monroe counties.Rice and Brown, West Virginia: A History, 1993, p. 143. Berkeley, Frederick, Hampshire, Hardy, Jefferson, Morgan, and Pendleton counties were again offered the chance to join, which all but Frederick County did. Eight counties, Greenbrier, Logan, McDowell, Mercer, Monroe, Pocahontas, Webster, and Wyoming, never participated in any of the polls initiated by the Wheeling government, although they were included in the new state. A new constitution for West Virginia was adopted on February 18, 1862, which was approved by voters on April 4.Rice and Brown, West Virginia: A History, 1993, p. 146. Governor Pierpont recalled the Reorganized state legislature, which voted on May 13 to approve the secession (and to include Berkeley, Frederick, and Jefferson counties if they approved the new West Virginia constitution as well).Randall, Constitutional Problems Under Lincoln, 1951, p. 452. After much debate over whether Virginia had truly given its consent to the formation of the new state, the United States Congress adopted a statehood bill on July 14, 1862, which contained the proviso that all blacks in the new state under the age of 21 on July 4, 1863, be freed.Rice and Brown, West Virginia: A History, 1993, p. 147; McPherson, Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era, 1988, p. 303-304; Randall, Constitutional Problems Under Lincoln, 1951, p. 460-461 President Lincoln was unsure of the bill's constitutionality, but, pressed by northern senators, he signed the legislation on December 31, 1862.Rice and Brown, West Virginia: A History, 1993, p. 149-150 The West Virginia constitutional convention had not adjourned sine die, but rather subject to recall. Every county except Webster and Monroe sent representatives to the session that convened on February 12, 1863 with Abraham D.Soper as its president.Gooden, Randall S. \\"Constitutional Convention of 1861‚Äì63.\\" e-WV: The West Virginia Encyclopedia. 08 December 2011. Web. accessed 16 and 18 August 2019. available https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/1566 After spirited debate concerning compensation for slaveowners whose slaves were freed (the matter ultimately being tabled), the convention amended the state's constitution on February 17 to include the congressionally required slave freedom provisions, and adjourned sine die on February 20.Rice and Brown, West Virginia: A History, 1993, p. 151.https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/1566 The state's voters ratified the slave freedom amendment on March 26, 1863. On April 20, President Lincoln announced that West Virginia would become a state in 60 days. Map of the political development of West Virginia. Counties in white are the original counties. Berkeley (red) and Jefferson (dark blue) Counties were the focus of Virginia v. West Virginia. Since they were under the military control of the Confederacy at the time, Berkeley, Frederick, and Jefferson counties never held votes on secession or the new West Virginia state constitution.Virginia v. West Virginia, 78 U.S. 39, 42. On January 31, 1863, the Restored Government of Virginia passed legislation authorizing the reorganized governor to hold elections in Berkeley County on whether to join West Virginia or not.Virginia v. West Virginia, 78 U.S. 39, 44-45. The reorganized legislature similarly approved on February 4, 1863, an election for Jefferson County (among others).Virginia v. West Virginia, 78 U.S. 39, 46. These elections were held, voters approved secession, and Berkeley and Jefferson Counties were admitted to West Virginia.Virginia v. West Virginia, 78 U.S. 39, 47-48. However, on December 5, 1865, the Virginia Assembly in Richmond passed legislation repealing all the acts of the reorganized government regarding secession of the 39 counties and the admission of Berkeley and Jefferson counties to the state of West Virginia.Virginia v. West Virginia, 78 U.S. 39, 48. On March 10, 1866, Congress passed a resolution acknowledging the transfer of the two counties to West Virginia from Virginia.Virginia v. West Virginia, 78 U.S. 39, 49. Virginia sued, arguing that no action had taken place under the act of May 13, 1862, requiring elections, and that the elections which occurred in 1863 were fraudulent and irregular. West Virginia filed a demurrer which alleged that the Supreme Court lacked jurisdiction over the case because it was of a purely political nature. Decision =Majority holding= Associate Justice Samuel Freeman Miller wrote the decision for the majority, joined by Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase and Associate Justices Samuel Nelson, Noah Haynes Swayne, William Strong, and Joseph P. Bradley. Justice Miller first disposed of the demurrer. He concluded that the demurrer could not be granted \\"without reversing the settled course of decision in this court and overturning the principles on which several well-considered cases have been decided.\\"Virginia v. West Virginia, 78 U.S. 39, 53. He noted that the court had asserted its jurisdiction in several cases before, including The State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations v. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 37 U.S. 657 (1838); State of Missouri v. State of Iowa, 48 U.S. 660 (1849); Florida v. Georgia, 58 U.S. 478 (1854); and State of Alabama v. State of Georgia, 64 U.S. 505 (1860).Virginia v. West Virginia, 78 U.S. 39, 54-55. Justice Miller then posed three questions for the Court to answer: :\\"1. Did the State of Virginia ever give a consent to this proposition which became obligatory on her? 2. Did the Congress give such consent as rendered the agreement valid? 3. If both these are answered affirmatively, it may be necessary to inquire whether the circumstances alleged in this bill, authorized Virginia to withdraw her consent, and justify us in setting aside the contract, and restoring the two counties to that State.\\"Virginia v. West Virginia, 78 U.S. 39, 56. Justice Miller then reviewed the various acts taken to reorganize the government of Virginia in 1861, and the various acts which the Reorganized Government and the United States took to create the state of West Virginia and extend its jurisdiction over the counties in question.Virginia v. West Virginia, 78 U.S. 39, 56-58. In answering the first question, Miller wrote, \\"Now, we have here, on two different occasions, the emphatic legislative proposition of Virginia that these counties might become part of West Virginia; and we have the constitution of West Virginia agreeing to accept them and providing for their place in the new-born State.\\"Virginia v. West Virginia, 78 U.S. 39, 58-59. There was no question, in the mind of the majority, that Virginia had given its consent. Although the elections had been postponed due to a \\"hostile\\" environment, the majority concluded that the Reorganized Government of Virginia had acted in \\"good faith\\" to carry out its electoral duties in the two counties.Virginia v. West Virginia, 78 U.S. 39, 59. In regard to the second question, Miller pondered the nature of Congressional consent. Congress could not be expected to explicitly give its consent to every single aspect of the proposed state constitution, Miller argued.Virginia v. West Virginia, 78 U.S. 39, 59-60. And clearly Congress had intensively considered the proposed state constitution (which contained provisions for accession of the two counties in question), because Congress seriously considered the slavery question regarding the admission of the new state and required changes in the proposed constitution before statehood could be granted.Virginia v. West Virginia, 78 U.S. 39, 60. This debate could only lead the Court to a single conclusion, Miller stated: \\"It is, therefore, an inference clear and satisfactory that Congress by that statute, intended to consent to the admission of the State with the contingent boundaries provided for in its constitution and in the statute of Virginia, which prayed for its admission on those terms, and that in so doing it necessarily consented to the agreement of those States on that subject. There was then a valid agreement between the two States consented to by Congress, which agreement made the accession of these counties dependent on the result of a popular vote in favor of that proposition.\\"Virginia v. West Virginia, 78 U.S. 39, 60-61. Miller now considered the third question. The majority held that although the language of the two statutes of January 31, 1863, and February 4, 1863, were different, they had the same legal intent and force.Virginia v. West Virginia, 78 U.S. 39, 61. Virginia showed \\"good faith\\" in holding the elections, Miller asserted. That the Reorganized Virginia legislature did not require vote totals to be reported to it and delegated the transmission of the vote totals to West Virginia was not at issue, Miller said. It gave the Reorganized Governor discretion as to when and where to hold the votes, under what condition the votes should be held, and to certify the votes. The legislature acted within its power to delegate these duties to the Reorganized Governor, \\"and his decision [was] conclusive as to the result.\\"Virginia v. West Virginia, 78 U.S. 39, 62. Were these votes fair and regular? The Virginia Assembly, Miller noted, made only \\"indefinite and vague\\" allegations about vote fraud, and unspecified charges that somehow Governor Pierpont must have been \\"misled and deceived\\" by others into believing the voting was fair and regular. Miller pointedly observed that not a single person was charged with fraud, no specific act of fraud was stated, and no legal wrongs asserted. The Virginia Assembly also did not claim that the state of West Virginia interfered in the elections. Absent such allegations, Virginia's accusations cannot be sustained, Miller concluded. But even if this aspect of Virginia's argument was ignored, Miller wrote, the Reorganized legislature had delegated all its power to certify to the election to Governor Pierpont, and he had certified it. That alone laid to rest Virginia's allegations.Virginia v. West Virginia, 78 U.S. 39, 62-63. \\"[She] must be bound by what she had done. She can have no right, years after all this has been settled, to come into a court of chancery to charge that her own conduct has been a wrong and a fraud; that her own subordinate agents have misled her governor, and that her solemn act transferring these counties shall be set aside, against the will of the State of West Virginia, and without consulting the wishes of the people of those counties.\\" =Dissent= Associate Justice David Davis wrote a dissent, joined by Associate Justices Nathan Clifford and Stephen Johnson Field. Davis concluded that Congress never gave its consent to the transfer of Berkeley and Jefferson counties to West Virginia.Virginia v. West Virginia, 78 U.S. 39, 63. By the time Congress did so (on March 10, 1866), the legislature of Virginia had already withdrawn its consent to the transfer of the two counties. Davis disagreed with the majority's view that Congress had consented to the transfer of the two counties when it debated the proposed West Virginia constitution. There was nothing in the debates to ever suggest that, he wrote.Virginia v. West Virginia, 78 U.S. 39, 64. What Congress agreed to was that the two counties should be offered the chance to join West Virginia by the time of the new state's admission to union with the United States. These conditions had not been met by the time of admission, and thus no transfer could be constitutionally made. Congress had not agreed to additional legislative acts of transfer, and thus they could not be made without Virginia's assent (which was now withdrawn). Assessment Former Justice Benjamin Robbins Curtis argued the case for the state of Virginia. When Virginia v. West Virginia first came to the Supreme Court in 1867, there were only eight Justices on the bench due to the death of Justice James Moore Wayne on July 5, 1867. The Court would not have nine Justices again until the resignation of Justice Robert Cooper Grier on January 31, 1870, and the confirmation of Justices William Strong (February) and Joseph P. Bradley (March) in 1870. During this three- year period, the Supreme Court was divided 4-to-4 as to whether it had jurisdiction over the case.Fairman, Reconstruction and Reunion, 1864-88, 1987, p. 625; Egger, \\"Court of Appeals Review of Agency Action: The Problem of En Banc Ties,\\" Yale Law Journal, November 1990, p. 475.Reynolds L. and Young, \\"Equal Divisions in the Supreme Court: History, Problems, and Proposals,\\" North Carolina Law Review, October 1983, p. 44. Chief Justice Chase delayed taking up the case until a majority emerged in favor of affirming the Court's original jurisdiction rather than seek a ruling on the issue. The acceptance of original jurisdiction in this matter is now considered one of the most significant jurisdictional cases in the Court's history.Fenn, \\"Supreme Court Justices: Arguing Before the Court After Resigning from the Bench,\\" Georgetown Law Journal, July 1996, p. 2478. It is noteworthy that former Associate Justice Benjamin Robbins Curtis argued the case on behalf of Virginia before the Court. He lost. Curtis, as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, had dissented from the holding in Dred Scott v. Sandford. Many in Congress questioned both the legality of the Reorganized Virginia government and the constitutionality of the creation of West Virginia.Davis and Robertson, Virginia at War, Kentucky, 2005, p. 151. Many scholars since have questioned the democratic nature of the Second Wheeling Convention, the legal and moral legitimacy of the Reorganized Government, and the constitutionality of the creation of West Virginia.McGregor, The Disruption of Virginia, 1922, p. 206-223; Randall, Constitutional Problems Under Lincoln, 1951, p. 437-444, 453; Cohen, The Civil War in West Virginia: A Pictorial History, 1996, p. 7; Hoar, Constitutional Conventions: Their Nature, Powers, and Limitations, 1987, p. 22-24; Ebenroth and Kemner, \\"The Enduring Political Nature of Questions of State Succession and Secession and the Quest for Objective Standards,\\" University of Pennsylvania Journal of International Economic Law, Fall 1996, p. 786; Donald, Lincoln, 1996, p. 300-301. But most lengthy scholarly treatments of the issue assert the legality of the Reorganized government. In Luther v. Borden, 48 U.S. 1 (1849), the Supreme Court held that only the federal government could determine what constituted a \\"republican form of government\\" in a state (as provided for in the Guarantee Clause of Article Four of the United States Constitution). Virginia was not alone in having two governments‚Äîone unionist, one rebel‚Äîwith the union government recognized by the United States.McPherson, Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era, 1988, p. 291-297. The Supreme Court had held in Luther v. Borden, \\"Under this article of the Constitution it rests with Congress to decide what government is the established one in a State.\\"Luther v. Borden, 48 U.S. 1, 42. As both the President and Congress had recognized the Reorganized Government, this provision was met and the entire process was legal.Lesser, Rebels at the Gate: Lee and McClellan on the Front Line of a Nation Divided, 2004, p. 78. There were precedents for such action as well. As one legal scholar has noted, Michigan was admitted to the union after irregular elections for three unauthorized constitutional conventions led to a request for statehood that Congress (eventually) granted in 1837.Jameson, The Constitutional Convention: Its History, Powers, and Modes of Proceeding, 1867, p. 186-207. Kansas, too, went through a highly irregular statehood process marked by violence, mass meetings masquerading as legislative assemblies, and allegations of vote fraud, but it was also admitted to the union. One widely cited legal analysis concludes that \\"the process of West Virginia statehood was hyper-legal\\". Indeed, to deny the legality of the Reorganized Government creates significant problems, two legal scholars have argued: \\"[It] follows, we submit, that 'Virginia' validly consented to the creation of West Virginia with its borders. Indeed, one can deny this conclusion only if one denies one of Lincoln's twin premises: the unlawfulness of secession; or the power of the national government, under the Guarantee Clause, to recognize alternative State governments created by loyal citizens in resistance to insurrectionary regimes that have taken over the usual governing machinery of their States.\\" Although the U.S. Supreme Court never ruled on the constitutionality of the state's creation, decisions such as those in Virginia v. West Virginia led to a de facto recognition of the state which is now considered unassailable.Barnes, \\"Towards Equal Footing: Responding to the Perceived Constitutional, Legal and Practical Impediments to Statehood for the District of Columbia,\\" University of the District of Columbia Law Review, Spring 2010, p. 18 n.138 West Virginia's first constitution explicitly agreed to pay a portion of Virginia's debt in helping build roads, canals, railroads, and other public improvements in the new state. But these debts were never paid, and Virginia sued to recover them. In the case, Virginia v. West Virginia, 220 U.S. 1 (1911), the state of Virginia admitted in its briefings the legality of the secession of West Virginia.Virginia v. West Virginia, 220 U.S. 1, 24-25.Ebenroth and Kemner, \\"The Enduring Political Nature of Questions of State Succession and Secession and the Quest for Objective Standards,\\" University of Pennsylvania Journal of International Economic Law, Fall 1996, p. 786-787. A second constitutional question arises as to whether the Constitution permits states to be carved out of existing states, whether consent is given or not. Article IV, Section 3, Clause 1 of the U.S. Constitution says: Should the phrase between the first and second semicolons be read as absolutely barring the creation of a state within the jurisdiction of an existing state, or should it be read in conjunction with the following clause (which permits such creation with the consent of the existing state)? If the former interpretation is adopted, then not only West Virginia but the states of Kentucky, Maine, and possibly Vermont were also created unconstitutionally. Virginia v. West Virginia was also one of the first cases to establish the principle that Congress may give implied consent, and that such consent may be inferred from the context in which action was taken.

The population distance correlation coefficient is zero if and only if the random vectors are independent. Thus, distance correlation measures both linear and nonlinear association between two random variables or random vectors. This is in contrast to Pearson's correlation, which can only detect linear association between two random variables. Distance correlation can be used to perform a statistical test of dependence with a permutation test. One first computes the distance correlation (involving the re-centering of Euclidean distance matrices) between two random vectors, and then compares this value to the distance correlations of many shuffles of the data. Several sets of (x, y) points, with the distance correlation coefficient of x and y for each set. Compare to the graph on correlation Background The classical measure of dependence, the Pearson correlation coefficient, is mainly sensitive to a linear relationship between two variables. Distance correlation was introduced in 2005 by G√°bor J. Sz√©kely in several lectures to address this deficiency of Pearson's correlation, namely that it can easily be zero for dependent variables. Correlation = 0 (uncorrelatedness) does not imply independence while distance correlation = 0 does imply independence. The first results on distance correlation were published in 2007 and 2009. It was proved that distance covariance is the same as the Brownian covariance. These measures are examples of energy distances. The distance correlation is derived from a number of other quantities that are used in its specification, specifically: distance variance, distance standard deviation, and distance covariance. These quantities take the same roles as the ordinary moments with corresponding names in the specification of the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient. Definitions =Distance covariance= Let us start with the definition of the sample distance covariance. Let (Xk, Yk), k = 1, 2, ..., n be a statistical sample from a pair of real valued or vector valued random variables (X, Y). First, compute the n by n distance matrices (aj, k) and (bj, k) containing all pairwise distances : \\\\begin{align} a_{j, k} &= \\\\X_j-X_k\\\\, \\\\qquad j, k =1,2,\\\\ldots,n, \\\\\\\\\\\\ b_{j, k} &= \\\\Y_j-Y_k\\\\, \\\\qquad j, k=1,2,\\\\ldots,n, \\\\end{align} where ‚ãÖ denotes Euclidean norm. Then take all doubly centered distances : A_{j, k} := a_{j, k}-\\\\overline{a}_{j\\\\cdot}-\\\\overline{a}_{\\\\cdot k} + \\\\overline{a}_{\\\\cdot\\\\cdot}, \\\\qquad B_{j, k} := b_{j, k} - \\\\overline{b}_{j\\\\cdot} -\\\\overline{b}_{\\\\cdot k} + \\\\overline{b}_{\\\\cdot\\\\cdot}, where \\\\textstyle \\\\overline{a}_{j\\\\cdot} is the -th row mean, \\\\textstyle \\\\overline{a}_{\\\\cdot k} is the -th column mean, and \\\\textstyle \\\\overline{a}_{\\\\cdot\\\\cdot} is the grand mean of the distance matrix of the X sample. The notation is similar for the b values. (In the matrices of centered distances (Aj, k) and (Bj,k) all rows and all columns sum to zero.) The squared sample distance covariance (a scalar) is simply the arithmetic average of the products Aj, k Bj, k: : \\\\operatorname{dCov}^2_n(X,Y) := \\\\frac 1 {n^2} \\\\sum_{j = 1}^n \\\\sum_{k = 1}^n A_{j, k} \\\\, B_{j, k}. The statistic Tn = n dCov2n(X, Y) determines a consistent multivariate test of independence of random vectors in arbitrary dimensions. For an implementation see dcov.test function in the energy package for R.energy package for R The population value of distance covariance can be defined along the same lines. Let X be a random variable that takes values in a p-dimensional Euclidean space with probability distribution and let Y be a random variable that takes values in a q-dimensional Euclidean space with probability distribution , and suppose that X and Y have finite expectations. Write :a_\\\\mu(x):= \\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\X-x\\\\], \\\\quad D(\\\\mu) := \\\\operatorname{E}[a_\\\\mu(X)], \\\\quad d_\\\\mu(x, x') := \\\\x-x'\\\\-a_\\\\mu(x)-a_\\\\mu(x')+D(\\\\mu). Finally, define the population value of squared distance covariance of X and Y as :\\\\operatorname{dCov}^2(X, Y) := \\\\operatorname{E}\\\\big[d_\\\\mu(X,X')d_ u(Y,Y')\\\\big]. One can show that this is equivalent to the following definition: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\operatorname{dCov}^2(X,Y) := {} & \\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\X-X'\\\\\\\\,\\\\Y-Y'\\\\] + \\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\X-X'\\\\]\\\\,\\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\Y-Y'\\\\] \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\qquad {} - \\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\X-X'\\\\\\\\,\\\\Y-Y\\\\] - \\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\X-X\\\\\\\\,\\\\Y-Y'\\\\] \\\\\\\\\\\\ = {} & \\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\X-X'\\\\\\\\,\\\\Y-Y'\\\\] + \\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\X-X'\\\\]\\\\,\\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\Y-Y'\\\\] \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\qquad {} - 2\\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\X-X'\\\\\\\\,\\\\Y-Y\\\\], \\\\end{align} where E denotes expected value, and \\\\textstyle (X, Y), \\\\textstyle (X', Y'), and \\\\textstyle (X,Y) are independent and identically distributed. The primed random variables \\\\textstyle (X', Y') and \\\\textstyle (X,Y) denote independent and identically distributed (iid) copies of the variables X and Y and are similarly iid. Distance covariance can be expressed in terms of the classical Pearson's covariance, cov, as follows: :\\\\operatorname{dCov}^2(X,Y) = \\\\operatorname{cov}(\\\\X-X'\\\\,\\\\Y-Y'\\\\) - 2\\\\operatorname{cov}(\\\\X-X'\\\\,\\\\Y-Y\\\\). This identity shows that the distance covariance is not the same as the covariance of distances, ). This can be zero even if X and Y are not independent. Alternatively, the distance covariance can be defined as the weighted L2 norm of the distance between the joint characteristic function of the random variables and the product of their marginal characteristic functions:, Theorem 7, (3.7). : \\\\operatorname{dCov}^2(X,Y)= \\\\frac 1 {c_p c_q} \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^{p+q}} \\\\frac{\\\\left\\\\varphi_{X,Y}(s, t) - \\\\varphi_X(s)\\\\varphi_Y(t) \\\\right^2}{s_p^{1+p} t_q^{1+q}} \\\\,dt\\\\,ds where \\\\varphi_{X,Y}(s,t), \\\\varphi_{X}(s), and \\\\varphi_{Y}(t) are the characteristic functions of X, and Y, respectively, p, q denote the Euclidean dimension of X and Y, and thus of s and t, and cp, cq are constants. The weight function ({c_p c_q}{s_p^{1+p} t_q^{1+q}})^{-1} is chosen to produce a scale equivariant and rotation invariant measure that doesn't go to zero for dependent variables. One interpretation of the characteristic function definition is that the variables eisX and eitY are cyclic representations of X and Y with different periods given by s and t, and the expression in the numerator of the characteristic function definition of distance covariance is simply the classical covariance of eisX and eitY. The characteristic function definition clearly shows that dCov2(X, Y) = 0 if and only if X and Y are independent. =Distance variance and distance standard deviation= The distance variance is a special case of distance covariance when the two variables are identical. The population value of distance variance is the square root of : \\\\operatorname{dVar}^2(X) := \\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\X-X'\\\\^2] + \\\\operatorname{E}^2[\\\\X-X'\\\\] - 2\\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\X-X'\\\\\\\\,\\\\X-X\\\\], where \\\\operatorname{E} denotes the expected value, X' is an independent and identically distributed copy of X and X is independent of X and X' and has the same distribution as X and X'. The sample distance variance is the square root of : \\\\operatorname{dVar}^2_n(X) := \\\\operatorname{dCov}^2_n(X,X) = \\\\tfrac{1}{n^2}\\\\sum_{k,\\\\ell}A_{k,\\\\ell}^2, which is a relative of Corrado Gini's mean difference introduced in 1912 (but Gini did not work with centered distances). The distance standard deviation is the square root of the distance variance. =Distance correlation= The distance correlation of two random variables is obtained by dividing their distance covariance by the product of their distance standard deviations. The distance correlation is : \\\\operatorname{dCor}(X,Y) = \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{dCov}(X,Y)}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\operatorname{dVar}(X)\\\\,\\\\operatorname{dVar}(Y)}}, and the sample distance correlation is defined by substituting the sample distance covariance and distance variances for the population coefficients above. For easy computation of sample distance correlation see the dcor function in the energy package for R. Properties =Distance correlation= =Distance covariance= This last property is the most important effect of working with centered distances. The statistic \\\\operatorname{dCov}^2_n(X,Y) is a biased estimator of \\\\operatorname{dCov}^2(X,Y). Under independence of X and Y : \\\\begin{align} \\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\operatorname{dCov}^2_n(X,Y)] & = \\\\frac{n-1}{n^2} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{(n-2) \\\\operatorname{dCov}^2(X,Y)+ \\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\X-X'\\\\]\\\\,\\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\Y-Y'\\\\] \\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] & = \\\\frac{n-1}{n^2}\\\\operatorname {E}[\\\\X-X'\\\\]\\\\,\\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\Y-Y'\\\\]. \\\\end{align} An unbiased estimator of \\\\operatorname{dCov}^2(X,Y) is given by Sz√©kely and Rizzo. =Distance variance= Equality holds in (iv) if and only if one of the random variables or is a constant. Generalization Distance covariance can be generalized to include powers of Euclidean distance. Define : \\\\begin{align} \\\\operatorname{dCov}^2(X, Y; \\\\alpha) := {} & \\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\X-X'\\\\^\\\\alpha\\\\,\\\\Y-Y'\\\\^\\\\alpha] + \\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\X-X'\\\\^\\\\alpha]\\\\,\\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\Y-Y'\\\\^\\\\alpha]\\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\qquad {} - 2\\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\X-X'\\\\^\\\\alpha\\\\,\\\\Y-Y\\\\^\\\\alpha]. \\\\end{align} Then for every 0<\\\\alpha<2, X and Y are independent if and only if \\\\operatorname{dCov}^2(X, Y; \\\\alpha) = 0. It is important to note that this characterization does not hold for exponent \\\\alpha=2; in this case for bivariate (X, Y), \\\\operatorname{dCor}(X, Y; \\\\alpha=2) is a deterministic function of the Pearson correlation. If a_{k,\\\\ell} and b_{k,\\\\ell} are \\\\alpha powers of the corresponding distances, 0<\\\\alpha\\\\leq2, then \\\\alpha sample distance covariance can be defined as the nonnegative number for which : \\\\operatorname{dCov}^2_n(X, Y; \\\\alpha):= \\\\frac{1}{n^2}\\\\sum_{k,\\\\ell}A_{k,\\\\ell}\\\\,B_{k,\\\\ell}. One can extend \\\\operatorname{dCov} to metric-space-valued random variables X and Y: If X has law \\\\mu in a metric space with metric d, then define a_\\\\mu(x):= \\\\operatorname{E}[d(X, x)], D(\\\\mu) := \\\\operatorname{E}[a_\\\\mu(X)], and (provided a_\\\\mu is finite, i.e., X has finite first moment), d_\\\\mu(x, x') := d(x, x')-a_\\\\mu(x)-a_\\\\mu(x')+D(\\\\mu). Then if Y has law u (in a possibly different metric space with finite first moment), define : \\\\operatorname{dCov}^2(X, Y) := \\\\operatorname{E}\\\\big[d_\\\\mu(X,X')d_ u(Y,Y')\\\\big]. This is non-negative for all such X, Y iff both metric spaces have negative type. Here, a metric space (M, d) has negative type if (M, d^{1/2}) is isometric to a subset of a Hilbert space. If both metric spaces have strong negative type, then \\\\operatorname{dCov}^2(X, Y)= 0 iff X, Y are independent. Alternative definition of distance covariance The original distance covariance has been defined as the square root of \\\\operatorname{dCov}^2(X,Y), rather than the squared coefficient itself. \\\\operatorname{dCov}(X,Y) has the property that it is the energy distance between the joint distribution of \\\\operatorname X, Y and the product of its marginals. Under this definition, however, the distance variance, rather than the distance standard deviation, is measured in the same units as the \\\\operatorname X distances. Alternately, one could define distance covariance to be the square of the energy distance: \\\\operatorname{dCov}^2(X,Y). In this case, the distance standard deviation of X is measured in the same units as X distance, and there exists an unbiased estimator for the population distance covariance. Under these alternate definitions, the distance correlation is also defined as the square \\\\operatorname{dCor}^2(X,Y), rather than the square root. Alternative formulation: Brownian covariance Brownian covariance is motivated by generalization of the notion of covariance to stochastic processes. The square of the covariance of random variables X and Y can be written in the following form: : \\\\operatorname{cov}(X,Y)^2 = \\\\operatorname{E}\\\\left[ \\\\big(X - \\\\operatorname{E}(X)\\\\big) \\\\big(X^\\\\mathrm{'} - \\\\operatorname{E}(X^\\\\mathrm{'})\\\\big) \\\\big(Y - \\\\operatorname{E}(Y)\\\\big) \\\\big(Y^\\\\mathrm{'} - \\\\operatorname{E}(Y^\\\\mathrm{'})\\\\big) \\\\right] where E denotes the expected value and the prime denotes independent and identically distributed copies. We need the following generalization of this formula. If U(s), V(t) are arbitrary random processes defined for all real s and t then define the U-centered version of X by : X_U := U(X) - \\\\operatorname{E}_X\\\\left[ U(X) \\\\mid \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ U(t) \\\\right \\\\\\\\} \\\\right] whenever the subtracted conditional expected value exists and denote by YV the V-centered version of Y. The (U,V) covariance of (X,Y) is defined as the nonnegative number whose square is : \\\\operatorname{cov}_{U,V}^2(X,Y) := \\\\operatorname{E}\\\\left[X_U X_U^\\\\mathrm{'} Y_V Y_V^\\\\mathrm{'}\\\\right] whenever the right-hand side is nonnegative and finite. The most important example is when U and V are two- sided independent Brownian motions /Wiener processes with expectation zero and covariance (for nonnegative s, t only). (This is twice the covariance of the standard Wiener process; here the factor 2 simplifies the computations.) In this case the (U,V) covariance is called Brownian covariance and is denoted by : \\\\operatorname{cov}_W(X,Y). There is a surprising coincidence: The Brownian covariance is the same as the distance covariance: : \\\\operatorname{cov}_{\\\\mathrm{W}}(X, Y) = \\\\operatorname{dCov}(X, Y), and thus Brownian correlation is the same as distance correlation. On the other hand, if we replace the Brownian motion with the deterministic identity function id then Covid(X,Y) is simply the absolute value of the classical Pearson covariance, : \\\\operatorname{cov}_{\\\\mathrm{id}}(X,Y) = \\\\left\\\\vert\\\\operatorname{cov}(X,Y)\\\\right\\\\vert. Related metrics Other correlational metrics, including kernel-based correlational metrics (such as the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion or HSIC) can also detect linear and nonlinear interactions. Both distance correlation and kernel-based metrics can be used in methods such as canonical correlation analysis and independent component analysis to yield stronger statistical power.

According to the church's leader, \\"The outside is exactly the same as that which was built in Jerusalem\\",\\"Solomon's Temple replica to be built in Brazil,\\" Aug. 3, 2010, Jewish Telegraphic Agency. but with increased dimensions. Bishop Edir Macedo, the founder and leader of the neo-pentecostal church, at the time of construction explained that \\"We are preparing ourselves to build the temple, in the same mold as Solomon's. Solomon's Temple ‚Ä¶ used tonnes of gold, pure gold ‚Ä¶ We are not going to build a temple of gold, but we will spend tonnes of money, without a shadow of doubt.\\"\\"Solomon's Temple in Brazil would put Christ the Redeemer in the shade; Huge replica planned for S√£o Paulo would be twice the height of the iconic statue of Jesus in Rio de Janeiro Tom Phillips, July 21, 2010, The Guardian. Bishop Macedo has said that the temple is twice the height of Rio de Janeiro's Catholic-sponsored Christ the Redeemer statue. Inside the temple there is a replica of the Ark of the Covenant constructed according to \\"biblical orientations\\".  The Temple  The temple was officially inaugurated on July 31, 2014. The inauguration attracted thousands of worshipers including former Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff. The Temple serves as both a house of worship and as world headquarters for the Church. The mega-church seats 10,000 worshipers and stands 55 meters (180') tall, the height of an 18-story building. Its dimensions therefore far exceed the temple it replicates, described in the Bible as having the relatively modest height of some thirteen meters (\\"thirty cubits\\", 1 Kings 6:2). The majority of the temple space is devoted to the main sanctuary. The sanctuary is lined with pews imported from Spain, which face the main altar. The sanctuary has a conveyor belt system designed to carry tithes and offerings from the altar directly into a safe room. The main ceiling is adorned with 10,000 LED light bulbs which will form different patterns designed to look like stars. Keeping with the Jewish theme of the temple, the walls are adorned with menorahs, and the entrance features a large central menorah. The church spared no expense in designing the many other features of the temple. Aside from the main sanctuary, the temple also has 36 rooms for children's Bible school, with a capacity of about 1,300 children, radio and television studios, a museum about the original temple, and 84 apartments of differing sizes for bishops and pastors of the church. The 11-story complex includes outdoor features such as a helicopter landing pad, a garden of olive trees based on the Garden of Gethsemane near Jerusalem, and flags of several countries There is a parking lot able to accommodate 1,000 vehicles and 50 buses, classrooms for 1,300 children, and radio and television studios inside the building. One of the most prominent features of the temple is its large central altar. It features an exact replica of the Ark of the Covenant, built to the specifications described in the Book of Exodus. The structure is entirely covered in gold leaf. Behind the ark is the temple's baptistry, above the altar is 100 square meters of gold stained glass windows, and an inscription \\"Holiness to the Lord\\" In September 2019, Brazil's president Jair Bolsonaro visited temple to strengthen ties with UCKG.  Construction  The temple construction cost about US$300m; the original estimate in 2010 was $200m. It took four years to build. The building was designed by architect Rog√©rio Silva de Ara√∫jo. The temple takes up an entire city block, and 24 properties had to be purchased in order to create the space to build it. The project also required new traffic signals and other improvements to the surrounding streets to improve traffic flow.\\"Em troca de megatemplo, igreja vai fazer obras para aliviar tr√¢nsito no Br√°s, Eduardo Reina, 22 de Julio, 2010, O Estado de S.Paulo. Construction on the temple used 28,000 cubic meters of concrete and two tons of steel. The church also contracted to import $8m worth of Jerusalem stone from Israel. The stone was used to cover the central pillars of the temple, the entrance, and the center aisle. Macedo told the Guardian that \\"We have signed the contract and commissioned the stones that will come from Jerusalem, just like the ones that were used to build the temple in Israel; stones that were witnesses to the powers of God, 2,000 [years] ago.\\"  Jewish reception  Brazil's Jewish community has generally accepted the temple, with a bit of reluctance. Rafael Edad, Israel's ambassador to Brazil, stated during the end of the temple construction that \\"four years is too little time to build something so great, with so many details. It is great like Brazil, I have no words\\". Some have had more mixed feelings, such as Brazilian rabbi Nilton Bonder, who stated \\"on the one hand, there's the favorable way in which Jewish culture and history are treated in the structure, [but] on the other, there's the bizarre aspect of the project's dimensions and aggressive marketing\\".  Additional information  The Universal Church of the Kingdom of God was founded in Brazil in 1977. It claims to have 8 million communicants who live in 180 different countries. It has a television channel, Rede Record, and a weekly newspaper, Folha Universal, distributed free to 2.5 million households, according to Church officials who also say that Bishop Macedo's blog gets as many as 4 million hits per month.

The competition is normally held on the campus of Oakland University in Rochester, Michigan, although it has occasionally moved to other venues within the state of Michigan. Approximately 40 teams typically participate in this competition. Competition Overview The details of the competition change from year to year. In 2010 the competition included the following four events.‚ÄúOfficial Competition Rules‚Äù retrieved from http://www.igvc.org/rules.html on July 31, 2010. # Design Competition: The design competition includes a written design report, an oral presentation, and an examination of the vehicle. # Autonomous Challenge: The autonomous challenge is the major event. Qualification for this event is required. A fully autonomous ground vehicle must navigate an outdoor obstacle course. The course consists of a lane painted with white or yellow lines on a grassy field. Obstacles come in a wide variety of shapes and colors including barrels, cones, saw horses, and posts. The vehicles often use a camera to detect the boundary lines and a laser rangefinder to detect obstacles, although a variety of other approaches have been used. # Navigation Challenge: This event requires the vehicle to travel autonomously from a specified starting point to a sequence of destinations specified by latitude and longitude. Qualification for this event is also required. Various obstacles are placed around the course including a fence with a randomly relocated opening. # JAUS Challenge: The JAUS challenge is optional. This challenge requires a vehicle to demonstrate compatibility with the JAUS (Joint Architecture for Unmanned Systems) standard by receiving and responding to a specified list of JAUS commands from the judges. The competition is often sponsored by the United States Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) and the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI) in addition to other sponsors.

Talley and built in 1910 at the corner of West Main Street (now Old Main Street) and South Pine Avenue in Inverness, Citrus County, Florida. It is also known as Inverness Masonic Temple. As was common with American Masonic buildings of the time, the first floor was used for retail stores, while the second floor was used for professional offices and the third floor was used for the lodge hall and other Masonic uses. Over the years, the second floor also housed the city hall and a movie theater. After repairing the fire damage from a lightning strike in 1963, Citrus Lodge decided to build a new building at 301 Hendrix Avenue and vacated the premises in 1965. The building was then sold to a series of private owners. In 1990 the Board of County Commissioners rented the third floor for a few years. Recent uses include the building management office on the ground floor, bookkeepers, attorneys, insurance agents, therapists, tutor services and an AA Intergroup office on the other floors. In 1989, the Masonic Temple was listed in A Guide to Florida's Historic Architecture, published by the University of Florida Press. On October 20, 2000, the City of Inverness placed a commemorative plaque on the building. The building was purchased by the Drywell Group, LLC in 2006 and they proceeded to renovate and restore the interior and exterior. Wood floors and windows were refinished, period furniture, lighting, art, and paint colors were added throughout the building. The exterior brick was re- pointed or painted, windows were repaired and painted, and the metal cornice and Masonic sign were restored. A ‚Äúhistory walk‚Äù of the building graces the first floor hall and a small exhibit about the building renovation/rehabilitation is on the second floor. During the rehabilitation, an application was submitted to the State of Florida for recognition of the Masonic Temple's historic status and on June 23, 2010, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places. City of Inverness listing for Masonic Temple A Guide to Florida's Historic Architecture, 1989, Gainesville: University of Florida Press, p. 97, Today, the building is known as the \\"Masonic Business Center,\\" and the first floor continues to be used for retail shops, among them a Subway submarine sandwich shop.

It originally aired on Fox in the United States on September 26, 2010. The episode follows the citizens of Quahog after they are invited by actor James Woods to his stately mansion on a remote island. While there, a series of murders occur, and the group struggles to determine who committed the mysterious acts, before ultimately attempting to escape from the island, and avoid being murdered themselves. The episode borrows its premise and title from Agatha Christie's 1939 murder mystery And Then There Were None, while also serving as a parody of the 1985 film Clue. The episode was written by Cherry Chevapravatdumrong and directed by Dominic Polcino. It received high acclaim from critics, who praised its storyline and cultural references. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed in 9.41 million homes in its original airing. The episode features guest performances by Drew Barrymore, H. Jon Benjamin, Max Burkholder, Colin Ford, Patrick Stewart, Ashley Tisdale and James Woods, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. It was the first Family Guy episode to air in 16:9 and high definition. The episode was nominated for Outstanding Music Composition for a Series at the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards. \\"And Then There Were Fewer\\" was released on DVD along with two other episodes from the season on December 13, 2011. The show confirmed afterwards that it was part of the show's \\"real\\" canon and those characters that died (i.e. Diane Simmons, Muriel Goldman etc.) would not be brought back in the future. However, James Woods is seen in the thirteenth episode of season 10, \\"Tom Tucker: The Man and His Dream\\", in which he tells Peter and Tom that paramedics brought him to a secret science lab made for celebrities and revived him. Plot Most of the known residents of Quahog are invited to a dinner party by James Woods at his cliffside mansion, who states he has become a born-again Christian thanks to his new girlfriend, Priscilla, and wishes to repent for all his wrongdoings. Early into the night, as James and Priscilla go to the kitchen, Quagmire's new and embarrassing girlfriend, Stephanie, is mysteriously shot and killed when she sits in James' seat, leading the guests to believe that James intends to murder them all. They try to leave, but lightning from a thunderstorm strikes a tree, causing it to break the bridge while the causeway is flooded. After discovering that Stephanie's body has disappeared and returning amidst accusations, James pleads ignorance before he too is murdered in front of the guests by an unseen killer with a knife during a power outage, causing Priscilla to faint. Trapped on the remote estate with no way of contacting anyone due to the storm and being out of cell phone range, the guests realize that the killer is among them. The guests find a used gun that was timed to fire at the chair Stephanie was sitting in, leading them to deduce that it was intended for James and that Stephanie was killed by accident. While they search for clues in discovering the killer's identity, they realize that many of them have motives for wanting revenge on James. After finding and reading a notebook belonging to him in a secret room, Mort Goldman's wife, Muriel, disappears after it is discovered that she was being blackmailed by Woods into supplying him with free medicine, causing everyone to suspect her as the culprit. The guests split up into teams to search the mansion for Muriel. However, Muriel turns up dead soon after by being stabbed in the back with the same knife used to kill James. Suspicion is placed on Priscilla, who also disappeared during the commotion. Jillian's husband, Derek Wilcox, goes to an upper balcony to find a cell phone signal and contact the police, but as he gains a signal, he is murdered by the unseen killer with James' Golden Globe Award. The guests search everyone's rooms until they locate the bloodstained award and Priscilla's dead body in Tom Tucker's guest room. Tom is thus implicated as the killer and is chased and caught by Peter, Joe, Carl, Dr. Hartman, Quagmire, Seamus, and Mayor Adam West. Tom is arrested by the police and the guests prepare to leave. Lois goes to comfort Tom's co-anchor, Diane Simmons, only to intuitively realize Diane is the true murderer when Diane shows a dress for her solo debut on the news, even though Diane could not have known that Tom would be recently leaving. Diane reveals that she had secretly dated James until he dumped her on her 40th birthday, around which Tom arranged her to be replaced by a younger woman as co-anchor. Seeking revenge, Diane bribed Priscilla to make James become a born-again Christian and throw the dinner party so she could murder James and frame Tom for the crime. Her plan went awry upon Stephanie's accidental death, forcing Diane to kill Priscilla, Muriel and Derek at convenient opportunities. Diane also admits that she had nothing to do with the mysterious disappearance of Stephanie's body; a cutaway reveals that her body was taken by Quagmire for necrophilic purposes. Diane then attempts to kill Lois by forcing her outside to a nearby cliff, only to be shot and killed herself with a suppressed sniper rifle fired by Stewie, who proclaims himself to be the one who will someday kill Lois. Production and development The episode was first announced at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International in San Diego, California, on July 24, 2010, by series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane. It was directed by series regular Dominic Polcino and written by series regular Cherry Chevapravatdumrong shortly after the conclusion of the eighth production season, which completed its airing on television on June 20, 2010. The episode takes its title from the Agatha Christie novel And Then There Were None, and was largely based on the 1985 comedy film Clue. Series regulars Peter Shin and James Purdum served as supervising director, with Andrew Goldberg, Alex Carter, Elaine Ko and Spencer Porter serving as staff writers for the episode. Composer Walter Murphy, who has worked on the series since its inception, returned to compose the music for \\"And Then There Were Fewer\\". \\"And Then There Were Fewer\\" was the first episode of Family Guy to be broadcast in high- definition, with series showrunners Mark Hentemann and Steve Callaghan overseeing the transition. The episode was dedicated to series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane's mother, Ann Perry MacFarlane, following her death from cancer on July 16, 2010. The original idea of the episode was sent to series showrunner and executive producer Hentemann in a text from Seth MacFarlane simply stating \\"murder mystery.\\" \\"And Then There Were Fewer\\", along with the two other episodes from Family Guys ninth season, was released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on December 13, 2011. The sets include brief audio commentaries by various crew and cast members for several episodes, a collection of deleted scenes and animatics, a special mini-feature which discussed the process behind animating \\"And Then There Were Fewer\\", a mini-feature entitled \\"The Comical Adventures of Family Guy ‚Äì Brian & Stewie: The Lost Phone Call\\", and footage of the Family Guy panel at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International. In addition to the regular cast, actress Drew Barrymore reprised her role as Jillian Russell, the former girlfriend of Brian; actor James Woods, in his fifth appearance in the series, reprised his role as the overly exaggerated version of himself; actress Ashley Tisdale (who is known for playing Candace Flynn on Disney Channel's Phineas and Ferb, the show created by Family Guy alumnus Dan Povenmire) made her first official appearance on Family Guy as James Woods's girlfriend, Priscilla; and voice actor H. Jon Benjamin reprised his role as Quahog Market owner Carl. Additionally, actors Max Burkholder, Colin Ford and Patrick Stewart also guest starred in the episode in minor roles. Recurring guest voice actors Lori Alan, John G. Brennan, Nicole Sullivan, Jennifer Tilly, and John Viener reprised their roles as news reporter Diane Simmons, Quahog pharmacist Mort Goldman, Muriel Goldman, Griffin family neighbor Bonnie Swanson, and Jillian's husband, Derek Wilcox, respectively. A minor appearance was also made by Family Guy writer and regular voice artist Danny Smith. Cultural references Survivor host Jeff Probst was referenced in the episode. The episode borrows heavily from the 1985 comedy film Clue, the 1976 comedy film Murder by Death, and is largely based upon the 1939 Agatha Christie novel And Then There Were None. The opening scene of the episode is similar to that of Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. Once the Griffin family arrives at the mansion, Lois remarks on the estate's beauty, wondering if television host Jeff Probst has a similar home. As they walk into the mansion, Sir John Everett Millais's Ophelia is seen. As dinner commences, Carl begins conversing with Tom Tucker, and discusses the plot of the 1986 fantasy film Labyrinth, directed by Jim Henson. After Tucker is accused of murdering James Woods, he reveals that Woods talked him out of auditioning for the lead role in the 1984 hit horror film A Nightmare on Elm Street. The finger is then pointed at Mayor West, who tells the group of his hardships on the social networking service Twitter, after Woods stole his originally intended username. Diane Simmons also goes on to state that Woods had promised to introduce her to former CBS news anchor Dan Rather, but ultimately ended up introducing her to actor and comedian Danny Bonaduce instead. In the extended DVD release, Carl mentions No Way Out, Hard Rain and Days of Thunder. While searching for Muriel Goldman throughout the mansion, Brian and Stewie begin humming and singing the theme song to several television shows, including the CBS science fiction series Lost in Space, the CBS sitcom The Dick Van Dyke Show, and the ABC soap opera Dynasty. After discovering the Golden Globe Award underneath Tom Tucker's bed, Tucker begins to profess his innocence, with Peter then instructing him to \\"tell it to Mike Judge.\\" In the scene where Diane tells Lois her conspiracy, Picasso's painting Le R√™ve can be seen on the wall behind Diane. At the end of the episode, Seamus asks, \\"When we all see each other at school on Monday, are we still gonna be friends?\\" in a reference to The Breakfast Club. Reception \\"And Then There Were Fewer\\" was broadcast on September 26, 2010, as a part of an animated television night on Fox, and was preceded by the season premiere of The Simpsons, and Family Guy creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane's spin-off, The Cleveland Show. It was watched by 8.85 million viewers in its first half-hour, and concluded with a total 9.41 million viewers in its second half-hour, according to Nielsen ratings, despite airing simultaneously with the season premiere of Desperate Housewives on ABC, the season premiere of The Amazing Race on CBS and Sunday Night Football on NBC. The episode also acquired a 4.3 and 4.7 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, beating The Simpsons and The Cleveland Show in addition to significantly edging out both shows in total viewership. The episode's ratings were Family Guys highest since the airing of the season eight episode \\"Family Goy\\". \\"And Then There Were Fewer\\" received widespread acclaim from critics and viewers, with one critic calling the storyline \\"solidly funny, well-plotted, and nearly perfectly executed\\". In a simultaneous review of the episodes of The Simpsons and The Cleveland Show that preceded the episode, The A.V. Clubs Emily VanDerWerff commented that she enjoyed \\"the 'a bunch of people go to an isolated place and start getting killed' murder mystery subgenre\\", and that the episode \\"made fun of the conceits of the genre\\". In the conclusion of her review VanDerWerff called the episode \\"excellent and fun\\", and \\"full of surprisingly gorgeous animation and a nicely creepy feel that hung over all of the jokes\\" and rated it as a B+, the best rating between The Simpsons episode \\"Elementary School Musical\\" and The Cleveland Show episode \\"Harder, Better, Faster, Browner\\". Jason Hughes of TV Squad also praised the episode's writers for doing a \\"solid job of creating a genuine mystery throughout the hour, keeping us guessing as to who did it and what their motive may have been\\". Hughes went on to comment positively on the episode's numerous guest stars, and compared its portrayal of Diane Simmons to that of The Simpsons character Sideshow Bob. Natalie Zutter of Ology also praised the episode, calling it, \\"Surprisingly, the best of the evening.\\" In the summary of her review, Zutter wrote that it was a \\"fun murder mystery that lets us see all our favorite Quahog folks\\", while continuing to wonder whether the characters who were killed off would remain dead. \\"And Then There Were Fewer\\" has frequently been selected in lists of the show's best episodes. Tom Eames of entertainment website Digital Spy placed the episode at number 14 on his listing of the best Family Guy episodes in order of \\"yukyukyuks\\" ‚Äì compiled in 2017 to honor the 18th anniversary of the show ‚Äì and praised the interaction of characters who do not normally interact, writing, \\"We never thought we'd see Jillian's boyfriend Derek hanging out with Seamus the sea captain.\\" He expressed his shock at the death of characters such as Muriel Goldman and Diane Simmons and noted, \\"That's one way to cut some dead wood.\\" In 2019, Jesse Schedeen from IGN placed \\"And Then There Were Fewer\\" at number 12 on his list of the 20 best Family Guy episodes, to celebrate the show's 20th anniversary, stating, \\"It's always nice when an episode commits to its premise rather than drifting along and focusing more on cutaway humor. Another big part of the appeal with \\"And Then There Were Fewer\\" is the fact that it features so many recurring characters, many of whom had never appeared alongside each other before.\\" In that same year, Shawn S. Lealos from Screen Rant ranked the episode at number 4 on his listing of the best episode of every season of the series. Kevin Wong from GameSpot also named it among the 20 best Family Guy episodes.

While Ontario in 2010 had 1,200 active oil wells and 1,400 active onshore and offshore natural gas wells, there was no major shale gas production as of early 2011.

Gastem, one of the Utica shale producers, has announced plans to explore for Utica Shale gas across the border in New York state. The Utica shale is a black calcareous shale, from 150 to thick, with from 3.5% to 5% by weight total organic carbon. The Utica Shale play focuses on an area south of the St. Lawrence River between Montreal and Quebec City. Interest has grown in the region since Denver-based Forest Oil Corp. announced a significant discovery there after testing two vertical wells. Forest Oil said its Quebec assets may hold as much as four trillion cubic feet of gas reserves, and that the Utica shale has similar rock properties to the Barnett shale in Texas. Forest Oil, which has several junior partners in the region, has drilled both vertical and horizontal wells. Calgary-based Talisman Energy has drilled five vertical Utica wells, and began drilling two horizontal Utica wells in late 2009 with its partner Questerre Energy, which holds under lease more than 1 million gross acres of land in the region. Other companies in the play are Quebec-based Gastem and Calgary-based Canbriam Energy.

Protesters, who were concerned that the seismic testing could lead to hydro-fracking in their communities, came from various communities, such as Penniac, Taymouth, Stanley, Rogersville and several First Nations, and began singing traditional First Nations songs once the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) arrived.cbc.ca: \\"Seismic testing trucks blocked by protesters\\", 9 August 2011 SWN Resources, the Canadian division of Southwestern Energy of Houston, Texas, held at November 2011 more than 1 million hectares worth of petroleum licences in the province. As of November 2011, Corridor Resources owned five wells in the Elgin, New Brunswick area with viable levels of gas found in some cases. In November 2011, the New Brunswick Department of Natural Resources filed a complaint with the RCMP against Windsor Energy Inc. for allegedly violating the Oil and Natural Gas Act.gnb.ca: \\"Complaint filed against Windsor Energy for alleged violation of Oil and Natural Gas Act\\", 9 November 2011 The Calgary-based company was accused of directing a contracted company to conduct geophysical exploration within the boundaries of the town of Sussex, New Brunswick without the town's permission, according to a statement by Natural Resources Minister Bruce Northrup. Under regulation 86‚Äì191 of the Oil and Natural Gas Act, a municipality's written permission is required before geophysical activity can be conducted inside the boundaries of an incorporated municipality. Northrup has previously said it is clear Windsor Energy broke the rules and did so intentionally. Its contractor, Seismotion, originally asked for town approval to do tests within the community, and councillors arranged a special meeting in October, just ahead of the company's scheduled arrival, the department found, but when Seismotion crews arrived in Sussex two days ahead of schedule, the company decided not to wait for town consent.cbc.ca: \\"N.B. files RCMP complaint against Windsor Energy\\", 9 November 2011 Over the year 2012, SWN Resources increased its leasehold from 1 million hectares to 2.5 million hectares. It named new regions the Marysville Formation, the Cocagne Formation.competitive-energy.com: \\"New Brunswick Canada Shale\\", 10 December 2012 It appeared that the lower third or quarter of the province had by then been claimed. The province measures in total 7.165 million hectares. The Elsipogtog First Nation was subject to controversy when it protested with blockades the fracking activity of SWN Resources in 2013. This protest attracted international attention, and was one of the reasons why fracking was a major issue in the 2014 New Brunswick general election. A week before the 2014 elections, Windsor Energy sued Northrup and the Government because of the statements Northrup made in 2011 to the effect that Windsor violated the province's Oil and Natural Gas Act when it conducted seismic testing in the town of Sussex. Windsor claimed Northrup was libellous when he issued a press release in November of that year, following an incident in which a Windsor subcontractor did seismic tests along Highway 1 inside Sussex town limits. Northrup said Windsor did not have permission to do the tests and had violated the act. The province then filed a complaint with the RCMP. In the statement of claim, Windsor recounts how it was cleared by the RCMP and alleges Northrup's press release was false, misleading and defamatory, and that the negative publicity drove potential investors away from his company.cbc.ca: \\"Windsor Energy lawsuit against N.B. government linked to election\\", 15 August 2014globalnews.ca: \\"Energy company suing province for $105M\\", 15 August 2014 It was not immediately apparent how an apology issued by the company in 2011 to the mayor, councillors and people of Sussex would affect the suit. On 24 March 2015, the Gallant government appointed a three- member panel to study the hydraulic fracturing process and report back to cabinet within one year on whether the government's conditions for shale gas development can be met. Energy and Mines Minister Donald Arseneault said that the government has a responsibility to consider the controversial method of natural gas extraction as a possible way to create jobs. Gallant appointed Guy Richard, former chief justice of the Court of Queen's Bench, to lead the commission.cbc.ca: \\"Fracking commission appointed to study shale gas conditions\\", 24 March 2015 Richard is the father-in-law of Dominic LeBlanc, a federal MP and Gallant's campaign manager in the 2014 provincial election.stcroixcourier.ca: \\"Liberals put 53 political appointees on public payroll ‚Äì Apr. 23, 2015\\" The conditions of the government were reported to be: * if New Brunswickers at large approve, * if there is clear and credible information about the impacts of fracking, * if there's a plan to mitigate the impacts on public infrastructure and deal with waste water, * if there is a process to consult with First Nations, * and if there is a way to maximize the local benefits, such as royalties. On 29 May 2015, Richard stepped down as head of the commission, and was replaced by Marc Leger, a career civil servant and former clerk of New Brunswick's Executive Council.

He relocated to the United States with his family upon the outbreak of World War II. Batterberry attended the Carnegie Institute of Technology, but dropped out to move to Venezuela with his family, where his father was establishing P&G;'s presence in Latin America.

Accessed July 30, 2010. After his return to the U.S. in the 1950s, Batterberry worked as a freelance food writer. He married writer Ariane Ruskin, and the two of them were arts editors at Harper's Bazaar. They co-authored On the Town in New York, From 1776 to the Present, a historical gastronomic survey that covered the city's food history from banquets to Chinese takeout which was described by The Washington Post as being \\"considered the authoritative history of dining in the country's culinary capital\\".Schudel, Matt. \\"Michael Batterberry, 78, dies; editor of Food Arts magazine\\", The Washington Post, July 31, 2010.

Accessed July 31, 2010. With Robert and Lindy Kenyon covering the business side and with funding by Hugh Hefner, Batterberry and his wife started publishing The International Review of Food and Wine in 1978, which had a prototype issue published in Playboy. Later renamed simply Food & Wine, the magazine's mission was to be a more down-to-earth alternative to Gourmet and its \\"truffled pomposity\\", while appealing to both women and men as readers, with early issues featuring articles by such non-traditional food writers as George Plimpton and Wilfrid Sheed. When it was first published, a senior editor of Gourmet magazine scoffed at the new alternative, saying \\"We don't look at the others as competition. They look at us, try to copy us and fail miserably\\". By 1980, when it was sold to American Express, the magazine had circulation of 250,000 per issue, evenly split by gender, and had sold 900,000 copies a month by the time of his death. The couple started Food Arts in 1988, a trade journal aimed at restaurants and hotels, which was acquired by M. Shanken Communications the following year. Batterberry remained as the publication's editor in chief until his death, with his wife continuing as the magazine's publisher. He and his wife were recognized with the James Beard Foundation Award for lifetime achievement in May 2010. The foundation's president Susan Ungaro called the Batterberrys \\"legends in the culinary publishing world\\", having \\"started a hallmark magazine that people still look to today\\" after three decades in print.

Life Born in Paisley, Scotland, seven miles west-southwest of Glasgow, Hamilton was the eldest son of William Hamilton, a preacher and religious author of local renown.Robert Chambers, Thomas Thomson, A Biographical Dictionary of Eminent Scotsmen, Volume 3 (1875), p. 214-216. James Hamilton was therefore destined from an early age to enter the ministry, and to that end he studied at the universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh. He enjoyed courses on the natural sciences, particularly chemistry and botany, and contemplated a career in one of those fields. Although Hamilton enjoyed poetry, he once read a novel by Sir Walter Scott and had the following reaction: He became assistant to Robert Smith Candlish at St. George's Church in Edinburgh, in 1838, and upon finishing his college studies, he \\"commenced his clerical life as assistant minister in the small secluded parish of Abernyte, in Perthshire\\". Early in 1841, he relocated to Roxburgh Church in Edinburgh, and in July of that year became pastor of the National Scotch Church, Regent Square, London, where he would remain until his death. In 1849 he became editor of the Presbyterian Messenger, and in 1864 editor of Evangelical Christendom, the organ of the Evangelical Alliance. He was an incessant literary worker and the author of some of the most widely circulated books of his day. His best known works were: Life in Earnest (London, 1845), of which 64,000 copies had been sold before 1852; The Mount of Olives (1846); The Royal Preacher (1851), a homiletical commentary on Ecclesiastes; and Our Christian Classics (4 vols., 1857‚Äì59). Following his death, his collected works were published in London (6 vols., 1869‚Äì73); and his Select Works appeared in New York (4 vols., 1875). In addition to his religious writings, Hamilton continued to have an interest in botany throughout his life, publishing several articles in journals on the subject.Ray Desmond, Dictionary of British and Irish Botanists and Horticulturists (1994), p. 311.

Career The son of a postal worker, Anthony grew up in Pittsburgh. He got his first guitar when he was sixteen, taking lessons from a teacher in Pittsburgh who admired Andres Segovia, Oscar Moore, and Django Reinhardt. Through his teacher, Anthony met Joe Negri, who became a big influence. He joined a quartet and performed at clubs in Pittsburgh. His father suggested he join the Army so he could get a G.I. loan if he ever wanted to buy a house. In 1956, Anthony entered the Army in Special Services and played in a jazz band, first on double bass, then on guitar. When he returned home, he attended Duquesne University for one year, then moved to New York City. Lee Konitz, Warne Marsh, and Lennie Tristano frequently visited his house for jam sessions. He befriended Billy Bean, who he considered \\"the essence of what a jazz guitarist was supposed to be. He had the harmony things down, he could swing, he had great right hand technique, and he could read well.\\" He spent nearly every day with Bean playing jazz, and he studied classical guitar, though he used a plectrum. Through Negri he met Barry Galbraith, who found him a job with George Shearing. He became friends with Wes Montgomery after Montgomery visited a club one night where the Shearing band was playing. Gary Burton played vibraphone for Shearing during this time. When he left to work with Stan Getz, he recommended Anthony, but Anthony returned to Pittsburgh and formed a band. In 1965, Anthony moved to Los Angeles, working first in the big band of Tex Beneke. Through contacts, he found jobs with Les Brown, Stan Kenton, and Vic Damone. With Damone he accompanied Bob Hope on a USO tour of Vietnam. He received an offer from Joe Pass to return to Shearing because Pass was leaving the band. Anthony intended to substitute briefly, but he remained with Shearing for another four years. In 1984 Anthony played in a trio for a party given by Frank Sinatra for Nancy Reagan. Two years later he was invited to replace Tony Mottola in Sinatra's band. Anthony played most of Sinatra's performances until Sinatra's death. He played in a trio for Sinatra's funeral.

In the United States and Indonesia, it is a type of sugar cookie. Rather than wheat flour, which is commonly used in the preparation of cookies, the corn cookie takes its color and flavor from corn products such as cornmeal. Like their traditional counterparts, corn cookies are often flavored with various herbs, spices, and fruits including lemon verbena, apricot, and rosemary. In addition to baking, corn cookies can also be prepared by using batter for making cornbread and cooking it on a hot griddle. Corn cookies have been prepared by the Sioux Indians in South Dakota due to the abundance of corn in that state.

It is that canton's only cave stronghold and one of the few in Switzerland. It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance.  Layout  The stronghold was built high in a natural cave of about wide and deep. The thick outer wall was provided with two doorways and some narrow windows. The wet rock face was covered with a lining wall; and the rest was a simple two-story timber construction, which is shown evident by the presence of holes into which beams were inserted. While being restored, the presently visible wall openings were distorted from their original form. At a later stage in the building of the stronghold, a fortified, inhabited house with an inside width of and a length of was erected in the forecourt. Presumably this was a defensive fortification of some farming complex. The entrance to the stone fortress stretched over a long, partly walled rise which is partly hewn from the rock. The connection between the forecourt and the fortress itself is still only incompletely reconstructed. The present-day rise is of modern source, and only partly represents its original state.

These instructions naturally suggest the influence of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, but the scherzo theme itself ... points more directly to the Third; Shapero updates Beethoven's two-note idea ... to include a jazzy flatted third.

Swans founder Michael Gira funded the recording of this album by creating the limited-edition album I Am Not Insane and chose several collaborators from previous Swans line-ups as well as his side project Angels of Light to record and tour for this album. My Father Will Guide Me up a Rope to the Sky has received positive critical feedback for the return of Swans as well as the rich spiritual themes of the lyrics. Recording In a 2009 interview, Gira hinted at the prospect of resurrecting the Swans project. Later that year, many of the tracks that would appear on My Father Will Guide Me up a Rope to the Sky were released in demo and acoustic form on I Am Not Insane and sold in order to fund the recording process for this album. Gira handmade 1,000 copies of that album to fund the new Swans recordings. In January 2010, Gira amended the band's Facebook and MySpace to read \\"SWANS ARE NOT DEAD\\"‚Äîan announcement that the band had been reformed as well as a play on words from Swans' live album Swans Are Dead. Gira wrote the songs over a three-year period and decided that they were unfit for an Angels of Light album and he wanted to transition back the aggressive sound and \\"sonic intensity\\" of Swans; he briefly considered releasing the material as an Angels of Light/Swans split album, but decided against it. After Gira financed the album through sales of I Am Not Insane, he got together a group of musicians to record with him in New York. Each song‚Äîwith the exception of \\"You Fucking People Make Me Sick\\"‚Äîwas recorded in 12-hour daily studio sessions that culminated in nighttime overdubs. In deciding to reform Swans, Gira attempted to create a continuity between the band's last studio album‚Äî1996's Soundtracks for the Blind‚Äîas well as his subsequent work with Angels of Light; for instance, the song \\"My Birth\\" includes lyrics written in 1997 originally for Swans. The line-up of Swans that recorded this album features Gira, Christoph Hahn, Phil Puleo, and Norman Westberg from prior Swans releases as well as Gira solo collaborators Thor Harris and Christopher Pravdica; this is the first Swans album that does not feature Jarboe since her debut on 1986's Greed. Gira chose these musicians in part for how they would work together touring to promote this album and has created a distinct sound for Swans, emphasizing rhythm and the interplay between atmospheric instruments such as dulcimer, tubular bells, and vibraphone. Gira contacted Italian artist Beatrice Pediconi to handle all of the artwork for the album after seeing her pieces in Harper's Magazine. The special edition of the album has a cover that mirrors the album artwork of I Am Not Insane. Themes The title of the album comes from the lyrics to a then unreleased Swans song entitled \\"Oxygen\\" (which was later released on To Be Kind) that depicts Gira dying and ascending to Heaven and several reviewers have noted spiritual themes on the album. Gira's interest in spirituality developed with this album and his goal was to create music, \\"to elevate, to make you levitate, almost like having it erase your body and lift you up to Heaven.\\" Promotion Swans touring in 2010 to promote My Father Will Guide Me up a Rope to the Sky In addition to releasing I Am Not Insane, Gira promoted the album by offering it for free streaming on the Internet, made a demo version of the song \\"No Words\\" available on the band's MySpace page, and reorganized Swans for their first tour since 1997. Tour dates were slated to be performed in the United States and Europe, including headlining the Supersonic Festival in October 2010, and Gira intended to tour for 18 months. Gira also remixed the album with the intention of selling that version on tour and through the band's website. Critical reception My Father Will Guide Me up a Rope to the Sky is rated an 83 with \\"universal acclaim\\" by Metacritic. The A.V. Club gave the album an A, calling it \\"a leviathan of an album\\" and commenting on the similarities and differences that this album has with the rest of Swans' catalogue, saying that it \\"resembles all of Swans' previous work, yet none of it.\\" BBC Music has declared it \\"a majestic return and, let us hope, a harbinger of more to come.\\" The Big Takeover has remarked that the album \\"encompasses all of the original band's many moods.\\" The Wire listed My Father Will Guide Me up a Rope to the Sky as the third best record of 2010 in its annual critics' poll.

History During the 1880s, the quarrying of a distinctive pink stone known as jasper or quartzite had developed into a successful business in Sioux Falls. In 1887, the Sioux Falls Granite Company opened four quarries six miles due east of downtown Sioux Falls in Split Rock Township. This area had an abundance of quartzite along the bluffs overlooking the Big Sioux River and exposure to the Earth's surface ensured that the stone could be easily mined. Hundreds of workers and their families settled in a nearby community known at the time as Ives. In 1888, Sioux Falls officials convinced the Illinois Central Railroad to extend the tracks west from Iowa and through the city. Influenced by the mining, the rail line was routed past the Split Rock quarries, opening markets for the stone in metropolitan cities such as Chicago. Railroad officials named the depot East Sioux Falls, replacing Ives in the historical records. By 1890, the community had grown to over 600 residents which led to the incorporation of East Sioux Falls as a municipality. Numerous structures were built in East Sioux Falls including worker's cottages, post office, town hall, depot, school house, general store, hotel, grain elevator, stable, saloons and jail. The remains of several buildings are still visible within the nature area. Sign marking the site of the former town. The quarried stone was cut into building stones and paving blocks and shipped to construction projects throughout the country. The pink quartzite was superior in quality to other stones and possessed a coloring which was extremely delicate and pleasing to the eye. The stone was used in the construction of several Sioux Falls buildings including the Old Courthouse Museum, old post office (now the Federal Courthouse), Carnegie public library, and Pettigrew Home & Museum. Historical records show that hundreds of miles of roads in the larger cities of the west were paved with quartzite blocks cut at the East Sioux Falls quarries. The city felt the impact of a slowing economy in 1891 and economic problems mounted with the depression of 1893. The tough economic times of the 1890s pushed the Sioux Falls Granite Company into bankruptcy and the property was acquired by George H. Perry who operated the East Sioux Falls Quarry Company for a time. By the turn of the century, concrete had taken the place of stone as a building material.

From February 8, 2005, to April 19, 2009, users of the website generated 111,669,334 disasters. The website won the Yahoo! UK & Ireland Finds of the Year 2005 award for Best Innovative Website. History Netdisaster creator Denis Rionnet registered the domain \\"netdisaster.com\\" on January 25, 2005. The online engine became available on at 3:00pm on February 8, 2005, with only five disasters available. Buzz about the website spread rapidly on the internet in the following months. On May 27, Rionnet added the \\"Netdisaster- Yourself\\" feature, which creates HTML codes for webmasters to allow their visitors to \\"destroy\\" their websites. By July 15, ten million disasters had been generated on the website. On January 26, 2006, as a result of Netdisaster's growing popularity, the website was named the Yahoo! UK & Ireland Finds of the Year 2005 Best Innovative Website. In October 2007, a Led Zeppelin disaster was added as part of an online marketing campaign by Rubber Republic. In 2007, PC Magazine included it in their Best of the Internet list of websites. On August 6, 2008, one hundred million disasters had been generated. Difficulties began on September 4, 2008, when RSA Security, a security issues company working for Yahoo!, threatened Netdisaster and its hosting provider, Lunarpages, with legal action, claiming that the \\"Text Sucker\\" disaster was being used for phishing. Per RSA's request, the website was shut down and Rionnet sent them the source code of the disaster engine. At that point, Netdisaster user Ronaldo Cardonetti of Abusando.org emailed the security company to tell them they had made a mistake. On October 6, 2008, RSA emailed Rionnet to apologize, after having realized their error. The website was brought back online about ten days later; however, users could no longer create disasters on any Yahoo! websites, nor could they share disasters they had created. On April 20, 2009, Netdisaster received another legal threat, this time from eBay. eBay complained about a specific URL at netdisaster.com. The page, which showed the \\"Graffiti\\" disaster on the eBay website, was suspected of being used for phishing. Unlike Yahoo!, eBay did not examine the website's source code to verify their claim, and thus the website's engine is still offline. However, after receiving support and fan mail from hundreds of users, Rionnet decided that he couldn't stand for Netdisaster to be dead. He created a desktop version of the engine, which allows users to run many of the original disasters on a screenshot of their desktop instead of one of a website. He also made the original browser-based disasters available to webmasters who wanted to add them to their own sites with the \\"Netdisaster- Yourself!\\" tool. On July 25, 2010, a fan-made extension for Google Chrome called \\"NetDisaster Loader\\" was posted to the Chrome Web Store that made the \\"Netdisaster-Yourself!\\" available for users to access on any website. This effectively made it possible for Chrome users to utilize Netdisaster in the same way they had before the engine was taken offline. The extension received a mention on the Netdisaster home page. Use Before the website's engine was shut down, users could choose from a list of disasters and the entire internet.After October 16, 2008, websites owned by Yahoo! were not available. Users could type in any URL, select a disaster from a drop-down list, and click \\"Go!\\". The disasters were divided into six categories, each one containing a variety of different options. Most of the disasters have been made available on the desktop application and the \\"Netdisaster-Yourself!\\" tool.

Ocean liner service The Serenade was built for service on the Marseilles to West Africa route as the Jean Mermoz,Paquet named after the famed aviator. She was originally designed to carry 854 passengers (144 first class, 140 second class, 110 third class, and 460 troops), as well as cargo. For eight uneventful years she went on the same voyage, departing France and calling at Casablanca, Dakar, Conakry, Monrovia, Abidjan, Tema, Lom√©, Cotonou, Lagos, Duala, Libreville, Port Gentil, and Pointe Noire for her owners, Compagnie de Navigation Fraissinet et Cyprien Fabre. The popular ship was the last of the colonial-era French-owned classic liners to sail exclusively under the French flag. In 1965 she was transferred to Nouvelle Cie de Paquebots. As competition grew fierce with Greek and Italian shipping companies, who offered less expensive voyages, Jean Mermoz was sold to the Paquet Cruises, who converted her into a full-time cruise ship. As colonial-era route diminished in scale, she was thus converted into a full-time cruise ship by 1970 at Genoa, Italy. Cruise service Jean Mermoz's appearance changed drastically after the 1969-1970 rebuilding at the T. Marriotti Shipyard, as her superstructure was expanded and her traditional looking round funnel was replaced with a streamlined cylinder like one. With the conversion her name was changed to Mermoz. Mermoz operated cruises along the South American coast, through the Gal√°pagos Islands and around the Black Sea. In 1985 her first South Pacific cruise was delayed three days due to pay disputes with crew members. Then tugboat operators declared her \\"black\\" in protest against the French nuclear tests in the Pacific. In 1993, Costa Cruises bought Paquet and all of its assets, but continued to operate Mermoz under the Paquet brand name on cruises targeted at the French market. In 1996 Carnival Cruise Line bought Costa. Carnival subsequently dissolved Paquet and laid up Mermoz. In 1999 Carnival sold Mermoz to the Cyprus based Louis Cruise Lines, who renamed her Serenade.LouisPCs Serenade operated two-night cruises, starting in Limassol and calling in Israel and Egypt. Due to the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict she was switched to a two-night cruise from Malta to Italy. Serenade later served as a floating hotel for the 27th G8 summit in Genoa.SSMaritime Throughout the rest of her career with Louis she spent considerable amounts of time laid up at Eleusis Bay, because Louis operated the vessel only during the summer months. In 2003 she began an itinerary of short cruises from Cyprus to the Greek Islands and Egypt. Demise In 2008 she was renamed Serena and sailed to scrapyards at Alang where she was beached and scrapped. Her departure from the cruising scene was noted around the world, with the popular travel magazine Cruise Travel also paying tribute the following year to the ship in their annual Directory Issue's Cruising's Classic Past.

This is the case because these are the versions endorsed by the NRC. NQA-1 Certification Program ASME offers an NQA-1 Certification Program. The ASME NQA-1 Certification program provides a means for an organization supplying items or services which provide a safety function for nuclear facilities to have its Quality Assurance Program recognized by ASME as having had its Quality Assurance Program audited and verified to be in conformance with the requirements of the ASME NQA-1 Standard. It provides a foot in the door to the industry; however, it does not relieve the buying organization from going through its vendor qualification process. The NQA-1 Certification Program is developed, maintained and administered by ASME and industry subject matter experts serving as volunteers on ASME‚Äôs committees.

Hitler's Valet) is a black-and-white 1942 comedy short propaganda film that was one of Hal Roach's Streamliners short film series. When the board of directors of Hell want Adolf Hitler to take charge, the Devil tries to save his job by making the German dictator perform a good deed. Plot In the pits of Hell, the board of directors decides to replace Satan (Alan Mowbray) with Adolf Hitler (Bobby Watson). Satan persuades them to give him 48 hours to save his job by getting Hitler to perform a single good deed. Satan arranges for Hitler's valet, Julius (Sig Arno), to appear to blunder several times, resulting in his replacement. Satan takes his place under the name \\"Gesatan\\". Italian dictator Benito Mussolini (Joe Devlin) and a Japanese representative, Suki Yaki (George E. Stone), enter. Mussolini presents Hitler with a miniature airplane which he stole from Suki Yaki, who in turn stole it from the Americans. When Suki Yaki activates the airplane, it goes out of control and eventually strikes Hitler in the rear. After Satan causes more trouble, Hitler orders the execution of his astrologer, Louis (Herman Bing), who had promised him a peaceful, quiet day. He makes Satan his new chief adviser. Satan tells Hitler that he should do one good deed that day, but Hitler has other ideas. He has a bunch of traitors brought in. Insurance salesman Walter Beeter (Douglas Fowley) joins the group to try to sell Hitler a policy. When Hitler questions Linda Kraus (Marjorie Woodworth), an agent sent to spy on the United States, Walter comes to her defense when she refuses to cooperate. Hitler orders the entire group imprisoned to await their execution. Satan persuades Hitler to get an insurance policy after all, telling him that the money could be used to fund hospitals and retirement homes. However, Hitler buys a policy from Walter for Suki Yaki. The intended victim orders a policy for Mussolini, who purchases life insurance for both Hitler and Suki Yaki. All three men hide alarm clock bombs under each other's pillow. However, the bombs are discovered. Satan impersonates Hitler and releases Walter and Linda, but Hitler finds out and orders them shot by firing squad. Satan convinces everyone that Hitler is the imposter. Hitler is put in front of a firing squad, the same one from which Satan rescued Walter and Linda moments earlier. Suki Yaki and Mussolini pretend not to know him, until he agrees to give them the Pacific and Italy respectively. They chase Satan into a storage room filled with explosives. Satan locks the door, ignites a bomb and gives it to Hitler. Satan gives Hitler the key on condition that he release Walter and Linda. Hitler does so, and Satan returns home to Hell with his position secure. When Hitler arrives in Hell, Satan pays special attention to his punishment.

Photo: Lars Haugdal Andersen / www.basse.no Basse is a Norwegian ball game, with roots before World War I.S√∏rensen, B. (1980). Basse ‚Äì ein tr√∏ndersport. I: Stemshaug, O. (red.) (Yearbook for Tr√∏ndelag). Trondheim: Tr√∏nderlaget. pp. 119‚Äì124. Today basse is mostly played in the county of Tr√∏ndelag, but has also spread to other countries. Construction The basse is similar to a bag ball although it's not really a bag. The basse is made with several rubber rings tied together to a round ball with a tight core. Use an old bicycle inner tube or rubber bands. It should be as round as possible, and not bounce in any direction when you hit it. The weight is about 70 ‚Äì 100 grams. Gameplay Create fields (squares or circles) on any surface (gravel, tarmac, grass or indoors). Use your feet, chalk or spray paint to create the field, depending on the surface. First, draw the mid field circle. Diameter 1‚Äì1,5 metre. Make room, 30‚Äì40 cm between the next circles. You can have 4 to 8 fields around the center circle. The optimal number of players are 5‚Äì7, but 8‚Äì9 can play a game of basse, depending on the field and space available. The overall goal is to defend your field (a circle) and to score goals on the other players. It is an individual sport and everyone plays against everyone. The game starts with a serve (not lower than the knee). If you concede a goal (i.e. the basse must land completely inside the circle and not touch the edge), you get one minus point. After 3 minus points you are out of the game. You must defend your circle and the players can hit the basse with all body limbs, except arms and hands. The finale is played when there are two players left. ‚ÄùThe first goal wins‚Äù, regardless of the number of minus points each finalists has received before. Some players practice rules for refereeing, dead squares, hand ball and penalty kicks. Basse tournaments are often held during the summer season.

The film is strikingly similar in style and plot to the 1988 ATV's The court Secret Agent (Èå¶Ë°£Ë°õ.), and is suggested to have been remade as, the 2010 film 14 Blades, which starred Donnie Yen. Plot Captain Zhao Wu Yi is the leader of the Brocade Guards, the government's secret police. The sergeant of the force is Zhao's elder son, Zhao Bu Fa. Zhao also has a younger son in the force, Zhao Bu Qun, whom he executes after he questions him about whether or not he would kill his father if he committed a crime, which he answers \\"No\\". The force works under a childish, womanizing Emperor who is irresponsible to his duties. The blood thirsty Eunuch Wang Zhen usually bribes the Emperor with woman and the Emperor gives his powers to the eunuch. Zhao Bu Fa has never been fond of the eunch. Eunuch Wang then orders The Brocade Guards to kill two righteous guards Yu Hua Long and Li Yi. Zhao refuses to kill them and resigns from the force. The furious eunuch then orders Zhao Wu Yi to kill his son; he sends his men to kill him but his troupe are no match for Zhao. And so, Zhao survives every time. Zhao then goes into hiding with his wife Xue Liang and son Ding Dong in his ancestral village. His whole clan are there and his uncle Zhao Wu Ji is their leader. Things work out fine, until a message is sent to the village ordering the clan to Kill Zhao Bu Fa or they will be executed. They decide to kill Zhao, where Zhao and his uncle engage in a duel and he kills his own uncle. Zhao's sister Wu Xiao Nan, who did not want to kill Zhao later gives Zhao a poisoned cup of tea; they engage in a fight where Zhao kills Wu, and he and his family escape. They meet up with Zhao's brother, who reveals that his execution was fake, it was just to show the Brocade Guards what would happen to them if they disobey an order. Bu Qun then treats his brother's poison and later disguises himself as his brother. He ends up sacrificing himself for his brother and family to live a peaceful life. Xue Liang repays his kindness by killing herself. The Jinyi troupe brings Bu Qun's head to show Wu Yi, who is saddened and says that he does not actually want his son to die. Eunuch Wang tries to completely take over the Emperor's throne. Zhao Bu Fa calls for a duel with Wang. They engage in a duel in the mountains and Zhao chops off Wang's left arm, later killing him by chopping him in half. After the duel, Zhao informs his father that he has killed Eunuch Wang.

The answers to these questions are many and each character will have to decide on the subject: the story is even more comprehensive.)

Le casting est impeccable, Leung Kar Yan en t√™te qui affiche une v√©ritable aisance dans les sc√®nes dramatique et d'action. Ku Feng, en p√®re tortur√©, est tout aussi convaincant.

There are many, certainly, but very often filmed so quickly as to lose a lot in authenticity. The cast is impeccable, Leung Kar Yan in mind that displays a real ease in drama and action scenes. Ku Feng, a father tortured, is equally convincing. Finally, we can say that Secret Service Of The Imperial Court is one of the last great achievements of the Shaw Brothers Studio at that time in artistic disarray.)

Early career at CBC The son of Fredrick and Marie Aylesworth,Science Fiction and Fantasy Literature, vol. 2, R. Reginald, 1979, pg 803 Aylesworth was born on August 18, 1928, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and performed on radio as a child. He left high school before graduating and went into the advertising business as a writer, working together with Frank Peppiatt. His wife recalled that they \\"were total cutups at the agency\\" and were approached by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation based on their reputation to write sketches for the late night variety program After Hours. At this point they officially became the comedy team of Peppiatt and Aylesworth. Peppiatt & Aylesworth were Canada's first television comedy team. They also wrote and performed on the CBC programs The Big Revue and On Stage and Aylesworth created Front Page Challenge, a current events and history game show that ran on CBC Television from 1957 to 1995. Hee Haw Aylesworth and Peppiatt relocated to the United States in 1958 and got work writing for The Andy Williams Show.Hevesi, Dennis. \\"John Aylesworth, a ‚ÄòHee-Haw‚Äô Creator, Dies at 81\\", The New York Times, August 3, 2010. Accessed August 4, 2010. They had worked together on The Jimmy Dean Show and wondered why a show hosted by a country music star didn't feature the country music more prominently. Aylesworth's 2010 book The Corn Was Green: The Inside Story of Hee Haw published by McFarland & Company told how he and Peppiatt came up with the idea for Hee Haw after seeing \\"country banter\\" between Charley Weaver and Jonathan Winters on The Jonathan Winters Show, and seeing that the shows atop the Nielson ratings included The Andy Griffith Show, The Beverly Hillbillies, Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C., Green Acres and Petticoat Junction, along with Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In and the duo conceived immediately of the format of country variety.Oermann, Robert K. (1998). \\"Hee Haw\\". In The Encyclopedia of Country Music. Paul Kingsbury, Editor. New York: Oxford University Press. pp. 235‚Äì6. Originally a summer replacement for The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, Hee Haw was an immediate ratings winner throughout that first summer and was permanently added to the CBS schedule in December 1969. Co-hosted by Roy Clark and Buck Owens, the hour-long program featured regulars Archie Campbell, Grandpa Jones, Minnie Pearl, Junior Samples, Lulu Roman and Gordie Tapp. Ron Simon curator of television and radio at New York's Paley Center for Media described their collaboration at Hee Haw as \\"an interesting hybrid of two of the most popular programs of the '60s, The Beverly Hillbillies and Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In, and ironically outlasted both of them. The show featured a sequence of brief sketches of cornball humor, combined with performances by top acts in bluegrass, country and western and gospel music. The show lasted for two seasons, starting in 1969 on CBS in prime time and lasted on network television until 1971 when CBS axed nearly all of its rural-oriented programming. The show then ran in syndication for another 22 years, making it one of the longest-running programs in television history with 585 episodes. Simon noted that Hee Haw featured performances by \\"Merle Haggard, Johnny Cash and Conway Twitty preserved in their prime\\". They sold the show in 1982 for $15 million.  Later career  Aylesworth also wrote for other television programs, including The Jonathan Winters Show, The Judy Garland Show, Kraft Music Hall and Your Hit Parade, receiving Emmy Award nominations for The Julie Andrews Hour in 1973 and in 1976 for The Sonny and Cher Show. He served as producer on several of those programs as well. Aylesworth worked on a stage musical DURANTE, based on the life of Jimmy Durante which played in several cities including San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Toronto. In his later career he repeatedly tried to find work as a television writer, but couldn't find any. He gave up looking in the 1980s and filed a class action lawsuit against agents and the television studios claiming age discrimination. In 1996 Peppiatt and Aylesworth reunited for a tribute show in Canada honouring their long careers and great contributions to television and film. The program, \\"Adrienne Clarkson Presents- A Tribute to Peppiatt & Aylesworth: Canada's First Television Comedy Team\\" aired in October 1996 on the CBC and was rerun several times through 1997. It profiled their classic careers with interviews, clips, archive footage, Kinescopes, and new sketches shot just for the tribute. The duo was once again called back to Canada in 2005 for the production of Comedy Gold, a history of Canadian comedy featuring an All-Star cast. They also participated in a retrospective, The Joke's on Us: 50 Years of CBC Satire, in 2002. Later life Aylesworth was a resident of Palm Desert, California. He died at age 81 on July 28, 2010, at Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage, California, due to complications of pneumonia as a complication of pulmonary fibrosis.Schudel, Matt. \\"John Aylesworth dies; co- creator of 'Hee Haw'\\", The Washington Post, August 1, 2010.

A Tale of the Twenty-Second Century is an 1827 three-volume novel written by Jane Webb (later Jane C. Loudon). It concerns the Egyptian mummy of Cheops, who is brought back to life in the year 2126. The novel describes a future filled with advanced technology, and was the first English-language story to feature a reanimated mummy. After her father's death, making her an orphan at the age of 17, Webb found that:Shigitatsu Antiquarian Books. Profile of Jane Webb Loudon (1807‚Äì1858). Shigitatsu.com. Retrieved on 5 April 2012. She may have drawn inspiration from the general fashion for anything pharaonic, inspired by the French researches during the Napoleonic invasion of Egypt; the 1821 public unwrappings of Egyptian mummies in a theatre near Piccadilly, which she may have attended as a girl; and, very likely, the 1818 novel by Mary Shelley, Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus.Lisa Hopkins, \\"Jane C. Loudon‚Äôs The Mummy!: Mary Shelley Meets George Orwell, and They Go in a Balloon to Egypt\\", in Cardiff Corvey: Reading the Romantic Text, 10 (June 2003). Retrieved on 16 December 2019. As Shelley had written of Frankenstein's creation, \\"A mummy again endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch,\\" which may have triggered young Miss Webb's later concept. In any case, at many points she deals in greater clarity with elements from the earlier book: the loathing for the much-desired object, the immediate arrest for crime and attempt to lie one's way out of it, etc. However, unlike the Frankenstein monster, the hideous revived Cheops is not shuffling around dealing out horror and death, but giving canny advice on politics and life to those who befriend him. In some ways The Mummy! may be seen as her reaction to themes in Frankenstein: her mummy specifically says he is allowed life only by divine favour, rather than being indisputably vivified only by mortal science, and so on, as Hopkins' 2003 essay covers in detail. Unlike many early science fiction works (Shelley's The Last Man, and The Reign of King George VI, 1900-1925, written anonymously in 1763The reign of George VI. 1900‚Äì1925; a forecast written in the year 1763. [London] W. Niccoll, 1763, Published in 1899, Archive.org. Retrieved on 5 April 2012.), Loudon did not portray the future as her own day with only political changes. She filled her world with foreseeable changes in technology, society, and even fashion. Her court ladies wear trousers and hair ornaments of controlled flame. Surgeons and lawyers may be steam-powered automatons. A kind of Internet is predicted in it. Besides trying to account for the revivification of the mummy in scientific terms‚Äîgalvanic shock rather than incantations--\\"she embodied ideas of scientific progress and discovery, that now read like prophecies\\" to those later down the 1800s. Her social attitudes have resulted in this book being ranked among feminist novels. The Mummy!: Or a Tale of the Twenty-Second Century was published anonymously in 1827 by Henry Colburn in three volumes, as was usual in that day so that each small volume could be easily carried around. It drew many favourable reviews, including one in 1829 in The Gardener's Magazine on the inventions proposed in it. In 1830, the reviewer, John Claudius Loudon, sought out Webb, and they married the next year.

He also contributed to many aspects of organometallic chemistry, including the discovery of Cu, Fe, and Ag-catalyzed cross-coupling processes (which preceded the discovery of the better known Pd and Ni- catalyzed versions), as well as several metal-catalyzed oxidative processes. At the time, these results were largely ignored by the synthetic organic chemistry community. Many decades later, interest in base metal catalysis sparked significant efforts to further develop cross-coupling reactions catalyzed by metals such as Fe in particular. His research in organometallic chemistry emphasized the importance of electron-transfer processes and radical species as intermediates. Many of these results (and the results of other investigators) are summarized in a monograph. Awards and honors Kochi received many awards for his research, including election to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. He developed the Kochi reaction, a variation on the Hunsdiecker reaction. Personal life Kochi was of Japanese descent and he and his family were forcibly interned at the Gila River War Relocation Center during World War II. He died at his home in Houston, Texas on August 9, 2008, after a brief illness.

The wolf became extinct in 1940. It was originally identified as a separate species by Richardson in 1839 and from other wolves in the area by Edward Goldman in 1945. This wolf is recognized as a subspecies of Canis lupus in the taxonomic authority Mammal Species of the World (2005). It was described as a cinnamon-coloured wolf, measuring 165 cm and weighing 36‚Äì49 kg.The Encyclopedia of Vanished Species by David Day, Universe Books ltd. 1981. Recently another subspecies, the British Columbia wolf (Canis lupus columbianus), has established itself in the Cascade mountain wolf's past territory by following the Cascade Range through Washington and is now west of the Cascade crest, expanding across Oregon, and into northern California to Lassen Peak, where in 2019 the Lassen pack produced 3 wolf pups.
