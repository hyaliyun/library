Q. M. Badruddoza Chowdhury in 2004. Abdul Mannan (BDB Secretary General) and recent (BDB Women Vice-President) Rabaya Begum; two of the most deepest assets of BDB play the most vital role by recruiting and managing the party to promote itself towards its objectives. Their party symbol during the polls is the kula (, a handmade winnowing fan). Its current political alignment is ambiguous, and has two seats in the parliament. Background The party was conceived by Dr Chowdhury in 2003 after he was forced to abdicate his Presidency. Dr Chowdhury felt the need of a third force in the de facto two-party democracy in Bangladesh. He expressed recruiting civil society members in politics to fight corruption and terrorism and establish good governance in the country through an alternate stream (lit. Bikalpa Dhara) political party. He, along with his son Mahi B. Chowdhury and BNP parliamentarian M A Mannan resigned from BNP to work for the new political party. Dr Chowdhury was the President, with M A Mannan as the secretary-general of the new party formed in March 2004. It had been a strong critic of the government during the time, and most of its members were defects from the ruling BNP. BNP parliamentarian Oli Ahmed too had defected from BNP bringing with him 24 other senior leaders of BNP to form a new party Liberal Democratic Party in which Bikalpa Dhara was merged on 26 October 2006. However, due to some ideological differences LDP was split and Dr. Chowdhury along with his followers went back to form Bikalpa Dhara again in 2007. By-elections in 2004 Article 70 of the Constitution states that a parliamentarian who defects automatically loses his seat. Since both M A Mannan and Mahi B Chowdhury were ruling party parliamentarians during their defection to Bikalpa Dhara, their seats were vacated and by-elections declared. Both the parliamentarians contested for their own seats again. The Munshiganj-1 district was contested mainly by Momin Ali of BNP and Mahi Chowdhury, (main opposition Awami League boycotted the by-polls) and the BNP- led government was determined to ensure that they retained the seat. The by- election was held on 6 June 2004. Despite considerable opposition from the BNP, Mahi Chowdhury managed to win the elections and enter Parliament as the only opposition member from the BDB. The Dhaka-10 constituency was contested between former MP M A Mannan and BNP's Mosaddek Ali Falu (main opposition Awami League had boycotted the by-polls). Falu, also political adviser to the Prime Minister, won the elections comprehensively, but the polls were considered to be sham by most observers, including, according to WikiLeaks, the United States. Mahi's membership in the Jatiyo Sangshad expired along with the parliament in October 2006. 2008 elections and aftermath The party contested the 2008 elections independently, but won no seats during the elections. Party president Dr Chowdhury lost his security money for obtaining only about 5,000 votes in his Dhaka-6 constituency, and came third in his Munshiganj-1 constituency, where he was elected parliamentarian four times in the past. No other Bikalpa Dhara candidates were able to secure seats in the 9th Parliament. In the emergency presidium meeting on 31 December 2008 just two days after the elections, Dr Chowdhury and M A Mannan, party president and secretary-general took responsibility for the loss, and resigned from their party posts, being appointed chief adviser and adviser to the party respectively. They also congratulated Awami League for their historic win in the elections. Dhaka University's political science professor Nurul Amin Bepari and Mahi B. Chowdhury were appointed acting president and acting secretary-general, respectively. However, Dr Chowdhury and Mannan were reinstated to their respective roles within the party in April 2009 after a presidium meeting. 2009 ‚Äì present Chowdhury attended political iftars with both Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina (which Khaleda Zia boycotted) and Khaleda Zia (which Sheikh Hasina boycotted). =Stances= Present government Bikalpa Dhara believes that the present Awami League-led Grand Alliance has failed in fulfilling their duties as the government, and a scheme of having fresh elections at the earliest must be hatched. Caretaker government Bikalpa Dhara opposed the repealing of the Thirteenth Amendment that abolished the caretaker government system in Bangladesh, and stated their liking of the system to the Chief Election Commissioner during a formal dialogue. The party also has agreed to join former foe BNP in a movement to reinstate the caretaker government. General agitations by BNP Bikalpa Dhara hasn't associated themselves with the general agitation movements being led by BNP. For instance, Bikalpa Dhara were invited by BNP to join their mass hunger strike on 12 July. While LDP, another party split from BNP, joined the movement, Bikalpa Dhara declined. The party also stated that it would shun any movements by BNP that they perceived were too hardline and would disrupt the normal passage of life for the people, although they agreed with BNP's cause in general. They were initially undecided about attending BNP's rally on 27 September, and later no reports of Bikalpa Dhara's attendance were found. However, Bikalpa Dhara joined BNP's road march program starting on 10 October.

The Q Series nettops are described by the manufacturer as being multimedia-oriented nettops. Comparing the size to a typical paperback book, Lenovo describes the Q Series nettops as the smallest desktops in production. The general features of the Q Series desktops are the small size, low energy requirements, ability to play HD video, and low noise levels. These nettops are designed to be extremely compact processing units. A nettop is a desktop computer that uses the same (or similar) components found in netbook PCs. The first nettop in the IdeaCentre Q series was the Q100, launched in 2009. 2010 The only nettop released in 2010 in the IdeaCentre Q series was the Q150. =Q150= Released in 2010, the IdeaCentre Q150 was a nettop like its predecessors: the Q100 and the Q110. In its review of the nettop, SlashGear described it as ‚Äúa great little media PC that serves up high definition content with minimal fuss.‚Äù The single core Intel Atom processor found in 2009‚Äôs Q-series nettops was replaced by the Intel Atom D510 processor, with two cores at 1.66 GHz. The nettop also included 2GB DDR2 RAM, a 500GB hard disk drive, and NVIDIA Nvidia Ion 2 graphics with support for DirectX 10. Unlike its predecessors, the Q150 also included Wi-Fi b/g/n. Ports on the nettop were available for HDMI, VGA, two USB, Ethernet, and audio input and output. A stand was provided to support the nettop, and a VESA mount was provided as an alternative, so the nettop could be kept behind a TV or a monitor. PCMag received the Q150 positively, calling it ‚Äúone of the smallest full-featured PCs‚Äù and saying, ‚ÄúThe Lenovo IdeaCentre Q150 is designed to be dropped on a desk or bolted behind an HDTV. It's one of the best web video/photo/music media consumption devices out there, once you've hooked up to a big screen.‚Äù PCMag gave the nettop a rating of four out of five stars as well as an Editor‚Äôs Choice award. 2009 The IdeaCentre Q-series nettops released by Lenovo in 2009 were the Q100, Q110, and the Q700. =Q100= The Q100 nettop was slightly larger than a typical external hard disk drive, with a plastic stand to allow it to remain upright. The nettop was equipped with a 1.6 GHz Intel Atom N230 processor, which was designed for low power consumption rather than processing power. The nettop also included 1GB of DDR2-667 RAM, and a 160GB hard disk drive. While the storage space was limited, PCWorld indicated that this was common in other, similar nettops, citing the Acer Aspire Revo 3610 and the MSI Wind Nettop CS120 as examples. While the nettop had four USB ports and a Gigabit Ethernet port there was no optical drive, and a mouse and keyboard were not included in the price. The Q100 could support a single VGA monitor. In its review of the nettop, PCWorld gave the PC one of five stars and indicated that it made a netbook seem like a better option. =Q110= Like the Q100, the Q110 nettop was also 0.7 inches thin and featured the 1.6 GHz Intel Atom N230 processor. Also like the Q100, a keyboard and mouse was not included. The differences between the two nettops, however, were that the Q110 had 2GB RAM, a 250GB hard disk drive, NVIDIA Ion graphics, and a 1080p HDMI output. =Q700= Launched in mid-2009, the Q700 was the Q series' third nettop from Lenovo released in that year. Unlike the Q100 and the Q110, the Q700 featured an Intel Pentium Dual Core E5700 processor, 4GB RAM, and Intel Graphics Media Accelerator X4500 integrated graphics. The Q700 measured 2.36 x 7.87 x 9.84 inches, and could be equipped with up to a 640GB hard disk drive. A HDMI output port was also present, as well as options for Wi-Fi b/g, a TV tuner, and different version of Windows Vista. The front of the nettop included four USB 2.0 ports, a slot-loading DVD writer, a four-in-one media card reader, as well as headphone and microphone jacks. The back of the nettop included an additional four USB 2.0 ports.

In simple words, the partial (or residual) correlation is a measure of the effect (or contribution) of a given node, say j, on the correlations between another pair of nodes, say i and k. Using this concept, the dependency of one node on another node, is calculated for the entire network. This results in a directed weighted adjacency matrix, of a fully connected network. Once the adjacency matrix has been constructed, different algorithms can be used to construct the network, such as a threshold network, Minimal Spanning Tree (MST), Planar Maximally Filtered Graph (PMFG), and others.

This original methodology was first presented at the end of 2010, published in PLoS ONE. They quantitatively uncovered hidden information about the underlying structure of the U.S. stock market, information that was not present in the standard correlation networks. One of the main results of this work is that for the investigated time period (2001‚Äì2003), the structure of the network is dominated by companies belonging to the financial sector, which are the hubs in the dependency network. Thus, they were able for the first time to quantitatively show the dependency relationships between the different economic sectors. Following this work, the dependency network methodology has been applied to the study of the immune system, and semantic networks. As such, this methodology is applicable to any complex system.

Reproduction from Madi et al., Chaos 21, 016109 (2011) Example of Dependency Network of associations, constructed from a full semantic network. Reproduction from Kenett et al., PLoS ONE 6(8): e23912 (2011) Overview To be more specific, the partial correlations of the pair, given j is the correlations between them after proper subtraction of the correlations between i and j and between k and j. Defined this way, the difference between the correlations and the partial correlations provides a measure of the influence of node j on the correlation. Therefore, we define the influence of node j on node i, or the dependency of node i on node j ‚àí D(i,j), to be the sum of the influence of node j on the correlations of node i with all other nodes. In the case of network topology, the analysis is based on the effect of node deletion on the shortest paths between the network nodes. More specifically, we define the influence of node j on each pair of nodes (i,k) to be the inverse of the topological distance between these nodes in the presence of j minus the inverse distance between them in the absence of node j. Then we define the influence of node j on node i, or the dependency of node i on node j ‚àí D(i,j), to be the sum of the influence of node j on the distances between node i with all other nodes k. The activity dependency networks =The node-node correlations= The node-node correlations can be calculated by Pearson‚Äôs formula: : C_{i,j}=\\\\frac {\\\\left \\\\langle (X_i (n)- \\\\mu_i) (X_j (n)- \\\\mu_j)\\\\right \\\\rangle}{\\\\sigma_i \\\\sigma_j} Where X_i(n) and X_j(n) are the activity of nodes i and j of subject n, Œº stands for average, and sigma the STD of the dynamics profiles of nodes i and j. Note that the node-node correlations (or for simplicity the node correlations) for all pairs of nodes define a symmetric correlation matrix whose (i,j) element is the correlation between nodes i and j. =Partial correlations= Next we use the resulting node correlations to compute the partial correlations. The first order partial correlation coefficient is a statistical measure indicating how a third variable affects the correlation between two other variables. The partial correlation between nodes i and k with respect to a third node j - PC(i,k\\\\mid j) is defined as: : PC(i,k\\\\mid j)=\\\\frac {C(i,k)-C(i,j)C(k,j)}{\\\\sqrt{[1-C^2(i,j)][1-C^2(k,j)]}} where C(i,j), C(i,k) and C(j,k) are the node correlations defined above. =The correlation influence and correlation dependency= The relative effect of the correlations C(i,j) and C(j,k) of node j on the correlation C(i,k) is given by: : d(i,k\\\\mid j)\\\\equiv C(i,k)-PC(i,kj) This avoids the trivial case were node j appears to strongly effect the correlation C(i,k) , mainly because C(i,j), C(i,k) and C(j,k) have small values. We note that this quantity can be viewed either as the correlation dependency of C(i,k) on node j, (the term used here) or as the correlation influence of node j on the correlation C(i,k). =Node activity dependencies= Next, we define the total influence of node j on node i, or the dependency D(i,j) of node i on node j to be: : D(i,j)=\\\\frac {1}{N-1}\\\\sum_{k e j}^{N-1} d(i,k\\\\mid j) As defined,D(i,j) is a measure of the average influence of node j on the correlations C(i,k) over all nodes k not equal to j. The node activity dependencies define a dependency matrix D whose (i,j) element is the dependency of node i on node j. It is important to note that while the correlation matrix C is a symmetric matrix, the dependency matrix D is nonsymmetrical ‚Äì D(i,j) e D(j,i) since the influence of node j on node i is not equal to the influence of node i on node j. For this reason, some of the methods used in the analyses of the correlation matrix (e.g. the PCA) have to be replaced or are less efficient. Yet there are other methods, as the ones used here, that can properly account for the non-symmetric nature of the dependency matrix. The structure dependency networks The path influence and distance dependency: The relative effect of node j on the directed path DP(i\\\\rightarrow kj) ‚Äì the shortest topological path with each segment corresponds to a distance 1, between nodes i and k is given: : DP(i\\\\rightarrow k\\\\mid j) \\\\equiv \\\\frac {1}{td(i \\\\rightarrow k\\\\mid j^+)} - \\\\frac {1}{td(i \\\\rightarrow k\\\\mid j^-)} where td(i \\\\rightarrow kj^+) and td(i \\\\rightarrow k\\\\mid j^-) are the shortest directed topological path from node i to node k in the presence and the absence of node j respectively. =Node structural dependencies= Next, we define the total influence of node j on node i, or the dependency D(i,j) of node i on node j to be: D(i,j)=\\\\frac {1}{N-1}\\\\sum_{k = 1}^{N-1} DP(i\\\\rightarrow k\\\\mid j) As defined, D(i,j) is a measure of the average influence of node j on the directed paths from node i to all other nodes k. The node structural dependencies define a dependency matrix D whose (i,j) element is the dependency of node i on node j, or the influence of node j on node i. It is important to note that the dependency matrix D is nonsymmetrical ‚Äì D(i,j) e D(j,i) since the influence of node j on node i is not equal to the influence of node i on node j.  Visualization of the dependency network  The dependency matrix is the weighted adjacency matrix, representing the fully connected network. Different algorithms can be applied to filter the fully connected network to obtain the most meaningful information, such as using a threshold approach, or different pruning algorithms.

His most successful year was 1991, when he won the International Stakes at York and was named European Champion Older Horse at the inaugural Cartier Racing Awards. He is best known, however, for his performance in the 1989 Derby in which he finished second at odds of 500/1, the longest ever recorded for a placed horse in the race. Background Terimon was a grey horse, standing 16 hands high, bred by the Hesmonds Stud in East Sussex in 1986. His sire Bustino was the best horse to race in the colours of Terimon's owner, Lady Beaverbrook. Bustino was a notable influence for stamina, being the sire of the Ascot Gold Cup winner Paean and the Coronation Cup winner Easter Sun. His dam, Nicholas Grey, from whom he inherited his colour, won the Listed Premio Carlo Chiesa and was placed in the Oaks d'Italia. Lady Beaverbrook was considered an eccentric character who gave most of her horses names consisting of one word with seven letters (Bustino, Relkino, Terimon, Boldboy, Niniski, Mystiko, Petoski), as this was the most common form for Derby winners. Like a much more famous grey champion Spectacular Bid, Terimon was so dark that he appeared almost black in his early racing career, although like most greys, his coat lightened as he aged. He was trained throughout his career by Clive Brittain at Newmarket, Suffolk. His most regular jockey was Michael Roberts who rode him in 21 of his 31 starts. Racing career =1988: two-year-old season= Terimon raced four times in 1988 without success, his nearest approach to victory coming when he was beaten a head in a maiden race at Newbury. He was campaigned ambitiously however; on his final race he ran in the Group One Middle Park Stakes, finishing last of the six runners. =1989: three-year-old season= Terimon began his three-year-old career with three more defeats, although he showed some ability by finishing second in the Group Three Sandown Classic Trial. On his eighth start, he recorded his first win, taking the lead close to the finish in a maiden race at Leicester. Terimon was the most experienced runner in the 1989 Epsom Derby, but he had apparently been exposed as being well below top class and started the complete outsider of the twelve runners at 500/1. The clear favourite for the race was Nashwan, the winner of the 2000 Guineas and the only horse seriously supported against him was Cacoethes, the easy winner of the Lingfield Derby Trial. Clive Brittain was well aware that his colt had no chance of beating Nashwan, and had entered him in the race with the intention of reaching a place. Cacoethes took the lead in the straight and was soon challenged by Nashwan. The two favourites raced together for a few strides, before Nashwan pulled away. Michael Roberts made steady headway on Terimon, moving up through the field to catch the tiring Cacoethes in the closing stages and finish second, five lengths behind Nashwan. In his two other starts of the year, Terimon failed to win, but confirmed that he was a Group class performer by finishing second in the Great Voltigeur Stakes and fourth in the St Leger. =1990: four-year-old season= On this first start of 1990, Terimon won his first important race, when he produced a strong finish to lead in the last strides and take the Group Three Earl of Sefton Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse. He had once again been ignored in the betting, starting at 20/1. He failed to win in his other six races that year, but finished second in the Eclipse Stakes and third in the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot. =1991: five-year-old season= Terimon had his best year in 1991, starting with a repeat win in the Earl of Sefton Stakes, this time as 7/2 favourite. He went on to finish a close second to In the Groove in the Coronation Cup and third to Stagecraft in the Prince of Wales's Stakes. He was well beaten in the Eclipse Stakes (behind Environment Friend) and the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes (behind Generous) before being sent to York for the International Stakes. He was made the 16/1 outsider of the six runners, with the leading contenders being Stagecraft, Environment Friend and the 1990 Derby winner Quest For Fame. Roberts sent Terimon into an early lead and set a slow pace before accelerating in the straight. Although his rivals had every chance, Terimon was never in serious danger and won by two lengths to record his biggest win. It was to be the only Group One win by an older male in Britain in 1991. In his remaining two starts he was unplaced in the Champion Stakes and the Japan Cup. =1992: six-year-old season= Terimon failed to produce his best form as a six-year-old. His best run in five races came on his debut, when he finished a close third in the Coronation Cup. At the end of the season he was retired to stud. Assessment Most of the open-age Group One races in 1991 were won by three-year-olds, with the classic generation including Generous, Suave Dancer, Sheikh Albadou, Marling, Selkirk, Hector Protector and many other top class performers. Terimon's win at York was therefore enough to secure him the title of European Champion Older Horse in the inaugural Cartier Racing Awards. Terimon was rated 124 by Timeform Stud career Less than three years after his retirement, Terimon's death was announced by Weatherbys, which came as a surprise to the staff at the Barton Stud at Bury St Edmunds where he was standing as a stallion. The death report was a result of a clerical error, and Terimon was actually \\"fine and in good form.\\" In 2000, he was moved to the Shade Oak Stud in Shropshire. Terimon sired the winners of over 100 winners, with most of his success being as a sire of National Hunt runners. He is the damsire of the 2012 Triumph Hurdle winner Countrywide Flame and the Arkle Challenge Trophy winner Simonsig.

Thomas Honywood (7 October 1819 ‚Äì 5 October 1888) was an English archaeologist and photographer. Biography Honywood was born at Horsham on 7 October 1819, the son of Mary Anne Morth and John Honywood (1790‚Äì1866), a carpenter, builder and surveyor.Sussex PhotoHistory http://www.photohistory-sussex.co.uk/HorshamPhotgrsH.htm He was Horsham's most eminent Victorian. He is said to have brought photography to Horsham and invented a new photographic process for nature printing. He drew detailed sketches of Horsham Gaol before it was pulled down. He is credited with identifying the Mesolithic or middle Stone age period. He discovered and preserved the Horsham Hoard of medieval pottery. He was an entrepreneur who set up his own museum. Honywood was Captain of the Horsham Volunteer Fire Brigade for which he received a handsome oil painting.Horsham's History, Volume 3 1880 to 1913, Knight, Jeremy & Horsham District Council, 2008. This oil on canvas painting by British painter Robert Wallace Martin (1843‚Äì1923), painted in 1869, can be seen in the library of Horsham Museum in Horsham, West Sussex. Honywood is shown in his uniform as a Captain in the Horsham Volunteer Fire Brigade. This portrait was presented by the townspeople in recognition of his services to the Brigade. The 1860s and 1870s saw him explore a number of archaeological sites including excavating barrows between Cocking and Bignor Hill. In 1878 Thomas married, lived in Courtenay House and had a son Thomas Courtenay de Honywood and a daughter Mabilia before he died in 1888. In the 1880s, Thomas Honywood was perfecting his technique of \\"Nature Printing\\". Honywood had been experimenting with photo-chemical printing processes which could transfer the images of ferns, flowers, leaves and even snowflakes onto a variety of surfaces. Eventually, Honywood patented his \\"Nature Printing\\" process for \\"producing designs direct from natural objects on all kinds of Fabrics, Pottery, Dados, Panelling, &c;, &c;\\". Three years before his death Thomas exhibited his unique photographic printing method at the International Inventions Exhibition held in London in 1885. Honywood took an early interest in photography and is thought to have taken the earliest known photographs in Horsham. Thomas Honywood's Museum In October 1887 Honywood held a sale of goods and chattels at his house. A rare copy of the sale particulars came to light in 2000, which although missing a couple of pages, shows the house was being stripped, including some of his collections, which he had thought of as a museum.

It uses a fluent interface in order to implement the Builder Pattern.  History  Before the introduction of the FluentQueryBuilder, the now outdated QueryBuilder was used for this purpose. However, it suffered from the verbosity associated with a classic interface, failed to help its clients deal with casting issues and type conversion issues commonly associated with Filter and Entity Attributes creation. The FluentQueryBuilder was created to address these issues.  Look and Feel  Following is a sample of a query created using the FluentQueryBuilder together with a discussion of how the shortcomings of QueryBuilder have been addressed Query q = new FluentQueryBuilder() .AddRange(someAttributes) .Add(ADtoClass.Attributes.AnAttribute) .FilterGroup .Add(ADtoClass.Filter.AFilter, Operators.Equals, 1) .BuildQuery(); = Fluent Interface = Due to its fluent interface, user can create a query without the need to assign the instance to a variable and continuously reference it in order to add attributes and filters. Using QueryBuilder, one would have to perform the following: var qb = new QueryBuilder(); qb.EntityAttributes = ...; qb.FilterGroup = ... var query = qb.Build(); = Type Conversion Help = EntityAttributes and Filters are stored as integers inside a query, but are initially available as enumeration values. Using QueryBuilder, client would have to continuously cast the enum values to integers. FluentQueryBuilder on the other hand uses generics to allow the user to pass any value for a filter, attribute, operator or value, and the values are cast or converted internally appropriately. For example, previously user would have had to write the following: Filter f = new Filter(); f.Column = (int)ADtoClass.Filter.AFilter; f.Operator = (int)Operators.Equals; f.Value = 1.ToString(); qb.FilterGroup.Add(f); = Filter Creation Help = Previously, Client had to create an instance of a Filter, and add it to the Filters of a FilterGroup. Then add the FilterGroup to the QueryBuilder. FluentQueryBuilder create the FilterGroup when the FilterGroup Property is called, and a filter can be added to this by specifying property values of filter: i.e. \\".FilterGroup.Add(ADtoClass.Filter.AFilter, Opperators.Equals, 1)\\" as seen above.

A prognostication he published in 1521 gained him a later reputation of having predicted the Protestant Reformation, as well as a major flood in 1525 and some apocalyptic dates.Thorndike p. 202. For 15 July 1524 he predicted another flood so that Joachim I Nestor and his entourage fled to the Runder Berg, then the highest of the Tempelhofer Berge range south of the residential city of C√∂lln.Klaus-Dieter Wille, Spazierg√§nge in Kreuzberg, Berlin: Haude & Spener, 1986, (=Berliner Kaleidoskop: Schriften zur Berliner Kunst- und Kulturgeschichte; vol. 32), p. 21\\\\. .Ilse Nicolas, Kreuzberger Impressionen (11969), Berlin: Haude & Spener, 21979, (=Berlinische Reminiszenzen; vol. 26), p. 10\\\\. .

According to another source the news of their frightful flight had spread among the C√∂llners and Berliners, many of whom had tried to get as well onto the hill, but were kept out by electoral guards. On their return the crowd awaited the elector and his entourage and welcoming him laughing. Subsequently from 1531 Philip Melanchthon took an interest in his work. Andreas Perlach in a work on the comet of 1531 questioned whether his methods were purely astrological or involved magic.Thorndike p. 381‚Äì2. His death is fixed as 1537, when Melanchthon communicated the news in a letter to Jacob Milich. Chronicles Carion's Chronicles became an important work in Lutheran and more generally Protestant millenarian thought. From an original that was indeed by Carion, it was completely rewritten in its Latin version at the hands of Melanchthon, and others.Avihu Zakai, Exile and Kingdom: History and Apocalypse in the Puritan Migration to America (2002), p. 18; Google Books. With Joachim Camerarius, Melanchthon and other Lutheran humanist scholars changed what was a traditional chronicle into a Reformation narrative of the Middle Ages.Arthur H. Williamson, Apocalypse Then: Prophecy and the Making of the Modern World (2008), p. 44; online book (PDF). After Melanchthon's death, Caspar Peucer continued to edit it. Major features were the scheme of four monarchies taken from the Book of Daniel, extended by the medieval idea of translatio imperii; further there is a second Three Eras schematic, the third period of which will be co-extensive with the Roman Empire extended by the Holy Roman Empire (the fourth monarchy) which will last to 2000 AD.Wilhelm Schmidt-Biggemann, Philosophia perennis: historical outlines of Western spirituality in ancient, medieval and early modern thought (2004), p. 403; [Google Books]. Initially, Carion published a short universal history in German, at Wittenberg (1532). It was then translated into Latin by Herman Bonnus (Halle, 1537); there were numerous subsequent editions and translations.Irving Ribner, The English History Play in the Age of Shakespeare (2005), p. 52; Google Books.

It is located on Witte street in the Tegel locality of the Reinickendorf borough. It is owned and operated by the Brotherhood of St. Prince Vladimir (Bratstvo). History and description The cemetery at the Witte Road was established on about 2 acres of grounds that the Russian Orthodox Brotherhood of St. Prince Vladimir Bratstwo bought in October 1892 at a price of 30.000 marks. Until then, Orthodox Christians were primarily buried on existing mostly Protestant Berlin cemeteries. The Friedhofskirche (cemetery church) of St. Constantine and St. Helena was built in 1894 and is the oldest of the three Russian Orthodox churches in Berlin, and the only one in Germany that has its own cemetery. It is situated in an industrial area near the motorway exit Holzhauser Stra√üe. The gateway is covered by a beautiful carved roof, under which the nine cemetery bells are housed. The cupolas are crowned with orthodox crosses, which tower above small crescent moons in memory of old religious wars. The church was designed and built by Albert Bohm, a member of the Prussian court architectural board. Two restored portraits of the Virgin Mary stand out under their icon ornamentation. They were donated by two monasteries on the sacred Mount Athos at the end of the nineteenth century. When the cemetery was laid out, Tsar Alexander III sent 4.000 tons of earth from Russia, so that the Russian deceased could be buried according to tradition in native Russian soil. Notables buried Among the notables buried here are * Vladimir Dmitrievich Nabokov, Russian criminologist, journalist, and progressive statesman during the last years of the Russian Empire, and father of the writer Vladimir Vladimirovich Nabokov, who died saving a political rival from an assassin. * Vladimir Sukhomlinov, Russian Minister of War (1909-1915) * Vladimir Sidorin, Commander of the White Don Army (1919-1920) * The operatic composer Mikhail Ivanovich Glinka died in Berlin and is buried in St. Petersburg, but is remembered here with a memorial stone. * The architect Mikhail Eisenstein, father of the famous film director Sergey Eisenstein, also commemorated here. * Alexander Rimski-Korsakov, a nephew of the composer of the same name, also commemorated here.

Persoonia myrtilloides was first formally described in 1827. Two subspecies are currently recognised, distinguished by the shape of leaves and tepals: *P. myrtilloides subsp. cunninghamii (R.Br.) L.A.S.Johnson & P.H.Weston which has broader leaves and reflexed tepal tips. *P. myrtilloides Sieber ex Schult. & Schult.f. subsp. myrtilloides which has narrower leaves and recurved tepal tips. Hybrids with P. acerosa, P. levis and P. recedens have been reported where the parent species both occur. The species occurs in the Blue Mountains from Wentworth Falls northwards to Capertee. Subspecies cunninghamii is found in the Wollemi National Park and the catchment of the Cudgegong River. Both subspecies are understory plants in open forests on sandstone-based soils. Subspecies myrtilloides is associated with trees such as sydney peppermint (Eucalyptus piperita), narrow-leaved peppermint (E. radiata) and silvertop ash (E. sieberi), and a shrubby understory of old man banksia (Banksia serrata), Phyllota squarrosa, paperbark teatree (Leptospermum trinervium) and mountain devil (Lambertia formosa).

Outline Action of this picaresque novel Flight without a tun occurs four countries: Germany, Switzerland, Nigeria and Georgia. Difficult on a genre and, at the same time the readable and fascinating story about adventures of three protagonists, three Georgian emigrants who are on semi- legal position in German camps for refugees and, as a whole Germany. Author has called his novel wittily a \\"textbook\\". A textbook for those who may act in her poor countries law-contrary and not renounce such way of life also in Germany. Refugee camps are places where people of different denominations and nationality form criminal groupings and, e.g., mediator's groups which connect drug mafia with drug dependent. The behaviors of the heroes is very easy and primitive, her life is a fight for drugs. Author describes the existence of his heroes ironically. Style of the story is epic sometimes and resembles him, Odyssey of Homer; and in places the author as if has a good time Rabelais's imitation and transfers the reader the hypertrophied worlds of poetic satire and humor... The title of the novel is an allusion to Goethe's Faust. To fly away Mephistopheles and doctor Faust use a barrel from Auerbach's Cellar, but for our heroes is for such a flight also enough Joint (cannabis) filled by marihuana. During the trip they meet the souls of her forefathers who worked in Germany in the same area (Grigol Robakidze, Konstantine Gamsakhurdia, David Guramishvili). In Weimar monuments Goethe and Schiller revive and argue with heroes of the novel, the Georgian and Nigerian drug dealers. The Nigerian deity of Olokun (Yoruba god) takes part in all these disputes! With the rise in the hierarchy of the drug mafia seem chums of the Georgian emigrants extremely winning, comical and at the same time dangerous Nigerian crooks. In the end the activity of the international crook's group ends with a failure. The German law has opposed the romantic swindling and the asylum-seekers were pushed away in her native country. Thus becomes clear that Germany is no ideal country because crook can have her chums and, moreover, the western civilization not be shaken. On the border of tragedy and satire balancing story of the novel exists of different and clear streams of consciousness which mark in each case the single heroes. And what is for the author especially importantly in this postmodern story in which all problems are treated ‚Äì like, e.g., the antagonism between developed and non-developed countries, Globalism and Anti-globalism, feminism and anti-feminism, harmonious existence of the sexual minorities and the majorities ‚Äì in witty aspects: The person as an individual and the person as a peculiar world with all his defects and his dignity is a space of the love which reconciles the author in the novel again with the world. In spite of the satire the author lets the readers fall in love in his heroes. And thus the heroes of the novel continue her life in the consciousness of the readers.

Cholmley House or Whitby Hall is a banqueting house sited next to the ruins of Whitby Abbey in North Yorkshire, England. It was built in 1672 by Sir Hugh Cholmeley, whose family had acquired the Abbey ruins and the land around them after its dissolution in 1539 - from then until 1672, the family had lived in what had been the Abbey's gatehouse and guest lodgings. It was originally built with a square forecourt in front of it, now known as the Stone Garden - this contains a replica of the Borghese Gladiator, another replica of which was owned by the builder of the house. In 1743 the family succeeded to the Wentworth estates and moved its main base to Howsham Hall, leaving Cholmley House deserted. The north front lost its roof in a storm in 1790, leading to the demolition of the north front. Only the main hall remained and even this fell into decay before coming into the possession of the Strickland family, who fitted bracing arches in 1866 to secure its walls. These arches were replaced after the Ministry of Works took over the house and abbey ruins in 1936, before it was transferred to the Ministry's successor English Heritage in 1984. The house was reopened on 30 March 2002 by David Hope, then Archbishop of York, as the museum, shop and visitor reception for the Abbey site.

Plot summary 1st century CE: the lame Claudius, not yet Emperor of Rome, travels in the year 23 to Galilee where he meets a charismatic young carpenter, Joshua of Nazareth, and is inspired by his philosophy of heaven on earth. Claudius records the carpenter‚Äôs words on a scroll that he takes back to Rome. Later, after the Nazarene is crucified, Claudius becomes emperor. He fakes his own death and disappears from imperial Rome to contrive an ingenuous plan to hide this secret gospel of Christ from those who would destroy it. 21st century: archaeologist Jack Howard and his team of researchers first learn of this last gospel when excavating Claudius‚Äôs secret library near Pompeii. Following the trail of clues Claudius has laid out, their quest takes them from Italy to London, California, and finally Jerusalem. All the while the mafia and elite Vatican henchmen are hot on their heels, willing to stop at nothing to prevent Christ‚Äôs true message from being discovered. Eventually they find the Gospel of Jesus. In the epilogue the whole scene of Claudius meeting Jesus is shown. The words of the Gospel are: \\" The Kingdom of heaven is on Earth.

The Island Alliance was established in 1996 solely to provide financial support to the Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area. It worked to attract capital investment from the private sector, and coordinates outside activities to secure financial support for the park system. The Island Alliance directly supported park facilities on the mainland (e.g. construction of the \\"Gateway\\" to the park system: the Boston Harbor Islands Pavilion), as well as the renovation of existing facilities (e.g. the Visitors' Centers located on Spectacle Island and Georges Island). The Island Alliance also provided financial management services for the other members of the Boston Harbor Islands Partnership. All members of the Partnership are expected to contribute some amount of funding toward park operations. However, the Island Alliance was the preferred vehicle of revenue generation and capital investment.

Hughie O'Donoghue is married to Clare, and is represented by Marlborough Fine Art, London. Style and influences Hughie O'Donoghue's paintings are highly abstracted figure paintings, an approach that is said to demonstrate the respect he has in his own practice for the history of art. His method is derived from a knowledge and understanding of the methods of both abstract and figurative painters of the past which he attempts to synthesise in his own work.Sue Hubbard, 'Hughie O'Donoghue: The Geometry of Paths', in The Independent (London newspaper), 24 March 2008 This respect for the historic methods of making art has led to O'Donoghue being praised not only for his painting skills, but also his emphasis on the importance of draughtsmanship in the making of a painting.Marianne O'Kane, 'Epic Proportions', in Irish Arts Review, vol. 20, no. 2, 1991 O'Donoghue's application of paint can be thick and heavy, reminiscent of American Abstract Expressionism,Dorothy Walker, Modern Art in Ireland (Dublin: Lilliput Press, 1997) p.151 as in the 'Geometry of Paths' series of paintings. This series was made partly in homage to O'Donoghue's father's service in the RAF in the Second World War, and can be seen as a development from an earlier series along similar lines made for the Imperial War Museum in 2003 called 'Painting Caserta Red'. The name The Geometry of Paths came from the title an old manual for wartime fighter pilots O'Donoghue found in a secondhand bookshop.Hughie O'Donoghue, The Geometry of Paths exh. cat. (London: James Hyman Gallery, 2008) In this series, O'Donoghue also demonstrated a characteristic trait in his work of juxtaposing seemingly unrelated ideas, in this case combining his father's wartime experience and the RAF training manual on one side with the destruction during the Second World War of a painting by Vincent van Gogh called The Painter on the Road to Tarascon. O'Donoghue will also incorporate photographs into the paint, often painting over these again, so the paintings appear as a series of layered images.Sue Hubbard, 'Hughie O'Donoghue: The Geometry of Paths', in The Independent (London newspaper), 24 March 2008 As this indicates, O'Donoghue uses specific narratives as motivations to make his work, and this allows him to explore 'ideas of place and identity in relation to historical and personal meaning'.Unsigned review, 'Hughie O'Donoghue: North Mayo retrospect' in The Irish Times (Ireland newspaper), 6 May 2011 However O'Donoghue has stated himself that he does not believe 'that artists wholly control the meaning of their work'.Hughie O'Donoghue, introduction, in Hughie O'Donoghue: Smoke Signals (London: Purdy Hicks Gallery, 2000) This results in a situations where art becomes a conveyor of incomplete and subjective truths about events such as the Second World War. However, in O'Donoghue's own view the academic study of history is like this anyway. This means O'Donoghue's paintings are not simply reminiscent of historic History painting in terms of their scale and subject matter, but in the way O'Donoghue conceives of them as a kind of historical exegesis.Marianne O'Kane, 'Epic Proportions', in Irish Arts Review, vol. 20, no. 2, 1991 References Further reading * James Hamilton, Hughie O'Donoghue: Painting, Memory, Myth (London: Merrell Publishers Ltd, 2010) External links * *Marlborough Art Gallery, artists' page *ARCHEUS / POST-MODERN, inventory of Hughie O'Donoghue's early works * Profile on Royal Academy of Arts Collections *Hughie O'Donoghue The Geometry of Paths *Hughie O'Donoghue Painting Caserta Red Category:1953 births Category:20th-century British painters Category:British male painters Category:21st-century British painters Category:20th-century Irish painters Category:21st-century Irish painters Category:Irish male painters Category:Modern painters Category:Living people Category:Royal Academicians Category:Alumni of Leeds Trinity University Category:Alumni of Goldsmiths, University of London ","title":"Hughie O'Donoghue"},{"id":"33172384","text":"The Green Isle of the Great Deep is a 1944 dystopian novel by Neil M. Gunn. Whilst the book features two protagonists from his previous novel, Young Art and Old Hector, Gunn transports the characters into an allegory about totalitarianism and the nature of freedom and legend. Plot Young Art and Old Hector are sitting in the kitchen, whilst the characters from the previous book discuss the atrocities occurring in mainland Europe. They then embark on a poaching trip to the Hazel Pool, a location which had great import in their previous adventure. Hector regales Art with tales of the Celtic Otherworld, the eponymous \\"Green Isle of the Great Deep\\" and of the supreme legend of the nuts of knowledge falling into the pool of life and being swallowed by the salmon of wisdom. However, both Art and Hector get into difficulty in the Pool and both seemingly drown in the deep waters. They awake in an alternative Highland universe called the Green Isle. This place is beautiful and fertile but although the land is abundant and the trees ripe with fruit, no one is allowed to touch the fruit and those that eat it fall ill. However, the advent of Art in the island, who proceeds to eat the fruit and then become a fugitive, causes a ripple effect which steadily causes the strict social hierarchy who live at the Seat on the Rock to slowly crumble and for God to awake. Hector demands an audience with God. Another principal character is Mary, who possesses an elixir which allows her and her husband, Robert, to eat the fruit of the trees. Themes Whilst the adventure that allows Gunn to ponder the question of how God could allow the Nazis to inflict their atrocities and subdue a people into doing their bidding the story can also reflect the situation in the Highlands concerning the landlords having feudal control of the land and therefore a great deal of control over their tenants' lives. In Hector's dialogue with God, two major themes are explored; the concept of knowledge without wisdom leading to a separation of the intellect from the spirit resulting in cruelty; and the concept of the requirement for some form of effective governance tempered by prudence. Gunn was a Scottish nationalist and believed in small nations \\"being humanity's last bulwark for personal expression against impersonal tyranny.\\" Reception Gunn himself when asked why \\"Green Isle\\" was not better known, replied, \\"I don't know, it was my best book.\\" References External links *Birlinn Books Profile Category:Caithness Category:Novels set in Scotland Category:Faber and Faber books Category:Dystopian novels Category:1944 British novels ","title":"The Green Isle of the Great Deep"},{"id":"33172387","text":"Manchester Evening Chronicle was a newspaper established by Sir Edward Hulton, a Manchester City chairman, a newspaper proprietor and a racehorse owner. It started publication in 1897, was renamed Evening Chronicle in 1914 but stayed in Manchester. It continued publication under various ownerships until 1963, when it was merged with the more successful Manchester Evening News and discontinued publication. History Hulton's father Edward Hulton was a well-known publisher and had founded earlier the Sporting Chronicle in 1871, the Athletic News in 1875 and the Sunday Chronicle in 1885. Besides the Manchester Evening Chronicle, Sir Edward Hulton also founded the Daily Dispatch in 1900 and the Daily Sketch tabloid newspaper in 1909. The Manchester Evening Chronicle was renamed Evening Chronicle in 1914. Edward Hulton and Co., of London and Manchester, a private company of proprietors, printers and publishers was sold for ¬£6 million when Hulton retired due to illness in 1923. The newspapers were sold, including the Manchester Evening Chronicle. The paper became controlled by Lord Beaverbrook and Lord Rothermere. Most of Hulton newspapers were sold again soon afterwards, to the Allied Newspapers consortium formed in 1924 (renamed Kemsley Newspapers in 1943 and bought by Roy Thomson in 1959). Almost all the newspapers Hulton founded have since merged with other newspapers. In 1955 the Daily Dispatch merged with the News Chronicle, which was subsequently absorbed into the Daily Mail in 1960. The Evening Chronicle on the other hand, ailing by the 1960s was merged with the more successful Manchester Evening News in 1963. Tournaments Manchester Evening Chronicle also organized various sports events, notably The Manchester Evening Chronicle Tournament, a professional golf tournament played at Mere Golf Club in Mere, Cheshire, England. It was held from 1947 to 1949. Total prize money was ¬£1400 in 1947 and ¬£1500 in 1948 and 1949.

It originally aired in six episodes on RAI 1 from January 16 to February 8, 2011 and was followed by a second season entitled Challenge to the sky (Sfida al cielo) in 2015. The first season of La narcotici (English: Anti-Drug Squad) was produced by Italy's Goodtime srl and the second season was co-produced by Goodtime srl with Germany's Beta production. Created by Leonardo Fasoli (Gomorrah) and written and directed by Michele Soavi, both seasons of Anti-Drug Squad are currently airing on MHz Choice and Amazon Prime, in Italian with English subtitles. The series follows the investigations of a Rome-based Narcotics team as they tackle drug- trafficking in the Italian capital. First season - Hunting the King (Caccia al Re) The drug lord referred to as King in the title is referred to in the series as The Eighth King of Rome. The first seven kings of Rome ruled from 753 BC, when Rome was founded, to 509 BC, when the kingdom was overthrown and Rome became a Republic. =Background= Deputy Police Chief Daniele Piazza (Gedeon Burkhard), aka Lupo, is put in charge of leading the narcotics section, after the former head of Narcotics was arrested for corruption. Piazza has been working in the anti-Robbery section while living with his daughter Sara (Laura Glavan), 17. The season opens with a flashback showing the death of Piazza's wife in a hit-and-run accident 13 years earlier, when their daughter was 4. The vehicle that killed his wife was being driven by a bank robber (Stefano Dionisi) fleeing the scene of Rome's biggest bank heist. The 35 Billion Lire from that bank heist turns out to have provided the capital for launching the Eighth King of Rome's drug empire. Thus, from the very beginning, we learn that the Eighth King of Rome is the man who murdered, then, Deputy Inspector Piazza's wife. =Cast & Characters= Deputy Police ChiefRanks are duty-based equated to those of the NYPD Piazza's team are # Inspector Daria Lucente (Raffaella Rea) - She led the investigation that convicted her former boss.

Tsar Peter the Great felt that the Russian people needed a Bible in the vernacular and authorized Pastor Johann Ernst Gl√ºck in 1703 to prepare such an edition. Gl√ºck died in 1705 and nothing is known of his work.  Early East Slavic translation projects  Francysk Skaryna (ca 1490-1552?) was the first to attempt the translation and printing of the Bible in Ruthenian, based on the Slavonic and Czech Bibles.The Slavs in European History and Civilization - Page 307 Francis Dvornik - 1962 \\"He was followed by the Belo-Russian Skorina, who had conceived the plan of printing the first Bible in Russian.

Gawthrop - 1993 \\"Francke's dream of a cheap Russian Bible was never realized, the \\"Elizabeth\\" Bible of 1751 , the first Bible in Russian to go through several editions, was prepared by translators trained at the Halle press.\\" Orthodox Church version The first Orthodox Church Bible appeared in 1876.Journal of the Moscow Patriarchate - 1978 \\"The latest edition of the Bible for the 100th anniversary of the first Bible in Russian came out in 1976. \\" It was left to the 19th century in connection with the establishment of the Russian Bible Society (founded in 1812 at Saint Petersburg, with the consent of Alexander I) to prepare a Bible in the vernacular. The work was undertaken by Filaret, rector of the Theological Academy of Saint Petersburg (afterward metropolitan of Moscow), and other members of the faculty of the academy. The Gospels were published in 1818 and in 1822 the entire New Testament. In 1820 the translation of the Old Testament was undertaken, and in 1822 Philaret's translation of the Psalms was published. In 1825 the Pentateuch, Joshua, Judges, and Ruth were issued. The year 1826 saw an end to the activity of the Bible Society in the ban put upon all kinds of private associations, even when non-political. Not before 1858 was the work of translation resumed. In 1876 the entire Bible was published in one volume. This translation is called the Synod Version. The Old Testament books, though based upon the Hebrew Bible, follow the order of the Septuagint and the Church Slavonic Bible. The Apocryphal books also form a part of the Russian Bible. The British and Foreign Bible Society also issued a Russian edition, omitting, however, the Apocrypha. Recent versions Since 1990 the Russian Bible Society and Protestants in Russia have produced newer translations into the Russian language. In September, 2000 the International Bible Society completed a Dynamic equivalence translation called Slovo Zhizny, the Russian equivalent of the English New International Version.

Introduction The Forum of Women's NGOs of Kyrgyzstan (FWNGO) was conceived in 1995. It was created to provide assistance to women's NGOs and establishing a network for mutual cooperation. The Forum seeks to consolidate the country's network of women's organizations, activists, and leaders. The consolidation activities focus on strengthening the capacity of institutional members to improve women's lives and increase gender equality in communities across Kyrgyzstan. Accordingly, the Forum focuses its main efforts in addressing gender issues in the Central Asian region. Today, the Forum of Women's NGOs of Kyrgyzstan works closely with more than 85 NGOs in Kyrgyzstan. History & Formation Following a conference of Central Asian women's organisations in 1995, participants at the conference decided that regular meetings between women's organizations would facilitate information exchange and help groups cooperate. Thus, they published a women's informational bulletin titled \\"Joogazyn\\" (Tulip) in Russian and Kyrgyz; assisting group members in writing grants and project proposals; and sponsoring conferences and seminars on topics concerning women.http://www.civilsoc.org/nisorgs/kyrgyz/wmnNGOs.htm Vision \\"Women‚Äôs empowerment is a key to successful development\\" Mission The Forum‚Äôs mission is the consolidation and strengthening of women's movement towards gender equality and women's empowerment. This is achieved by building partnerships towards women's equality, creating an increase in women's participation in public life through their organizations and NGOs. As part of this mission the Forum of Women's NGOs of Kyrgyzstan contributes to developing the capacity of women's organizations', and organizing active networking in Kyrgyzstan and in Central Asia. Activities The Forum has three main activities: i. monthly seminars and national workshops ii. monthly newsletters iii. training to develop organizational capacity With funding from the Asian Development Bank, the Forum conducted a number of activities designed to build partnerships between women's NGOs in both the Kyrgyz Republic and in Central Asia. Peaceful March of Citizens for Law and Order These ‚Äòmarches‚Äô are organized on a regular basis, as a form of a peaceful demonstration, bringing to light ‚Äúwomen's positions with regards to growing criminality in Bishkek and in Kyrgyzstan‚Äù. Flyers are distributed during the March and the text of flyers were in two languages ‚Äì Kyrgyz and Russian to help raise awareness. Those in attendance don violet scarves, as a show of solidarity. Though there was a crackdown on the media‚Äôs broadcasting of this peaceful demonstration, certain political leaders acquiesced to the requests put forth by the Forum at past marches. Nevertheless, major media networks were present at past events to interview some of the participants of the demonstration, a sign that even if there was no televising the event, there was still much interest from the public and media at large. Women's Dialogue In June 1997, the Forum hosted a conference of Central Asian women's NGOs entitled \\"Women's Dialogue\\". 50 Women in Politics This is a four-year programme run by the Forum, and it seeks to increase gender equality in Kyrgyzstan's political system and aims to empower women's political leadership capacity by increasing the number of women participating in the next set of regional and local elections. The ultimate goal is to facilitate the election of female candidates in the 2010 parliamentary elections.http://www.globaljusticecenter.net/projects/ Kyrgyzstan/Forum-Womens-NGOs.html School of Women‚Äôs Studies At present, the Forum is working to create a School of Women's Studies in Bishkek. Affiliations The Forum is an active member of the United Nations ECOSOC and has participated several sessions in the interests of UN ECOSOC in addressing the status of women. The Forum is an active member of the Asian- Pacific Forum on Women, Law and Development (APWLD). It represents the national monitor for Violence Against Women (VAW) in Kyrgyzstan The Forum is also supported by the European Union in campaigning the role of civil society by encouraging non-state actors to play an active role.http://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/Kyrgyzstan/eu_Kyrgyzstan/civil_society_dialogue/index_en.htm References Other Resources * http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cedaw/docs/NGOs/ForumofWomensNGOS_Kyrgyzstan42.pdf * http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001465/146593e.pdf Category:Women's organisations based in Kyrgyzstan ","title":"Forum of Women's NGOs"},{"id":"33172471","text":"Cascina Vianello is an Italian television series.

Description The site lies partly on traditionally owned Aboriginal land and partly on the Bing Bong, Manangoora and Greenbank pastoral leases. The intertidal mudflats are up to 5 km in width and, at low tide, join up with those of South-West Island.BirdLife International. (2011). Important Bird Areas factsheet: Port McArthur Tidal Wetlands System. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 22/09/2011. Birds The site has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because the mudflats have supported over 1% of the world populations of grey-tailed tattlers, eastern curlews and great knots, as well as moderate numbers of Asian dowitchers. Other wader species recorded in substantial numbers include curlew sandpipers, marsh sandpipers and black- tailed godwits. Great-billed herons occur in greater densities than recorded elsewhere in the Northern Territory. Small numbers of beach stone-curlews are present. Little terns breed at sites along the coast. There are at least two large waterbird breeding colonies containing over 3000 egrets, cormorants and pied herons. Non-waterbird species include white-gaped honeyeaters and canary white-eyes.

The genre is a combination of detective crime and sentimental comedy. The series consists of two seasons of twelve episodes: the first was broadcast from 8 January to 12 February 2009 on Rai 1, while the second aired from 3 March 2011 on the same network. A third series, of which the subject had already been laid out, was not completed.  Production  is a spin-off of the 2005 television series Una famiglia in giallo, in which the actor Guido Caprino, interpreter of Luca Manara, appeared in a secondary role in the 5th episode entitled \\"Biscotti al Veleno\\". For the new series that saw him as the protagonist, Caprino claimed to have been inspired by Frank Zappa for behavioral psychology and the physiognomy to be attributed to Commissioner Manara, being in first person an estimator of the Italian-American composer and guitarist. The episodes are set in a fictional location not precisely specified between Orbetello and the Argentario promontory, but in reality the first season was filmed about 90 kilometers away, in the countries bordering Lake Bracciano (Bracciano, Trevignano Romano, Anguillara). In particular the seat of the municipality of Trevignano Romano was transformed into the police station directed by the commissioner Luca Manara. The second season of the series, announced in 2010, was shot in Maremma and in Rome. Filming lasted 19 weeks, from May to October 2010, for a total of 105 days. In July 2012 the third season did not appear in the RAI production plans, and the creator of the series Alberto Simone began to fear that he had now reached the epilogue, thus commenting the news on Facebook: \\"The new Series Subject that we already had written, full of even more amusing novelties and with a gigantic twist in the life of our friendly protagonist, it will therefore remain in the production drawers \\". In August 2013, following the change of direction of Rai Fiction (from Fabrizio Del Noce to Eleonora Andreatta), the realization of a third season was confirmed and the broadcast was scheduled for autumn 2014 on Rai 1. In the first months of 2014, however, the series was finally definitively suppressed.  Plot  The first season begins with the arrival in Tuscany, in a town of the Maremma Grossetana, of the new commissioner, Luca Manara, a nonconformist who, thanks to his charm, conquers every woman in the country. He is working with subordinates who are a bit clumsy but willing, and thanks to their help he is able to solve the murder cases that occur in each episode. In the police station he is working closely with Inspector Lara Rubino, played by Roberta Giarrusso, whom he had already met during the school for inspectors, and, between highs and lows, the two begin a relationship that will lead them to get engaged in the final episode, very rich in twists. The second season begins with the marriage between the two protagonists, Luca Manara and Lara Rubino, who is interrupted by a murder. Due to the fact Lara moves to Milan for a refresher course, and is temporarily replaced in the police station by Marta, played by Anna Safroncik [6], a colleague with a dark past who will fall in love with the protagonist. In reality, Manara still loves Lara and at the end of the series she will rejoin with her, while Marta will return to the anti-Camorra team together with a colleague (initially enemy of Manara) who heads the anti-terrorist team. Recurring characters are Lara's aunt, Caterina Bentivoglio (who was Scarpati's mother in the series A family in yellow) and her sheepdog Brigadiere; the policemen of the commissarial bumbling and clumsy but willing, in particular the Toscani-Sardinian couple who in the first series falls in love and gets married and in the second gives birth to a little girl named Alice; the coroner Ginevra Rosmini, a seductive devourer of men; the superintendent Casadio, who does not appreciate the methods of Manara but must recognize each time his skill; and finally Ada, the owner of the farm where Manara lives. The strong Piedmontese accent characterizes the recurrent cameos of Bruno Gambarotta in the role of the policeman Quattroni.

The historical development of program evaluation. Online Journal of Workforce Education and Development, 2(4) To this end, the approach makes use of teams of evaluators who present two opposing views (these teams are commonly referred to as adversaries and advocates). These two sides then agree on issues to address, collect data or evidence which forms a common database, and present their arguments. A neutral party is assigned to referee the hearing, and is expected to arrive at a fair verdict after consideration of all the evidence presented.Miller, R. L. & Butler, J. (2008). Using an adversary hearing to evaluate the effectiveness of a Military program. The Qualitative Report, 13 (1), 12‚Äì25. There are many different models for adversary evaluations, including judicial, congressional hearing and debate models. However, models which subscribe to a legal-framework are most prominent in the literature.Worthen, B. (1990). Program evaluation. In H. Walberg & G. Haertel (Eds.), The international encyclopedia of educational evaluation (42‚Äì47). Toronto, ON: Pergammon Press. The legal/judicial model The judicial evaluation model is an adaptation of legal procedures for an evaluative framework. Unlike legal adversary hearings, the objective of this approach is not to win, but rather to provide a comprehensive understanding of the program in question. This model assumes that it is impossible for an evaluator not to have a biasing impact. Therefore, the focus of these evaluations shifts from scientific justification to public accountability. Multiple stakeholders are involved, and this approach aims at informing both the public, and those involved in the evaluation about the object of evaluation. While the model is flexible, it usually incorporates a hearing, prosecution, defence, a jury, charges and rebuttals. Dependent upon the evaluation in question, this model may also incorporate pre-trial conferences, direct questioning and redirected questions, and summaries by prosecution and defence (Owens, 1973). Proponents of this model, however, stress the importance of carefully adapting the model to the environment in which it is deployed, and the policy which it intends to address. Procedure While flexibility is encouraged when implementing an adversary evaluation, some theorists have attempted to identify the stages of specific adversary models. Wolf (1979) and Thurston,Thurston, P. (1978). Revitalizing adversary evaluation: deep dark deficits or muddled mistaken musings. Educational Researcher, 7(7), 3‚Äì8. propose the following four stages for a judicial evaluation: ; 1. The issue generation stage : At this stage, a broad range of issues are identified. Thurston recommends that issues which reflect those perceived by a variety of persons involved in, or affected by the program in question, are taken under consideration in the preliminary stages. ; 2. The issue selection stage : This stage consists of issue- reduction. Wolf (1979) proposes that issues on which there is no debate, should be eliminated. Thurston states that this reduction may involve extensive analysis (inclusive of content, logic and inference). The object of debate should also be defined and focused during this stage (Wolf, 1979). ; 3. The preparation of arguments stage : This stage consists of data collection, locating relevant documents and synthesising available information. The data or evidence collected should be relevant to the for and against arguments to be deployed in the hearing (Wolf, 1979). ; 4. The hearing stage itself : This stage may also be referred to as the clarification forum and involves public presentation of the object of debate (Wolf, 1979). This is followed by the presentation of evidence and panel or jury deliberation. Owens (1973) provides a more detailed description of the hearing stage in an advocate-adversary setting. He attributes the following characteristics to this aspect of the model (list adapted from Crabbe & Leroy, p. 129): * Procedural rules must be flexible * There are no strict rules for the assessment of evidence. The only requirement is that the judge(s) must determine beforehand whether evidence is admissible or not. * The parties may be asked before the hearing to present all relevant facts, pieces of evidence and names of witnesses/experts to the judges * A copy of the complaint must, before the public hearing takes place, be committed to the judge(s) and the defence. The defence may plead guilty to some charges and deny others. * Witnesses are able to speak freely and may be subjected to cross-examination. * Experts may be summoned for a statement before or during the hearing. * Meetings of all parties involved with the judge(s) prior to the public hearing tend to soften the debate and can be conducive to a joint striving to get to the truth of the matter on the basis of relevant facts. * Besides the two parties involved, other stakeholders may also be allowed to participate. Benefits The following are identified as benefits of using an adversarial approach: # Due to the public nature of the evaluation, openness and transparency regarding the object of evaluation is encouraged. # As the model takes into account multiple forms of data (inclusive of statistical fact, opinions, suppositions, values and perceptions), it is argued to do justice to the complex social reality which forms part of the evaluation (Wolf, 1975). # The judicial nature of this approach may reduce political controversy surrounding an object of evaluation. # As both sides of an argument are presented, the risks of tactical withholding of information should be minimised. # This approach allows for the incorporation of a multitude of perspectives, this should promote a more holistic evaluation (Wolf, 1975, 1979). # The presentation of pro and con evidence and a platform which allows for cross-examination, permits public access to various interpretations of the evidence introduced into the evaluative context (Wolf, 1975). # The presentation of rival hypotheses and explanations may enhance both quantitative and qualitative approaches (Yin, 1999). # All data must be presented in an understandable and logical way in order to persuade the jury. Dependent on the jury in question, this can make the data presented more accessible to the public and other stakeholders involved in the evaluation. # Finally, this approach is suitable for meta- evaluation and may be combined with other approaches which are participatory or expertise-oriented. Limitations According to Smith (1985), many of the limitations of this approach relate to its competitive nature, the complexity of the process, and the need for skilled individuals willing to perform the various roles needed for a hearing. Listed are the main limitations of the adversary evaluation: # This form of evaluation may provoke venomous debate and conflict may have a negative impact on the outcome of the evaluation. # The focus of the evaluation may shift to assigning blame or guilt, rather than optimising policy. # As adversary-advocate models are conflict-based, possibilities for reaching an agreeable outcome are curtailed. # Key stakeholders are not always equally skilled, and articulate individuals are placed at an advantage. # This method can be time-consuming and expensive (Owens, 1973). # It is sometimes difficult for hearing members to develop specific, operational recommendations (Wolf, 1979). # Time-limitations may only allow for a narrow focus. Applications Although currently out of favour, this approach has been used quite extensively in the field of educational evaluation (Owens, 1973). It has also been applied to ethnographic research (Schensul, 1985) and the evaluation of state employment agencies (Braithwaite & Thompson, 1981). Crabbe and Leroy contend that an adversary approach to evaluation should be beneficial when: # The program being evaluated may affect a large group of people; # when the issue in question is one of controversy and public attention; # when the parties involved realise and accept the power of a public trial; # when the object of evaluation is well-defined and amenable to polarised positions; # in contexts in which judges are likely to be perceived as neutral, and; # when there are sufficient time and monetary resources available for the method. Criticisms Popham and CarlsonPopham, W. J. & Carlson, D. (1977). Deep dark deficits of the adversary evaluation model. Educational Researcher, 6(6), 3‚Äì6. proposed that adversary evaluation was flawed based on the following six points: # Disparity in adversary abilities # Fallible judges # Excessive confidence in the usefulness of the model # Difficulty in framing issues # Potential for the manipulation of results # Excessive cost Popham and Carlson, however, were in turn criticised by others in the field. Gregg JacksonJackson, G. (1977). Adversary evaluation: sentenced to death without a fair trial. Educational Researcher, 6(10), 2‚Äì18. argues that these criticisms do a \\"gross injustice\\" (p. 2) to adversary evaluation. He proposes that the only valid criticism amongst those listed is \\"difficulty in framing issues\\" (p. 2), stating that the other points are unfair, untrue or exaggerated. He further noted that Popham and Carlson seemed to hold adversary evaluation to a higher or different standard to other forms of evaluation. Thurston argues in line with Jackson, but proposes two alternative criticisms of adversary evaluation. He states that issue definition and the use of the jury pose major problems for this approach. Finally, Worthen notes that at present there is little more than personal preference which determines which type of evaluation will best suite a program. Crabbe and Leroy caution that all evaluations should be approached with regard to their unique needs and goals, and adjusted and implemented accordingly; there is unlikely to be one approach which satisfies the needs of all programs.

Frances Marion, who wrote the screenplay, became frustrated by the numerous requests and later said she \\"lost track of what the story was really about and the material seemed frayed on all edges.\\" The film's stars, John Gilbert and Ren√©e Ador√©e, complained about the numerous rewrites and felt their roles were \\"not worthy\\". Before filming completed, George W. Hill requested that he be removed as director as he did not like the film's subject matter and had tired of Gilbert and Ador√©e's complaints. Clarence Brown was then hired to reshoot several scenes and ultimately completed the film. Among the many extras used in The Cossacks were members of a \\"Dijigit Troupe\\" of over 100 genuine Russian Cossacks, who in 1926 came to the United States from Europe after performing equestrian exhibitions and traditional Cossack musical and dance shows in various cities in France and England.Anikouchine, William Alexander (1999).\\"Cossack Timeline\\", 1925-1928, Foundation for East European Family History Studies, Payson, Utah; retrieved December 15, 2017.Axmaker, Sean. \\"The Cossacks (1928)\\", article, Turner Classic Movies (TCM), Turner Broadcasting System, a subsidiary of Time Warner, New York, N.Y.; retrieved December 13, 2017. Once the troupe arrived in the United States, MGM contracted some of its horsemen to perform as trick riders and as doubles in several of the studio's films in 1927 and 1928, including The Gaucho and The Cossacks. In its review of The Cossacks in June 1928, the American entertainment trade publication Variety notes the use of these Russian extras and their contributions to enhancing the authentic \\"look\\" of the film. Variety also comments about the equestrian exhibition, \\"the fiasco\\", that the Cossack troupe had presented in New York at Madison Square Garden before some of its performers continued to California, where MGM crews had constructed elaborate location sets for the Cossacks in Laurel Canyon: Reception The Cossacks received mixed reviews from critics upon its release in 1928. Variety gave generally high marks to the actors' performances and to the film's overall production values: Mordaunt Hall, the influential film critic for The New York Times in 1928, viewed Gilbert's performance quite differently. Hall disparaged the actor's interpretation of Lukashka, both in his portrayal of the character's temperament and physical appearance: The film earned rentals of $747,000 in the United States and Canada and foreign rentals of $588,000 for a total of $1,335,000.

Its function is in osmoregulation, responding to changes in environmental osmolality by regulating the expression of the outer membrane porins OmpF and OmpC. EnvZ is a histidine kinase which also possesses a cytoplasmic osmosensory domain, and OmpR is its corresponding response regulator protein. Overview EnvZ is a sensor-transmitter that spans the inner cytoplasmic membrane and has historically been divided into two domains, the sensory and the transmitter domain. The protein is composed of a short N-terminal tail in the periplasm, two transmembrane regions with an intervening periplasmic loop, and a cytoplasmic domain containing the autophosphorylated histidine residue, which is located in a dimeric four-helix bundle. Variations in osmolality trigger conformational changes in EnvZ which have been localized to the cytoplasmic four-helix bundle and which effects phosphoryl transfer to OmpR. Upon phosphorylation, OmpR becomes an active dimer that exhibits enhanced DNA-binding ability specific for both the ompC and ompF genes. The signaling cascade can be elucidated as follows: :#Activation of the inner membrane sensor histidine kinase EnvZ, :#Autophosphorylation of EnvZ at His243, :#Phosphate transfer to OmpR at Asp 55, :#Binding of OmpR-P to upstream sites on the ompF and ompC porin promoters to differentially modulate their transcription. :#Dephosphorylation of OmpR-P via the phosphatase function of EnvZ. It is important to note that ompF and ompC are expressed at all times at constant levels; however, the individual porins OmpF and OmpC are present in various relative abundances based on medium osmolarity. Also, the amount of OmpF and OmpC are each controlled by a variety of mechanisms; for example, synthesis of OmpF is also repressed by high temperature. Likewise, the EnvZ-OmpR pair is involved in tripeptide permease system that is completely free of osmotic control. However, the control of EnvZ-OmpR over OmpF and OmpC is a significant mechanism. Low osmolarity response When medium osmolarity is low, EnvZ exhibits comparatively low kinase activity (i.e., high phosphatase activity) towards OmpR. Hence the amount of the phosphorylated form of OmpR in cells is relatively small. In this particular situation, the OmpR-P complex binds cooperatively to F1, F2 and F3 activator sites of ompF gene and upregulates its transcription. These sites have high relative affinity for OmpR-P complex as compared to the C1, C2 and C3 activator sites of ompC. Therefore transcription levels of ompC is less as compared to ompF under low osmolarity condition. This phenomenon has been attributed to the fact that OmpF has a larger pore diameter (1.12 nm) than OmpC (1.08 nm) which results in a 10-fold faster diffusion rate that provides a selective advantage at low osmolarity to rapidly scavenge scarce nutrients. High osmolarity response In the event of high medium osmolarity, EnvZ actively undergoes auto-phosphorylation and then efficiently transfers its phosphoryl groups to the N-terminal receiver domain of OmpR through EnvZ-OmpR complex formation. As the number of phosphorylated OmpR protein molecules increases, two events occur: OmpR binds not only to the high affinity binding sites upstream of the ompF promoter but also to the one low affinity-binding site. Binding to this low affinity site results in repression of ompF gene. Further, OmpR binds to the three low affinity activator sites upstream of the OmpC promoters as a result ompC gene expression is stimulated and more OmpC porin protein is expressed on outer membrane of the cell. Also, transcription of micF antisense mRNA is initiated at high medium osmolarity. micF binds to complementary sequence of ompF mRNA to block its translation. These two mechanisms ensure that there is relatively higher expression of OmpC as compared to OmpF under the conditions of high medium osmolarity.

According to the ISI Citations web database, Cardona was one of the eight most cited physicists since 1970. He specialized in solid state physics. Academic career Cardona was born in Barcelona, Spain in 1934. After obtaining a Masters in physics in 1955 from University of Barcelona Cardona was awarded a fellowship to work as a graduate student at Harvard University starting in 1956. At Harvard he began investigations of the dielectric properties of semiconductors, in particular germanium and silicon. With this work as a thesis he received a PhD in Applied Physics at Harvard. From 1959 till 1961 he continued similar work on III-V semiconductors at the RCA Laboratories in Zurich, Switzerland. In 1961 he moved to the RCA Labs in Princeton, NJ, where he continued work on the optical properties of semiconductors and started investigations of the microwave properties of superconductors. In 1964 he became a member of the Physics Faculty of Brown University (Providence, RI). In June‚ÄìSeptember 1965 he taught at the University of Buenos Aires under the auspices of the Ford Foundation. In 1971 he moved to Stuttgart, Germany as a founding director of the then-recently created Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research. Concomitantly he became scientific Member of the Max Planck Society, where he became emeritus in 2000.  Interests  Cardona's main interests were in the fields of: Raman scattering (and other optical spectroscopies) as applied to semiconductor microstructures, materials with tailor-made isotopic compositions, and high Tc superconductors, particularly investigations of electronic and vibronic excitations in the normal and superconducting state.

Background J√∏rn Utzon grew up in Aalborg, a harbour city in the north of Jutland. As a boy, he spent much of his time sailing on the Limfjord or at the wharf where his father, Aage Utzon, worked as a shipbuilding engineer and where J√∏rn became fascinated with ships and their intricate designs. These impressions would be a lasting inspiration for his later works.Tobias Faber \\"J√∏rn Utzon\\", Kunstindekx Danmark & Weilbachskunstnerleksikon. Retrieved 18 September 2011. But the idea of a centre came not from Utzon himself but from Aalborg University's School for Architecture and Design as a place where students could research and discuss architectural trends.Sarah Kott, \\"Et Strejf af Utzon i Aalborg\\", Jyllands Posten, 27 May 2008.

At the initiative of Adrian Carter of the Architecture and Design School, the Utzon Research Center was established in 2003 with the objective of promoting understanding of Utzon's work. In August 2003, a symposium and a summer school brought together 150 participants from across the globe. Thanks to its success, economic support was received from Sydney, Australia, and major funding was allocated by the European Union and the Obel Foundation for the creation of an Utzon archive and research center, providing a basis for the Utzon Center itself. As a result, Utzon and his son Kim were invited to design plans for a new building. \\"The Utzon Research Center\\" . Retrieved 22 September 2011. In August 2005, when he was 87 years old, the plans Utzon and his son Kim had completed for a 2,700 square metre exhibition and research centre on the Aalborg waterfront were presented to the press. The Utzon Foundation under university rector Finn Kj√¶rsdam would be responsible for completing the project.\\"Et nyt Utzon-center i Aalborg skal skabe debat om arkitektur.

At the time, J√∏rn Utzon communicated his own ideas about the centre: \\"From the bottom of my heart I hope that the Utzon Center will be a place where good thoughts will meet, and where the students from the School of Architecture will go when they want to be together to discuss their ideas. It will be a power centre for architecture and human life in the future.\\"Line Christensen, \\"Regarding Utzon Center: Architecture for Everybody\\" , Utzon Center. Retrieved 22 September 2011. Architecture The Utzon Center on Aalborg's waterfront With its highly reflective, dramatically curved rooftops, the centre cannot be missed. The rather tent-like spaces they enclose are reminiscent of Utzon's times in the Middle East and the Mediterranean. Most of the rooms are impressively well lit, offering views out over the Limfjord. To protect visitors from the wind, Utzon has provided sheltered courtyards inside the complex which also contribute to the pleasure of eating in the outdoor area of the restaurant. The building has an open and welcoming look but at the same time has the protective feel of Utzon's houses on Mallorca and of Kim Utzon's other projects, some of which have an almost fortress-like appearance. \\"Aalborgt√•rnet\\", Berlingske, 16 June 2008. Retrieved 21 September 2011. The centre consists of several individual buildings creating a special place around a courtyard on a platform. The tall sculptural roofs of the auditorium and the boathall, both on the harbour front, and the library facing the park area and the city are set off by the lower roofs of the exhibition and workshop areas inside the complex.\\"Utzon Center\\", Kim Utzon Arkitekter. Retrieved 22 September 2011. The centre's role The Utzon Research Center at Aalborg University is responsible for planning the centre's core activities. The top priority is to undertake research directed towards promoting the significance of J√∏rn Utzon's work and approach. This is achieved by organising workshops, conferences and exhibitions and disseminating their results for the benefit of the architecture profession and the general public. The centre is not a museum immortalizing Utzon but rather a knowledge centre designed to convey an understanding of architecture in general and quality in the broadest sense. It also has lecture theatres and workshops as well as a library with bright study areas close to the windows. It also celebrates the boatbuilder Aage Utzon, the architect's father, and includes ships designed by him. There is also an archive of Utzon's original drawings.Lars Attrup, \\"En enest√•ende arkitekt er d√∏d\\", Jyllands Posten, 29 November 2008. Retrieved 22 September 2011. The Utzon Center also hosts exhibitions of the work of other architects and has a programme of events of interest to the general public.

After years of instability caused by inter-clan cattle raiding and a decade-long military disarmament campaign in Karamoja, many people in the region have been finding alternatives to their traditional semi-nomadic pastoralist lifestyles. One such alternative is mining. Typically male, miners use rudimentary tools to dig holes reaching up to 10 m underground. The miners then spend up to ten hours a day digging earth from tunnels. The earth is then passed to the surface in homemade containers where it is washed and sieved. Gold extracted at Rupa is bought on-site by dealers from other regions of Uganda and neighbouring Kenya. It is then transferred to either Uganda‚Äôs capital, Kampala, or Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, for resale. In early April 2011, the local price paid for 0.1 grams of gold was around 7000 Ugandan shillings, equivalent to around 2.5 US dollars. Generally, miners say that they extract between 0.05 and 0.1 grams (known locally as a ‚Äúpoint‚Äù) each day. This local price level was barely half the price level on international commodity markets. In early April 2011, gold was trading at $1,476 per troy ounce, equivalent to $47.45 per gram, or $4.75 per point. The differential between the local and international price reflects the costs involved in transporting output from mines and the profit margins taken by local, regional and global intermediaries. In the absence of official data, estimating the size of the gold deposits at Rupa remains difficult, but local mining officials have said that as many as 10,000 people now depend on the mine for their incomes. Safety and Child Labour Anecdotal evidence collected from miners at the Rupa site suggests that injuries and deaths are common. Accidents often occur when unsupported tunnels dug by inexperienced miners collapse, trapping people inside. Child labour is common, with minors under the age of ten often used to collect water for washing the gold. Whole families sometimes work at the mine, with children absent from school. Aerial survey and potential industrial extraction In 2009 Uganda‚Äôs government concluded an airborne geophysical study of over 80 percent of the country‚Äôs landmass to map mineral deposits. Funded by the World Bank, the project was seen as an important step in developing the country‚Äôs extractive sector. However, due to ongoing security concerns, the survey did not include the Karamoja region. As of mid-2011, according to officials at the Department for Geological Survey and Mines, plans had been drawn up to extend the survey to Karamoja, but funding for this extension remained absent. Although Ugandan officials have expressed hopes that mining in Karamoja will help develop this severely deprived region local activists and inhabitants have expressed fears that the arrival of industrial extraction could destroy the precarious livelihoods of artisanal miners working at the Rupa site.

Translated by Princess Galitzine for Chapmann & Hall, it came out in English in 1874. Prince Serebrenni (also known as The Silver Knight, according to the alternative translation), a novel about 16th-century Russia, inspired by the works of Sir Walter Scott and the German Romantics, has become a popular young adult novel in Russia. Acknowledging its limits as a historical document, critics invariably praised the way it \\"imbued the readership with the ideas of justice, honesty, nobleness and human dignity.\\"  Background  Aleksey Tolstoy had been for years intrigued by the theme which became the book's leitmotif: that of a struggle between Ivan the Terrible, the most cruel of all Russian monarchs, and boyarstvo, a community of high-ranked aristocrats who opposed the Tsar and his tyranny, largely carried out by the Oprichniki. Several of his poems and ballads, notably, Vasily Shibanov and Knyaz Mikhailo Repnin, were investigating this historical dilemma. The death of Nikolai I and the emergence of the new atmosphere of openness prompted Tolstoy to set upon working on the novel about the disaster the absolute monarchy might bring. =History= Tolstoy started working on Prince Serebrenni in the late 1840s. Several sources reported that in the course of his Kaluga mission alongside senator Davydov, Tolstoy read the novel to Alexandra Smirnova-Rossette and Nikolai Gogol.Russkaya Starina magazine, 1890, No. 11, pp. 362-363. It was there and then (according to P.A.Kulish) that Gogol told Tolstoy about a folk song \\"Master Panteley Walks About in the Yard\\" which has been promptly installed into the plot. According to N.Kolmakov, senator Davydov's senior aide, the novel by this time had been finished.Kolmakov, N.M. The Old Russian Court. Russkaya Starina, 1886, No.12, pp. 520-521 If so, this could apply only to its very first, rough version. After that, apparently came a long break for there's been not a mention of the novel up until 1855. \\"I'd like to sit down and write Prince Serebrenny, but still cannot find it in me,\\" Tolstoy complained in a letter to his wife on May 10, 1855. He mentioned it again in his December 13, 1856, letter. By this time the novel has been finished but the author was not pleased with the result. Again a pause followed and the work resumed in 1859. In a February 4, 1859, letter to his friend and translator Boleslav Markevich Tolstoy wrote: \\"I've been working upon Serebrenny but failed to finish it, too restless my mind was.\\" Also in 1859 he wrote to Mikhail Pogodin who was asking for a fragment to be included in the Utro anthology: \\"My novel still needs a clean-up and not even a fragment can be published in its present state. Thousands of small things prevented me from starting upon it.\\" In a March 20, 1860 letter he informed Markevich that the novel was now virtually finished but the second part of it looked much stronger than the first one which needed to be improved. Prince Serebrenni premiered at a recital party in the Palace in late December 1861. The readings which lasted several days were highly successful and brought the author a book-trinket from Empress consort Maria Aleksandrovna as a personal gift. = Sources = Prince Serebrenni was the first example in the Russian literature of a historical novel written in the West European tradition. Much in the vein of Sir Walter Scott and Alexander Dumas' classics, a fictitious character here acts among real historical figures in a thoroughly researched and artfully recreated historical context. The major source for Tolstoy was History of the Russian State by Nikolay Karamzin. It was important for the author to reconstruct Old Russia's real life with its people's language, way of life, customs and habits. Of great use for him were The Russian Tales, Songs of the Russians and Russian Traditional Fairytales, Ivan Sakharov's works, popular at the time. He also used Kaliki Perekhozhye (in Old Russian: Blind minstrels) by Pyotr Bessonov, Spiritual Poems by Viktor Varentsov and The Everyday Life of the Russians by Aleksander Tereschenko. Aleksey Tolstoy himself was a scholar in the history of Old Russia's folklore; this enabled him, according to biographer Kuleshov, to create a totally plausible panorama of 16th-century Russian life. Critics praised Tolstoy's novel language, a complicated, composite thing built up according to archaic linguistic structures, on the one hand, but laconic and accessible on the other. The author was much worried by future editors' ways of treating his colourful stylings and implored them never to change, say, old 'bogatchestvo' into modern 'bogatstvo' (riches, in Russian) or 'petchalovatsa' into 'petchalitsa' (to mourn or be sad). Being well aware of his novel's shortcomings from a professional historian's point of view, Tolstoy subtitled it: \\"A Tale of the Terrible times\\", again much in the folklore vein. Synopsis Knyaz (Prince) Nikita Serebryanni is on his way to Moscow. In Medvedevka village his small armed unit of servants clashes with the oprichnik Khomyak‚Äôs gang. There and then the Prince learns that bloodshed and lawlessness here were inspired by Tsar Ioann's new policies, known as oprichnina. Another plotline involves Yelena Morozova, the wife of Medvedevka landlord whom the Prince helped out; she turns out to be his own loved one of the old times, who had to marry the old man in order to thwart another vile oprichnik, Vyazemsky, with his unwanted passes. Further on his way, Serebrenni helps out the outlaw named Persten (the latter would repay the Prince by leading him out of Grozny‚Äôs jail) and encounters the much feared Tsar himself. Appalled by Boris Godunov's cynicism (the latter suggests that the two should join forces in the anti-Grozny alliance) and torn apart between his righteous hatred towards the Tsar with his corrupt oprichnicks, and his own oath of allegiance, Serebrenni, all kinds of adventures behind, chooses to go to war, to fight for his country (not its amoral ruler), and die the death of a noble man.  Reception  According to the Soviet scholar V.Kuleshov, one notable quality of Aleksey Tolstoy's novel is its artful and concise construction with an elaborate plot, masterfully built and developing dramatically, a host on intrigues intertwining. Each episode reads as a rounded-up piece, fitting neatly into the general scheme. It is this all- embracing net of logic that creates the feel of inevitability of things to come and makes one ponder on the fragility and illusory nature of man's life in a troubled world, argued the critic. Aleksey Tolstoy's weaknesses show when it comes to romantic scenes and when characters begin to act in a melodramatic fashion. He excels at dialogues where, according to Kuleshov, his gift of a dramatist becomes obvious. = Ivan the Terrible character = Tolstoy is credited for being the first Russian author to try to recreate Tsar Ioann IV's character in all of its complexity. He portrays the Tsar as a man driven apart by violent extremes, highly intelligent, yet pathologically sadistic, theatrical in behavior (tinged with a morbid sense of humour) and ingenious in his intrigues, a man who one minute may seem full of remorse, yet the other is in a fit of demonic rage. Before Tolstoy, Tsar Ioann was mostly idealized as a builder of \\"the new Russia\\", both writers and historians highlighting his victories and rarely focusing on darker sides of his rule. Critics noted, though, that Tolstoy was personally too appalled by the deeds of Tsar Ioann to give him credit for any achievements, social, political or geopolitical, of which there were some. On the other hand, boyars come in the novel as too virtuous for their own good, being portrayed by the author as promoters of sublime moral values.

Reverend Dunne was consecrated by Cardinal Moran in 1901 and served until his death in 1919. Early years and background Born to Michael Dunne, a farmer, and his wife Mary, n√©e Hennessy, Dunne was educated by the Christian Brothers at Mitchelstown, and Mount Melleray College, and studied for the priesthood at All Hallows College, Drumcondra, Dublin, where he was ordained priest on 24 June 1870 and arrived in Sydney the following year, before transferring to the Bathurst diocese. Dunne served in the Fish River district, at Mudgee and at Wentworth on the Darling River, before becoming a parish priest in 1875 in Dubbo. Over a period of ten years, Dunne established a brick church and the Convent of Mercy, which had day and boarding schools, before being recalled to Bathurst to administer the cathedral parish, supervising the construction of a Patrician Brothers' monastery and enlargement of the cathedral. Dunne eventually served as vicar- general from 1900 under Bishop Joseph Byrne. Roman Catholic Bishop of Bathurst Following the death of Bishop Byrne, Dunne was elected Bishop of Bathurst on 12 January 1901, and consecrated by Cardinal Moran on 8 September 1901. Widely known as the 'Builder Bishop', Dunne is credited with ensuring that every parish had a church, school, presbytery and convent. In Bathurst he raised the money to build St Joseph's Mount and Orphanage, St Philomena's School and the stately Bishop's House. Keenly interested in St Stanislaus' College, he gave generously to finance its 1907 additions. Throughout his life Dunne promoted Catholic education. As a prudent and skilful administrator and a near-genius at raising money, he made the 'voluntary system' work in his diocese. Before he visited Europe in 1906, he was presented with a purse containing ¬£1,000, most of which he characteristically saved during his year's absence, and presented the remainder to St Stanislaus' College. Dunne died of cancer at Bishop's House on 22 August 1919 and was buried in the Catholic section of Bathurst cemetery.

The church is mentioned in the 1769 will of Samuel Butcher Sr. as already existing. However, some doubt appears to exist concerning whether the present \\"old church\\" is that mentioned in the will, as meeting minutes from 1804-1806 describe \\"finishing the meeting house.\\" Ebenezer Church was organized in 1804 by nine members of the Goose Creek Baptist Church and eight members of the Ketoctin Baptist Church. By the 1830s a schism had developed among Baptists concerning church practices, with \\"New School Baptists\\" opposing \\"Old School\\" or \\"Primitive Baptists.\\" By 1834 the congregation had split into these two camps, but both continued to use the church. A fire in 1855 may have spurred the construction of a new church for the New School congregation immediately adjacent to the old church. The Ebenezer Baptist Churches were placed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 3, 1994.

Description Lomatia myricoides grows as a woody shrub or small tree, reaching high, or rarely up to high. The leaves are lance-shaped or oblong, long and wide and have a pointed apex. They are glabrous and the leaf edges may be straight or adorned with several serrations. The flowers grow in groups in leaf axils, the groups long and usually shorter than the leaves. The flowers are white or cream in colour, though pink-tinged flowers have been recorded. Taxonomy German botanist Karl Friedrich von Gaertner first described this species as Embothrium myricoides in 1807. At the time, Embothrium was a wastebasket taxon to which many proteaceae were assigned. It was given its current binomial name by Karel Domin in 1921. The species name comes from the resemblance of the leaves to those of the genus Myrica. (The suffix -oides means \\"likeness\\" in Latin.) Common names include river lomatia, mountain beech and long-leaf lomatia. Hybrids have been recorded with tree lomatia (Lomatia fraseri) on the Southern Tablelands, with native holly (L. ilicifolia) on the New South Wales south coast, and with crinkle bush (L. silaifolia) on the New South Wales Central Coast and Central Tablelands. Analysis of chloroplast DNA showed that there is extensive hybridization between the five species (L. arborescens, L. fraseri, L. ilicifolia, L. myricoides and L. silaifolia) of mainland southeastern Australia, though each is distinct enough to warrant species status. Distribution and habitat woody base Lomatia myricoides: dehiscent fruit The range is from the New South Wales Central Coast south into eastern Victoria to the Dandenong Ranges. Lomatia myricoides is found in moist sheltered areas such as riverbank forests and montane forest, on loamy or sandy alluvial, or on basalt-derived soils. Associated species along watercourses include watergum (Tristaniopsis laurina), grey myrtle (Backhousia myrtifolia), cedar wattle (Acacia elata), coachwood (Ceratopetalum apetalum), tantoon (Leptospermum polygalifolium) and coral fern (Gleichenia dicarpa). Montane trees that L. myricoides grows as an understory with include broad- leaved manna gum (Eucalyptus mannifera), broad-leaved peppermint (E. dives), as well as the shrubs daphne heath (Brachyloma daphnoides) and prickly broom heath (Monotoca scoparia). Ecology It has a woody lignotuber, from which it regenerates after bushfire. Small ants and flies forage for nectar in the flowers. Cultivation Not commonly seen in cultivation, Lomatia myricoides grows in semi-shade in situations with some moisture. It appears to tolerate Phytophthora cinnamomi. Joseph Maiden reported that its wood was light and hard, and easily worked.

Biography =Early life= Ernest House was born in Mancos Canyon on September 27, 1945, to Thomas House Sr. and Francis Marie (n√©e Wall). A member of the Weeminuche Band of the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe, House was the grandson of the last hereditary chief of the Ute Mountain Ute, Chief Jack House. He was raised in Mancos Canyon in southwestern Colorado. House served as a veteran of the Colorado Army National Guard within the Special Forces Airborne Group. He was also employed by the National Park Service and the Bureau of Indian Affairs at various times during his career. =Ute Mountain Ute Tribal Chairman= Ernest House worked for the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe for more than fifty years, including more than thirty years in Ute tribal politics. House was elected to the Ute Mountain Ute Tribal Council in 1979. In 1982, he was elected to his first term as Chairman of the Ute Mountain Ute. He was elected to four nonconsecutive four-years terms as Chairman between 1982 and 2010. His most recent, fourth term as Chairman ended in 2010. House simultaneously served as the CEO of Ute Mountain Ute Tribal Business and Enterprise and the head of the Ute Tribal Council during his tenure as chairman. House was an advocate of Native American businesses and entrepreneurship. He championed the upgrading of Native American public safety programs and healthcare facilities in his home state of Colorado, as well as Utah and New Mexico. He also testified before the United States Congress during congressional hearings on the Animas-La Plata Water Project and the Dolores Project. House spearheaded an increasing in public security between 2005 and 2010. He increased the number of police officers in the Ute Mountain Ute tribal police force from just two officers to more than twelve during those years. He had recently reached out to freshman U.S. Rep. Scott Tipton (R-Colorado) to have a tribute to his grandfather, Chief Jack House, an advocate for tribal healthcare, read on the floor of the United States House of Representatives. Ernest House was seriously injured in a motorcycle accident near Cortez, Colorado, on the afternoon of September 17, 2011. House was returning from a motorcycle rally when he was struck by an oncoming car that was trying to pass another vehicle. House, who was riding his motorcycle, suffered a broken pelvis and leg in the accident. The driver of the car that struck House was charged with careless driver and heavy rains may have contributed to the accident. House was transported to San Juan Regional Medical Center in Farmington, New Mexico, where he lost consciousness and died of his injuries later on September 17 at the age of 65. House was survived by his three children, Michelle House, Jaque House-Lopez and Ernest House Jr.; his father, Thomas House Sr., and five grandchildren. He was a resident of McElmo Canyon in Colorado. The United States District Court for the District of Colorado Troy Eid has said, \\"Indian Country has lost a brilliant, courageous and inspired leader, as has the entire State of Colorado.\\" Eid also called House's death \\"tragic beyond words.\\" A traditional Ute wake and funeral service will be held on September 23 and 24, 2011, in Towaoc, Colorado. He will be buried in Towaoc Cemetery.

The lever just in front of the bomb aimer's fingertips sets the altitude, the wheels near his knuckles set the wind and airspeed. The Drift Sight was a bombsight developed by Harry Wimperis in 1916 for the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS). It used a simple mechanical device to measure the wind speed from the air, and used that measurement to calculate the wind's effects on the trajectory of the bombs. The Drift Sight eliminated the need for a stopwatch to perform this calculation, as on earlier devices, and greatly eased the bomb aimer's workload. The Drift Sight was quickly introduced into RNAS service and quickly thereafter by the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) as well. In British service, Wimperis' Course Setting Bomb Sight (CSBS) started replacing the Drift Sight in 1917, but it remained in widespread use in the US Army Air Service into the 1920s. In US use the Drift Sight is often referred to as the Wimperis sight, but this name is more commonly applied to the CSBS, especially in Commonwealth air forces. History =Early bombsights= Prior to the introduction of the Drift Sight, bombsights were generally very simple systems of very limited accuracy. The primary pre-World War I device in RNAS service was the \\"Lever Sight\\" which had to be held out of the cockpit in one hand by the pilot while flying the aircraft with the other. The Central Flying School bombsight (CFS) replaced this in 1915, but was difficult to install in the cockpit. The CFS was in turn replaced by the Equal Distance Sight (EDS) designed by in 1916 by Warrant Officer Scarff, better known for the Scarff ring. The EDS allowed the bomb run parameters to be entered once and then left the pilot free to fly the plane. Adjusting for the effects of wind was a difficult process. None of these sights had a way to calculate \\"drift\\", the sideways motion of the bombs due to wind. This meant the aircraft had to attack their targets along the wind line. Even in this direction, the wind would cause the bombs to fall long or short. To correct for this, on an extended run the bomb aimer would measure their speed over the ground using a stopwatch, calculate the wind speed, and then adjust their aim point based on that speed and their current altitude. This solution was difficult, time consuming, and prone to error. =Drift Sight= In 1916, Henry Wimperis started design of a new bombsight, working in collaboration with Scarff. His \\"Drift Sight\\" included a simple system for calculating the effects of wind. This measurement was taken prior to the bomb run, using a secondary sighting system are the rear of the main bombsight. The pilot would first determine the direction of the wind, and estimated its speed. The estimated speed was dialled into the sight, which moved a metal rod at the back of the sight so it laid at an angle to the fuselage. The aircraft would then fly at right angles to the bomb line, which would cause the wind to push the aircraft sideways (unless this direction the aircraft is flying while doing this just happens to be directly upwind or downwind). Comparing the angle of motion of objects on the ground to the angle of the rod, the bomb aimer would adjust the angle of the rod until the two were equal. A scale at the end of the bar directly read the wind speed. This adjustment also automatically moved sights at the front of the bombsight fore and aft, directly setting the bombsight to calculate the drift of the bombs due to the measured wind. Two sights were used, one for bombing directly upwind, and another for bombing directly downwind. The timing of the drop was set by dialling in the measured air speed, which moved the entire sighting system fore or aft, carrying the two \\"backsights\\" along with it (as well as the drift bar mechanism). Setting the altitude moved the foresight, below the backlights, setting the correct bombing angle. The original design was only suitable for low-level use and was later known as the Low Height Drift Sight Mk. I. At higher altitudes the indicated airspeed - being measured by pitot tube instruments - was affected by differences in outside air pressure that rendered it increasingly inaccurate. (A correct ground speed is required for accurate bombing.) The Mk. IA was introduced for this role, including a simple adjustment between the airspeed and altitude settings that accounted for this effect. A third version was also introduced for use by Navy airships, which worked at much lower speeds and also had the advantage of being able to directly measure the windspeed by throttling their engines until they lay still over the water. Although the Drift Sight was a significant improvement over earlier designs, it still required the aircraft to fly up or downwind on the final bomb run. For the RNAS this was a serious problem, as a submarine or ship would attempt to maneuver away if it spotted the attack, and thus upset the bomb run. Over land, as anti-aircraft guns grew more proficient, this became a serious concern as they would pre-sight for firing along the wind line, and using the bombsight under fire was difficult. There were instructions on how to use the Drift Sight for cross-wind bombing, but this was complex and apparently rarely used. =In service= The Drift Sight was introduced in 1916, and the simplicity of the device in terms of manufacture and mounting to the aircraft allowed it to quickly equip RNAS forces. By 1917 it was in widespread use in the RNAS, and was selected for the Handley Page O/400 bomber in RFC service as well. However, Wimperis was well aware of the shortcomings of the Drift Sight in terms of flying along the wind line, and was already testing his solution, the Course Setting Bomb Sight. The CSBS was only slightly more complex than the Drift Sight to build, adding a compass and another adjustment to the sights to account for cross-drift. Hundreds were in use by 1918, and had supplanted the Drift Sight by the war's end. A major difference between the Drift Sight and CSBS was that the later needed to sight below the aircraft, and was not as suitable for use on the side of the fuselage. This kept the Mk. IA in US Army Air Service use for some time, as they did not have dedicated bomber aircraft until after the war. Oddly, when development of new bombsights started in the 1920s, these were based on the Drift Sight design, not the CSBS. The US Navy, contrarily, developed their Mk. III design from the CSBS,\\"Ordnance\\", American Defense Preparedness Association, 1921, pg. 290 and it was a borrowed Mk. III sights that were used to sink the former German battleship Ostfriesland in 1921.\\"Interwar Development of Bombsights\\" , National Museum of the US Air Force, 19 June 2009 Description Labelled diagram of the various parts of the Mk. IA sight. The wires making up the sights for timing the drop are just visible, while the directional wire at the bottom is not. :Opening the adjacent diagram in a separate window will greatly ease the understanding of the following description. The Drift Sight was mounted to the side of the aircraft using two brackets at the front and back of the sights. The forward bracket had a pivot point, and the rear a screw jack that rotated the entire sighting system up or down around the front bracket's pivot. This allowed fine adjustment of the levelling of the sight during flight to account for changes in trim; after making these adjustments the system was locked in position using wingnuts. This mounting system was common among early British bombsights, notably the Equal Distance Sight that led to the Drift Sight. The main sighting system rode on two rods running fore and aft between the mounting brackets, allowing the bomb aimer to move it to a comfortable position for sighting. In the Equal Distance design, this movement was itself the main aiming mechanism, and could not be adjusted for ease of use as it was in the Drift Sight. Sighting was accomplished in the manner of iron sights on rifles, and the Drift Sight used the same terminology of \\"foresight\\" and \\"backsight\\", although \\"lower\\" and \\"upper\\" would be more accurate physically. The fore and backsights were thin metal wires stretched across the opening of a C-shaped metal plate. The bombs were dropped when the wires of the foresight, backsight and target overlapped as seen from the bomb aimer's position. A separate \\"direction wire\\" ran fore- aft on a plate below the foresight, providing left-right aiming. Altitude was set by moving a lever fore-and-aft against a scale, which rotated the foresight fore or aft, setting one half of the sight's bombing angle. Behind the altitude setting was an airspeed scale and a wheel to finely select the airspeed. This moved the backsights fore or aft to account for the other half of the sight's \\"range angle\\". In this respect the Drift Sight was similar to earlier bombsight designs. Where it differed was in the addition of the \\"drift bar\\" setting at the extreme rear of the sighting system. The drift bar was a metal rod that extended rearward from the sight and was pivoted so it could rotated outward, away from the aircraft fuselage. Prior to the bomb run, the pilot or bomb aimer would dial in an estimated wind speed, which rotated the bar outward with increasing values. They would then look past the bar to any convenient objects on the ground, comparing its direction of motion to the line of the bar. Fine adjustments to the wind speed were made until the observed drift was directly along the line of the bar. Changing the setting of the wind speed had the effect of moving the two backlights closer or further apart. This accounted for the effects of the wind on the trajectory of the bombs in addition to the airspeed setting. Two sights were used, one for bombing upwind and another for downwind. As the Drift Sight only worked correctly if flying straight and level, the bombsight also includes two spirit levels.

He is best known as the director and co-producer of Are You This Able?, nominated for best documentary at the Ophir Award. Biography Rony Gruber was born in Tel Aviv and graduated the prestigious Tichon Hadash High school, majoring in arts. He made his first steps in the film industry as a lighting technician. As a freshman in Tel Aviv University's Film & TV department, he joined up forces with a group of young and promising filmmakers, later to be credited for Israeli cinema renaissance. His work as a gaffer in the student films of Arik Kaplon, Yair Lev, Shemi Zarhin and Gur Heller and his work with acclaimed directors Amos Guttman on \\"Himmo, King of Jerusalem\\" by Yoram Kaniuk and Ze'ev Revach on Bouba, sharpened his aesthetic perception and enriched his cinematic language. Advertising Following his studies, Gruber established a directorial career in the advertising business, soon to become an award winning commercials director, with Israeli and international credits. His clients included Volvo, Ocean Spray, P&G;, Mazda, Ikea, Pizza Hut, Chevrolet, Whirlpool, Holiday Inn, Mitsubishi and more. In his 20-year career he received a Golden Drum Award, and several Golden Cactus Awards. Film career His first film was The Room (1987), a one-act drama by Harold Pinter. His second film Are You This Able? (2001) premiered in the Haifa International Film Festival and participated in film festivals around the world. Israeli critic Amir Kaminer wrote about the film: \\"Rony Gruber's sensitive and human documentary is sheer exhilaration. A sweet moment of victory....\\" Critic Nir Kipnis wrote in Globes, \\"The biggest achievement of the film in offering us a fresh point of view of the emotional world of the mentally disabled. The world portrayed in Are You This Able? seems so similar to our own and yet it differs elusively in the way it is manifested....\\" In 2002 he collaborated with praised writer Yitzhak Ben Ner in the writing of the script for the fictional feature film Nicole's Stations, commemorating 30 years to the Yom Kippur War and based on Ben Ner's novel Rustic Sunset. The script was commissioned by the Makor Film Fund. In 2003 Gruber directed a five-episode reality television series commissioned by Israel Broadcasting Authority. The series portrays day-to-day life at the Herods Theme Hotel in Eilat using it as an allegory of Israeli society's hedonistic and extroverted existence. The music was written by composer Avi Benjamin. In 2007 he directed episodes in the critically acclaimed TV drama Room Service featuring Asi Levi, Sasha Damidov, Danny Steg, Yehezkel Lazarov and others. Gruber is currently developing two documentaries: In Golda's Shoes, a portrait of Golda Meir, and There We Sat and Wept ... in collaboration with Prof. Yossi Yona, telling the story for Iraqi Diaspora longing to Iraqi Jews driven out of Baghdad in the 1940. Other Rony Gruber served three terms (2007‚Äì2010) as a board member at AIDF (Association of Israeli Documentary Filmmakers) and wrote its articles of association. He has been invited to be a member of the Readers Committee at The Israel Film Fund and the Makor Film Fund.

Hambye in Pune (c1973) √âdouard Ren√© Hambye (3 July 1916 ‚Äì 7 September 1990), was a Belgian Jesuit missionary priest in the Indian subcontinent, and a leading scholar on the history of Indian churches. Hambye is the author of Christianity in India, and a contributor to The St. Thomas Christian Encyclopaedia of India. He was often published under the name E. R. Hambye, and in India was anglicized as \\"Edward\\".  Biography Hambye was born in Mons and attended that city's Jesuit high school. He entered the novitiate of the Society of Jesus on 23 September 1934. The usual spiritual and academic Jesuit training led him to receive sacerdotal ordination on 24 August 1946. After further studies involving Syriac he was appointed Professor of Church History and of Patristics at the Kurseong Saint-Mary's Jesuit Theologate in West Bengal where he undertook research into the history of eastern church rites (notably in the Syrian Catholic tradition). His primary field of writing was the Syrian Malabar church. Hambye's History of Christianity in India was well received in the 1970s, but some of his contemporary scholars, such as Stephen Neill, were less impressed. When work on the St. Thomas Christian Encyclopaedia of India commenced in 1970 by George Menachery he was along with Paul Verghese, later Paulos Mar Gregorios, one of the prominent consultants.The St. Thomas Christian Encyclopaedia of India title pages He also researched the history of the 'Bengal Jesuit mission' of the Belgian Jesuits and the role of chaplains in the fleet of 17th Century Flanders. In Kerala Hambye was actively involved in ecumenism between Saint Thomas Christians, Syrian Orthodox and Roman Catholics in India. An active member of the Indian Church Historical Association, Hambye was appointed a member of the commission for dialogue with the Malankara Orthodox Church, Kottayam, 1989. In 1977 he had already been working in Kurseong, Delhi, Poona, Vadavathoor-Kottayam for 26 years. In later years he was a professor at the Pontifical Oriental Institute in Rome.

The term Neeliyar Bhagavathi refers to the goddess of the Mangattuparamba Neeliyar temple; the ritual is mainly performed in this temple. This Theyyam is usually performed in the evening, during sunset. The goddess Neeliyar Bhagavathi has temples dedicated to her in different parts of Kannur including Cherukunnu, Eranjikkal, Mathamangala, etc. This particular Theyyam is performed by the Vannan caste. A few musical instruments, like Chenda are used during the performance.  About  Theyyam rituals in northern Kerala usually begin in the month Thulam of the Malayalam calendar and end by Edavapathy month, after the Theyyam performance of Kalarivatukkal Bhagavathi at Valapattanam Kalarivathukkal temple. However, Neeliyar Bhagavathi Theyyam is conducted throughout the year. During Karkidaka month - from the 2nd day to the 16th day - this Theyyam is not performed, as it is believed that during this time the goddess is away in Kottiyoor. Families who do not have children, as well as those awaiting marriage, pray at this temple. Once their wishes are fulfilled, or in order for their wishes to be fulfilled, they conduct a Theyyam at the temple.  Legend  The legend behind Neeliyar Bhagavathi is intricate and ancient. According to legend, in Kottiyoor, Kannur, there was once a lower-caste woman called Neeli who was extremely beautiful and intelligent. She was killed by the local ruler. Upon her death, Neeli became the Goddess Neeliyar Bhagavathi. When she was alive, Neeli lived near a sandbank. After her death, whenever travellers came near the river next to this place, Neeliyar Bhagavathi would ask them whether they needed oil and a thaali leaf (used in the place of soap in ancient time) before their bath. Whoever said yes and went near her was captured, whereupon the Goddess Neeliyar Bhagavathi would suck their blood. No one who went near the river ever returned home. Once, a personal called Kalakkad Namboothiri went there for a bath, and saw Neeliyar Bhagavathi. The Goddess asked him his name; he replied saying he was Kalakkad; and the Goddess told him that she was Kali. She then gave him oil and a thaali leaf. Kalakkad drank the oil and thaali juice saying that it was Amruthu (nectar) given to him by his mother. On seeing this, the Goddess was very happy that he called him mother, and so she spared his life, and furthermore accompanied him on his way to the west. Neeliyar Bhagavathi then revealed that she was a Goddess, and said she would like to reside in a temple where the tiger and cow live together peacefully. On their journey, Kalakkad Nambhoothiri saw a cow and tiger co-existing in Mangattuparambu, and so he put down his umbrella (made from the leaves of a palm tree) and rested there. The Goddess was accompanying him by riding atop the umbrella, and decided to stay at the place. Kalakkad Nambhoothiri subsequently set up a temple for the Goddess at the spot.Interview with Kalyani of Ozhakrom (2011) Interview with PV Knjiraman of Amsham Tthrachambaram in Thaliparambu (2011) However, M. V. Vishnu Nambuthiri, who is a scholar of Kerala folklore in general and the Theyyam ritual in particular, suggests that this story is not an official part of any of the folk songs about Neeliyar Bhagavathi herself.Interview with Vishnu Nambuthiri (2011)  Costume  right The Neeliyar Bhagavathi Theyyam is very similar to the Valiya Thampuratty Theyyam, a ritual form that is quite famous in other parts of Kannur. The face-painting and long crown is almost identical in both the Theyyams. People from Vannan caste typically have the privilege of performing this Theyyam. Further, only Vannan people who have the honour of Karakkaattidam Nayanar perform this ritual. In the present time, among the main performers of this Theyyam are the Mangattuparambu Neeliyar Kaavil Daasan and Ravi.

Description A very small scops owl which is heavily streaked and barred on its pale sandy-grey upperparts, paler underparts with darker shaft streaks and fine, dark barring. The plain facial disc has vague margins and the shoulder stripe is not as conspicuous as in other scops owls and are sandy coloured. The ear tufts are very small and the eyes are yellow. Length is . =Voice= The song of the Socotra scops owl is a repeated, low pitched series of notes which is similar to that described for the oriental scops owl Otus sunia. Distribution and habitat The Socotra scops owl is endemic to the Indian Ocean island of Socotra off the Horn of Africa, which is within the territory of Yemen. On Socotra it is found on over 45% of the island, most numerous in areas where there are mature palms. Its preferred habitat is rocky semi-desert with scattered trees and bushes. Habits Very little is known about the behaviour of the Socotra scops owl, it probably mainly feeds on insects and small vertebrates; the stomach contents of a single specimen contained a grasshoppers, a centipede and two lizards. It has also been observed hawking for moths at dusk, in a similar fashion to a nightjar. Very little is known about its breeding behaviour but a female with enlarged ovaries was caught in April. It probably uses natural cavities for nesting. Two 20-day-old young have been recorded on the nest in February, their age suggesting that the eggs were laid in early January. Taxonomy The Socotra scops owl was previously lumped with the African scops owl Otus senegalensis but differences in plumage and vocalisations have led to it being split to a separate species. Recent genetic research suggests that its closest relatives are the Oriental scops owl and the Seychelles scops owl Otus insularis. An interesting theory this research has led to is that the oriental scops owl is a taxon that evolved from a colonisation of the continent from island ancestors, an event which had previously been thought unlikely because island taxa were thought to be less competitive than related continental taxa.

Formerly it was listed as a Greek manuscript of the New Testament, but it was removed from the list in 1908. The manuscript is a famous instance of the Comma Johanneum.  Description  The codex contains a complete text of the New Testament, in two volumes, on 292 + 205 parchment leaves (size ). The leaves are arranged in quarto. It contains a spurious biblical passage, the Comma Johanneum in 1 John 5:7. Although it was rewritten from the Complutensian text, there are some textual divergences between them: Matthew 2:13; 15:22; 17:2; 23:8; 1 John 5:10; Jude 22,George Travis, Letters to Edward Gibbon, esq: author of the History of the decline, and fall, of the Roman Empire, C.

Rivington, 1802, vol. 2, p. 771. The codex was used as an argument in the 18th century that Complutensian was rewritten from the Codex Ravianus, even with imitation of its letters, but scholars like La Croze, Griesbach, and Michaelis proved that errors of Ravianus are nothing more than errors of the pen. It lost its weight as an independent authority.  History  The manuscript is a transcript from the Complutensian Polyglot, printed in 1514. It copies even typographical errors of it, and the letters are similar. Some variant readings were inserted from the margin of Stephanus's edition.Adam Clarke, The Holy Bible containing the Old and New Testaments, N. Bangs and J. Emory, 1823, p. 851.Bruce M.

It is a tragedy following events in the life of a gunsmith who sells his services to assassins. The style is also partly in the form of classic confessional writing, as the protagonist seeks to explain the relevance of his choice of vocation. It was reissued by Bantam Books in 2010 under the title The American (), after a film of that title had been made based on it.  Setting  The time of the story seems to be late 20th century, more or less similar to the year of publication. The story is written in the first-person narrative from the point of view of the main character, who is known as Edmund or Signor Farfalla. He lives in a small hill town in the north of Italy.  Plot  The protagonist makes his living custom-making firearms specified for individual assassins' needs. To the townsfolk he puts on the role of a painter of butterflies, which can be found in diverse and rich measures in the hilly and forested areas around the village. The protagonist is reserved and very skilled at keeping his real job a secret. Edmund is a foreigner, and although he does not reveal his origin to anybody (not even the reader), he pretends to be an Englishman. This is not far from the truth, since he admits to having stayed in the English countryside for a very long time at an earlier stage in his career. Although his profession has demanded that he move location from time to time, he has developed a fondness for the Italian village, in particular a young woman, and has decided that he wants to stay. However, a person described as a \\"shadow-dweller\\" starts showing up in the mountains spying ‚Äì or threatening ‚Äì Signor Farfalla. While finding out who he is, Signor Farfalla must decide whether to face his opponent or escape and leave his home once more.  Characters  *Signor Farfalla is a middle-aged man who is possibly from a country where English is spoken as a first language. He is a skilled craftsman, first and foremost with metal; but he is also a painter. He is well-read and spends much of his time lecturing to the reader about history, culture, politics, religion and literature. The time of writing of the story has Signor Farfalle sitting at an unknown place shortly after the events of his story. He is a thorough storyteller, who is very focused on describing the landscape and geography in which his story unfolds. However, he is also a lecturer of sorts, who takes great care to digress from the action of the story, to inform the reader on various subjects as they arise. He includes small essays about politics, religion, history, culture, as well as expositions about his own secret profession and the machinations of his own small and sinister \\"world\\". Unlike what one might expect, Edmund is not apologetic about his profession. On the contrary, he sees the need for people who kill to change the world for the better. *Father Benedetto is the local Catholic priest in the Italian village. He befriends Signor Farfalla; and they discover a shared interest in wine, food, and the joy of debate and discussion. *Clara is a young Italian student. She meets Signor Farfalla when he becomes her regular client in the local bordello. After a while, the two begin an actual relationship.Review of A Very Private Gentleman by Martin Booth ‚Äì Publishers Weekly  Adaptation  The novel was adapted by Rowan Joffe into a screenplay for the film The American (2010), which was directed by Anton Corbijn and stars George Clooney, Thekla Reuten, Violante Placido, Irina Bj√∂rklund, and Paolo Bonacelli. Concurrent with the film's release, the novel was republished under the same name by Bantam Books, with a cover design promoting the movie. The film makes several small departures from the book's plot. For instance, the gunsmith has an agent in the film, whereas he finds work on his own (or it finds him) in the book. The main differences between the novel and film are the aesthetic tones and the ending. In the book, Edmund is an intelligent and persuasive defender of his work, while the film portrays a feeling of doom. While the book concludes with Edmund's leaving the village and Clara, the film adaptation fades to black only after Edmund has collapsed after being shot (whether he survives or dies is left unexplained).

He is most notable for attempting to contest various elections, general and presidential, without a record of success. He went to compete for 1999 Singaporean presidential election, 2005 Singaporean presidential election, 2011 Singaporean presidential election & 2017 Singaporean presidential election but his applications for the Certificate of Eligibility was rejected due to various reasons, such as not finding assentors to sponsor him, and incomplete nomination forms. Life Ooi was reportedly a former private tutor and property executive. Politics Ooi entered the political arena in the presidential elections in 1999. He submitted eligibility forms to the Elections Department who later declined to issue a certificate of eligibility. Ooi contested Joo Chiat SMC in the 2001 General Elections as an independent candidate, against People's Action Party incumbent Chan Soo Sen. He garnered 3,038 votes (16.45%). Ooi attempted to seek presidential candidacy for the second time in the presidential elections in 2005. His application for the Certificate of Eligibility was rejected by the Presidential Elections Committee due to his lack of experience and ability required by the Constitution. In 2006, he formed the People's Liberal Democratic Party, four days after Nomination Day of the 2006 general election. He was thus unable to contest the election. In 2011, Ooi sought to contest Sengkang West SMC in the 2011 General Elections, and attempted to promote himself by singing an impromptu election jingle on television. One of his assentors did not turn up on Nomination Day and was unsuccessful in attempting to seek a replacement from the crowd. He then left the nomination centre without submitting his nomination papers. Ooi decided on a third run for the presidential election in 2011. As the constitution requires presidential candidates to be nonpartisan, Ooi had to resign from the PLDP. He submitted his forms on 11 July, and was found to be ineligible because his application was incomplete and he had asked for a waiver from certain requirements set forth by the constitution, which the Elections Department claims it has no power to do. Ooi was the first to collect nomination paperwork for the 2013 Singaporean by-election in Punggol East. Ooi dropped out of the hustings when he failed to file nomination papers on Nomination Day. He claimed that he had lost his political donation certificate, in addition to failing to find assentors, and having his driver abscond with the deposit. He launched into a profanity-laden rant when interviewed after the defeat, accusing the mainstream media of discriminating against independent candidates. Ooi applied to contest in the presidential election of 2017. However, his application was rejected due to the election being reserved for candidates from the Malay community. Ooi again tried for his application in the 2020 General Elections under the Bukit Panjang SMC, but did not qualify. Ooi was the first among the four known independent candidates to have announced their candidacy for the election, but only one candidate, Cheang Peng Wah (in Pioneer SMC) has been successfully nominated.

About the report As metal use has increased during the 20th and 21st centuries, there has been a substantial shift from metal resources being subterranean geological stores to becoming ‚Äòabove-ground‚Äô stocks in use in society.Metal Stocks in Society: Scientific synthesis, 2010, International Resource Panel, UNEP Metals can be used over and over again, saving energy and minimising the negative environmental impacts associated with mining virgin material, so it makes sense to recycle these above-ground stocks. However, the report found that less than a third of the crucial 60 metals studied in the report have an end- of-life recycling rate above 50 per cent, and 34 of them have a recycling rate of below 1 per cent.Clean technologies under threat from low metals reuse Environmental Data Interactive Exchange downloaded 22 September 2011 Green technologies would certainly benefit from greater metals recycling. Among the least-recycled metals are tellurium and gallium, which are used in solar cells, and lithium, which is a key component of the batteries in electric cars.

Published in 1936 or 1937 by Balai Pustaka, it tells the story of two sisters and their relationship with a medical student. It has been noted as emphasizing the need for Indonesians to adopt Western values in order to modernize the country. Plot Tuti and Maria, daughters of Raden Wiriatmadja, go to the fish market where they meet Yusuf, a medical student from Martapura, South Sumatra. After he escorts them home, he realizes that he has fallen for Maria. The following day, he meets the sisters while on his way to school and goes out on the town with them. He and Maria become closer and closer, while Tuti busies herself with reading and attending congresses on women's rights. A few months later, Yusuf returns early from his holidays to be with Maria; however, not long afterwards she falls ill and is diagnosed with malaria. Tuti begins feeling the need to be loved, remembering Supomo who had once proposed to her; after Supomo's younger brother comes to demand an answer, she says no. Maria's condition grows steadily worse and the doctors change their diagnosis to tuberculosis. As she lies dying in hospital, Tuti and Yusuf go to visit her cousins in Sindanglaya, where Tuti notes that one need not live in the city in order to be useful to one's country. Upon their return to Maria's bedside, Maria requests that they marry each other. After Tuti and Yusuf, who have been growing closer, agree, Maria dies. Themes Tham Seong Chee notes that the characters and plot of Layar Terkembang are symbolic, with each character representing a certain worldview or culture. When two characters are incompatible, it is in fact an incompatibility of the two worldviews or cultures. He gives the example of Tuti, whom he describes as being \\"independent, socially confident, articulate, egoistic, and emancipated\\", and her sister Maria, who is described as \\"symbolic of the traditional ideal Indonesian woman\\"; Yusuf's marriage to Tuti after the death of Maria is seen as being symbolic of the \\"demise of the old and inevitable take over of the new\\". He also notes a contrast between the \\"Western\\" worldview of changing ones surroundings and the traditional view of surrendering oneself to fate, as well as the new and old generations. Maman S. Mahayana, Oyon Sofyan, and Achmad Dian also note the progressiveness of Tuti, writing that she is active in numerous organizations and is always working to further the needs of the Indonesian people, especially its women. Diction Bakri Siregar notes that, although Alisjahbana attempts to use new constructions, the Malay influence comes across clearly. He writes that the romance between Yusuf and Maria comes across clearly, even when there is no dialogue; some chapters are entirely without dialogue. Publication and reception Several writers (including Ajip Rosidi and HB Jassin) have written that Layar Terkembang was published in 1936; however, the seventh and eighteenth reprints of the book note it as 1937. By 1963 it had been translated into Malaysian; the Malaysian translation has also been reprinted several times. Contemporary poet Sanusi Pane contested Alisjahbana's pro- Western stance in the novel, noting that it was dangerous to unthinkingly adopt Western values; he argued that the best way to enter modernity would be to combine Western materialism with Eastern spiritualism. In response, Alisjahbana noted that the West had spiritualism and stated that insisting on using Eastern spiritualism was uninformed self-deception. He pressed that a proper education was the foremost way for Indonesians to prepare for the \\"international culture\\" based on individualism and positivism. Siregar notes that certain characters seem to be direct challenges to the concepts of feudalism of Mangkunegara IV and the Indian mysticism of Pane. Chee notes that the central purpose of Layar Terkembang is clear, that Indonesia could only be a modern country if both men and women adopted the Western characteristics of \\"individualism, egoism, materialism, and intellectualism\\". However, he notes that Alisjahbana's ideology \\"dominate[d]\\" Tuti to the point that the solution to the conflict is \\"unconvincing\\". Siregar writes that Layar Terkembang is more complex than Alisjahbana's earlier work Dian yang Tak Kunjung Padam, with better developed characters. He also notes that the shift of focus from Maria to Tuti is done well, to the point that the tragedy does not detract from the message at hand. Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw notes that Layar Terkembang is one of the three most important Indonesian works written before World War II, together with Sitti Nurbaya and Salah Asuhan. He writes that the novel shows the shift in focus from the conflict between individuals and traditional culture to a nationalist awakening in the youth as well as a budding feminist movement.

Water crisis problem There is a prevalent water crisis in many developing nations. As cities and slums grow at an alarming rate, the lack of access to clean water and sanitation kills thousands, as well as reducing the quality of life of many Hondurans. Demographics As of 2010, Honduras is a country that has a population of around 7.6 million people, of which about more than 50% live in the rural areas. Description The Guacirope River Basin is in the South of Honduras. It is an area that faces extreme drought due to high temperatures and low annual rainfall. This is a deviation from coastal regions of Honduras that enjoys high annual rainfall and relatively cool temperatures. Problem Water coverage in Honduras has is about 80% of its total population and about 70% in rural areas. The current level of water sanitation and its quantity is insufficient where close to 90% of the water supply is intermittent and unreliable. In the rural areas, 44% of the water is up to health standards due to absence of water quality control and monitoring. Sanitation coverage in Honduras is improving, reaching 68% of the total population but only 50% of the rural populace In addition, this area suffers from extensive deforestation, which reduces the soil‚Äôs water retention rate which in turn leads to poor returns on crop cultivation, health issues and poverty. The lack of infrastructure and resources to collect rainwater in the Guacirope River basin exacerbates this problem. Current situation In 1998, Honduras was hit by Hurricane Mitch which left 75% of the country without safe drinking water, and the country has not yet recovered from the damage to the infrastructure it has caused. Currently, infrastructure and basic healthcare is lacking and repair works are still ongoing. Today, 1.2 million people in Honduras have no access to improved water sources. A military coup in 2009 has led to political and economical turmoil, further worsening the water situation in the country. Coupled with the lack of infrastructure, the health standards in Honduras are dire. A severe lack of water has led to much hardship amongst the locals, especially in the rural areas. Diarrhea and hepatitis are some of the illnesses which are rampant, especially among the young which can be fatal in some cases. In the rural villages, women spend up to 6 man-hours to fetch clean water which could otherwise be used for educational and developmental purposes. Lack of access to clean water contributes largely to the poverty and poor health of the Hondurans. Despite the graveness of the crisis, the government is unable to implement useful programs to ease the destitution in the country, especially those living in the rural areas. One Drop NGO =Introduction= One Drop Foundation is a non-governmental organisation (NGO) that aim to fight poverty by providing access to water to those in need. Another goal of said NGO is to raise awareness about the water crisis to communicate the need for mobilization in order to ensure that all individuals have access to sufficient amount of safe water in both the present and future. To achieve these, One Drop is actively involved in fundraising through events such as LA SOIR√âE ONE DROP and making use of popular media platform like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Flickr. One Drop is currently undertaking nine projects in both developed and developing countries. =History= One Drop Foundation was founded by Guy Lalibert√© on October 29, 2007, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. One Drop has projects in Nicaragua and Honduras. Currently, One Drop is assessing the situation in India, Haiti and El Salvador. =Approach= One Drop utilises a trident approach ‚Äì Technical, Microfinance, Social Arts and Popular Education. The Technical approach targets to improve access to water and promote responsible use of this resource. The Microfinancial approach entails granting loans to communities in order to launch income-generating initiatives and ensure the longevity of projects. The Social Arts and Population Approach aims to raise awareness, educate and mobilize communities on water-related issues so as to promote the sound management of water, One Drop makes use of social arts and popular education. =Mission and values= One Drop is guided by its objectives to improve access to safe water in order to increase the level of health and agricultural output, establishing a high standard of food security, improving household incomes, increasing awareness with regards to water-related issues through educational shows and workshops, promoting gender equality and to embody leadership skills in youth so that they can lead the change. A comprehensive and transparent website listing out its activities makes it a reliable platform for future partners and donations from people traversing the globe. The website also has a news section that features activities and functions they engage in. It features live photos, lists out the duration of the project, tasks of representatives and how it has helped benefit the lives of the people. This gives partners and donors an intuitive feel and further enhances its credibility. =One Drop in developing countries= Honduras Guacirope River Basin is an area stretched by extreme drought due to high temperatures and low annual precipitation. The mountain areas of Guacirope River Basin, faces extensive deforestation diminishing the soil‚Äôs capacity to retain water. This results in low agricultural yields, poor health, poverty and susceptible to the immense weather. The venue is also undernourished in resources, materials and infrastructures needed to collect rainwater. The Honduras project which is currently ongoing, will directly impacts 1,000 families and will ultimately benefit over 15,000 men, women and children. =Progress report= Technical and Material Contributions Energy-efficient stoves: 1,082/1,350 Family gardens: 1,350/1,350 Potable water filters: 1,350/1,350 School gardens: 19/19 Refurbished latrines: 314/400 Water cisterns: 1,350/1,350 Fruit and forest trees : 16,023/13,000 Social Arts and Popular Education Educational and artistic workshops: 80/80 Multidisciplinary touring shows: 85/85 Microfinance Following the military coup that took place on June 2009, ONE DROP has decided to reallocate its microfinance fund to activities that will help even more families obtain access to water.

In the 1990s Callahan was lead vocalist, guitarist and co-songwriter for the critically acclaimed power pop Portland, Oregon band, Doris Daze. Doris Daze released two albums, Uncle (1994) and Perpetual Happiness Machine (1997) before disbanding in 1999. A multi-instrmentalist who is admittedly \\"A little too fond of the recording process\\", Callahan has had several cameo appearances on local musicians' albums throughout the years. Callahan released her country album, Dry (2011) following a ten-year hiatus from music. Her most recent single, \\"Break My Heart Again\\" was released in 2013. In 2012, Maria co-founded Molly Miller Band with drummer Charles Nelson, but disbanded it in 2013. Maria also performs with the all-female Merle Haggard Tribute Band, Gerle Haggard Band that she founded in April 2013. Doris Daze (1994‚Äì1999) In 1993, Callahan joined with musicians Erin Moreland, Scott Crabtree and Eric Merrill to create Doris Daze, a Portland- based band that garnered much critical success and a devoted fan base. The band's not-to-be-pigeonholed sound was referred by critics to everything from \\"poppy folk-rock\\" to \\"eclectic beyond belief,\\" for their wide range of instrumentation and disregard for genre. Critic Scott D. Lewis commented that \\"the congenial quartet combines influences ranging from classic rock, upbeat country, progressive folk, hallucinatory psychedelia and standard pop to form music that, through proficient and consistently compelling, resists easy branding.\\"*Lewis, Scott D. (1995). \\"The Rocket\\" Callahan is frequently cited as one of the group's strength's for both her voice and songwriting ability. Lewis further noted in his review for Perpetual Happiness Machine that \\"Doris Daze singer/guitarist Maria Callahan, who is also the band's chief songwriter, displays a durable aptitude for creating memorable, if quirky songs and the ability to color them with unusual guitar formations; singing them with a rich, evocative voice.\\"Lewis The Oregonian stated that \\"Singer/songwriter Maria Callahan's strong voice makes Doris Daze one of Portland's best modern folk-rock bands.\\"*The Oregonian (August 1996)\\"Arts & Entertainment Guide\\" Doris Daze played to increasingly packed houses as well as doing tour stints in Oregon penitentiaries and appeared more than once on the stages of NXNW music festival. Though the band continued to get regular play on both FM and college radio and had begun receiving interest by the record industry, the group decided to call it quits in 1999 following the release of \\"Perpetual Happiness Machine.\\" Dry (2011) After 10 years away from the studio, Callahan began working on a series of country songs in the winter of 2009. Teaming up once again with producer Danny O'Hanlon (Perpetual Happiness Machine) Dry is the first solo effort by Callahan. In addition to writing ten of the record's eleven songs, she provided the majority of the instrumentation and all of the vocals. The song Don't You Let Me Down was collaboratively written with Portland-area songwriters Rob Barteletti and Nick Peets. Dry was released in September 2011. In an October 2011 review, music critic S.P. Clarke commented that, \\"Maria is a skilled musician...with Dry she stakes her claim on a barren stylistic landscape earning a hard-carved harvest.\\" A music video for the album's closing song, He's Your Problem Now, directed by Mette Bach of Vancouver, BC, can be found on YouTube.

May was born in Chicago in 1915 and raised in the suburb of Oak Park. He graduated from Oak Park High School and earned a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from the University of Rochester in 1937. He pursued graduate studies at both the University of Chicago and the Illinois Institute of Technology. In the 1930s, May joined DuPont as part of a research team which developed the first rust-proof paint. He was hired by the American Can Company in 1940, based in a laboratory in Maywood, Illinois. May became head of the American Can Company and shepherded the company through fifteen years of expansion and growth from 1965. He spearheaded American Can Company's relocation of its corporate headquarters to Greenwich, Connecticut, in 1972. May was elected to the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts' board of directors in 1967. He was tasked with establishing a new film department for Lincoln Center. He worked as the program's chief fundraiser, while two other members of the committee handled artistic contributions, Richard Roud and Amos Vogel, both of whom founded the New York Film Festival. However, Lincoln Center withdrew financial support from the committee in 1968 due to financial woes. May searched for new financial donors. In 1969, May and two Lincoln Center executives, Schuyler G. Chapin and Martin E. Segal, co-founded the Film Society of Lincoln Center. May retired from the American Can Company in 1980. He served as the dean of what is now called the New York University Stern School of Business for four years. He later became the chief executive of the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation, eventually becoming chairman emeritus in 2006. William May died on September 18, 2011, in Greenwich, Connecticut, where he resided since 1970, at the age of 95. Before moving to Greenwich, he and his family had lived in nearby Chappaqua, New York. He was survived by his wife, Kathleen; two daughters; four grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

Howard's sword and sorcery hero Conan the Barbarian. It was first published in trade paperback by Tor Books in October 1989; a regular paperback edition followed from the same publisher in September 1990. Plot Conan and his companion, Elashi, find themselves pursued by pirates under the leadership of a hermaphroditic amalgamation of two lovers, who believe Conan's sword can separate the couple back into their original state. The two men soon discover a subterranean world, where a beautiful sorceress named Chuntha and Katamay Rey, an evil necromancer, struggle for control over various intelligent creatures. The bizarre cave-dwellers include blind white apes, vampire bats, web-spinning plants, one-eyed monsters, burrowing lizards, mole- like beasts, and giant earthworms. The local balance of power is threatened by Conan's arrival and various complications ensue, including a revolt by the enslaved creatures, before Conan can win his way back to the surface. One of the worms and a cyclops are featured sympathetically in a subplot. Chronology Internal evidence indicates that Perry's earlier Conan work Conan the Defiant directly precedes this novel, though in the comprehensive Conan chronology of William Galen Gray, Sean A. Moore's Conan the Hunter is placed between the two books. Reception Writing on one of Perry's other novels, reviewer Ryan Harvey assessed the author's Conan corpus as \\"goofy\\", noting that he \\"has a reputation among Conan fandom for overkill and general silliness.\\"Harvey, Ryan. \\"Pastiches 'R' Us: Conan the Free Lance\\" (Review), Jul. 28, 2009. Don D'Ammassa calls \\"Perry's third Conan pastiche ... rather out of the ordinary [with] [l]ots of chase scenes and more humor than is usual in sword and sorcery.\\"D'Ammassa, Don. \\"Conan the Indomitable\\" (review on Critical Mass).

The manuscript is famous for the Comma Johanneum.  Description  The codex contains the text of the Catholic and Pauline epistles on 397 paper leaves (size ). The text is written in one column per page, 28 lines per page. The Catholic epistles contain a commentary.  Text  The Greek text of the codex is a representative of the Byzantine text-type in the Pauline epistles. In the Catholic epistles it has mixed text with some old and valuable readings. Kurt and Barbara Aland gave it the following textual profile in the Catholic epistles: 631, 71/2, 152, 15s. This means the text of the manuscript agrees with the Byzantine standard text 63 times, and 7 times with the Byzantine when it has the same reading as the original text, it agrees 15 times with the original text against the Byzantine, it has 15 independent or distinctive readings (Sonderlesarten). In the Pauline epistles Alands gave the profile ‚Äì 1651, 441/2, 12, 6s. Alands placed the Greek text of the Pauline epistles in Category V and the text of the Catholic epistles in the Category III. It contains a spurious biblical passage the Comma Johanneum (from the original scribe).  History  F. H. A. Scrivener dated it to the fourteenth century. C. R. Gregory dated the manuscript to the sixteenth century, which is in conformation with the current dating by the INTF. The manuscript was added to the list of New Testament manuscripts by Scrivener (206a) Gregory (234a). Gregory saw it in 1886. It was briefly described by Emmanuel Miller (Miller 8). In 1908 Gregory gave it the number 918. Currently the manuscript is housed at the library of Escorial (Cod. Escurialensis, Œ£. I. 5), in Escurial.
