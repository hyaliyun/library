Also, axons of alpha, beta, and gamma motor neurons become myelinated. Moreover, these efferent neurons originate from the anterior grey column of the spinal cord and travel to skeletal muscles. However, the larger diameter alpha motor fibers require higher conduction velocity than beta and gamma. Types There are two kinds of beta motor neuron (as gamma motor neuron) that include: *Static beta motor neurons. These motor neurons innervate nuclear chain fibers of muscle spindles, with collaterals to extrafusal muscle fibers. *Dynamic beta motor neurons.

The School includes the highly acclaimed High/Scope approach in Preschool. In this approach, the teacher tends to not teach the ideas, but rather \\"provide experiences and materials that help children develop the broad language and logical abilities that are the foundation for later academic learning. For example, to encourage children's beginning reading and writing skills, teachers create a print-rich environment and provide opportunities throughout the day for children to listen to stories, explore books and other print materials, and work with writing tools and materials The program of marine education for children M.A.R.E from the Lawrence Hall of Science from the University of Berkeley, California, USA and the first in offering digital media training courses from Apple Inc to children and starting the 21st century learning initiative by providing an iPad to each of its students. History Before the development of tourism in Acapulco in the 1980s, there was a mismatch between academic endeavour and attainment. With the development of new infrastructure such as the \\"Del Sol\\" Highway (Mexican Federal Highway 95), Acapulco required a new educational model. The ambitions of the tourism industry, the modernising local community and incomers called for better and trilingual education. By September 1987 the Nautilus School was inaugurated thanks to the great support of distinguished local industrialists summoned by the patronage of the school. By beginning of the 1990s the school had managed to certify their students with English as a second language providing Cambridge certification, provide an ubiquitously environmental education and to be the first school in Acapulco with a computerized multimedia hall. In the year of 1995 the school made an agreement with Lions Clubs International to buy their facilities and transform it from a social club into a school campus. The school has maintained the leadership in each of this matters, specially that of technological culture, being the first school in Acapulco in obtaining the service that allows the parents of our lower school students to see their children work in the classroom via Internet and being again the first school in Acapulco to have a technological partnership with Apple Inc. In 2008 the school designed new architectonic facilities to provide the students with the latest technological advances that go from interactive blackboards to promoting the use of laptops or iPad amongst the students instead of the traditional books and notebooks. At 22 years since its foundation, the school has developed architectonic spaces that teachers aptitudes of and student allow to the optimization of the creative generating suitable processes of learning to obtain the excellence. Institutional Programs # Educational Technology # The use of technology has always played a mayor role in the school‚Äôs community. This is why one or its most important institutional programs in The Nautilus School is Computer studies. They have the honor of being members of the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE), which provides service to improve teaching, learning and school leadership, through the effective use of technology from Preschool though Secondary, and gives them ongoing teacher training in the area of technology. Through the partnership with Apple, Microsoft, the school was able to develop technological abilities in their students, using the most advanced tools and methodologies. The classrooms are equipped with different technological equipments, like Apple's iPad Mobile Labs in each classroom, helping teachers give a more dynamic class having a mayor impact on the students. With the extensive variety of subscriptions to different educational sites on the web and a wide variety of software, they enrich the methodology and the subjects that are given in class by using technology as a tool and support. Teachers and students have access to a video distribution system on demand called Digital Cinema, which can be accessed in real time from any place and platform inside the school through the local network, and which gives them access to a large library of movies and documentaries. Middle School students are being prepared to achieve the Certificate in Microsoft Office Specialist and the Apple Certificate in Training Series in the multimedia iLife and iWork suite. # Environmental education # The school is a strong promoter of environmental education throughout the student body, making them aware of the pollution and deforestation problems our planet is facing, amongst others. some of the campaigns the school has come up with to make it easier for children to understand how important it is to take care of our mother earth include: ocean week earth day fair meatless Mondays ecology classes recycling competitions clean it, green it, mean it (a program that is in charge of cleaning nearby beaches) the school also promotes vegetarianism and off campus recycling Category:Schools in Mexico Category:Educational institutions established in 1986 Category:Acapulco Category:Buildings and structures in Guerrero Category:Education in Guerrero Category:1986 establishments in Mexico ","title":"Colegio Nautilus"},{"id":"28202582","text":"EGOT is an acronym for \\"Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, Tony\\" in reference to persons who have won all four awards.

The Presidency General Hospital was established near the St. John's Church (presently, in 1, Garstin Place and in its adjoining areas) which was in famous as a hellish side. According to Mrs. Bleshinden, \\"It was a veritable death-trap to those unfortunate who were driven to seek its shelter and had been the subject of constant complaint for years. At last in 1768. a house was purchased from a native gentleman for the purpose of a hospital. It stood to the south of the Maidan, practically in the country. This house with various alterations and additions, including two other buildings created in 1795 remained in us as the Presidency General Hospital\\". The construction of the hospital started after the Government occupied the land on 20 June 1769. The west wing was completed on 2 April 1770 and the east wing on 2 June 1770.

Lake Zoar Authority The Lake Zoar Authority (LZA) is an organization for promoting safety on the lake and improving water quality. The members represent the four towns bordering the lake and meet on a monthly basis. Authority is granted through the Connecticut General Statutes, section 7-151a (of the 1969 supplement). Notable events *September 7, 2005: A 37-year-old man named Frank Northrop died while water-skiing on the lake. * November 1986: Richard Crafts murdered his wife Helle Crafts in Newtown, froze the body, cut it up with a chainsaw and finally put it through a woodchipper from a bridge into the lake. Recreation =Boating= There is a speed limit of limit daytime, from 30 minutes after sunset to 30 minutes before sunrise. Vessels are prohibited from approaching within on upstream side or on downstream side of Stevenson Dam. Activities including fishing, water-skiing and jet skiing are permitted. Access Each of the towns has a public access boat launch. The Southbury location is maintained by the state of Connecticut and is open to non-town residents. Additionally, there is canoe access from Kettletown State Park. * Monroe, Zoar Beach Boat Ramp. * Newtown, Eichler's Cove. * Oxford, Jackson Cove Park. * Southbury, at the end of Scout Road. =Sand Bar= The Sand Bar is an accumulation of sand close to the center of Lake Zoar. It is a popular meeting destination for all boaters alike. The depth of the water above the sand bar varies upon the generation schedule of \\"First Light Hydro Generation.\\" The depth varies from 6 inches of water at its most shallow point to a foot before receiving. The area stretches about a quarter. =Fishing= Lake Zoar is not stocked yearly with fish by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, but the Pootatuck and Pomperaug rivers feed into it are heavily stocked with trout, many of which eventually make their way into the lake. Fish species The lake contains the desirable Smallmouth Bass, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, White Perch, Yellow Perch, Calico Bass (Black Crappie), White Catfish (Ictalurus catus), Brown Bullhead, Rainbow Trout, and the Common Carp. PCBs and fish consumption Most fish from Lake Zoar are generally considered safe to eat in moderation, with the exception of the Northern Pike. In a 2008 study by the United States Department of Health and Human Services Smallmouth Bass varied between 0.35 and 0.58 ppm, suitable for one meal per month. PCB levels in the lake have fallen considerably since the 1980s. Invasive species Four invasive plant species exist in the lake as of a 2007 study, including Eurasian watermilfoil, Brittle waternymph, Curly leaf pondweed, and European waterclover. As with all the Housatonic River impoundments south of Bulls Bridge, Zebra Mussels have invaded and colonized Lake Zoar. =Hiking= The Zoar Trail is a Blue-Blazed Trail in Newtown maintained by the Connecticut Forest and Park Association.

It is believed that the name ‚ÄòColiba≈üi‚Äò is related to the shepherds who walked their sheep flock towards this place in search for wealthy grasslands. Once here they have capitalised on the wild steppes and the natural riches of the Prut riverside. As a result, huts started to appear on the left bank of the river Prut. The settlers who built them were nicknamed coliba≈üi (a word believed to derive from the Romanian word coliba, hut). Hence the name of the village - Coliba≈üi. Other theories in regards to village's name and its origins have been debated by some. The Doctor of Historical Sciences V.M. Kabuzan claims in his monograph \\"Narodonasilenie Bessarabskoi oblast i levoberejnih raionov Pridnestrovia\\" that the village bears the name of Coliba≈üi (or Culiba≈üi) - a name he argues is linked to Ottoman rule. During settlements in southern Bessarabia, the village of Coliba≈üi, as well as other villages in Bugeac region, was home to natives from Bulgaria and Ukraine and from that period on it became one of the largest village in the country.

The previous emperor, Emperor Wu, had reversed the laissez-faire policies of his predecessors and imposed a wide variety of state interventions, such as creating monopolies on China's salt and iron enterprises, price stabilization schemes, and taxes on capital. These actions sparked a fierce debate as to the policies of the Emperor. After his death, during the reign of Emperor Zhao of Han, the regent Huo Guang called on all the scholars of the empire to come to the capital, Chang'an, to debate the government's economic policies. The debate was characterized by two opposing factions, the reformists and the modernists. The reformists were largely Confucian scholars who opposed the policies of Emperor Wu and demanded the abolition of the monopolies on salt and iron, an end to the state price stabilization schemes, and huge cuts in government expenditures to reduce the burden on the citizenry. The Modernists supported the continuation of Emperor Wu's policies in order to appropriate the profits of private merchants into state coffers to fund the government's military and colonization campaigns in the north and west. The results of these debates were mixed. Although the Modernists were largely successful and their policies were followed through most of the Western Han after Emperor Wu, the Reformists repealed these policies in Eastern Han, save for the government monopoly on minting coins. Background The discourses on salt and iron took place behind a tumultuous background. The previous ruler, Emperor Wu of Han, had undertaken a drastic change in policy compared to his predecessors. Reversing their laissez-faire policy at home and policy of appeasement of the Xiongnu abroad, he nationalized coinage, salt, and iron in order to pay for his massive campaigns against the Xiongnu tribes, which posed a threat to the empire. Although Wu was successful in his campaigns, his policies bankrupted many merchants and industrialists, led to widespread dissatisfaction, and even revolts against imperial authority. After his death, the regent Huo Guang called a court conference to discuss whether to continue Wu's policies. =Policies in the early Han= Policies in the early Han were marked by laissez-faire, due to the adoption by the early emperors of the Taoist principle of Wu wei (ÁÑ°ÁÇ∫), literally meaning \\"do nothing\\". As part of their laissez-faire policy, agricultural taxes were reduced from 1/15 of agricultural output to 1/30, and for a brief period abolished entirely. In addition, the labor corv√©e required of peasants was reduced from one month every year to one month every three years. The minting of coins was privatized, while Qin taxes on salt and other commodities were removed. Later opponents of taxation described the early Han as a prosperous period and lamented what they saw as overtaxation. Under Emperor Jing, > ... the ropes used to hang the bags of coins were breaking apart due to the > weight, and bags of grain which had been stored for several years were > rotting because they had been neglected and not eaten. Severe criminal punishments, such as cutting off the nose of an offender, were abolished. Merchants and industrialists in particular prospered during this period. In the early Western Han, the wealthiest men in the empire were the merchants who produced and distributed salt and iron, acquiring wealth that rivaled the annual tax revenues collected by the imperial court. These merchants invested in land, becoming great landowners and employing large numbers of peasants. A salt or iron industrialist could employ over one thousand peasants to extract either liquid brine, sea salt, rock salt, or iron ore. =Emperor Wu's policies= Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141-87 BCE) viewed such large-scale private industries as a threat to the state, as they drew the peasants' loyalties away from farming and towards the industrialists. Nationalizing the salt and iron trades eliminated this threat and produced large profits for the state. This policy was successful in financing Emperor Wu's campaigns of challenging the nomadic Xiongnu Confederation while colonizing the Hexi Corridor and what is now Xinjiang of Central Asia, Northern Vietnam, Yunnan, and North Korea. Other policies included a price stabilization scheme and a tax of 10 percent on the capital of merchants and industrialists who had not yet been expropriated. However, these policies imposed great hardships on the people; banditry and armed revolts were occurring by Emperor Wu's death. Debate As complaints surfaced criticizing more and more about the government's policies, the regent Huo Guang, who was the de facto ruler of China after Emperor Wu of Han, called a court conference to debate whether the policies of Emperor Wu should be continued.Wagner (2001), 13-14 The resulting debate was divided into two groups, the reformists and the modernists. The reformists, largely provincial Confucian scholars, backed privatization and a return to the laissez-faire policies of old. The modernists, on the other hand, largely represented the interests of the central government and were more in tune with legalist philosophy, as well as being admirers of the previous Qin dynasty, whose harsh and numerous laws had been based on legalist principles.Loewe (1986), 189 =Reformist position= The reformist view was based on the Confucian ideal which sought to bring about the betterment of man by conformity to fundamental moral principles. To achieve this, they wished to reduce controls, demands for service, and taxation to a minimum. The reformists' criticism of the monopolies largely centered on the idea that the state \\"should not compete with the people for profit\\", as it would tend to oppress the citizenry while doing so; mercantile ventures were not \\"proper activities for the state\\".Wagner (2001), 53-54 They pointed out that the monopolies had placed an immense burden on the citizenry. In addition, the reformists complained that the state monopolies oppressed the people by producing low-quality and impractical iron tools that were useless and made only to meet quotas, yet which the peasants had to pay for regardless of their quality.Wagner (2001), 25 The reformers believed former private smelting by small-scale family enterprises made better implements \\"because of pride of workmanship and because they were closer to the users\\", in contrast to the state monopoly.Wagner (2001), 26 In addition, the reformists complained that the state monopolies could not coordinate their production in accordance with the needs of all the provinces of the empire, with some areas overproducing and actually forcing the peasants to buy the surplus.Wagner (2001), 59 The reformists also criticized the aggressive foreign policy of Emperor Wu, which they believed had weakened instead of strengthening China, and whose costs did not justify the benefits involved. =Modernist position= The modernists were headed by Sang Hongyang, an ex-merchant who had been selected by Emperor Wu to administer to his new interventionist policies.Loewe (1986), 163 They justified the imposition of controls on the grounds that they would thus wrest profits from wealthy private merchants that could pose a threat to the state and bring them into state coffers; particularly, modernists claimed that salt and iron industrialists were \\"brutal and tyrannical,\\" who employed thousands of workers that could potentially become rebels.Wagner (2001), 55-56 The modernists took the view that with its iron monopoly the state could effectively distribute tools of good quality for the use of the peasant, as well as stabilizing the price of many essential goods. They also claimed that private workshops were too small, unspecialized, and poorly equipped. Modernists claimed the government workshops offered better working conditions and access to more materials than private workshops.Wagner (2001), 56 In addition, the modernists claimed that the expansionist campaigns were necessary to defend China from barbarian incursions, and that by nationalizing the salt and iron industries the state could obtain the funds needed to defend the empire without imposing additional burdens on the peasantry.Wagner (2001), 28 Legacy The modernists survived this debate with most of their policies intact, with only the monopoly on liquor abolished, although Sang was later executed in 80 BCE for treason. Reformists gradually gained more power through the rest of Former Han, due to the growing unsustainability of the Modernists' policies. They briefly succeeded in getting the central government monopolies on salt and iron abolished from 44 to 41 BCE, though this was unsuccessful and the monopolies resumed until the end of Wang Mang's (r. 9-23 CE) regime, which imposed ultra- modernist policies.Bielenstein 1987, p. 238 After his overthrow, the government of later Han resumed earlier laissez faire policies and relinquished control of these industries to private businessmen.

Originally discovered by Alan Lomax and Hamish Henderson during the early 1950s, she continued to perform into her later years. Life MacNeil was born in 1928 on the island of Barra, one of Gaelic song's most important strongholds. There were singers on either side of her family, but this was a time when the menfolk were often away at sea for long periods, leaving the women to raise the children and tend the croft ‚Äì singing all the while, to assuage their labours ‚Äì and most of MacNeil's repertoire was passed on from her mother, Ann Gillies. In these pre-television days (Flora's family did not even have a radio until the 1950s), ceilidhs with the neighbours were a regular occurrence in the MacNeil household, and from earliest childhood she remembers \\"soaking up\\" literally hundreds of songs, as if by osmosis. Clearly, the music was in her blood: by age four, famously, she was already tackling the sophisticated poetry of Mo r√πn geal √≤g (\\"My Fair Young Love\\"), one of the greatest of the Orain Mor, or \\"Big Songs\\". Like many others before her, MacNeil left Barra in 1947 to find work in Edinburgh. She found a public platform in the burgeoning round of ceilidhs and concerts that marked the first stirrings of the British folk revival. These brought her to the attention of Hamish Henderson, who recorded her singing as part of his 1950s collaboration with American musicologist Alan Lomax. Henderson also invited MacNeil to perform at the 1951 Edinburgh People's Festival Ceilidh. The ceilidh, which brought Scottish traditional folk music to the public stage for the first time, took place in Edinburgh's Oddfellows Hall in August 1951. The Scottish G√†idhealtachd was represented at the Celidh by Flora MacNeil, Calum Johnston, and John Burgess. The music was recorded live at the scene by Alan Lomax. In 2005, Lomax's recording was released on compact disc by Rounder Records. Until 1954, the Edinburgh Festival Ceilidhs were an annual event. Eventually, however, the affiliation of some board members with the Communist Party of Great Britain caused the events to lose the backing of the city's trade unions. MacNeil also recorded two albums, Craobh nan Ubhal in 1976 (reissued in 1993) and Orain Floraidh in 2000. She died after a short illness on 15 May 2015, aged 86. Family Flora's daughter, Maggie MacInnes, is a Gaelic singer and harpist. Quote * \\"Traditional songs tended to run in families and I was fortunate that my mother and her family had a great love for the poetry and the music of the old songs. It was natural for them to sing, whatever they were doing at the time or whatever mood they were in. My aunt Mary, in particular, was always ready, at any time I called on her, to drop whatever she was doing, to discuss a song with me, and perhaps, in this way, long forgotten verses would be recollected. So I learned a great many songs at an early age without any conscious effort. As is to be expected on a small island, so many songs deal with the sea, but, of course, many of them may not originally be Barra songs. Nevertheless the old songs were preserved more in the southernmost islands of Barra and South Uist possibly because the Reformed Church tended to discourage music elsewhere.\\" References External links *Traditional Music Hall of Fame *Description of a 2000 Ceilidh in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia *Scottish Music from Flora MacNeil * =Alan Lomax Research Center= *Ailein Duinn a ni's a Naire *Nach Freagair Thu Charaistiona *Phiuthrag 'S A Phiuthar *Mhic Iarla Nam Bratach Bana with Calum Johnston. *A Bhradag Dhubh *Faca sibh Raghall na Ailean *Cadal cha d√®an mi *'S mi ri imeachd 'nam aonar *Mo R√πn Geal Og *Mo R√πn Geal Og at the 1951 Edinburgh People's Festival Ceilidh *Co Siod Thall Air Sraid Na H-eala? *Mo Nighean Donn Bh√≤idheach Category:1928 births Category:2015 deaths Category:People from Barra Category:Scottish Gaelic singers Category:Members of the Order of the British Empire ","title":"Flora MacNeil"},{"id":"28202883","text":"Kamienica ≈Åyszkiewicza w Warszawie (the ≈Åyszkiewicz apartment building) is a museum (birthplace of Maria Sk≈Çodowska Curie), established 1967, in Warsaw New Town, Poland.

He practised so diligently both prose and verse writing that he soon became an elegant poet and most adept rhetorician. When speaking of him as a poet, John Pits says that he was chiefly remarkable for talents which are rarely found in combination ‚Äî Ingenium felix, inventio, lucidus ordo, Gratia, majestas, ad rem bene congrua verba. As his judgment became more matured by years, he was unwilling to spend all his life and all his ability in exercises of ordinary choice. He therefore betook himself to the reading of the holy scriptures, and in the midst of that labour he undertook the task of preaching the divine word, for which his previous education had so eminently qualified him. All the polite learning of his youth was now devoted to this sacred purpose. He achieved, as might be expected, a great success, and made for himself a name amongst theologians of no little fame. He was still living, according to Antonio Possevino, in 1366. His chief work was a 'Commentary on the Gospel of St. Matthew' in one book, which is bound up in the older editions of the works of St. Anselm.

History New building of Chopin Institute, seen from Ostrogski Palace terrace The Fryderyk Chopin Museum at the Fryderyk Chopin Society in Warsaw was established in the 1930s. Already in 1935, the Fryderyk Chopin Institute, established a year earlier by 32 outstanding representatives of the world of culture and politics, headed by Karol Szymanowski, J√≥zef Beck and August Zaleski, had begun amassing a collection. At that time, thirteen extremely valuable manuscripts were purchased from Ludwika Ciechomska, granddaughter of Ludwika Jƒôdrzejewicz, Chopin's sister, and Bogus≈Çaw Kraszewski. The manuscripts included: a complete autograph of the G minor Trio op. 8 for piano, violin and cello by Chopin, seven letters written at Szafarnia by the young composer to his family in 1824 (including four examples of the famous Szafarnia Courier) and at Kowalewo (6 July 1827) as well as to his school friend Julian Fontana in Paris (1835), three special greetings addressed by Chopin to his father (6 December 1816 and 1818) and mother (16 June 1817) upon their name days as well as two dedications of 6 and 9 June 1833 for J√≥zef Nowakowski, a friend from the Warsaw Conservatory. The creation of a Collection of Photographs, Recordings and a Library was started prior to 1939. In 1945 the Fryderyk Chopin Institute reopened, on Warsaw's Zgoda Street, and since 1953 has been housed in the Ostrogski Palace. This is also the home of the Fryderyk Chopin Museum, Library and Collections of Photographs and Recordings. The Museum covers the history and works of Chopin and includes original manuscripts and documents written by the composer, photographs and sculptures of him, and letters. It also hosts piano recitals and competitions of Chopin's works. The rich plafonds, stucco and Pompeian style frescoes are a fitting setting for the rooms of the Fryderyk Chopin Museum. Refurbished for the 200th anniversary (2010) of Fr√©d√©ric Chopin's birth, this mutimedia museum is one of the most modern museums in Poland.

It is considered one of the finest collections of European art in Warsaw. The collection includes around 400 exhibits mainly Old Masters and the Impressionists along with some copies of masterpieces of European painting.  History  Pope John Paul II with Janina and Zbigniew Karol Porczynski Zbigniew and Janina Porczy≈Ñski have been amassing the collection since 1981. In the first three years, the couple concentrated on adding paintings with biblical themes but later portraits and impressionistic works were added. In 1986 the couple transferred about 400 exhibits to the Archdiocese of Warsaw and the Polish nation and created a foundation to supervise the collection. The first part of the collection was displayed publicly on 5 November 1987 at the Museum of the Warsaw archdiocese (Muzeum Archidiecezji Warszawskiej) at Solec Street. The second part was displayed from 14 September to 30 December 1988. In 1989 the beneficiaries of the foundation, the Primate of Poland and the Polish Arts and Culture Ministry, decided to create a museum to provide a permanent display of the collection. The city of Warsaw provided the collection with a permanent home in a building designed by Antonio Corazzi in 1825 \\\\- the former stock exchange rebuilt after the Second World War destruction.  Criticism  Since 1987 various art experts put in doubt the authenticity of many important works in the collection. The Polish art historians Mieczys≈Çaw Morka and Waldemar ≈Åysiak contributed several times to this criticism. A painting signed by Alfred Sisley (River landscape) is a forgery by Tom Keating. Apart from forgery allegations and unclear financing of the foundation by the public sector, some other activities of the foundation were criticized (the organization of commercial events in the museum premises).  Collection  The collection is displayed in eight rooms and arranged thematically: Impressionists, mythology and allegory, portraits and self-portraits (in the two-story hall \\"Rotunda\\"), mothers and children, effigies of the Madonna and Child, biblical themes, still lifes and landscapes (in the gallery) and a room dedicated to the monumental painting Baptism of Lithuania (1889) by Wojciech Gerson. The majority of the collection consists of works by British, Dutch, Early Netherlandish, Flemish, French, German, Italian, Spanish and Swiss Old Masters, their pupils and followers. Among the artists represented are Paris Bordone, Cornelis van Haarlem, Jos√© de Ribera, William-Adolphe Bouguereau, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Vincent van Gogh and a significant collection of paintings by Swiss painter Fritz Zuber-B√ºhler.

It deals with the themes of class, religion, love and marriage. The premise of the novel is drawn from Gissing's own early life ‚Äî an intellectually superior man born into a socially inferior milieu, though the story arc diverges significantly from the actuality. Plot summary The main protagonist, Godwin Peak, is a star student at Whitelaw College, which he won a scholarship to attend. He wins many academic prizes and his future seems promising. Then his Cockney uncle arrives intending to open an eating-house adjacent to the college. Godwin is mortified of being associated with 'trade' and leaves the college rather than face the scorn he expects to receive from his upper-class fellow students. This is indicative of his social aspirations (upwards) and snobbery (downwards). He moves to London where he abhors the social mores of the lower orders and pines to be accepted into high society where he believes his intellect should place him. He sees writing as a possible entry and pens a fiercely critical article on the Church of England and its attitude to Darwinism. It is published anonymously but not before word of its true authorship has spread within his small circle of friends. These include Christian Moxey, who has an idealised romantic fixation on a married woman (ultimately found to be unrequited), Moxey's sister Marcella has a likewise unrequited crush on Godwin Peak, and Malkin-a flighty Bohemian who has an idea of training an adolescent girl to be a wife worthy of his radical views, and who has formed a relationship with Mrs. Jacox and her daughters to further this plan (ultimately successful). After submitting the article Peak goes on holiday to the West Country stopping of in Exeter where he encounters the Warricombe family (minor gentry) whose son Buckland he was at Whitelaw with (Peak once visited the family as a child and was smitten by their daughter Sidwell). He trails the family around Exeter until he has an 'accidental' encounter with Buckland and gets invited to their house. He meets Sidwell, now a beautiful and devoutly religious woman, and in a hypocritical volte face Peak declares himself a Christian and whats more his intent to take Holy Orders. This plan would give him two things he desires: an upper class wife and entry into a socially higher class through his vocation. He stays in Exeter to execute his plan and proximity to the Warricombes, especially Sidwell and her father, seems to be getting him closer to his goals. However Buckland Warricombe distrusts him, seeing him as a social upstart, and seeks out Peak's London friends to ascertain his motives. He meets with the Moxeys and while there Malkin arrives, whose mouth runs away with him, exposing Peak's authorship of the article thus revealing Peak as a fraud and hypocrite. Marcella does not stop Malkin despite knowing the consequences for Peak, as it suits her ends to hamper Peak and Sidwell's relationship. Ironically Marcella is shown to be a better mate for Peak but he is more interested in Sidwell's beauty and social position. Buckland exposes Peak as a hypocrite and possible fraudster to Sidwell and her father (who liked Peak believing him to be sympathetic to his anti-evolutionary Anglicanism). However Sidwell has fallen in love with Peak and forgives him but Peak feels he cannot stay in Exeter and be shamed by the revelation of his hypocrisy, reminiscent of his leaving college rather than be associated with tradespeople. They part but keep up a cool, sporadic correspondence for some years. Then Marcella Moxey is killed while trying to prevent a horse being beaten and leaves her considerable wealth to Peak. He reluctantly accepts it (she had previously offered him money but he refused it) and now an independent man of means he proposes marriage to Sidwell. She almost accepts him but out of love and loyalty to her family, and father in particular, she turns him down. Denied his aspiration to marry into society Peak goes on a tour of Europe where he contracts Malaria and dies alone in a Viennese boarding-house. Thus Peak was born, lived and died in Exile.

The collection consists of valuables collected by subsequent owners of the Wilan√≥w Palace, the Kings of Poland - John III Sobieski and Augustus II, as well as by representatives of noble families of Potocki, and Lubomirski and a collection of Sarmatian art. History The Wilan√≥w Palace was first opened to the public in 1805, when the owners of the Palace, Stanis≈Çaw Kostka Potocki and his wife Aleksandra Lubomirska created a museum, one of the first public museums in Poland. In 1877 the museum was popularized by the publication entitled Wilan√≥w. Album widok√≥w i pamiƒÖtek... edited by Hipolit Skimborowicz and Wojciech Gerson. This was followed in 1893 by a guide over the Palace and its collections. After the Second World War, the palace was renovated, and most of the collection, which had been stolen by Nazi Germany, was repatriated. Under the Communist agrarian reform, the Wilan√≥w estate became the property of the state. In 1954 the extensive revitalization palace and the park began in 1962 with the opening of the museum as a branch of the National Museum in Warsaw. In following years the number of visitors to the palace and gardens reached 400,000 people per year. In 1983, on the occasion of the 300th anniversary of the Battle of Vienna, the museum organized a jubilee exhibition \\"Glory and fame of John III in art and literature\\". In 1995 the Palace Museum was established as an independent entity under the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage. The Museum regularly organizes temporary exhibitions, conferences and seminars, conducts research, publishes books and organizes educational activities dedicated to both cultural and natural values of the Wilan√≥w residence. In September 2013 the museum was renamed as the Museum of King John III's Palace at Wilan√≥w. Collection The palace's collection started with its establishment by King John III Sobieski, who collected works of art and objects of everyday use. Only a fraction of King's collection survived to this day in the museum's current holdings, including two still life paintings by Abraham Mignon, portrait paintings and furnishings like Chinese quilt of Kings' wife Marysie≈Ñka. Originally the Royal belongings included 6 paintings by Rembrandt and Johannes Vermeer's Loveletter, scattered after King's death. The subsequent owners re-estabslished and enriched the collection with paintings by Lucas Cranach the Elder, Peter Paul Rubens, Jan Lievens, Charles Le Brun, Pompeo Batoni, Angelika Kauffmann and Anton Graff, among others. The Equestrian Portrait of Stanis≈Çaw Kostka Potocki, painted in 1781 by Jacques- Louis David, is among the most precious paintings of the collection. The acquisitions also included examples of European and Polish goldsmithery (e.g. Decorative platter by Hans Jacob Mair), biscuits, craft, objects from the Far East (e.g. Japanese nanban table adorned with mother-of-pearl), antiquities (e.g. Red - figure amphora by the Painter of the Louvre Gigantomachia and marble bust of a prince of the Julio-Claudian dynasty) and Royal memorabilia (e.g. dressing table of Queen Marysie≈Ñka).

It was established in 2005. Until the construction of its new museum, the Museum of Modern Art in Warsaw carries out its program activities in a temporary premises at ul. Pa≈Ñska 3. The Director of the museum since June 6, 2007 has been Joanna Mytkowska.  The construction of the new museum  In 2006, an international architectural competition for the design of the museum was announced. The competition was won in February 2007 by Swiss architect Christian Kerez. It was chosen from 109 designs. The building of about 30,000 square meters was to be completed from 2012-2016 on the northern side of Parade Square beside Marsza≈Çkowska Street (previously occupied by a marketplace). In April, 2008 the President of Warsaw, Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz and Christian Kerez signed a contract for the design of the museum. In summer 2008, Warsaw authorities decided to change the functional program and project of the inside of the building, and as a result, the project had undergone significant change, and design work had to be significantly extended. The final concept of the building was to have been presented in the summer of 2010. However, in May 2012, the City terminated the contract with Christian Kerez. At the same time it was decided that for the next three years the temporary location for the museum would be in Pa≈Ñska Street, off the nearby main thoroughfare Emilii Plater. Current plans are to open the new custom- built museum in 2019.  Plans for the museum  The museum will present the achievements and changes in Polish art of the twentieth and twenty-first century in an international context, create an art collection, present significant phenomena in the field of visual arts, film, theater and music, as well as support exceptionally talented artists. Museum on the Vistula The museum will be a platform for dialogue between tradition and the new currents, which will allow for constant renewal of the historical memory of the \\"near\\" and to negotiate the changing social hierarchy of values in the wider culture. The museum - open for art in the broadest sense - is geared to interact with many diverse circles of Polish society, and to communicate with the public and international artistic circles. The collection, exhibition time, as well as a multimedia program will be supported by information and education addressed to a number of social and age groups, with particular emphasis on high schools and universities. The activities of the museum will serve to raise the level of knowledge and interest in the arts with references to tradition and history, and will develop and promote international cooperation with a view to forming a European cultural identity. This will apply to both the new museum and artistic and scientific exchanges with artists and people working in the area of culture - art historians, exhibitions curators, art critics - as well as participation in international museum artwork circuits and projects in the area of contemporary culture. Thanks to its unique location and historical surroundings the museum will be particularly try to stimulate intercultural dialogue. The attractiveness of the building, combined with a favorable location and dynamics of the museum will be used to create a space for recreation and leisure for residents of and visitors to the city of Warsaw.

It shows the history of Pawiak Prison which was notably used during the German occupation between 1939 and 1944. History Pawiak Prison Museum was founded in 1965 on the initiative and with the participation of former Pawiak political prisoners. It was designed by architects Romuald Gutt and Mieczys≈Çaw Mo≈Çdawa. The museum building was built in the foundations of the surviving underground casemates of the prison which was blown up by the Germans in August 1944. During the construction, items from the rubble, including object grilles, hinges, locks and fittings, documents, equipment and items used by the prisoners were recovered. Monuments important to Pawiak also include: a pillar represents a part of the entrance gate, the Monument Tree of Pawiak (which is bronze copy of the famous elm, witness to its history - on which the victims' families since 1945 have placed the epitaph plates), concrete wall of sandstone blocks surrounding the grounds of the Museum, with symbolic sculptures by Tadeusza ≈Åodziany and Stanis≈Çawa S≈Çoniny, as well a monument within the old prison courtyard: an obelisk by Zofii Poci≈Çowskiej. In a reconstructed courtyard there are marble plaques at specific points and an entrance going down to the morgue from the street. On the other side of the avenue now named for John Paul II, crossing the former prison's grounds, is the site of the women's prison Serbia, where there is a plate commemorating the bravery and suffering of its prisoners. Since 1990, the Museum of Pawiak Prison, together with the Mausoleum of Struggle and Martyrdom is a branch of the Museum of Independence in Warsaw. Education The museum organizes historical education: * on March 26 it has a meeting with scouts in a nationwide campaign to remember Operation Arsenal; * in the second half of September, Remembrance Days for Pawiak are addressed mainly to the younger generation. Lectures by well-known historians, school participation programs, and historical and literary scenes performed by actors from Warsaw, who participate in workshops to connect with Pawiak's history and that of the Polish Underground State. Pawiak Museum lessons are conducted about: * Generation Janka Bytnara; * The ethos of the Polish Underground State; * Polish Underground State and Pawiak. The program is a planned lecture lesson by a historian. Visitors to the exhibition have the ability to listen to recordings of secret messages and artistic educational performances. An important element of the research workshop Museum are thematic and personal files for the entire duration of the prison. Particular attention is paid to the ever-growing number of files about prisoners from the years 1939-1944, useful not only to historians or scholars but also for former prisoners (including in their efforts to gain compensation).

It has been designated by Cadw as a Grade II* listed building, and is under the care of the Friends of Friendless Churches. It is listed Grade II* because it is \\"a scarce rural example of an unaltered Anglican church of its date\\". History St Andrew's is thought to be an early 19th-century rebuild of a medieval church. It was designed by a local architect, David Evans of Eglwyswrw, the first Welsh-based architect to have been trained in Wales, rather than in England. Since it was declared redundant, the church has been maintained by the charity, the Friends of Friendless Churches, who hold a 999 year lease with effect from 7 October 1983. Since acquiring the church, the charity has reinstated the Gothic-style sash windows, and renewed the rendering on the western face to deal with the effects of damp. Architecture The church is constructed in stone rubble with a slate roof and a bellcote in blue lias stone. It is rectangular in plan and consists of a single chamber. The windows are twelve-pane sashes with Gothic tracery in the top panes; there are two such windows on the south side, and one on each of the east and north sides. At the west end is a flat-arched doorway. Internally it is \\"remarkable\\" as it is a \\"little altered\\" early 19th- century church interior.

You could also say that Big Ears was for people with long attention spans, good concentration and an appetite for letting repetitive non-dance music wash over them. And at least in its first edition ‚Äî Mr. Capps intends to repeat Big Ears in Knoxville, and also export the idea to other cities ‚Äî Big Ears was for concertgoers who appreciate not hearing a lot of introductions and context and sponsor announcements before the music even starts.

She was the first Ethiopian ever legally to challenge a bridal abduction. Traditionally in rural Ethiopia, if a man wants to marry a woman but does not have the money to pay a bride price for her, he kidnaps and rapes her, after which she is expected to marry him because she is considered \\"ruined\\" and will probably be unable to find anyone else willing to marry her. When Woineshet was 13 she was kidnapped and raped. The leader of the men who participated in this (Aberew Jemma Negussi) was briefly arrested, but then released on bail, at which point he kidnapped Woineshet again and held her for over a month until she managed to escape, but only after he had forced her to sign a marriage certificate. At this time, Ethiopian law stated that a man could not be charged with rape if he married the victim. On July 22, 2003, Aberew Jemma Negussie was sentenced to 10 years‚Äô imprisonment without parole for kidnapping and rape, and his four accomplices were each sentenced to 8 years‚Äô imprisonment without parole, making Woineshet's case the first case in which accomplices were also charged and convicted for kidnapping. However, just four months later, on December 4, 2003, the High Court of the Arsi Zone sitting on appeal overturned the decision of the lower court and released the five men from prison. On May 9, 2005 the new Ethiopian Penal Code came into effect, which removed the marital exemption for kidnapping and rape, largely due to a campaign by Equality Now inspired by Woineshet's case. On March 10, 2016, Africa's human rights-focused Union court based in The Gambia ruled that \\"Ethiopia had violated the girl's rights to equality, dignity and a fair trial, among others,\\" ordering the state to pay Woineshet $150,000 as compensation.Ethiopia to pay $150,000 to raped girl - BBC News  References  Category:Ethiopian victims of crime Category:Women's rights in Ethiopia Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Violence against women in Ethiopia ","title":"Woineshet Zebene"},{"id":"28203091","text":"200px Thung Liang Lee or Tang Liangli (traditional Chinese: '; simplified Chinese: '; pinyin: TƒÅng Li√°ngl«ê) (1901‚Äì1970) was a journalist and politician in the Republic of China. He was an important politician during the Wang Jingwei regime (Republic of China-Nanjing). He was an overseas Chinese who was born in Java, Indonesia, and whose family place of origin was Fujian. His Indonesian name was Tubagus Pranata Tirtawidjaya.  Biography  = Journalist = T'ang Leang-Li spoke English better than Chinese. He studied at London University and Vienna University. In 1925 he acquired a B.Sc (Economics), from London University, and was recommended as a member of the Royal Economic Society. In 1929, T'ang was appointed chief of the Communications Office to Europe, Central Executive Committee, Kuomintang (). The next year, he returned to China and became Wang Jingwei's private secretary and a reporter for several foreign presses, including The New York Times, The Daily News (London), The Batavia Newspaper, and the news agency of the Social Democratic Party of Germany. He was also appointed president of Lianhua Shubao () and general editor of People's Tribune. In 1931, Zhou Enlai who managed the central leading authority of the Communist Party of China in Shanghai, was pressured heavily by the Kuomintang. At that time, T'ang hid Zhou from the Kuomintang authorities, and with the assistance of a Western friend, enabled Zhou's escape from Shanghai.According to Lawrence Kessler,\\"Reconstructing Zhou Enlai's Escape from Shanghai in 1931: A Research Note\\" and Zhai Yaliu which also referred to Kessler's Article. In 1933, T'ang was appointed as an adviser to the Foreign Ministry, National Government, with minister extraordinary and plenipotentiary status. After that he became a general editor of The China Today Series and the English Encyclopedia of Modern China. During that time, he wrote extensively in English, with many of his works becoming influential both inside and outside China. Among these are, The New Currency System in China (1937),Tatsuo Yamada, p.114. According to Liang Jie,\\"Friedman and the Issue of the Chinese Currency,\\" in 1935. which was referred to by Milton Friedman.Liang, Ibid. = In the Wang Jingwei regime = In March 1940, when the Wang Jingwei regime was established, T'ang assumed formal office in the regime. In August of the same year, he was appointed director of the International Publicity Bureau (), remaining at this post until the collapse of the regime following Japan's surrender in 1945. From May to August 1941 he also held the post of Policy Affairs Vice-Minister for the Foreign Affairs Ministry. After the Wang Jingwei regime had collapsed, T'ang was arrested by Chiang Kai-shek's National Government; however, for unknown reasons, he was soon released. In 1949, he returned to Indonesia and lived in Jakarta. He participated in editing The Indonesian Review of International Affairs, and was interviewed by Japanese political scientist Tatsuo Yamada (who specialized in Chinese politics) on December 17, 1969. T'ang Leang-Li died in 1970.Kessler,op.cit. But Yamada (p.115), which was published in October 1972, did not write about T'ang's death.  Works  *China in Revolt (London, 1927.

Once the world's largest botnet, Grum can be traced back to as early as 2008. At the time of its shutdown in July 2012, Grum was reportedly the world's 3rd largest botnet, responsible for 18% of worldwide spam traffic. Grum relies on two types of control servers for its operation. One type is used to push configuration updates to the infected computers, and the other is used to tell the botnet what spam emails to send. In July 2010, the Grum botnet consisted of an estimated 560,000‚Äì840,000 computers infected with the Grum rootkit. The botnet alone delivered about 39.9 billion spam messages in March 2010, equating to approximately 26% of the total global spam volume, temporarily making it the world's then-largest botnet. Late in 2010, the botnet seemed to be growing, as its output increased roughly by 51% in comparison to its output in 2009 and early 2010. It used a panel written in PHP to control the botnet. Botnet takedown In July 2012, a malware intelligence company published an analysis of the botnet's command and control servers located in the Netherlands, Panama, and Russia. It was later reported that the Dutch Colo/ISP soon after seized two secondary servers responsible for sending spam instructions after their existence was made public. Within one day, the Panamanian ISP hosting one of Grum's primary servers followed suit and shut down their server. The cybercriminals behind Grum quickly responded by sending instructions through six newly established servers in Ukraine. FireEye connected with Spamhaus, CERT-GIB, and an anonymous researcher to shut down the remaining six C&C; servers, officially knocking down the botnet.

A feed from the sinkhole was processed via both Shadowserver and abusix to inform the Point of Contact at an ISP that has an infected IP addresses. ISP's are asked to contact their customers about the infections to have the malware cleaned up.

The actress auditioned for the role and began filming in June 2009. She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 14 August 2009. Sonya was introduced as a recurring guest character and dog trainer for established character Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney). When producers noticed there was a good chemistry between the characters, Morey was promoted to the regular cast in July 2010. Sonya is portrayed as being good-hearted, funny and loving. She was once addicted to alcohol, drugs and gambling, but moved to Erinsborough for a fresh start. While working as a guide dog trainer, Sonya develops a relationship with Toadfish Rebecchi, which ends when Toadie gets back together with his former girlfriend Stephanie Scully (Carla Bonner). However, when Sonya learns the relationship is a sham, she agrees to wait for Toadie. The couple eventually reunite, marry and start a family. Sonya's estranged younger sister Jade Mitchell (Gemma Pranita) was introduced in late 2010, which led to the revelation that Sonya is Callum Jones's (Morgan Baker) biological mother. Other storylines for the character have seen her open her own garden nursery, suffer marital difficulties, been targeted by a stalker and become Mayor of Erinsborough. Sonya was killed off as a part of a cancer storyline and her final episode was broadcast on 5 March 2019. Morey later made an uncredited cameo appearance on 1 January 2020. The character has been popular with viewers, and Morey has earned two Logie Award nominations, and three nominations for Best Daytime Star at the Inside Soap Awards. Casting Morey successfully auditioned for the role of Sonya and joined the cast in June 2009 in a recurring capacity. Morey made her first screen appearance as Sonya during the episode broadcast on 14 August 2009. The show's producers noticed the chemistry between Moloney and Morey's characters, and Morey was promoted to the regular cast a year later. A writer for Holy Soap said that viewers would be seeing a lot more of Sonya in the future. In February 2011, Morey signed a new contract to stay with Neighbours for another year. She told the Daily Star, \\"It was great to know I'd be working for a year ‚Äì from a struggling actor's point of view that is fantastic. But it also meant there is a year's worth of developing the character because she will become part of the bigger storylines instead of supporting.\\" Morey added that she was loving her time on the show and the people she was working with. Morey took maternity leave from the show in 2014 after giving birth to her first child. Sonya made a temporary departure to visit her son in the United States. In July 2017, Morey announced that she was pregnant with her second child. Producers chose not to write her pregnancy into the show, and Sonya made a temporary departure during 29 January 2018 for Morey's maternity leave. Development =Characterisation= Sonya is an animal lover who has previously worked for Guide Dogs Victoria. She is good-hearted and relished her role as a trainer. A writer for Network Ten's Neighbours website described Sonya as having a shady past and wanting to set up a new life for herself in Erinsborough. Sonya used to have alcohol, drug and gambling addictions, but she has worked hard to overcome them. Morey told a reporter from Channel 5 that she is similar to Sonya morally and ethically, plus they both want the best for the people they love. However, Sonya occasionally goes about things in a way in which Morey said she did not understand. The actress also struggled to understand the place of darkness that Sonya has been in too. When asked if her character could ever escape her past, Morey replied \\"I don't think she will every truly escape her past because ultimately I don't think she should. If she doesn't have it there as a reminder and a good motivator to help her stay on track.\\" Morey revealed she would like to see Sonya reach her potential as a mother in the future. In an interview with a What's on TV journalist, Morey said viewers relate to Sonya because she is \\"pretty normal\\". The actress noted that Sonya is not glamorous and there is \\"something quite humbling about her.\\" Morey went on to say that Sonya's heart is usually in the right place and she always tries to do the right thing for the right reasons. Of her character's development, Morey explained \\"She has become a lot more self-assured and she has learnt to trust herself again. I think when we first met her, she was quite closed off and didn't want to let anyone in fear of hurting them.\\" Sonya decides to give up her job as a guide dog trainer to buy and turn the community garden into a garden nursery. Morey told Jason Herbison from Inside Soap that she thought that the garden was symbolic of what Sonya is doing in her personal life. She explained \\"She made a lot of mistakes when she was younger. Now she just wants to plant beautiful things and watch them grow. She's very focused on that for now.\\" =Marriage to Toadfish Rebecchi= When Sonya is sent to check up on the progress of Toadfish Rebecchi's (Ryan Moloney) guide dog puppy, Rocky, she \\"soon found love\\" with the lawyer. Sonya and Toadie began a relationship and Moloney thought that Sonya was perfect for Toadie. Moloney quipped \\"She's funny and a little bit zany and really accepting and loving as well.\\" However, their romance comes to an end when Toadie tells Sonya that he has got back together with his ex-girlfriend, Stephanie Scully (Carla Bonner). A Sunday Mail reporter said Sonya was \\"simply heartbroken\\" and \\"devastated\\" after she was told about Toadie and Steph's relationship. However, she is unaware that Toadie is pretending to be in love with Steph to help cover up the fact she is carrying Daniel Fitzgerald's (Brett Tucker) child. Toadie becomes torn when Sonya tells him she loves him, but he carries on the lie. Of the situation, Moloney said \\"Toadie is in love with Sonya, but he's had to give up the chance to follow his heart. Now we see that he really wants nothing more than to be able to tell her he loves her and that he wants to be with her ‚Äì but he just can't.\\" Toadie realises that Sonya still loves him when he notices she is still wearing the bracelet he gave her. Sonya tells him that she is not ready to take it off. Sonya tries to move forward with her life and starts dating David Foster (Ben Ridgwell). However, she is struggles with her feelings for Toadie. Morey told TV Week that Sonya is \\"completely in love with Toadie, but she's trying to move on as best she can ‚Äì and that's where David comes into the picture.\\" Despite only being with David for three weeks, Sonya agrees to move to Perth with him. Morey said that Sonya believes she has nothing left keeping her in Erinsborough and she wants a change of scenery. Sonya chooses not to tell Toadie that she leaving, so Lucas Fitzgerald (Scott Major) tells him instead. Steph then comes by and tells Sonya that Toadie still loves her and that their relationship is sham. Steph asks Sonya to stay if she wants more information and Steph later tells her that the baby is not Toadie's. Sonya is left shocked and relieved at the same time. Sonya agrees to wait for Toadie. When Steph's secret is eventually revealed, Sonya and Toadie start their relationship over. Morey told Herbison that due to how the relationship between Sonya and Toadie developed, it gave them a sense of history when they did finally get together. Morey revealed that she would like to see Sonya and Toadie have children together in the future. She told a Press Association reporter, \\"I would love it. I think there is so much richness in Toadie and Sonya going on that journey together which lends itself to humour, sadness, more drama. Cross fingers they will go down that path.\\" Morey also hoped Sonya could be happy in the future. Morey told the official UK Neighbours website in July 2011 that Sonya and Toadie would start to have some excitement and fun again following all the drama, but they would have to deal with a few issues first. When the subject of marriage comes up, Sonya and Toadie realise that they have different views about it. Morey explained, \\"At this point Sonya wants to get married for the wrong reasons, and Toadie doesn't want to get married for the wrong reasons. They haven't both independently reached a healthy perspective on it. She wants to do it for security to protect Callum, and he doesn't want to do it... He feels it will jinx [their relationship], because his other marriages have gone that way.\\" Morey added that Sonya and Toadie have reached a point in their relationship where they have to make some big decisions, which could change the direction they move in. In January 2012, Moloney told Sue Yeap from The West Australian that while Sonya was the one for Toadie, he did not think they would be getting married anytime soon. The actor believed Toadie did not need a piece of paper and a ring to tell the world that Sonya was \\"the love of his life.\\" Sonya and Toadie begin planning to have a baby and Morey stated that she was \\"deliriously broody\\" at the prospect of her character becoming pregnant. She admitted that she loved the journey the couple had been on as they try to start a family, although she thought Sonya might go over the top with the situation, which would make it hard for those around her. She also believed that Sonya and Toadie would make \\"wonderful parents\\" because of the amount of thought they had put into the decision. She added that Toadie has always wanted a child of his own, while Sonya wanted to make up for her past problems. After failing to fall pregnant, Sonya gave up hope that she and Toadie would naturally conceive a child and she went through a \\"mourning process\\", before trying to move on. During a blood drive, Sonya was asked to take a pregnancy test and it came back positive. Both Sonya and Toadie were shocked, but delighted to learn that they were expecting a baby. A few months later, Toadie asked Sonya to marry him. He had initially been reluctant to propose, as he had had bad luck with weddings in the past. Moloney commented to an Inside Soap columnist, \\"He's scared that marriage will change things between him and Sonya, as they're perfect at the moment.\\" Toadie realised that with a baby on the way, he could not waste time and proposed to Sonya at the nursery. Sonya, who was \\"excited, but also a little bit shocked\\" accepted straight away. =Sister and secret= Jade (Gemma Pranita) was introduced in 2010. In late 2010, Sonya's younger sister, Jade (Gemma Pranita) was introduced to the serial. A reporter from the Herald Sun stated that Jade's arrival would see her expose \\"a dark secret\\" held by Sonya. Before Jade arrived in Erinsborough, she and Sonya had been estranged from each other for seven years. Jade contacts Sonya out of the blue, leaving her \\"mortified\\" by the call. Pranita told Jackie Brygel from TV Week, \\"Sonya's response is 'Why are you calling me? Why now? Don't come anywhere near me!' But Jade keeps ringing and harassing Sonya and then rocks up on her doorstep.\\" Pranita explained that Jade and Sonya share a bad history and that Jade has been holding on to one of Sonya's darkest secrets, which the people in Sonya's life know nothing about. The actress thought that Jade's appearance would \\"completely rock the boat\\", especially as she has the potential to cause trouble for her sister and expose her for lying to everyone. During an interview with a Channel 5 journalist, Morey revealed that the last time the siblings saw each other, they were at their grandmother Hilda's (Maureen Edwards) home and Sonya was in \\"a very bad place\\". This causes Sonya to think that Jade might be in town to get some form of revenge. The sister's relationship is initially \\"rocky\\" and Sonya tries to get rid of Jade, before she can meet Toadie and his son, Callum. However, she runs out of time and Jade quickly realises that Callum is actually the child Sonya gave up to be raised by their grandmother. Jade demands an explanation and then urges her sister to tell the truth. However, after Jade sees how happy Sonya is, she becomes \\"fiercely supportive\\" of her. Pranita noted \\"It's almost the Mitchell sisters against Ramsay Street.\\" Morey told Jason Herbison that she could not have asked for a better pretend sister in Pranita, adding that they had become good friends off-screen. Jade's reappearance in Sonya's life precipitated the revelation that Sonya is Callum's biological mother. Morey admitted that she was \\"shocked\\" and \\"stunned\\" when the producers told her about the development for her character. She questioned how the storyline would come together, since there had never been any indication that Sonya was Callum's mother before. Morey explained \\"Initially, I thought, 'How could this work ‚Äì Sonya being Callum's mum?', but then I realised it does work. All of a sudden, it creates even more depth and complexity to Sonya and the decisions she's made and her motivations for things like forgiving Toadie for his and Steph's sham marriage. There's this whole other layer.\\" Morey called the storyline \\"phenomenal\\" and noted that it would change everything that viewers thought they knew about why Sonya became part of Toadie and Callum's lives. Morey researched how other people had reacted to similar situations and came to realise that the pieces fall into place, despite it being \\"a leap.\\" She stated that Sonya had entered Callum's life, not to get him back, but to see if he was okay. However, she then fell in love with Toadie. The actress believed that it was not Sonya's intention to \\"plant herself in their lives\\", but it just happened. When she was asked how Callum does not remember Sonya, Morey explained that Sonya had fallen in with a bad crowd, was an alcohol and drugs addict and was suffering from post-natal depression. She chose to leave Callum with her grandmother, Hilda, so she could get herself cleaned up. Hilda then had everything related to Sonya removed from the family. Callum was around four or five when Sonya left and Morey believed that he had blocked out the bad memories of her. Morey commented that Sonya's relationship with Callum would have been \\"a love-hate one\\" because she was only 16 when she had him. He would have become like a younger brother to her rather than a son. Executive producer Susan Bower defended the storyline when asked why Sonya and Callum's history had been rewritten. She told an Inside Soap columnist that they worked with the character's established backgrounds and found reasons and motivations for Sonya to act the way she did. Bower admitted that the only discrepancy that could be pointed out was Callum's age. When Hilda dies, Sonya becomes concerned that her secret will be revealed when Callum attends the funeral. However, Callum chooses to say goodbye to his great-grandmother privately, much to Sonya's relief. Callum then explains that he wants to find his real mother and tell her that he hates her, which devastates Sonya. She tells her sister that she cannot tell him the truth now as she cannot handle him looking at her, knowing what she did. Callum steps up his investigation into the identity of his mother and is injured in an accident while looking for clues. At the hospital, he recalls a memory about his mother and realises that she is Sonya. Toadie then \\"angrily orders\\" Sonya to leave. Of the revelation, Morey said \\"For Toadie, it's a betrayal to both him and his son. He's angry, but his initial priority is to make Callum number one.\\" Morey quipped that filming the scenes was \\"exhausting.\\" The actress also explained that Toadie's reaction to finding out that Sonya is Callum's real mother was one of devastation, he has to question whether Sonya ever loved him or was only with him to get Callum. Morey told a writer for What's on TV that it had been \\"fun\\" to see Sonya change when she could finally be a mother to Callum. She added that Sonya would probably struggle with everything that happened with Callum, but she should remember that she has been forgiven. =Marriage problems= A year after their wedding, Sonya and Toadie's marriage came under strain. Toadie accused Sonya of neglecting their relationship, when she began to get involved in their friends' problems. Morey said, \\"Sonya and Toadie have been together for five years and, unfortunately, little things are starting to niggle ‚Äì which doesn't mean they're over, or anything like that, but it's definitely causing a few issues for them.\\" Morey explained that life had slowed down for Sonya and Toadie and they were getting into \\"the nitty gritty\\" of their marriage, which was challenging for them both. Things became worse for Sonya and Toadie when Jacob Holmes (Clayton Watson) kissed Sonya. Morey told Kirsty Nutkins from the Daily Express, \\"The kiss with Jacob was the first big crack in their relationship. Even though Sonya didn't have feelings for him, it hurt Toadie a lot.\\" The actress said it was uncomfortable to play out the scenes involving her character's marital problems. She also found it frustrating, as she knew Sonya in particular was not learning from her mistakes. Morey thought Sonya and Toadie could benefit from better communication, and from Sonya telling people to seek help from other sources, like a counsellor. She also thought Toadie could help his wife out more often, especially if the person she was helping was his friend too. Shortly after Naomi Canning (Morgana O'Reilly) was introduced, it was revealed that she would set her sights on Toadie. Morey doubted Toadie would have an affair, as it was not in his nature. She also said Sonya questions certain things that Naomi does, but then lets them go when she is proved wrong. Morey commented that Sonya and Toadie's relationship was vulnerable to Naomi. Morey told a What's on TV writer that Naomi undermines the things Sonya does, making \\"small wounds into big gaping bloody cuts.\\" The actress added that she enjoyed working with O'Reilly, but their characters would never be friends as they were complete opposites. Sonya later learned that Naomi had kissed Toadie, and she was angry with her for lying and trying to undermine her marriage. When Naomi and Sonya came face-to- face, Naomi provoked Sonya by blaming her for the troubles in her marriage, causing Sonya to \\"impulsively\\" slap Naomi. Morey admitted that she was uncomfortable about having to slap O'Reilly, as they are friends in real life. Sonya later apologised to Naomi, but told her to stay away from her family. Morey called it a \\"pretty satisfying\\" moment. =Hate mail campaign and stalker= In October 2014, it was announced that Sonya would become the focus of a hate mail campaign storyline. Toadie received the first anonymous letter which made \\"damaging insinuations\\" about Sonya and her past. He initially kept the letter from Sonya, deciding that he would investigate on his own. Toadie ruled out Naomi and wondered if someone from Gamblers' Anonymous might have it in for Sonya. When Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) also received a letter about Sonya, Toadie then told Sonya the truth leaving her \\"horrified\\" and fearing for her safety. Sonya's paranoia about the situation caused her to forgo her plans to take Nell trick-or-treating for Halloween and leave a GA meeting abruptly. When Patricia Pappas (Katerina Kotsonis) berated Toadie for his involvement in her son's court case, Brennan suspected Patricia could be the letter sender, but she too was ruled out. Shortly after, Sonya was falsely accused of child abuse when Nell had a fall at the park, while Sonya looked away for a brief moment. Sonya was then visited by a Department of Human Services worker after a formal complaint was made against her. The situation made Sonya realise that she was being watched by the same person who sent the letters. Sonya's stalker was revealed to be her old school friend Erin Rogers (Adrienne Pickering). Erin broke into Sonya's home and admitted to sending the letters because she blamed Sonya for introducing her to drugs, which ruined her life. Morey commented, \\"Erin represents what could have happened to Sonya if she didn't get out of that life.\\" After Erin was arrested, Toadie warned her to stay away from his family, while Sonya felt so guilty she paid Erin's bail. Sonya then vowed to make amends with Erin and helped her get a job at The Waterhole, but after Brennan exposed Erin as Sonya's stalker, she lost the job leaving Sonya \\"to pick up the pieces once again\\". On Christmas Day, Sonya began thinking about how Erin would be spending the holiday, which prompted Brennan to find her the address of Erin's squat. Sonya visited Erin with some food, but Erin told her to leave as she did not need her charity. Sonya then made it clear that she would be there for Erin when she needed her. =Ovarian cancer and departure= In early December 2018, Neighbours confirmed a character was being killed off in 2019, saying that \\"the devastating death of a fan favourite will change the lives of their neighbours ‚Äì and us ‚Äì forever.\\" Speculation about Morey's imminent departure from the serial began shortly after when her co-star Sharon Johal (Dipi Rebecchi) posted a video to her Instagram account appearing to show Morey's leaving party. Baker (Callum) and Pranita (Jade) were also seen on set increasing the speculation that Sonya would be the departing character. On 11 January 2019, Duncan Lindsay of the Metro reported that Sonya would die in an upcoming storyline, after being left with weeks to live. Later that month, it was confirmed Sonya would be diagnosed with ovarian cancer ahead of her departure. Sonya is admitted to Erinsborough Hospital after collapsing, and the doctors initially suspect that it has something to do with her recent poisoning. However, a large cyst is found on her ovary and a gynaecologist suggests that it should be removed quickly. Sonya is also told that she may have to undergo a hysterectomy, which leaves her \\"devastated\\", as she had hoped to have another child. Morey said that Karl treats Sonya and does not think her condition is serious, however, an oncologist then informs Sonya that the cyst was cancerous and it has already spread. Of Sonya's reaction, Morey explained: \\"It's a truly surreal moment for Sonya. Everyone's been putting on a brave face and only focussing on the positive. But then she receives the diagnosis ‚Äì and no amount of sugar- coating will get away from the fact that this is a very serious situation.\\" Morey also pointed out that her character's chances of beating stage-four cancer were \\"extremely slim\\", but Sonya is willing to try whatever treatments are available. Morey hoped the storyline would raise awareness of ovarian cancer, adding that it was Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month in the UK in March. Morey revealed that it was not her choice to leave the serial, but once she knew Sonya was being written out, she asked for her to be killed off, knowing that she would never leave Toadie and the children. Morey explained, \\"I didn't want her to go off the rails again, if you make someone unlikable because they're leaving you end up not caring they're going! I feel death was the only option in order to be true to them.\\" The character's last scenes aired on 5 March 2019. Sonya is informed that her cancer has spread and her condition quickly deteriorates during a road trip with her family. As she watches her children at the beach, Sonya dies in her husband's arms. On 7 December 2019, it was announced that Morey would make a cameo appearance. Sonya appears in a video message that Toadie watches as he spends his first New Years without Sonya. The message then inspires Toadie to honour Sonya and find more ways of bringing her values into Nell and Hugo's lives. The character's appearance aired on 1 January 2020. Storylines Sonya comes to Ramsay Street to assess the progress of a guide dog puppy being trained by Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) and his son Callum Jones (Morgan Baker). Sonya offers to give Toadie and Callum some private lessons to help with the puppy's training. Toadie asks Sonya out, but she turns him down, telling him she does not date clients. Toadie comes to believe Sonya is romantically involved with his friend Lucas Fitzgerald (Scott Major), when he sees them together, but Sonya admits that she is actually Lucas's sponsor at Gamblers Anonymous. Sonya agrees to go on a date with Toadie and they begin a relationship. However, it comes to a sudden end when Toadie tells Sonya that he is back together with Stephanie Scully (Carla Bonner). Sonya tells Toadie she loves him, but he rejects her. Lucas uses Sonya to make Toadie jealous, causing a brief rift between them. Sonya relapses and visits a racing track, before going to a club and getting drunk. Libby Kennedy (Kym Valentine) takes her home to Lucas and Sonya tells him she will sort herself out. Sonya decides to move to Perth with her new boyfriend David Foster. Steph then tells Sonya that her upcoming wedding to Toadie is a sham to cover up the fact that she is carrying Libby's estranged husband Dan's child. Sonya agrees to wait for Toadie, and they begin dating again. Sonya moves in with Toadie and Callum. Her sister, Jade Mitchell (Gemma Pranita), comes to visit, but Sonya is keen to get rid of her. Jade meets Callum and realises that he is Sonya's son, that she left with their grandmother. Callum tries to find his mother. After an accident, Callum is rushed to hospital and he realises that Sonya is his mother. Sonya confirms it and a devastated Toadie asks her to leave. Callum begins meeting Sonya in secret and she tells him that she left him with her grandmother because she was in a bad place due to her addictions. Sonya's ex-boyfriend and Callum's father, Troy Miller (Dieter Brummer), comes to Ramsay Street. Sonya introduces Callum to Troy and she tries to reconnect with Toadie. Troy kisses Sonya, but she realises she still loves Toadie and they get back together. Troy reacts badly and he punches Toadie, shouts at Callum and tries to force Sonya into having an emotional breakdown. He leaves shortly after. Sonya decides to buy the community gardens and turn the land into a garden nursery. Sonya unsuccessfully applies for a loan, but Toadie begins working for a law firm and gets the loan, allowing Sonya to buy the gardens. Sonya and Toadie decide to bring their plans to try for a baby forward, but worry when Sonya does not become pregnant. Sonya and Toadie undergo fertility tests and Rhys Lawson (Ben Barber) tells them that Toadie has a low sperm count. After almost giving up on the idea of having a baby, Sonya takes a standard pregnancy test before donating blood, and Rhys tells her she is pregnant. Troy returns to town and moves next door to Sonya and Toadie. He tries to gain custody of Callum and takes an intervention order out on Toadie, causing Sonya to collapse from the stress. When Troy refuses to let Callum leave his house, Sonya and Jade force their way in and Troy locks them inside. When Sonya and Jade escape, Troy falls and sustains a head injury. After he discharges himself from hospital, Troy goes to Callum's school and is confronted by Sonya and Toadie. Troy leaves, but falls unconscious at the wheel of his truck and dies. Toadie's cousin, Georgia (Saskia Hampele), moves in and bonds with Sonya over the baby. Toadie proposes to Sonya and she accepts. Sonya goes into labour two weeks early and due to complications, she has to be rushed to hospital, where she gives birth to Nell (Scarlett Anderson) via caesarean section. Sonya undergoes surgery for internal bleeding, before she is reunited with her daughter. Toadie's mother, Angie (Lesley Baker), arrives for Nell's naming day and instantly clashes with Sonya, who feels that Angie is criticising and undermining her parenting skills. Sonya asks Angie to leave when she catches her going through her bag looking for drugs. Angie returns for the wedding and she and Sonya make up. After Sonya and Toadie marry, Sonya sees Mason Turner (Taylor Glockner) and Robbo Slade (Aaron Jakubenko) shortly after they tried to rob Lassiter's. A gas bottle explodes at the reception, destroying the marquee and knocking Sonya unconscious. She suffers a fractured skull and a bleed on the brain, which lead to memory loss. Toadie organises a surprise vow renewal ceremony and Sonya gets her memory back. Sonya is delighted when her estranged uncle Walter (Chris Haywood) turns up in Erinsborough. However, she is devastated when Walter steals money from the nursery and reveals that he is an impostor. Sonya struggles to cope with the deception and becomes scared of relapsing. Robbo returns to Erinsborough and he intimidates Sonya. Robbo spikes her drink; however, it is Toadie who drinks it. Robbo dies after being involved in a hit-and-run and Toadie becomes the primes suspect for a while, as he cannot recall his movements that night. When Toadie is sued by Eric Edwards (Paul O'Brien), Sonya befriends his wife, Mandy (Emelia Burns). Sonya arranges a dinner, so they can talk and work things out, but she ends up fighting with Toadie. However, this causes Mandy and Eric to realise they need to sort out their problems and Eric drops the lawsuit. Sonya begins an online blog about parenting and is soon contacted by Jacob Holmes (Clayton Watson), who is raising his son, Elliott (Ryder Smyth) alone. Jacob leaves Elliott with Sonya and she fears he will never come back. She struggles to cope with two young children, especially when Elliott becomes sick. Toadie contacts Elliot's maternal grandparents despite Sonya's objections. Jacob soon returns for Elliott. When Jacob kisses Sonya, she ends their friendship. When Toadie discovers the kiss, he feels betrayed and Sonya recognises that Toadie no longer trusts her, putting strain on their marriage. Sonya becomes the convenor of the local Gambler's Anonymous support group and meets Patricia Pappas, her neighbour Chris's (James Mason) mother. She learns that Patricia does not know that Chris's boyfriend Hudson Walsh (Remy Hii) is serving time in prison for murder, and inadvertently reveals Chris's secret to her. Soon after Patricia is arrested for theft to fund her gambling, leading to Chris discovering her secret. Chris is angry with Sonya, calling her a hypocrite. However, Chris come to terms with his mother's problem, and turns to Sonya for advice. Sonya spends less time at home with Toadie, Callum and Nell, causing strain on her marriage. Toadie hires Naomi Canning as his personal assistant and her mother, Sheila (Colette Mann), warns Sonya to be wary of her daughter. Sonya reluctantly allows Callum to go to the United States after he wins an overseas scholarship. The problems in the Rebecchi marriage continue when Sonya starts spending all of her time helping Mark Brennan and Bailey Turner (Calen Mackenzie) through their issues. Sonya and Toadie have a big argument in public, and Sonya goes away with Nell. On her return, she learns Naomi kissed Toadie and Sonya slaps her during a confrontation. She later apologises to Naomi. Sonya and Toadie agree to cut back on their work, so that they can spend more time together, and eventually convinces Naomi to return to working for Jarrod as he loses customers. Sonya supports Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) when he falls ill with depression, allowing him to visit the nursery to be at one with nature. When Paul recovers, he uses the nursery, and Sonya, as a marketing campaign to try to get himself re-elected as mayor; however, the nursery is trashed by Jayden Warley (Khan Oxenham) in revenge as his mother Sue Parker (Kate Gorman) is the stand-in mayor. Paul convinces Sonya not to press charges against Jayden and Sonya realises that Paul did this to blackmail Sue into standing down as mayor. Toadie tells Sonya that he has received poison pen letters about her and she becomes fearful of going out. Mark suspects that Patricia might be sending the letters, as Toadie is representing Josh Willis (Harley Bonner), who attacked her son. Sonya dismisses Mark's suspicions. After Nell has an accident at the local park, Sonya receives a visit from the DHS after someone makes a formal complaint against her. Sonya then realises someone is watching her. When she worries that another complaint to the DHS could result in Nell being taken into care, Sonya is tempted to drink some wine. Sonya's stalker breaks into her bedroom where Nell is sleeping and hits Mark over the head. The stalker breaks in again and is revealed to be Sonya's former best friend Erin Rogers. Erin blames Sonya for introducing her to drugs and the subsequent loss of her daughter to the DHS. Sonya feels guilty and pays Erin's bail. She also offers her a job at her nursery and gets her into a drug treatment program. Sonya lends Erin money to buy a dress, but she suspects Erin is meeting a drug dealer and follows her. She is assaulted and her bag is stolen. Erin later tells Sonya she did not buy drugs. Erin's daughter Cat (Maleeka Gasbarri) visits Erin and Sonya reveals that Erin was present at Cat's cricket games; Cat becomes upset as Erin did not reveal herself and leaves, causing Erin to fallout with Sonya again. Cat later returns and things go much better, but the pressure gets to Erin and she flees. Cat asks to live with Toadie and Sonya, but Sonya helps her reconcile with her foster mother instead. Sonya befriends Amy Williams (Zoe Cramond) and invites her and her son to stay at Number 30. Toadie and Sonya decide to enlist Nell in childcare when she begins playing up, believing she does not get enough attention. During an open day for the new childcare centre, Toadie falls from an out-of-control bouncy castle and is left paralysed. Sonya struggles as Toadie refuses to accept how serious his injury is. She asks Amy to continue living with them to help with Nell while Toadie recovers. Angie briefly visits to help out, but soon leaves after clashing with Sonya. The neighbours organise a benefit for Toadie, which raises over $6000. Sonya is bitten by a Redback spider at the nursery, causing her to pass out. After receiving treatment, Sonya recovers at home. She and Toadie consider using the benefit fund to pay their bills, but discover the money has been taken. Amy's ex-husband Liam Barnett (James Beck) later reveals he stole the money. Steph returns to Erinsborough and Sonya is uncomfortable having her around. However, after she learns Paul was gaslighting Steph, Sonya invites her to move in with her and Toadie. Steph's ex-girlfriend Belinda Bell (Nikki Shiels) believes Steph has feelings for Toadie, and she threatens Toadie. When Sonya learns that Belinda is the theatre nurse during Toadie's spinal surgery, she interrupts the operation, causing a complication that leaves Toadie infertile. Worried that Steph is a threat to her marriage, Sonya offers Belinda a job as Toadie's nurse. Belinda quits after one day and Sonya's insecurities are exposed. She and Toadie begin attending counselling. When Sonya learns the community centre is being demolished, she asks for Tim Collins's (Ben Anderson) help as he is interim Mayor, but he double-crosses her. Sonya runs against Tim for Mayor and wins. On becoming mayor she is confronted by protesters, Paige among them, against removal of trees for the laying of a pipeline. Sonya hires Aaron Brennan (Matt Wilson) as her assistant, but after he allows Tom Quill (Kane Felsinger) to view council documents, Sonya is forced to fire him. Tom begins threatening the Rebecchis, taking a photograph of Nell and breaking into the house. The Lassiter's boiler room explodes, and Sonya realises Toadie is trapped under the rubble. He is soon rescued. Sonya's uncle Walter (Greg Stone) arrives in town to reconcile with her. Sonya decides to read the accident report about her parents' deaths and learns Walter was there that night. He then reveals that he is her father, and that he was arguing with his brother about telling her the truth when the car crashed. Sonya also learns that she has a half-sister called Zoe Mitchell (Nicola Billie Gullotti), who has leukaemia and requires a bone marrow transplant. Sonya takes a blood test, but is found not to be a match, so Walter suggests that Nell be tested and Sonya goes through with it behind Toadie's back. Nell is a match, but Toadie and Sonya refuse to let her go through with the transplant. Callum is also found to be a match and Zoe and Walter leave to continue her treatment. Sonya supports the creation of bike lanes in Erinsborough, but she faces opposition from Clive West (David Bradshaw). Susan is also upset at the decision as money will be taken away from the high school's remedial program. Someone vandalises Sonya's vehicle, a brick is thrown through Toadie's law office window, and snakes are let loose in the street, leading Sonya to think that she is being targeted by Clive. However, it turns out Steph is the target of a stalker. Sonya offers to be a surrogate for Steph and Mark, and they agree. The surrogacy is made public by Tim Collins in a bid to force Sonya to quit as mayor. When Steph is told that she has no viable eggs, Sonya offers to donate hers. The fertilisation goes ahead, but Steph changes her mind and asks Sonya to take the morning after pill, but Sonya refuses. Days later, she learns she is pregnant. Toadie's former wife, Dee Bliss (Madeleine West) turns up in Erinsborough to reconnect with Toadie. She also introduces him to their daughter Willow (Mieke Billing- Smith). Sonya and Toadie's marriage is strained while Toadie spends time with Dee and Willow. Steph ends her relationship with Mark, and he tells Sonya that he will raise the baby by himself. Sonya worries about Mark's friendship with Elly Conway (Jodi Anasta), and she threatens to keep the baby. During her second ultrasound, Sonya and Mark learn the baby is a girl, but when a possible abnormality is detected, they are advised to have an amniocentesis, which comes back clear. Sonya becomes stressed about the amount of time Toadie is spending with Dee, while he becomes jealous of her closeness with Mark. When Dee and Willow go to London, Sonya tells Toadie to follow them. She starts to feel ill and Mark stays over with her. Nell tells Toadie that Mark is in bed with Sonya, resulting in an argument during a video chat. Toadie fails to close the chat window properly and Sonya sees him having sex with Dee. Mark then reveals that Dee is actually a woman named Andrea Somers, and Willow is not Toadie's daughter. Sonya's contractions begin and she is rushed to the hospital, where she has a miscarriage. When Toadie returns home, Sonya tells him that she wants to separate and he moves in with the Kennedys. Sonya becomes depressed and struggles to cope with her grief. She and Mark kiss, but Sonya realises that she just wants to remain friends. Sonya breaks her sobriety and begins drinking again. When Steph realises what is going on, she offers her help. While dropping Nell off to Toadie, Sonya sees a letter from a lawyer concerning divorce proceedings. Toadie tells her his mother, Angie, contacted the lawyer. Sonya also decides to contact a lawyer, but Toadie tells her he does not want a divorce. Sonya continues to drink and she collapses at a public event. Toadie seeks full custody of Nell and Tim Collins urges her to step down as Mayor. However, when her drinking problem is reported in the press, she is sacked. Sonya turns to gambling, but loses her money. She later remembers that she was the one who crashed Amy's ute into the Erinsborough Backers' injuring Piper Willis (Mavournee Hazel) and David Tanaka (Takaya Honda) and makes a confession to the police. She is then charged. Attempting to get her life back together, she leaves Erinsborough for rehab, but Toadie soon learns that she has checked herself out. She gives Toadie power of attorney and asks him to sell the nursery to pay Leo Tanaka (Tim Kano). Toadie finds Sonya in a caravan with a former drinking friend. He asks Callum to come home and talk with Sonya, who agrees to return home. Sonya and Toadie reconnect via emails. Toadie represents Sonya at her trial, where she receives 240 hours community service. Sonya tells Toadie that she is not ready for them to get back together. But when Sonya thinks that Toadie has feelings for Amy, she agrees to see a relationship counsellor. Toadie begins seeing his own counsellor, who Sonya recognises as her former rehab counsellor and crush Sam Feldman (Alex Tsitsopoulos). When Sam admits his feelings for her, Sonya informs him she only loves Toadie. Toadie asks Sonya to meet him at Lassiters Lake if she wants to reconcile, but she falls from a chair and is knocked unconscious. Susan finds her and she is taken to hospital, where she and Toadie reconcile. Sonya and Toadie both decide that they want another child. Sonya receives a message from Jade, telling her that Zoe's cancer has returned. Sonya leaves for Los Angeles, taking Nell with her, on what was to be her first day of school. When Sonya returns from Los Angeles, she wants to track down Andrea to recover the money she defrauded them of and she does not want another baby. She later decides that she does want another baby and begins IVF, when Sindi Watts arrives with Andrea's baby, Hugo, and says that Toadie is the father. This is confirmed by a DNA test. Sonya is persuaded to abandon the IVF program and raise Hugo as her own. She initially finds bonding with Hugo difficult but welcomes him into the family with a naming day. Sonya asks Paul to find Andrea, and his private detective finds her in a psychiatric facility in Hobart. Visiting Andrea in secret, Sonya discovers that Andrea believes she actually is Dee Bliss, and does not recognise either Hugo or Willow. Toadie is hurt when he discovers Sonya's secretive behaviour, but agrees to keep away from Andrea. The Rebecchis pay for Andrea's psychiatric care, stretching them financially. Sonya hires Alice Wells (Kerry Armstrong) as Nell and Hugo's live-in nanny and grows close to her, unaware that Alice is lacing her food with strong painkillers. As her dependency on the drug grows, Sonya's behaviour alerts suspicion from Toadie and her friends. She falls severely ill when Alice withdraws the painkillers; she nearly relapses but resists with Toadie's help. Infuriated by Sonya's strength, Alice poisons her with pesticide, revealing herself as Andrea's mother. She leaves Sonya for dead at the roadside, but Willow uncovers her grandmother's con and warns Toadie. Together, they rescue Sonya and she pulls through. After being discharged from hospital, Sonya experiences stomach pain for several weeks and ultimately collapses. Doctors find a large cyst on her ovary ‚Äì unrelated to Alice's poisoning ‚Äì and after she has it surgically removed, Sonya is told she has stage four ovarian cancer, which has already spread to her gastrointestinal tract, liver and brain. With Toadie's support, Sonya hides her diagnosis from her friends and family. Karl later tells her that she has a 25% chance of surviving for the next five years. Sonya begins intensive chemotherapy but the situation becomes more stressful when Andrea sends lawyers to assess the Rebecchis' suitability as Hugo's guardians. Sonya uses her cancer as leverage and convinces Andrea to sign full custody of Hugo to Toadie. Sonya eventually reveals her diagnosis to her family and friends, who organise a fundraiser for her at The Waterhole. Callum returns from San Francisco to support Sonya, after Dipi contacts him. Jade also returns to Erinsborough, and the family plan a trip to a beach house. Sonya confides in Toadie's brother Shane Rebecchi (Nicholas Coghlan) that when she went to Tasmania, Andrea told her about a man who mistook her for a woman called Karen, as they look alike. Andrea believes that he was talking about the real Dee. Shane agrees that Sonya should keep it from Toadie for the moment. Sonya's oncologist informs her that the chemotherapy has had no effect on the tumour in her brain, and she only has days to live. Sonya experiences blurred vision and numbness in her hands on the road trip to the beach house. She tells Toadie that she does not have long left. As they make their way down to the beach, they stop and sit down to watch their children playing. Sonya decides that she does not want them seeing her in her current state. She says that she knows that heaven exists because it is with Toadie and her family, and after telling him she loves him, Sonya dies in Toadie's arms. Reception For her portrayal of Sonya, Morey was nominated for Best Daytime Star at the 2011 and 2012 Inside Soap Awards. She received a nomination in the same category in 2017. In 2019, Morey received nominations for the Gold Logie Award for Most Popular Personality on Australian Television and Most Popular Actress. Holy Soap said Sonya's most memorable moment was when she attended Toadie's sham wedding to Steph and agreed to wait for him. The Daily Record called Sonya an \\"extremely nice girl\\" and said she had become popular with fans. The official UK Neighbours website said Sonya and Toadie's relationship had \\"seen more drama than most\\" and Bridget McManus of The Age branded Sonya a \\"clucky girlfriend.\\" In July 2011, Morey's co-star Jackie Woodburne said Sonya was one of the best characters that had come into Neighbours in a long time. Alan Fletcher, who plays Woodburne's on screen husband, also praised Sonya and said the audience had really taken to her. The actor told What's on TV \\"They absolutely adore her. In a short space of time, Sonya was established as one of the favourite Neighbours characters. I think a lot of that has to do with the marvellous onscreen relationship that Eve has with Ryan Maloney (Toadie) and Morgan Baker (Callum).\\" Holly Byrnes of the Herald Sun called Sonya \\"a beautiful woman.\\" While Byrnes' colleague, Dianne Butler, said \\"Sonya's wondering how long they have to wait before they face the fact there could be something wrong with her. I say no time at all, Sonya. Which explains why she's gardening on her own in those opening credits.\\" When Sonya and Toadie found out that they were expecting a baby, Claire Crick from All About Soap commented \\"At last ‚Äì Sonya and Toadie are having a baby‚Ä¶ and we can't think of a soapy couple who deserve such happy news! Not only do we totally love Toadie and Sonya (it's so refreshing seeing a couple who are happy together!), but they're also so clearly desperate to be parents.\\" Crick later praised Sonya for helping Lucas and Vanessa realise their feelings for each other, saying \\"thank goodness for her meddling ways!\\" A Newcastle Herald reporter noted that Sonya \\"has seen more drama than most\\". The character's final storyline and death episode received positive attention from critics and viewers. Conor McMullan of Digital Spy wrote a feature on the \\"most moving moments\\" from the ovarian cancer storyline. On the scene in which Sonya learned her cancer had spread, McMullan said \\"In frank and honest scenes, Neighbours didn't shy away in hitting Sonya, or viewers, with the tough facts ‚Äì and the scene was much stronger for it. Despite being told that the cancer had spread through her body, Sonya's resolute determination to beat it broke our hearts.\\" McMullan said the \\"father-daughter bond\\" between Sonya and Karl was \\"very sweet and real\\", and would be missed, as would her friendship with Lucas which was one of the \\"most memorable in recent years\\". After seeing Sonya's final episode, Laura-Jayne Tyler from Inside Soap wrote that Morey and Moloney's performances were \\"sublime, and deserve to win every award going.\\" A campaign to secure Morey a nomination for the Logie Award for Most Popular Actress began on social media shortly after the episode aired.

This syndrome was first described in 2005.  Presentation  The clinical phenotype of 3q29 microdeletion syndrome is variable. Clinical features can include mild/moderate intellectual disability with mildly dysmorphic facial features (long and narrow face, short philtrum and a high nasal bridge). Of the 6 reported patients, additional features including autism, ataxia, chest-wall deformity and long, tapering fingers were found in at least two patients. A review of 14 children with interstitial deletions of 3q29, found 11 who had the common recurrent 1.6Mb deletion and displayed mental retardation and microcephaly. The variability of phenotype is underscored by the report on a 6 and 9/12 year-old male patient with a de novo chromosome 3q29 microdeletion identified by BAC array comparative genomic hybridization assay (aCGH), with accompanying normal 46,XY high-resolution chromosome analysis. The patient has language-based learning disabilities and behavioral features consistent with diagnoses of autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) of the inattentive type. He also displays some other features previously associated with chromosome 3q29 microdeletion such as an elongated face, long fingers, and joint laxity. Most notably the patient, per formal IQ testing, was not found to have frank intellectual disability as has been previously reported among patients with chromosome 3q29 terminal deletion, but rather the patient has demonstrated an average full-scale IQ result. This report further expands the phenotypic spectrum to include the possibility of normal intelligence as corroborated by formal, longitudinal psycho-educational testing. The presence of two homologous low copy repeats either side of the deletion break-point suggests that non-allelic homologous recombination is the likely mechanism underlying this syndrome.  Genetics The microdeletion, around 1.6 million base pairs, in length and encompasses 5 known genes and 17 uncharacterised transcripts. These include transferrin receptor, choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase A, RNF168, serine/threonine-protein kinase, nuclear cap-binding protein complex, melanotransferrin, DLG1 and D-beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase Research Research on the risk for developing schizophrenia in Ashkenazi Jews and other populations showed that 3q29 microdeletion syndrome leads to a significant higher rate of schizophrenia. In addition, a deletion at 3q29 was found to confer a striking increase to the odds of developing schizophrenia in a study of copy number variants and their effect on that disease.

It was established in 1850. History The Archaeological Museum in Krak√≥w is the oldest archaeological museum in Poland. It was founded as the Muzeum of Antiquity, by a group of intellectuals and academics who belonged to the Krak√≥w Scientific Society (Towarzystwo Naukowe Krakowskie, TNK) during the Partitions of Poland. The foreign rule in the Austrian Partition prohibited the existence of Polish patriotic organizations except for the learning societies like the TNK; which in turn, set up a museum as centre of Polish socio-cultural activities. The TNK society which sponsored the museum foundation, existed in Krak√≥w since 1816. It has formed its own Division of Art and Archeology in 1848. The founding act was signed on 18 February 1850 by the Committee which included such notable personalities as Director of the Jagiellonian Library, J√≥zef Muczkowski (President of the Committee), Karol Kremer (member of the Sejm of the Free City of Krak√≥w: Rzeczypospolita Krakowska), Wincenty Pol (Professor UJ, poet and explorer), as well as Teofil ≈ªebrawski (architect, city inspector). A series of documents including the museum mission statement were written for the administration, specifying the priority of the museum in obtaining archaeological finds from private donors. The first museum exhibit opened in 1857 at the Lubomirski Palace at 17 ≈õw. Jana Street. The collection originated mostly from private donations by numerous noble Polish families, including the statue of Zbruch Idol (≈öwiatowid ze Zbrucza), which is the symbol of the museum. The museum is divided into five major permanent exhibitions: Gods of the Ancient Egypt, Prehistoric Pottery, The Garden of Ceramics, The Prehistory and Early Middle Ages of Lesser Poland, and The Carts of Bronocice, which includes the Bronocice Pot (3635‚Äì3370 BC) - a ceramic vase incised with the earliest known image of what may be a wheeled vehicle.

Those objects are not only of sentimental, historical or artistic value but, above all, they allow us to take a closer look at the most important values present in life and ordained ministry of this great saint, as well as his rich teachings, which are still valid and important in the present days. For cardinal Wojty≈Ça, the idea of creating an Archdiocesan Museum in Krakow as a place which would present the spiritual, historical and artistic legacy of the Archdiocese of Krakow was a truly crucial matter. According to his wish, collection of sacral art from the 13th to 20th century, including paintings, sculpture and handcrafts from the region of the Archdiocese of Krakow, can be seen in the Museum.

The National Museum in 1904 created an ethnographic department and a permanent ethnographic exposition in the Cloth Hall was opened. There were collections of, among others, Seweryn Udziela, Stanis≈Çaw Witkiewicz, and Tadeusz Estreicher. In 1910, the Society of the Ethnographic Museum was founded, which took over the collection from the National Museum. In 1911 a separate branch was established at Studencka St., with Seweryn Udziela as its director. A year later, the collections were exported to Wawel. After World War II, the seat of the Ethnographic Museum changed its place to Plac Wolnica 1, and after some time also to 46 Krakowska Street. The main building is the former Town Hall of Kazimierski.

Among the various exhibits of pharmaceutical technology are weights of less than one gram as patented by Marian Zahradnik, the shape of which indicates their importance. Such weights were adopted in the countries of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and later across Europe, and are still used with minor modifications. Another interesting invention is an electrical device to sterilize prescriptions. It was to protect the pharmacist from infection by germs transferred on the prescription.

Early career  Originally from the San Francisco Bay Area, Corey attended Los Gatos High School. During this time, she formed theJOEband, a classic rock cover band that won Clear Channel's, 98.5 KFOX Last Band Standing competition in 2007, jumpstarting a career of live performances around the Bay Area.theJOEband MySpace In 2008, Corey entered University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), and was a member of Alpha Phi. During which time she was the lead singer of SoulMinded, a soul/reggae/funk band that performed around the Santa Barbara and Los Angeles areas. With SoulMinded, she performed at UCSB's Extravaganza 2010 ‚Äì an all-day music festival for the Santa Barbara community. Corey played alongside Drake, Chromeo, and Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros.UCSB Extravaganza 2010 article In 2009, Corey recorded her debut EP in Los Angeles. The seven-song release featured notable producers and songwriters including The Stereotypes (Natasha Bedingfield/Mary J. Blige). The EP featured the track \\"Truth\\" and was a hit on social media.  Currently  On August 25, 2015, Corey released her new album All That written and co produced by Jordan Corey. In August 2015, the single \\"Focus\\" from the new album was released along with the official music video. In 2014 Jordan Corey began a long journey of writing and co producing her new album \\"All That\\". The new music is a sonic fusion of soul and movement which she calls \\"future soul\\".Pulling inspiration from contemporaries like Blood Orange, Jessie Ware, and Frank Ocean, with an unmistakably pop/soul twist infusing 90s R&B; and great lyricism. Her newest project, All That, It is a playful reflection of life, love, and purpose. Jordan Corey is currently featured as a New \\"Artist to Watch\\" by iHeartRadio. In 2011, Corey began working on her next release with producer Jason Hollis and songwriter/producer Dan Dixon (Dropsonic). The resulting tracks would become her second EP, Do Me Wrong. Corey co-wrote all five of the EP's original songs‚Äîthe sixth track being a reinvented version of The Rolling Stones classic, \\"Miss You.\\" Recorded in Los Angeles' Sonora Recorders, using vintage and analog gear, Corey's second release features a distinctive 1960s‚Äì1970s soul sound with an indie twist. Do Me Wrong also features saxophonist Lon Price (The Rolling Stones/Leonard Cohen) and was mixed by five-time Grammy Award winner, Matt Hyde. Do Me Wrong was released in March 2012. The single \\"Tonight\\" from the EP hit Hot AC Radio the week of April 22, 2012. Invigorated by the response to Do Me Wrong, Corey/Dixon/Hollis went back into the studio to work on a follow-up record. The three-song EP was initially written as part of a larger work, but after recording the tracks, Corey felt that the songs stood on their own; each a pillar in her artistic voyage. On March 12, 2013, Corey took to the Internet asking fans to financially back her sophomore release, Trilogy. The project would be a 3-song EP accompanied by a 3-part video series that Corey would conceptualize and produce with a team of filmmakers. 30 days later, Corey independently raised over $16,000 for the projects' release and began an almost yearlong journey.

It is situated on Wawel Hill, between the Vasa Gate and the former seat of the Castle Seminary, in the Cathedral House, which is composed of two 14th-century buildings. History In 1906, Cardinal Jan Puzyna established the diocesan museum in the buildings. In 1975, cardinal Karol Wojtyla, future Pope John Paul II, decided to transform it into a cathedral museum, where objects from the Wawel Cathedral would be kept and exposed. On 28 September 1978, on the 20th anniversary of the day he was anointed as bishop, Cardinal Karol Wojty≈Ça ceremonially opened and blessed the Wawel Cathedral Museum, which was to be his last official duty at Wawel before he became pope. Exposition The cathedral museum exhibition presents the most precious objects which were kept in the cathedral treasury: the oldest Polish regalia, handicraft, clothes, paintings and sculptures, as well as the memorabilia related to Pope John Paul II. The exhibits are organized according to their historical and artistic value, and exhibited in four rooms: * Royal Room - houses the regalia and gifts of the Polish monarchs for the cathedral: St Maurice's spear, the coronation mantle of king Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski, the coronation sword of king Augustus III, the Golden Rose of queen Maria Josepha, the crown, sceptre and orb of king Casimir IV, the rationale of bishops of Krak√≥w. * Cathedral Threasury Room (11th ‚Äì 16th century) - houses the collection of objects donated to the cathedral by kings, bishops and aristocrats: the silver box (known as a ‚ÄúSaracene-Sicilian case‚Äù), the chasuble donated by Cracow Voivode, Piotr Kmita, objects found in the grave of bishop Maurus (silver chalice and patena, a golden ring, a bone bead and a lead tablet), Hedwig glass as well as the slabs from an 11th-century stone building. * Cathedral Threasury Room (17th ‚Äì 20th century) ‚Äì monstrance of bishop Stanis≈Çaw DƒÖmbski, mitre of Bishop Andrzej Lipski, the collection of chalices of bishops of Krak√≥w, crosier of Bishop Adam Stefan Sapieha, sabre, portrait and orders of Prince J√≥zef Poniatowski. * Papal Room ‚Äì contains the memorabilia related to Pope John Paul II: papal clothes (cassocks, biretta, zucchetto and sash), mitre handed over to the cathedral during the papal visit in Poland, armchair used by John Paul II and Benedict XVI during their visits in the cathedral, goblet made of coconut and silver (presented to the Museum by cardinal Wojtyla, on its opening day).

During a pole's winter, it lies in continuous darkness, chilling the surface and causing the deposition of 25‚Äì30% of the atmosphere into slabs of CO2 ice (dry ice). When the poles are again exposed to sunlight, the frozen CO2 sublimes. These seasonal actions transport large amounts of dust and water vapor, giving rise to Earth-like frost and large cirrus clouds. The caps at both poles consist primarily of water ice. Frozen carbon dioxide accumulates as a comparatively thin layer about one metre thick on the north cap in the northern winter, while the south cap has a permanent dry ice cover about 8 m thick. The northern polar cap has a diameter of about 1000 km during the northern Mars summer, and contains about 1.6 million cubic km of ice, which if spread evenly on the cap would be 2 km thick. (This compares to a volume of 2.85 million cubic km (km3) for the Greenland ice sheet.) The southern polar cap has a diameter of 350 km and a thickness of 3 km. The total volume of ice in the south polar cap plus the adjacent layered deposits has also been estimated at 1.6 million cubic km. Both polar caps show spiral troughs, which recent analysis of SHARAD ice penetrating radar has shown are a result of roughly perpendicular katabatic winds that spiral due to the Coriolis Effect. The seasonal frosting of some areas near the southern ice cap results in the formation of transparent 1 m thick slabs of dry ice above the ground. With the arrival of spring, sunlight warms the subsurface and pressure from subliming CO2 builds up under a slab, elevating and ultimately rupturing it. This leads to geyser-like eruptions of CO2 gas mixed with dark basaltic sand or dust. This process is rapid, observed happening in the space of a few days, weeks or months, a rate of change rather unusual in geology‚Äîespecially for Mars. The gas rushing underneath a slab to the site of a geyser carves a spider-like pattern of radial channels under the ice. In July 2018, Italian scientists reported the discovery of a subglacial lake on Mars, below the surface of the southern polar layered deposits (not under the visible permanent ice cap), and about across, the first known stable body of water on the planet. Freezing of atmosphere Research based on slight changes in the orbits of spacecraft around Mars over 16 years found that each winter, approximately 3 trillion to 4 trillion tons of carbon dioxide freezes out of the atmosphere onto the winter hemisphere polar cap. This represents 12 to 16 percent of the mass of the entire Martian atmosphere. These observations support predictions from the Mars Global Reference Atmospheric Model‚Äî2010.  Layers  Both polar caps show layered features, called polar-layered deposits, that result from seasonal ablation and accumulation of ice together with dust from Martian dust storms. Information about the past climate of Mars may be eventually revealed in these layers, just as tree ring patterns and ice core data do on Earth. Both polar caps also display grooved features, probably caused by wind flow patterns. The grooves are also influenced by the amount of dust. The more dust, the darker the surface. The darker the surface, the more melting. Dark surfaces absorb more light energy. There are other theories that attempt to explain the large grooves. ;Layers in northern ice cap, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program ESP 044934 2670icecaplayers.jpgLayers exposed. 44934 2670icecapclose.jpgClose view of layers exposed.

Each winter the ice cap grows by adding 1.5 to 2 m of dry ice. In summer, the dry ice sublimates (goes directly from a solid to a gas) into the atmosphere. Mars has seasons that are similar to Earth's, because its rotational axis has a tilt close to our own Earth's (25.19¬∞ for Mars, 23.44¬∞ for Earth). During each year on Mars as much as a third of Mars' thin carbon dioxide (CO2) atmosphere \\"freezes out\\" during the winter in the northern and southern hemispheres. Scientists have even measured tiny changes in the gravity field of Mars due to the movement of carbon dioxide. The ice cap in the north is of a lower altitude (base at -5000 m, top at -2000 m) than the one in the south (base at 1000 m, top at 3500 m). It is also warmer, so all the frozen carbon dioxide disappears each summer. The part of the cap that survives the summer is called the north residual cap and is made of water ice. This water ice is believed to be as much as three kilometers thick. The much thinner seasonal cap starts to form in the late summer to early fall when a variety of clouds form. Called the polar hood, the clouds drop precipitation which thickens the cap. The north polar cap is symmetrical around the pole and covers the surface down to about 60 degrees latitude. High resolution images taken with NASA's Mars Global Surveyor show that the northern polar cap is covered mainly by pits, cracks, small bumps and knobs that give it a cottage cheese look. The pits are spaced close together relative to the very different depressions in the south polar cap. Both polar caps show layered features that result from seasonal melting and deposition of ice together with dust from Martian dust storms. These polar layered deposits lie under the permanent polar caps. Information about the past climate of Mars may be eventually revealed in these layers, just as tree ring patterns and ice core data do on Earth. Both polar caps also display grooved features, probably caused by wind flow patterns and sun angles, although there are several theories that have been advanced. The grooves are also influenced by the amount of dust. The more dust, the darker the surface. The darker the surface, the more melting. Dark surfaces absorb more light energy. One large valley, Chasma Boreale runs halfway across the cap. It is about 100 km wide and up to 2 km deep‚Äîthat's deeper than Earth's Grand Canyon. When the tilt or obliquity changes the size of the polar caps change. When the tilt is at its highest, the poles receive far more sunlight and for more hours each day. The extra sunlight causes the ice to melt, so much so that it could cover parts of the surface in 10 m of ice. Much evidence has been found for glaciers that probably formed when this tilt-induced climate change occurred. Research reported in 2009 shows that the ice rich layers of the ice cap match models for Martian climate swings. NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's radar instrument can measure the contrast in electrical properties between layers. The pattern of reflectivity reveals the pattern of material variations within the layers. Radar produced a cross-sectional view of the north-polar layered deposits of Mars. High-reflectivity zones, with multiple contrasting layers, alternate with zones of lower reflectivity. Patterns of how these two types of zones alternate can be correlated to models of changes in the tilt of Mars. Since the top zone of the north-polar layered deposits‚Äîthe most recently deposited portion‚Äîis strongly radar-reflective, the researchers propose that such sections of high-contrast layering correspond to periods of relatively small swings in the planet's tilt because the Martian axis has not varied much recently. Dustier layers appear to be deposited during periods when the atmosphere is dustier. Research, published in January 2010 using HiRISE images, says that understanding the layers is more complicated than was formerly believed. The brightness of the layers does not just depend on the amount of dust. The angle of the sun together with the angle of the spacecraft greatly affect the brightness seen by the camera. This angle depends on factors such as the shape of the trough wall and its orientation. Furthermore, the roughness of the surface can greatly change the albedo (amount of reflected light). In addition, many times what one is seeing is not a real layer, but a fresh covering of frost. All of these factors are influenced by the wind which can erode surfaces. The HiRISE camera did not reveal layers that were thinner than those seen by the Mars Global Surveyor. However, it did see more detail within layers. Radar measurements of the north polar ice cap found the volume of water ice in the layered deposits of the cap was 821,000 cubic kilometers (197,000 cubic miles). That's equal to 30% of the Earth's Greenland ice sheet. (The layered deposits overlie an additional basal deposit of ice.) The radar is on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. SHARAD radar data when combined to form a 3D model reveal buried craters. These may be used to date certain layers. In February 2017, ESA released a new view of Mars's North Pole. It was a mosaic made from 32 individual orbits of the Mars Express. South polar cap The south polar permanent cap is much smaller than the one in the north. It is 400 km in diameter, as compared to the 1100 km diameter of the northern cap. Each southern winter, the ice cap covers the surface to a latitude of 50¬∞. Part of the ice cap consists of dry ice, solid carbon dioxide. Each winter the ice cap grows by adding 1.5 to 2 meters of dry ice from precipitation from a polar-hood of clouds. In summer, the dry ice sublimates (goes directly from a solid to a gas) into the atmosphere. During each year on Mars as much as a third of Mars' thin carbon dioxide (CO2) atmosphere \\"freezes out\\" during the winter in the northern and southern hemispheres. Scientists have even measured tiny changes in the gravity field of Mars due to the movement of carbon dioxide. In other words, the winter buildup of ice changes the gravity of the planet. Mars has seasons that are similar to Earth's because its rotational axis has a tilt close to our own Earth's (25.19¬∞ for Mars, 23.45¬∞ for Earth). The south polar cap is higher in altitude and colder than the one in the north. The residual southern ice cap is displaced; that is, it is not centered on the south pole. However, the south seasonal cap is centered near the geographic pole. Studies have shown that the off center cap is caused by much more snow falling on one side than the other. On the western hemisphere side of the south pole a low pressure system forms because the winds are changed by the Hellas Basin. This system produces more snow. On the other side, there is less snow and more frost. Snow tends to reflect more sunlight in the summer, so not much melts or sublimates (Mars climate causes snow to go directly from a solid to a gas). Frost, on the other hand has a rougher surface and tends to trap more sunlight, resulting in more sublimation. In other words, areas with more of the rougher frost are warmer. Research, published in April 2011, described a large deposit of frozen carbon dioxide near the south pole. Most of this deposit probably enters Mars' atmosphere when the planet's tilt increases. When this occurs, the atmosphere thickens, winds get stronger, and larger areas on the surface can support liquid water. Analysis of data showed that if these deposits were all changed into gas, the atmospheric pressure on Mars would double.Phillips, R., et al. 2011. Massive CO2 ice deposits sequestered in the south polar layered deposits of Mars. Science: 332, 638-841 There are three layers of these deposits; each is capped with a 30-meter layer of water ice that prevents the CO2 from sublimating into the atmosphere. In sublimation a solid material goes directly into a gas phase. These three layers are linked to periods when the atmosphere collapsed when the climate changed.Bierson, C., et al. 2016. Stratigraphy and evolution of the buried CO2 depositin the Martian south polar cap. Geophysical Research Letters: 43, 4172-4179 A large field of eskers exist around the south pole, called the Dorsa Argentea Formation, it is believed to be the remains of a giant ice sheet.Head, J, S.

Res.-Planet, 106 (E6), 12275-12299. This large polar ice sheet is believed to have covered about 1.5 million square kilometers. That area is twice the area of the state of Texas.List of U.S. states and territories by areaScanlon, K., et al. 2018. Icarus: 299, 339-363. In July 2018 ESA discovered indications of liquid salt water buried under layers of ice and dust by analyzing the reflection of radar pulses generated by Mars Express. =Swiss cheese appearance= While the north polar cap of Mars has a flat, pitted surface resembling cottage cheese, the south polar cap has larger pits, troughs and flat mesas that give it a Swiss cheese appearance.Thomas,P., M.

Observations made by Mars Orbiter Camera in 2001 have shown that the scarps and pit walls of the south polar cap had retreated at an average rate of about 3 meters (10 feet) since 1999. In other words, they were retreating 3 meters per Mars year. In some places on the cap, the scarps retreat less than 3 meters a Mars year, and in others it can retreat as much as 8 meters (26 feet) per Martian year. Over time, south polar pits merge to become plains, mesas turn into buttes, and buttes vanish forever. The round shape is probably aided in its formation by the angle of the sun. In the summer, the sun moves around the sky, sometimes for 24 hours each day, just above the horizon. As a result, the walls of a round depression will receive more intense sunlight than the floor; the wall will melt far more than the floor. The walls melt and recede, while the floor remains the same.Hartmann, W. 2003. A Traveler's Guide to Mars. Workman Publishing. NY NY. Later research with the powerful HiRISE showed that the pits are in a 1-10 meter thick layer of dry ice that is sitting on a much larger water ice cap. Pits have been observed to begin with small areas along faint fractures. The circular pits have steep walls that work to focus sunlight, thereby increasing erosion. For a pit to develop a steep wall of about 10 cm and a length of over 5 meters in necessary.Buhler, Peter, Andrew Ingersoll, Bethany Ehlmann, Caleb Fassett, James Head. 2017. How the martian residual south polar cap develops quasi- circular and heart-shaped pits, troughs, and moats. Icarus: 286, 69-9. The pictures below show why it is said the surface resembles Swiss cheese; one can also observe the differences over a two-year period.

Image:South Pole Terrain.jpgHiRISE view of south polar terrain. =Starburst channels or spiders= Starburst channels are patterns of channels that radiate out into feathery extensions. They are caused by gas which escapes along with dust. The gas builds up beneath translucent ice as the temperature warms in the spring. Typically 500 meters wide and 1 meter deep, the spiders may undergo observable changes in just a few days.Hansen, C, A. McEwen and HiRISE Team. December 2007. AGU Press Conference Spring at the South Pole of Mars. One model for understanding the formation of the spiders says that sunlight heats dust grains in the ice. The warm dust grains settle by melting through the ice while the holes are annealed behind them. As a result, the ice becomes fairly clear. Sunlight then reaches the dark bottom of the slab of ice and changes the solid carbon dioxide ice into a gas which flows toward higher regions that open to the surface. The gas rushes out carrying dark dust with it. Winds at the surface will blow the escaping gas and dust into dark fans that we observe with orbiting spacecraft. The physics of this model is similar to ideas put forth to explain dark plumes erupting from the surface of Triton. Research, published in January 2010 using HiRISE images, found that some of the channels in spiders grow larger as they go uphill since gas is doing the erosion. The researchers also found that the gas flows to a crack that has occurred at a weak point in the ice. As soon as the sun rises above the horizon, gas from the spiders blows out dust which is blown by wind to form a dark fan shape. Some of the dust gets trapped in the channels. Eventually frost covers all the fans and channels until the next spring when the cycle repeats. Image:Star burst channels.jpgStar burst channels caused by escaping CO2 gas, as seen by HiRISE. Such channels, also called spiders, may be about 500 m in diameter and 1 m deep. Image:Spider Early in Spring.JPGSpider on the second Martian day of spring, as seen by HiRISE.

On the 90 E side, the deposits rest on a major basin, called Prometheus. Some of the layers in the south pole also show polygonal fracturing in the form of rectangles. It is thought that the fractures were caused by the expansion and contraction of water ice below the surface. Polar ice cap deuterium enrichment Evidence that Mars once had enough water to create a global ocean at least 137 m deep has been obtained from measurement of the HDO to H2O ratio over the north polar cap. In March 2015, a team of scientists published results showing that the polar cap ice is about eight times as enriched with deuterium, heavy hydrogen, as water in Earth's oceans. This means that Mars has lost a volume of water 6.5 times as large as that stored in today's polar caps. The water for a time may have formed an ocean in the low-lying Vastitas Borealis and adjacent lowlands (Acidalia, Arcadia and Utopia planitiae). Had the water ever all been liquid and on the surface, it would have covered 20% of the planet and in places would have been almost a mile deep. This international team used ESO‚Äôs Very Large Telescope, along with instruments at the W. M. Keck Observatory and the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility, to map out different isotopic forms of water in Mars‚Äôs atmosphere over a six-year period.

He deals mainly with microhistory,researches and documents the changes that have taken place in the former suburbs of Krakow since their integration into the city, organizes temporary exhibitions devoted to the history of Krakow's suburbs, Krakow customs and outstanding representatives of the local community. A regular resident and caretaker of the Zwierzyniecki House is a black cat W≈Çodek. The headquarters of the branch is a typical suburbs tenement house from the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. It was built by the animal mason Jan Florczyk. From July to August 1912, the apartment upstairs lived with the family of Russian revolutionary Vladimir Ulianov, better known as Lenin. To commemorate this fact, in 1970 the first Lenin apartment in Krakowwas opened here. Since 1980, the building was owned by the Lenin Museum in Krak√≥w and functioned as its subsidiary, where, next to the permanent exhibition (Lenin's apartment), temporary exhibitions on the workers' movement and the proletarian revolution were presented. In 1990, after the decommissioning of the Lenin Museum, the building was transferred to the Museum of Krakow. Initially, the object served as a museum warehouse, and in the years 1991-1996 some of the halls were used by the Ewa DemarczykTheatre. In 1996, as a result of an agreement between the Museum and the District Council of the VII Zwierzyniec and the Zwierzyniecki Circle of Friends of All Arts, founded by the Krakow painter Halina Cie≈õli≈Ñska-Brzeska,the Zwierzyniecki Artistic Salon, a branch of the Krakow Museum, was established here. The branch, in cooperation with the Circle of Friends, organized temporary exhibitions, which presented paintings, graphics and sculptures of local artists. In 2009, the formula of the branch was changed, art exhibitions were abandoned in favor of exhibitions presenting the history of Zwierzy≈Ñc. Since 2014, the branch has been called Zwierzyniecki House. The permanent exhibition presents the interior of an apartment in a suburb of Krakow at the beginning of the 20th century. Temporary exhibitions tell about the history of Krakow's suburbs, ancient traditions and specific urban folklore. The branch organizes historical meetings and lectures as well as educational activities for children. Cyclically organizes cultural events related to the pre-city traditions: Easter Stop Emaus,during which there is a competition for the most beautiful emaus tree, in the octave of Corpus Christi meeting with Lajkonik - Konik Zwierzyniecki and joint caroling at the Christmas tree dressed in toys made by children. Zwierzyniecki House also serves as an information point about Zwierzy≈Ñec,where you can buy guides, souvenirs and literature on the history of Krakow's suburbs published by the Museum of Krakow.

Founded in 1919, it was to act as the RAF's premier maritime arm. It was replaced by RAF Coastal Command on 14 July 1936. Beginnings of maritime aviation The Committee of Imperial Defence (CID) met in 1909 and decided the direction that British air power would take in the early 20th century. As far as maritime air power was concerned, First Sea Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill, an advocate of the aircraft in military affairs, pushed for development. Under pressure from the services, both the Royal Navy and British Army, the Government increased spending and the aviation budget rose from ¬£9,000 in 1909 to ¬£500,000 by 1913.Buckley 1998, p. 35. Before the First World War the Naval Staff had a positive attitude to aviation and their interests were to grow during the course of the 1914‚Äì1918 conflict. Before the war budgetary concerns and constraints had kept the development of aviation low. While the War Office attempted to save money by encouraging civilian aviators such as Samuel Cody to carry out research on their behalf, mostly in the field of reconnaissance and artillery co-operation, the Admiralty undertook its own trials with aircraft built to its own specifications. Between 1909 and 1911 the Navy took advantage of huge strides in military development of aircraft, having a significant tradition in research and development and a strong regard to long- range navigation and reconnaissance. Attention swiftly turned to ship-borne aircraft. Lieutenant Charles Rumney Samson achieved the feat of flying off a ship in December 1911. On 2 January 1912 Lieutenant H.A Williamson, a submarine officer, who held a Royal Aero Club Certificate submitted a paper dealing with ship-borne aircraft and their use for anti-submarine warfare (ASW). The Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) factored these aspects of naval air warfare into its development of naval aviation.Goulter 1995, pp. 2‚Äì3. The Navy was quick to begin experiments to see if surface vessels and submarines could be detected from the air, and started this research in July 1912 at Harwich and Rosyth. The use of wireless telegraphy and bomb dropping was well in advance of the War Office. The Royal Flying Corps (RFC) carried out bomb dropping experiments but refused to respond to Admiralty requests for collaboration, this was as late as August 1914.Goulter 1995, p. 3. The Naval Air Wing was renamed the RNAS officially in July 1914 and affirmed its independence from any other air service. The Admiralty introduced new types of aircraft and was enthusiastic about continuing development and striving to improve all aspects of aircraft design. They encouraged competition among private firms within the design parameters set by the Admiralty. The RFC, on the other hand, was reliant on the Royal Aircraft Factory and a lack of competition led to its equipment being over-standardised, inflexible in design approach which generally retarded progress in development. The RNAS was better prepared to carry out effective detection operations at sea and to conduct attacks using bombs against naval and land targets than the RFC.Goulter 1995, p. 8. =First World War= The Airco DH.6, the world's first ASW aircraft. The First World War was the first indication that a specialised maritime service was needed. During the War, the RNAS was primarily responsible for operations at sea. There was some confusion and debate over what type of aircraft would be suitable for multi-purpose operations. The Germans favoured airships which carried the advantages of long-range, heavy lift capacity for maritime missions while the British were debating the use of flying boats and seaplanes. Seaplanes were smaller, handier and cheaper, while flying boats were long-range but more expensive to build and operate. Operating aircraft over sea created problems. Few forces had the doctrine or capability to deployment their charges on effective sea operations despite manoeuvres involving aircraft being carried out in 1913. Still, aircraft were the mainstay of British maritime air power during the First World War. The most important contribution made by aviation in maritime operations was ASW defence. It was in this role that the Coastal Area and RNAS proved decisive during the Great War.Buckley 1998, p. 57. The submarine, in the shape of the German U-boat, and the aircraft, threatened the status quo of maritime warfare, threatening to displace the battleship as the leading maritime weapon and the cornerstones of naval supremacy. For the British, this meant their vulnerable trade routes in the Atlantic Ocean could be threatened by submarines, and later aircraft. By 1916, after the Battle of Jutland, the Germans were forced to concede that the Imperial German Navy's surface fleet could not challenge the strength of the Royal Navy on the high seas, so great faith was placed in the U-boat to strangle British supply lines in the Atlantic. The U-boats achieved great success in the sinking of Merchant vessels. In 1916 Admiral John Jellicoe claimed that the Germans could achieve victory in the Atlantic and force Britain to terms. The situation had become so bad, and militarily embarrassing, that the RNAS was ordered to concentrate solely on ASW.de la Fert√© 1960, p. 37. The turning point in the Atlantic came when escorted convoy systems came in, and merchant ships ceased sailing independently. Added to the system was aircraft, which although incapable of sinking a submarine, could render valuable psychological damage to U-boat crews and provide reconnaissance support which eliminated the U-boat threat.Buckley 1998, pp. 58‚Äì59. Despite the preference for flying boats and seaplanes, non-rigid blimps were also developed for anti-submarine patrol, the airships being built in a number of types, such as the SS class, the SST class, the SSP class, and the SSZ class. For flying boats, having started initially with Curtiss H boats bought from the United States, a modified version with a new, more seaworthy hull, was designed by RNAS Commander John Porte at the Seaplane Experimental Station at Felixstowe, and these aircraft became known as the Felixstowe F.1, Felixstowe F.2, and Felixstowe F.3, culminating in the Felixstowe F.5 of 1918. These, along with the blimps, were to make a valuable contribution to the protection of convoys.Goulter 1995, p. 14.Bowyer 1976, p. 10.de la Fert√© 1960, pp. 38, 44, 46, 75. Unrestricted submarine warfare made aircraft more important than ever in the war against the U-boats. By 1917 some 39 seaplane and 26 aircraft stations in Britain were all assigned to ASW operations. By December 1918 Britain's land-based coastal air forces was to have consisted of 353 flying boats and seaplanes and 920 land-based aircraft. The actual figures obtained were 305 and 382 respectively, but the clear intended expansion was an indication of air power's importance in trade and maritime defence.Buckley 1995, pp. 16‚Äì17. The figures and statistics for the coastal air force's impact on the U-boat fleet are disputed. Air Ministry figures claimed aircraft sighted 361 U-boats, attacked 236 and sank 10. It is unlikely that these figures are correct owing to the lack of capable offensive weapons.Buckley 1995, p. 17. But 'scarecrow' tactics did result in 96 sightings and 46 attacks.de la Fert√© 1960, pp. 39‚Äì40. U-boat crews, ignorant of aircraft's capabilities, were often forced to dive to escape observation and the attention of escorting destroyer screens which aircraft could direct for the kill. By 1918 only six convoys under escort by aircraft were attacked. One unnamed U-boat captain stated that \\"aircraft are our worst enemy\\". By the end of the war, British maritime air power was the most advanced in the world. Totalling a maximum of 3,000 aircraft (in all services), 55,000 aircrew and 12 aircraft handling ships, such as , , and , (later called aircraft carriers), air power had indicated what it was capable of in naval warfare.Buckley 1998, p. 58. With wireless and new aircraft such as the DH.6 now available, effective ASW missions could be carried out to the extent that aircraft became one of the core instruments in trade defence. Co- operation was also a breeding ground for tactical doctrine. But the surrender of Germany in November 1918 and mass demobilisation saw maritime aviation enter terminal decline for the next 20 years.Buckley 1995, pp. 17‚Äì18. By 1918 the RNAS had made far more contributions to long-range maritime air operations than either the RFC or its successor the RAF. In August 1914 the primary role for the maritime services was air defence from enemy attack, maritime reconnaissance, and ASW. ASW was considered the most important.Goulter 1995, p. 9. During the course of the coming war, the RFC would be mainly responsible for over-land operations, whilst the RNAS partook in all aspects of aerial warfare; strategic air defence, strategic bombing, ASW and fleet reconnaissance. Prior to the formation of the RAF in April 1918, maritime air operations were the responsibility of the RNAS. When the RAF was formed in April 1918, these operations became their domain. No. 10 Group RAF was given the task. In September 1919 RAF Coastal Area was formed as the Air Ministry's maritime arm.Goulter 1995, p. 46. After the formation of the Air Ministry and the RAF in April 1918, Coastal Area was subordinated to the new service but after the war received little encouragement or assistance from the Air Ministry for developing their service.de La Ferte 1960, p. 78. Ignoring past lessons Trenchard's struggle with the Admiralty resulted in the Air Ministry focusing more on strategic bombing, at the expense of ASW. Despite the fact that Britain had been caused severe difficulty by the U-boat campaign in the First World War, the Admiralty completely ignored the threat of the submarine until the late 1930s. The Royal Navy had founded its traditional defensive strength on the battleship, which was used to defend its waters and merchant fleets. This weapon had proved incapable of countering U-boats during the war. The Admiralty also ignored the damage caused by submarines and regarded them as ineffective defensive weapons. Given the disarmament of Germany there seemed little offensive threat. Even after the rise of Adolf Hitler and the birth of the Third Reich, there seemed little inclination or will toward rearming Britain's ASW air forces. To the contrary, the Anglo-German Naval agreement signed in June 1935, allowed the Germans to build German U-boat strength to one-third the displacement tonnage of the entire Royal Navy. In fact, the Germans had been developing submarines as early as 1922, despite the Treaty of Versailles and the banning of German military submarines.Bowyer 1979, pp. 14‚Äì15.Buckley 1995, p. 71. In the RAF, which in April 1918 was created by merging the RNAS and RFC, there still existed a place for maritime aviation. However the Navy expected the RAF to hand back the naval component after the war, which was reasonable considering the indifference the RAF displayed towards the submarine campaign in the 1914‚Äì1918 conflict. The failure of the RAF to do so started a power struggle between the Air Ministry on one side and the Admiralty and War Office on the other. The Air Ministry found its existence threatened and resolved to fend off the attempts of the Admiralty and War Office to break up the RAF and recover the RFC and RNAS by offering a cheaper, innovative alternative strategy for British air power in the future.Goulter 1995, p. 41. The RAF, under the direction of a new Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) Hugh Trenchard, adopted the strategic bombing theory of air power theorists such as Giulio Douhet, who argued that air power could win wars on its own, bypassing the need for armies and navies.Hyde 1977, p. 137.Franklin 2003, p. 103.Buckley 1995, pp. 92‚Äì93. Maritime aviation and the valuable lessons of the First European war were cast aside,Goulter 1995, p. 34. but crucially the appointment of Trenchard and his views, the removal of the weaker personalities such as CAS Frederick Sykes, and the continued support of Winston Churchill saved the Air Ministry from being disbanded.Goulter 1995, p. 36. In July 1923, Trenchard sent a memorandum to AOC (Air Officer Commanding) Central and AOC Coastal Areas advising them the strategic area offensive would be the dominating policy of future conflicts, and the Coastal services would take part in such operations. In doing so Trenchard stated openly that the goals of the Air Arm in no way conflicted with either the Army or Navy. This meant that maritime, or \\"auxiliary\\" squadrons would be radically reduced to allow the focus on land-based bombers and fighters for air attack and defenceHyde 1977, pp. 137‚Äì138. in line with the RAF's \\"non-specialisation policy\\".Buckley 1995, p. 97. In the 1920s, Bomber and Fighter forces were expanded while Coastal Area was continually downgraded.de la Fert√© 1960, pp. 74‚Äì75. By 1920 little remained of Coastal Area Air Forces.de la Fert√© 1960, p. 72. With Trenchard's policy unequivocal, for both military and political reasons, maritime aviation was in danger of being disbanded altogether. In April 1923 shore-based strength amounted to a solitary squadron (Nb: possibly No. 230 Squadron RAF). A year later all that remained was one flight of torpedo bombers. Only five squadrons of ship-borne aircraft remained by April 1924. These reductions were not uniform across the service. The percentage reduction of the maritime component was far greater than non-maritime elements. The ten year rule (that there would be no major war for ten years) laid down in 1919 ensured the RAF was to be reduced by 50 percent, which downsized the maritime squadrons on the RAF to just five percent of its November 1918 strength. The Air Ministry justified this reduction of maritime aviation in light of the 'breakthrough' in ASDIC (sonar), and underwater detection technology capable of locating submarines. As 86 percent of the First World War maritime air effort had been expended on ASW it argued it was reasonable for a reduction in maritime expenditure in light of the technology now available.Goulter 1995, pp. 38‚Äì40.Buckley 1998, p. 93.Buckley 1995, p. 79. The lack of ASW development during the 1920s and 1930s was not entirely the fault of the Air Ministry. The struggle between the Admiralty and Air Ministry continued into the 1930s and the Admiralty lost sight of why it was pursuing its own air service for the Navy. It became a matter of getting revenge over the RAF for its success in defeating earlier attempts to break up the Air Force. It succeeded in forcing the return of the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) from the RAF in 1937, but made no effort to develop ASW formations. Instead it continued to believe in the supremacy of the capital ship and the FAA was meant to be suitable for fleet actions only. It was a mistake most of the major powers, in particular the Imperial Japanese Navy, made during the lead up to the Second World War.Terraine 1989, pp. 181‚Äì182. Throughout the inter war period, the Admiralty had been continually sceptical of the aircraft's ability to sink a surface vessel. It was regarded as merely a reconnaissance technology. This resulted in a lack of development of a maritime strike force and lost another early opportunity to garner support for Coastal Area/Coastal Command.Buckley 1995, p. 38, 92. In summation First Sea Lord David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty proclaimed \\"[I] know of no operation in which the Navy and the Air [Service] have to co-operate in which the Navy would not play the more important role than the air service\\".Goulter 1995, p. 48. In 1936, almost 18 years after the end of the First World War, there was a major change in the Command structure of the RAF. Several Expansion Schemes were heading at such pace to rearm the British military in face of the Nazi threat that \\"Area\\" formations were now to be called \\"Commands\\". Fighter and Bomber Areas became Fighter and Bomber Command and Coastal Area was renamed Coastal Command. Its headquarters was located as Lee-on-Solent. Air Marshal Arthur Longmore, AOC Coastal Area oversaw the renaming and handed over command to Air Marshal Philip Joubert de la Fert√© on 24 August 1936.de la Fert√© 1960, p. 108, and Hyde 1977, pp. 385‚Äì386.

A well known face throughout numerous Manhattan art and club ‚Äòscenes‚Äô since the 1960s, she remains active in various aspects of popular culture. Biography Raised in Brighton, UK, Lazzarani moved to New York City at the age of 15 with her parents who opened and ran a successful pizzeria in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. At age 21, Lazzarani left the family home to attend Rhode Island School Of Design in Providence where she studied interior architecture before dropping out after just one year and returning to New York City. On her return, Lazzarani rented an apartment in Manhattan while working as a hostess at the famous Satin Dolls gentlemen‚Äôs club on Times Square. In 1964, Lazzarani met a young Lou Reed who introduced her to Andy Warhol, later to be a guiding light in her artistic career. With Warhol‚Äôs active encouragement, Lazzarani spent the remainder of the 1960s establishing herself as an avant-garde sculptor exhibiting regularly in the Stable Gallery where her notorious \\"The Despair Of Eve\\" exhibit almost forced the closure of the gallery by the New York Police Department after numerous complaints from gallery patrons. With the curators of the gallery agreeing to remove the piece immediately, Lazzarani staged her own protest against this perceived censorship in the following days by standing outside the main doors of The Stable, handcuffed, with an onion sack over her head and a placard round her neck saying ‚ÄòPrisoner Of Conscience‚Äô. The protest made the pages of numerous New York newspapers and art sheets. While continuing to sculpt and exhibit on a regular basis during the 1970s, Lazzarani became more interested in the performing arts and in particular music. A proficient piano player since childhood, Lazzarani played keyboards in The Artistics, an early incarnation of Talking Heads, and joined The Patti Smith Group on stage on numerous occasions at CBGB‚Äôs (where she supplemented her earnings by working as an occasional bartender). During the same period, Lazzarani became an important member of the Fluxus collective and engaged in numerous experimental music, sculpting and intermedia projects. Lazzarani remained in Manhattan until 1980 and continued to be an influential member of the New York scene, working variously as a door picker at Xenon nightclub, a DJ at Ruza Blue and Fab Five Freddie‚Äôs Negril club night and as artist in residence at The Camera Club gallery. Lazzarani returned to the UK in early 1980 with her British husband where she raised a family and adopted a more conventional lifestyle although her influence on the New York arts and music scene remains and can still be seen to this day. =Recent career= In June 2007, Lazzarani moved back to Manhattan following her divorce and began to exhibit again for the first time in over 30 years. As well as the challenging sculptures that Lazzarani has become known for, she also started to produce illustrations, screenprints and canvas art. Her work has been displayed in various locations including Brooklyn‚Äôs BRIC and the prestigious Bronx River Art Centre.

In November 2010 she became the first indigenous woman in Oaxacan politics, assuming the position of deputy of the National Action Party and president of the board of the local congress. In December of the same year Eufrosina was appointed as coordinator of indigenous affairs of the National Executive Committee of the PAN.http://www.milenio.com/node/600761 She is also the founder and director of the QUIEGO (Queremos Unir Integrando por Equidad y G√©nero en Oaxaca) Asociaci√≥n Civil, which promotes gender equality in Oaxaca. The starting-point for her fight for gender equality was that she was not permitted to participate in the municipal elections of her home town Santa Mar√≠a Quiegolani, for the single reason that she is a woman. This was a valid reason according to the usos y costumbres (local traditional laws). Because of Eufrosina Cruz‚Äôs fight, the constitution was later reformed to give women equal voting rights. On October 3, 2008 Cruz received the National Youth Award for her contribution to political culture, which was presented by President Felipe Calder√≥n. On Saturday, June 30, 2018, she was expelled from the PAN due to her opposition of Ricardo Anaya's 2018 presidential candidacy. Background and context Eufrosina Cruz comes from a tiny Zapotec village called Santa Mar√≠a Quiegolani in Oaxaca, Mexico, where Zapotec is the native language. Her life was as so many Zapotec women traditionally lived: getting up at 3 o‚Äôclock in the morning, gathering fuel, grinding maize, preparing tortillas, watching the children and cleaning the house. Most girls in such villages have little chance to complete grade school and are married at a young age to men chosen by their fathers.Deborah Bonello,http://blog.quiego.org/ , April 6th 2009. At the age of 11, Eufrosina Cruz decided that she didn‚Äôt want to live like this and left to study and learn Spanish.Daniel Blancas Madrigal, http://blog.quiego.org/ , December 26th 2007. She wanted a better future and eventually to help the other women that were discriminated against and marginalized. She graduated from college with a degree in accounting and obtained a job teaching in indigent communities. Here she served as community instructor for education and founded three high schools in indigenous municipalities.Daniel Blancas Madrigal, http://blog.quiego.org , December 26th 2007. After this she returned to her original village with the intention to change the lives of the women there. When she came back everything was still the same. Women were working hard but did not have equal rights. They were submissive to men and remained silent when men were around. Furthermore, women could not vote and did not have a voice in the law. Even so, Eufrosina ran for mayor of Santa Mar√≠a Quiegolani. This idea was revolutionary since the local political power was traditionally exclusively in the hands of men, and Eufrosina would have been the first female municipal president of Santa Mar√≠a Quiegoliani. It was a difficult struggle; most people didn‚Äôt want a woman in the government and spread rumors, ridiculed and threatened her.www.milenio.com/node/191393, March 29th 2009. =Usos y Costumbres Law= In 2007 she was eventually allowed in the election because the ruling family thought no one in town would dare to violate the tradition and vote for a woman. To everybody‚Äôs surprise Eufrosina Cruz won the elections (although the former authorities suggest otherwise). But this victory was not accepted and the election was annulled by the male authorities of the village.Mark Stevenson, http://www.csmonitor.com/, February 12th 2008.Diego Cevallos, http://ipsnews.net/ , March 12th 2008. Votes for Cruz and her application for mayor were literally thrown into the trash bin. The former mayor of the municipality said ‚Äúwomen do not exist here‚Äù and ‚Äúwomen were created to serve men, to cook and care for children, but not to govern the former mayor also thought \\"a women for MAYOR??!!.‚ÄùDaniel Blancas Madrigal http://blog.quiego.org , December 26th 2007. The indigenous authority based their reason for this on oral traditions that said that women are not allowed in political positions in the community. This was in a way valid, since the usos y costumbres (uses and customs) law in the Oaxacan constitution states that indigenous communities can elect and form parties according to their own traditions and customs. Oaxaca is the only state with this law, which is meant to respect the democratic practices of indigenous communities and protect their traditions. The communal authority is in this case stronger than the overall state politics.Constituci√≥n Pol√≠tica del Estado Libre y Soberano de Oaxaca, art. 25, AII. 418 out of 570 indigenous municipal laws are based on the usos y costumbres law; in 95 of these communities women did not have a voice or vote and were not permitted to make decisions for their community.http://www.e-consulta.com/, August 28th 2008. Successes of Eufrosina Cruz Eufrosina Cruz did not give up and addressed human rights organizations and state authorities. The matter was taken seriously and she gained national recognition. In consequence, a revolutionary event took place on the 18th of January, 2008. For the first time the former governor visited Eufrosina Cruz‚Äôs small community, to demand that women should be able to have better lives.Fransesc Relea, http://www.elpais.com/, February 12th 2008. In February 2008 Cruz filed a complaint to the Human Rights Commission. The Commission recognized the violation of her rights.Katia D'Artigues, http://blog.quiego.org/ , April 2nd 2009. As a result, the government introduced an initiative to amend Article 25 of the state constitution, which was approved by the state congress. Since the 21st of September 2009 on, Article 25 paragraph A section II of the Constitution of Oaxaca states the following: \\"La ley proteger√° y propiciar√° las pr√°cticas democr√°ticas en todas la comunidades del estado de Oaxaca, para la elecci√≥n de sus ayuntamientos, en los t√©rminos establecidos por el art√≠culo segundo, apartado A, fracciones III y VII de la Constituci√≥n Pol√≠tica de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos y 16 de la Constituci√≥n Pol√≠tica de Oaxaca; establecer√° los mecanismos para garantizar la plena y total participaci√≥n de la mujer en dichos procesos electorales, y el ejercicio de su derecho a votar y ser votada en condiciones de igualdad con el de los varones, y sancionar√° su contravenci√≥n.‚Äù (translation: \\"The law shall protect and facilitate democratic practices in all communities of the state of Oaxaca, for the election of their councils, in the terms established by Article Two, Section A, sections III and VII of the Constitution of the United Mexican States and 16 of the Constitution of Oaxaca, establish mechanisms to ensure the full involvement of women in these elections, and the exercise of their right to vote and be voted [for] on an equal footing with that of men, and punish its violation.\\") * March 2008: Eufrosina Cruz became founder and director of QUIEGO, AC (see below) * October 3, 2008: Eufrosina Cruz received the Premio Nacional de la Juventud (National Youth Award) in the category of contribution to the political culture from the President of M√©xico. * Cruz represented Mexico in the Iberoamerican conference on Gender and Development. * Cruz represented Mexico in the conferences of female leaders in Iberoamerica. =QUIEGO, A.C.= In March 2008, Eufrosina Cruz founded the non-profit association QUIEGO (Queremos unir, integrando por la equidad y g√©nero, a Oaxaca). The goal of this nonprofit is bringing attention to the situation of indigenous women, and ensuring that injustice such as what Eufrosina went through will not happen again.NOTIMEX, http://blog.quiego.org/ , March 31st 2009, and El Universal and BBMnoticias.com. QUIEGO stands for equality between indigenous men and women, and wants women to have equal rights in development, progress, and education. This will be done through promoting human rights, making the importance of freedom and being a woman clear, creating projects to improve women‚Äôs quality of life, and women‚Äôs rights workshops.BBMnoticias.com, http://blog.quiego.org/ , March 31st 2009. It will not only affect Quiegolani but also other indigenous communities in Oaxaca. * On December 6, 2008, QUIEGO organized the first forum in the history of the region to discuss the importance of women in community development and their right to access social programs. * Shortly after the forum, the Secretariat of Agrarian Reform supported them with six exclusive productive projects for women, including a community pharmacy, a bakery, and a sewing project. * In San Jose Quianitas, months later, women could vote and be candidates in their community. * In November 2010 another successful forum for the freedom of indigenous women was held, organized by Eufrosina Cruz and QUIEGO. In 2009 Eufrosina was approached by several political parties to participate in elections for the federal Chamber of Deputies. The president of QUIEGO rejected the proposals and urged these same parties to the creation of mechanisms for the participation of women in municipalities governed by custom.Eugenia Jimenez, http://blog.quiego.org/ , April 1st 2009. In November 2010, Eufrosina Cruz was nominated as a candidate for deputy of the local congress for the PAN. When Gabino Cu√© Monteagudo (PAN) won the elections, Eufrosina was elected to the office of presidenta de la mesa directiva del congreso local (president of the board of the local congress), becoming the first indigenous woman to chair the state Congress of Oaxaca.http://www.milenio.com/node/577467 On December 14 of the same year, Eufrosina was appointed as coordinator of indigenous affairs of the National Executive Committee of the PAN.

He was under attack by Oswald Boelcke and Erwin B√∂hme when they collided, causing Boelcke's death. Two months later, Knight would fall under the guns of Manfred von Richthofen, who had also been in the dogfight when Boelcke was killed.Guttman & Dempsey (2009), pp. 45 & 48. Early life Arthur Gerald Knight was the son of Arthur Cecil Knight and Isabella Jael Knight (n√©e Baston). The younger Knight was a student of Applied Science at Upper Canada College when he joined the Royal Flying Corps in 1915. World War I service =Aerial victories= Knight was assigned to the command of Major Lanoe Hawker. He began his victory string on 22 June 1916, using an Airco DH.2 of No. 24 Squadron RFC to destroy an LVG C model reconnaissance aircraft over Courcelette. His next two wins were of the \\"driven down out of control\\" variety, but for his fourth triumph on 14 September he helped Stanley Cockerell flame a Fokker fighter. The following day, he singlehandedly flamed another German fighter; a month later, he drove a Roland C.II down out of control. On 9 November 1916, he shared the destruction of an enemy fighter with Alfred Edwin McKay and Eric Pashley. Knight's Military Cross was awarded five days later.Shores et al, pp. 226‚Äì227. This drawing shows the primitive simplicity of the Airco DH.2 =Notable combats= On 28 October, Knight was under attack by Boelcke and B√∂hme when McKay, pursued by Richthofen, cut across between Knight and his assailants. In the resultant dodges and swerves, B√∂hme's plane's landing gear wheels damaged Boelcke's upper wing, and Boelcke fell to his death.Guttman & Dempsey (2009), p.45. Knight transferred to No. 29 Squadron RFC as the flight commander, B Flight, still flying a DH.2. On 11 December 1916, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. He scored his eighth victory five days later, downing an enemy fighter northeast of Arras, and continuing his assault on a second despite a broken machine gun extractor. Four days later, he led his final patrol before ten days' leave. He did not return. His patrol of four made it back, but badly battered by combat. Knight had become the Red Baron's thirteenth victim.Guttman & Dempsey (2009), p.48. The only known description of Knight's end comes from the victor's combat report: \\"...I attacked him at closest range.... I saw immediately that I had hit the enemy.

He was educated in Paris at the Lazarist seminary, and left for the United States in 1828 where he completed his studies for the priesthood at The Barrens in Perryville, Missouri. He was ordained a priest in St. Louis, Missouri by Bishop Joseph Rosati in 1831. His first appointment was to New Madrid, Missouri but was transferred after a few months to Salt River. The parish territory included mission stations in northern Missouri, western Illinois and southern Iowa. His health was affected by the extent of his work, and in 1841 he returned to Europe to rest. Diocese of Detroit While Lefevere was in Rome Pope Gregory XVI named him titular bishop of Zela and coadjutor bishop of Detroit on July 23, 1841. In effect, Lefevere would be the leader of the Detroit diocese, as Bishop Frederick Rese had become incapacitated for unspecified reasons and had returned to Europe, while retaining the title of Bishop of Detroit until his death in 1871. (As coadjutor, Bishop Lefevere exercised the authority of a diocesan bishop as the administrator of the diocese, but he never held the title of Bishop of Detroit.) He returned to the United States and was consecrated on November 21, 1841 by Bishop Francis Patrick Kenrick of Philadelphia. The principal co- consecrators were Bishops John England of Charleston and John Joseph Hughes of New York. This was a period of growth for the Catholic Church in Michigan. When Lefevere arrived in Detroit, the diocese covered the Michigan Territory, which at the time encompassed modern-day Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin, as well as all of Michigan. There were two parishes in the city and only twenty- five in the diocese. During his time as bishop the number of parishes in the city increased to eleven and 160 in the diocese, which was reduced to the lower peninsula of Michigan in 1853. There were 18 priests in the diocese when he arrived and that number grew to 88 by the time of his death. He went to Belgium to recruit priests and the Redemptorists were the first order to staff a parish. He established St. Thomas Seminary, most likely in his own home. With Bishop Martin Spalding of Louisville, he established the American College at Louvain in Belgium for the education of new priests and assigned four of his priests as the first four rectors of the school. The diocese under Rese had been poorly run and suffered from financial mismanagement. Lefevere established diocesan statutes in 1843 and presided over the first diocesan synod in 1859. He won a dispute with some of the laity over the ownership of church property. He built Saints Peter and Paul Church in Detroit, which became his cathedral in 1848, replacing Ste. Anne de Detroit. He bought property throughout the diocese where possible churches could be built. This became a financial investment for the diocese to draw upon to carry out its mission.Clarke, Richard Henry. \\"Rt. Rev. Peter Paul Lefevere, D.D.', Lives of the Deceased Bishops of the Catholic Church in the United States, Vol. 2, P. O'Shea, 1872, pp. 191 et seq Lefevere also served the larger church in the United States. He took an active role in the provincial councils of Baltimore and Cincinnati. In 1852 he attended the First Plenary Council of Baltimore and the Second Plenary Council in 1866. Bishop Lefevere helped to establish several charitable institutions in the diocese, which included four orphanages, a hospital and an asylum for the mentally ill. The Daughters of Charity became the first order of teaching sisters to come to Detroit. The Sisters, Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary were established in the diocese in 1845. Numerous other religious orders of men and women were introduced to the diocese to teach in schools and staff parishes. He took care of the pastoral needs of the Native Americans and those of mixed-blood in his diocese. He was an advocate of the Temperance Movement, especially among Native Americans. Lefevere died in Detroit at the age of 64 after serving the Diocese of Detroit for 28 years, and was buried in Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral. His remains were later transferred to Holy Sepulcher Cemetery to be with other bishops of Detroit.

Reign Heinrich succeeded as reigning Prince Reuss of Greiz after the death of his father on 8 November 1859. As Heinrich was a mere thirteen years of age, his mother Caroline of Hesse-Homburg (1819-1872) served as regent until his majority at the age of 21. As the daughter of an Austrian general and the wife of an Austrian officer, Caroline was vehemently anti-Prussian. As a result, during the Austro-Prussian War, Reuss was occupied by Prussian troops, who remained until a payment of 100,000 thalers was made. On 28 March 1867, Heinrich took the reins of government into his own hands. Upon taking full power, he gave his principality its first constitution. Like his parents, Heinrich remained anti-Prussian his entire life, repeatedly rejecting Prussian measures such as Kulturkampf and the creation of civil marriages. Heinrich, as well as his subjects in Reuss, refused fully to accept that the Hohenzollern German Emperors had precedence over other royal houses. For instance, when asked about his relationship with the Emperor, Heinrich would simply respond that they \\"were allies for the common defense of the German Federation\\". Heinrich lost no opportunity to displease the Emperor, declining to permit the construction of any memorial to Emperor Wilhelm I, Wilhelm II's beloved grandfather but this was later forced upon him. Heinrich also refused to tolerate any demonstrations of mourning, either official or in private, when the deaths of emperors Wilhelm I and Frederick III occurred, and forbade any celebration of the anniversaries of the German victories of 1870 but this was done any way and could not be punished and was ignored and punishment not enforced and done anyway . Heinrich was very wealthy, as the greater part of the territory he ruled over was his private property.Martin (1889), p. 184. At the end of his rule, Reuss contained fewer than 70,000 people, and comprised an area of 122 square miles. =Frankfurt National Assembly= In the late 1840s, there were discussions at the Frankfurt National Assembly for the creation of a hereditary imperial royal family that would rule over a united Germany, along with a new parliament and constitution.Dawson, pp. 55-56. There was much debate however on which particular royal dynasty would become Emperor, as many Germans refused to back the Hohenzollern claim. This led Prince John of Saxony for instance to remark that \\"If the nine Electors of the old German Empire were restored, the Prince of Reuss-Greiz would have a better chance of being Emperor than the King of Prussia\\".Dawson, p. 56. Marriage and issue On 8 October 1872, he married Princess Ida of Schaumburg-Lippe, a daughter of Adolf I, Prince of Schaumburg-Lippe. They had the following children: * Heinrich XXIV, Prince Reuss of Greiz (1878‚Äì1927) * Princess Emma (1881‚Äì1961) ‚àû (1903) Graf Erich von Ehrenburg (1880‚Äì1930) * Princess Marie (1882‚Äì1942) ‚àû (1904) Freiherr Ferdinand von Gnagnoni (1878‚Äì1955) * Princess Caroline (1884‚Äì1905) ‚àû (1903) Wilhelm Ernst, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar- Eisenach (1876‚Äì1923) * Princess Hermine (1887‚Äì1947) ‚àû I.

His death meant his mentally and physically disabled only son Prince Heinrich became reigning prince of Reuss. As the prince was clearly unable to fulfill these duties, arrangements for a regency were made. A younger branch of the Reuss family was next-in-line to the title, but there was some concern that Heinrich might choose another for the regency, as he disliked them. In the end, Heinrich's distant cousin Prince Heinrich XXVII of Reuss zu Schleiz was chosen; his wife, Princess Elise of Hohenlohe- Langenburg was a cousin of both Kaiser and his wife Empress Augusta Viktoria, and the prince himself had served alongside Emperor Wilhelm in the regiment of the Hussars of the Guard, thus repairing relations between the houses of Hohenzollern and Reuss.

The origins of the company date to the early 1980s, when Alberto Vilar and Gary A. Tanaka founded two companies named \\"Amerindo\\" in England and Panama. The American branch, called \\"Amerindo Investment Advisors Inc.\\" was founded in 1985. The East Coast office was located in the 399 Park Avenue in New York City, the West Coast office, and \\"principal place of business\\" was located at One Embarcadero Center in San Francisco, and the international office was in London. Vilar made an early and very successful investment in Yahoo!, which once totaled 40% of the fund's investment portfolio. Vilar's financial strategy included investing in purchasing shares of companies shortly after their initial public offering. The company's \\"flagship\\" financial product, the \\"Amerindo Technology Fund,\\" was known for investing in startup high tech and Dot-com companies. Following many years of strong growth during the internet boom the fund came to a crash. Vilar gained a lot of press for declaring the internet to be \\"bigger than the Industrial Revolution.\\" Fraudulent activities Amerindo had advertised that its \\"Guaranteed Fixed Rate Deposit Account\\" (GFRDA) would be invested in \\"high quality, short-term deposits\\" that would produce a \\"fixed-rate of interest for a fixed-term.\\" Instead, these funds were invested in risky dot com ventures, and the fund lost large sums after the 2000 dot-com bust, which meant that Amerindo couldn't repay the investors, costing investors millions of dollars. Separately, Amerindo investor Lily Cates, mother of actress Phoebe Cates, invested $5 million in the \\"Amerindo Small Business Investment Company\\" venture, but most of her investment was rerouted to pay for Amerindo's business expenses, donated to various charities to which Vilar had made pledges that he couldn't afford, and to pay a settlement from a former client who was suing Amerindo about the GFRDA account. In September 2003, Vilar ordered an employee to copy Cates' signature onto a document that purported to authorize a $250,000 transfer, with most of that money going into Vilar's personal account. In 2005, Cates filed a complaint with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regarding Vilar and Amerindo. During the investigation, Vilar lied to the SEC, claiming that Cates wasn't a client and that he did not own the Panamanian subsidiary. In 2005, Vilar and Tanaka were convicted for organizing a series of transactions that defrauded their clients. After the nine-week trial, Vilar was convicted of two counts of securities fraud; two counts of wire fraud; four counts of money laundering; investment adviser fraud; mail fraud; making false statements; and participating in a conspiracy to commit securities fraud, investment adviser fraud; wire fraud, mail fraud; and money laundering and Tanaka was convicted of three of the twelve counts with which he was charged: securities fraud; investment adviser fraud; and conspiring to commit securities fraud; investment adviser fraud; wire fraud; mail fraud; and money laundering.

It is part of the East Side Kids series. Plot After an afternoon of playing baseball, Muggs McGinnis (Leo Gorcey) and the East Side Kids gang arrive at the door of their clubhouse, where a man named Higgins (silent comedian Harry Langdon, in one of his last film appearances) is removing their \\"East Side Club\\" sign. Higgins explains that the owner of the place plans to rent it to some \\"respectable\\" tenants. When Muggs learns that the new tenants are due to examine the place at noon the following day, he plans to frighten them away by picking a fight with Butch (Billy Benedict) and the Five Pointers, a rival gang. The next day, Glimpy (Huntz Hall) and Pinky (Gabriel Dell), scribble a challenge to the Five Pointers on the sidewalk. When Butch and his gang read the message, \\"The East Siders dare you to fight,\\" they seek out their challengers. Meanwhile, Muggs and the gang see Higgins supervising the delivery of some window boxes that he ordered to replace the weather-beaten pots that are lining the street. Pretending to be helpful, the gang offers to dispose of the old pots, but instead, stack them against a nearby wall. Soon, the prospective tenants, an elderly woman named Amelia Norton (Minerva Urecal) and her French-born grandson Jean (Fred Pressel) arrive, and Higgins greets them. Just then, Butch and his gang show up and take the bait, hurling the empty pots at Muggs and his gang, while a shocked Amelia looks on. When Jean critiques Muggs's fighting style, Muggs begins to brawl with him. After they are both arrested, the judge (Noah Berry, Sr. tells Muggs that he will hold each one accountable for the other's behavior. Later, Jean goes to the clubhouse to make sure that Muggs is staying out of trouble, and the gang teaches him some American games. Afterward, Jean invites the gang over for tea, and they meet snobby Irma Treadwell (Kay Marvis) and her mother Virginia. When Muggs and Glimpy see a black sedan pick up Jean, who is dressed like Count Dracula, they decide to follow him. The car takes Jean to a costume party at a chic club, where Muggs wins 'best costume' for being dressed as a Bowery tough. Meanwhile, Tobey Dunn (Bill Chaney), an ailing member of Muggs's baseball team, is told by his doctor (Robert F. Hill) that a stay in the country would cure him, but unfortunately, Tobey's family cannot afford the trip. Later, Danny (Jimmy Strand), sees his girlfriend Jinx (Roberta Smith) dancing with Jean at a party, so the gang decides to crash it. When Glimpy tells Danny that he saw Jinx riding on the back of Jean's bicycle, Danny tries to fight with his rival, but Muggs intervenes. The gang then goes to the field to play baseball, and Jean quickly learns the game. At the clubhouse, Amelia thanks the gang for allowing Jean to play with them. During the team's next game, Lippman (Bernard Gorcey), the team's sponsor, tells the gang that if they win, he will send them all to summer camp in the Catskill Mountains. With the bases loaded, Jean hits a home run and wins the game, and Tobey is awarded his much-needed trip to the country.

A·π£√≠k√≤ was the Christian version of s√°k√°r√† (Sakara).  Background  It developed originally as a type of syncretic street drumming in port towns throughout Anglophone West Africa. By the 1920s it was also played by musicians inland in Yoruba towns like Abƒôokuta and Ibadan. Isaac O. Delano gives a detailed description of an a·π£√≠k√≤ ensemble in the 1930s: > Another popular native dance is the \\"Ashiko\\". It is not a Yoruba dance in > its origin, but was imported from Sierra Leone or somewhere that way. The > \\"Ashiko\\" dance is chiefly performed by Christian people, and has only one > kind of music, rather quicker than the \\"Sakara\\" . . . and resembles a fox- > trot. No stringed instruments are employed, only drums and carpenter's saw, > used occasionally to make a kind of noise on its sharp edge, as an > embellishment to \\"Ashiko\\" drum music. Sometimes a bottle is also used, a > nail beating time on it, for the same purpose. The drummers, five in number, > all beat similar drums, and produce a continuous volume of music. The > dancing is done by pairs, two ladies and two gentlemen facing each other. > The drummers sing as in the \\"Sakara\\" dance with chorus boys, but no one else > sings with them (Delano [1937] 1973:157).\\"Delano, Isaac. [1937] 1973. The > soul of Nigeria. Nendeln: Kraus Reprints. A·π£√≠k√≤ music has its origins in the music of Sierra Leonean repatriates, from the West Indian colonies, who themselves had been influenced by Afro-Brazilian samba music. The wooden frame drums used in a·π£√≠k√≤ music and the carpenter's saw, were introduced by the Aguda, who introduced modern carpentry techniques to the Yoruba artisans. Often, elderly informants use the terms a·π£√≠k√≤ and s√°mb√† interchangeably. A·π£√≠k√≤ was popular in Accra, the capital of the Gold Coast Colony before World War I.Collins, E.J. 1977. Post-war popular band music in West Africa. African Arts 10(3): 53-60. Other influences are also possible from Dahomean, Liberian and West Indian immigrants. Lagos was a breeding ground for young Christian musicians playing a·π£√≠k√≤ music. They developed and rehearsed their own versions of holiday songs, for various festivals around Christmas, etc. Then when the day arrived they would take to the streets and compete. With the elders as judges, the best group would take home a cash prize. The a·π£√≠k√≤ drum, a square frame drum, complete with tuning pegs, was perfect for marching in a parade. It was hand held, lightweight and easy to play with one hand. The drums are made in different sizes and played using interlocking rhythms, which create a driving beat that's difficult to resist as the band marches through the streets. Delano noted European musical influences, since there is no call and response tradition within this genre. The drummers themselves are the singers.  Influence  The success of these amateur a·π£√≠k√≤ groups resulted in a number of them becoming full-time professional bands, which eventually entered the recording studios allowing them to reach a larger audience and become quite popular. Musicians such as A.B.O. Mabinuori, Amusa (otherwise known as 'Captain'), Jero, Tesilimi, Samu Egbo (\\"Samu Esu\\"), Ajayi Williams (alias \\"Ajayi Koboko\\") and Alabi Labilu are just a few of the most popular a·π£√≠k√≤ bandleaders. This syncretized music was the perfect match for the newly indoctrinated Christian converts of the day, because it incorporated \\"foreign\\" instruments with no ties to traditional religious practices; lyrical poetic song texts promoting Christianity over the √≤r√¨·π£√† (traditional religion) and the songs were sung in either Yoruba or Nigerian Pidgin English, which made them accessible to a large cross-section of the population. As the music grew in popularity the song texts began to change as well. By the late 1920s songs could be heard about important social events, historical events, current events and low-status occupations, like prostitution, etc. Nigerian musician Babatunde Olatunji incorporated many of these elements into his music. The samba rhythm was one of his favorites, heard on many of his albums. Much like the rhythm of James Brown identified him and his music; the samba rhythms identify the music of Olatunji. Typically, he did not use sets of drums, but rather created batteries of drums. For instance, atsimevu, djembe, congas and dunun would be played together. In the latter part of his career he also introduced a drum, now identified with him, the Boku drum from Cuba, under the name a·π£√≠k√≤ (ashiko). For most American drummers this is the ashiko drum, as opposed to the hand held relative of the Spanish Pandeiro. In light of his Yoruba origins and Christian upbringing, it all makes sense. As we look at his recordings we see everything from songs like Bethlehemu to Shango and from Sahara Samba to Mbira which features, not Mbira as we know it but rather, a Cuban style Marimbula or Agidigbo as it is known in Nigeria.

The film had its origins in primary research for a documentary about the British Railways Board. Jones' test research coincided with one of the coldest winters on record, and Jones approached BTF producer Edgar Anstey with the idea to contrast the comfort of the passengers with the efforts of the railway workmen in keeping trains going in the frozen conditions. Work began on the documentary straight after gaining approval, and Jones and cameraman Wolfgang Suschitzky travelled around the country filming scenes for the rest of the winter. The film was edited to a re-recorded version of Sandy Nelson's \\"Teen Beat\\" by Johnny Hawksworth, expanded to twice its original length by accelerating the tempo over the duration of the film.

Onrusrivier has a popular beach and also a quaint tidal rock pool. Onrus is a predominantly residential area, situated between mountains, the Onrus river, and the seaside. There is an abundance of birds in Onrus, as well as animals such as mongoose and porcupine. The flora in Onrusrivier includes the ancient milkwood trees, and colourful indigenous flowers, which are seen only at certain times of the year.

The film portrays the cooperation between residents of the Washington logging town, Randle, and Cascadia Defense Network activists attempting to stop the clearcutting of old growth trees on Watch mountain (part of the Cascade Mountain range) and along the nearby Fossil Creek. The film served as Waters' senior project at Evergreen State College. Synopsis The film opens with the Plum Creek Timber Company attempting to exchange ownership of of land to the federal government in exchange for considered more suitable for commercial logging, in what will become known as the I-90 land exchange. This exchange, if approved will give Plum Creek ownership of from the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, which includes Watch mountain and land surrounding Fossil Creek, near Randle. Residents of the town, in addition to young activists, express concern that Plum Creek logging operations will destroy old growth forest in the area and damage the local eco-system of the creek, resulting in mudslides. Watch documents the responses of residents of Randle as well as the activists who come to engage in tree sitting as a means of deterring Plum Creek logging. Footage includes two town meetings addressing the issue of the logging, protests outside of and inside of Plum Creek's offices in Seattle, confrontations with police, and acts of support by the Cowlitz tribe. In November 1999, Plum Creek agrees to remove the disputed areas from the draft of their land exchange agreement, and the finalized exchange grants them rights to only of land, primarily east of Cascades, with Watch mountain and Fossil Creek excluded from the deal. The film ends with the activists tearing down their own platforms in the old growth canopy, and gathering celebrate their victory.

This technique involves inserting a tetra-polar catheter into the ventricle and measuring conductance. This measured conductance is a combination of blood and muscle and various techniques are used to identify the blood conductance from the total measured conductance. Blood conductance can then be converted to volume using a linear (Baan) or a non-linear (Wei) relationship that relates conductance to volume.  Traditional conductance technology  This approach is based on the idea that the total conductance, G, of a fluid between two electrodes is a function of the fluid's conductivity (reciprocal of resistivity) and volume. In cardiology, a tetra-polar catheter is inserted into the ventricle and a constant current (I) is applied across the two outer electrodes. This generates an electrical field within the ventricle and the two inner electrodes measure a voltage generated due to the electric field. This measured voltage (V) is used to determine conductance through a modified version of Ohm's Law. Conductance (G) is the reciprocal of resistance (R) which changes the standard Ohm's equation from V=IR to V=I/G. Conductance is then related to blood volume though Baan's equation. When used in cardiology, the electric field generated is not limited to the blood (the fluid of interest) but also penetrates the heart wall, giving rise to additional conductance often called \\"parallel conductance\\" or \\"muscle conductance\\", Gm which must be removed. Various techniques have been attempted to remove the Gm contribution with varying degrees of success. The most common method is the hypertonic saline technique which involves injecting a bolus of hypertonic saline into the ventricle to alter blood conductivity without affecting the surrounding muscle. Another less commonly used technique involves evacuating the ventricle of blood and measuring muscle conductance alone with a conductance catheter. Clearly both techniques are unreliable, somewhat invasive and fail to account for the continuous variation in Gm over the cardiac cycle.  Improved admittance technology  The Admittance technique is an improvement over the Conductance technique for the real-time removal of muscle conductance Gm. Blood and muscle respond to alternating (AC) electrical currents very differently. Blood is purely resistive while muscle has both resistive and capacitive properties. The fixed charges in muscle cells create a significant reactance that causes a phase shift (time delay) in the measured signal, relative to the excitation signal. Admittance technology uses this phase shift to determine the instantaneous muscle conductance and remove it from the total measured conductance. = Removal of Gm = The total Admittance (Y), of the blood filled ventricle is given by Y = Gb \\\\+ Gm \\\\+ iœâCm where * Gb is the measured conductance of the blood (the desired signal) * Gm is the measured conductance of the cardiac muscle (unwanted signal) * Cm is the measured capacitance of the cardiac muscle * œâ is the angular frequency of the excitation signal The signals Gm and Cm are both properties of cardiac muscle and vary in a fixed ratio. Thus the ratio of Gm to Cm is equal to the ratio of muscle conductivity (œÉ) to muscle permittivity (Œµ). The ratio œÉ/Œµ is the constant of proportionality. Although both œÉ and Œµ are functions of the health of the heart tissue, they are relatively constant for short periods of time. Using this proportionality, one can rewrite the equation for Gm as Gm = (œÉ/Œµ)Cm Note that the imaginary component of Y depends only on the amount of muscle in the field of the catheter. This makes it easy to isolate by measuring the phase shift, œÜ, of the measured signal: cos(œÜ) = (Gb \\\\+ Gm)/Y sin(œÜ) = œâCm/Y Hence, Cm = Y.sin(œÜ)/œâ also, Gm = (œÉ/Œµ)Cm Thus, blood conductance is determined as Gb = Y.cos(œÜ) - Gm Wei's equations can be applied to this calculated blood conductance Gb to obtain blood volume. Unlike Baan's equation, Wei's equation takes into account the non-linear nature of the electrical field and the dynamic nature of the cardiac cycle to give a more accurate representation of the blood volume.  Experimental results  Admittance technique involves the measurement of both phase angle and total conductance in the ventricle. Thus, it is possible to observe how the parallel conductance (muscle conductance) varies throughout the cardiac cycle. A plot showing both the blood and muscle contribution are shown in the figure.

History The present church is thought to date from the 18th century, and it was much rebuilt in 1841. A church has been documented on this site since 1254. The only fabric possibly surviving from this earlier church is to be found in the foundations and part of the walls. Since it was declared redundant, the charity the Friends of Friendless Churches has held a 999 year lease, which was transferred to them on 1 February 2007. After taking it over, the charity has organised the re-covering of the roof, and has re-introduced timber windows designed by Tim Ratcliffe, their design being based on the pre- existing windows. Architecture It is a small rectangular church constructed in stone rubble. At the west end is a gabled rendered bellcote. The doorway is at the west end of the south side, and there is no chancel.

Location It lies in the Hex River Valley on the N1 National Route, 32 km north-east of Worcester and 40 km south-west of Touwsrivier. It is in the centre of an export grape growing region, surrounded by over 200 table grape farms. History The town takes its name from the farm \\"De Doorns boven aan de Hex Rivier\\" (‚Äòthe thorns on the upper Hex River‚Äô), known as early as 1725. The area was declared a sub-drosty of Tulbagh in 1819 and the farm became the seat of the area's own drostdy in 1822. The De Doorns farm was bought by the government of Cape Prime Minister John Molteno in 1875, to build a railway station for the rapidly expanding Cape Government Railways. The line was immediately built through De Doorns, connecting it to Cape Town on the coast and reaching Montagu Road(later Touws River) in 1877, on its way to Kimberley. Around the station, the hamlet of De Doorns would later develop.C. Schoeman: The Historical Karoo: Traces of the Past in South Africa's Arid Interior. Penguin Random House South Africa. Burman, Jose (1984), Early Railways at the Cape. Cape Town: Human & Rousseau. The area around the town became an important region for table grape farming. It had the necessary infrastructure for exporting its produce, and the longest harvest season in the world - December to April. During the second Anglo-Boer War (1899-1902), the town and its railway infrastructure played an important supporting role. The stone blockhouses which were built to protect the vital railway link are still found in the valley.Schmidt J.: Call of the Muezzin - Cape to Riyadh. Partridge Africa, Johannesburg. 2014.

It was concluded he had likely died in November 1978, aged 79, and his family had never announced his death in an attempt to preserve his longevity record. Relatives had rebuffed attempts by ward officials to see Kato in preparations for Respect for the Aged Day later that year, citing many reasons from him being a \\"human vegetable\\" to becoming a Sokushinbutsu. The cause of death was not determined due to the state of Kato's body. The discovery of Kato's remains sparked a search for other missing centenarians lost due to poor record keeping by officials. A study following the discovery of Kato's remains found that police did not know if 234,354 people over the age of one hundred were still alive. Poor record keeping was to blame for many of the cases, officials admitted. One of Kato's relatives was found guilty of fraud; his relatives claimed ¬•9,500,000 (US$117,939; ¬£72,030) of pension meant for Kato. History =Discovery of the body= An illustration of where Kato's mummified body was discovered. (1) Location the body was found; (2) Newspaper from 1978; (3) Rotary dial telephone; (4) Main entrance. After tracking down the residence in Adachi, Tokyo, where Kato was reportedly living, attempts by officials to meet him were rebuffed numerous times by the family. Many reasons were given by his relatives, including that he was a \\"human vegetable\\" and that he was becoming a Sokushinbutsu. Eventually, Kato's body was found by police and ward officials in July 2010, when ward officials intending to honour his achievement of longevity on Respect for the Aged Day later that year were again rebuffed and police broke into the house. Found in a first floor room, Kato's mummified remains were lying on a bed wearing underwear and pajamas and were covered with a blanket. Newspapers that were found in the room dated back three decades to the Sh≈çwa period, suggesting that Kato's death may have occurred around November 1978. An official named Yutaka Muroi said, \\"His family must have known he has(d) been dead all these years and acted as if nothing happened. It's so eerie.\\" The day after the visit, Kato's granddaughter told an acquaintance that \\"my grandfather shut himself in a room on the first floor of our home 32 years ago, and we couldn't open the door from the outside. My mother said, 'Leave him in there,' and he was left as he was. I think he's dead.\\" One official had reported concerns about Kato's safety earlier in the year to his ward office. An autopsy failed to determine the cause of Kato's death. Adachi, Tokyo, where Kato's body was found =Fraud trial= Following the discovery of Kato's body, two of his relatives were arrested in August 2010, and subsequently charged with fraud. Prosecutors alleged that Michiko Kato, 81, Kato's daughter, and Tokimi Kato, 53, his granddaughter, fraudulently received about ¬•9,500,000 ($117,939; ¬£72,030) of pension money. In addition, after Kato's wife died in 2004 at the age of 101, ¬•9,450,000 ($117,318; ¬£71,651) from a survivor's mutual pension was deposited into Kato's bank account between October 2004 and June 2010. Approximately ¬•6,050,000 ($75,108; ¬£45,872) was withdrawn before his body was discovered. Kato was likely paid a senior welfare benefit from the time he turned 70, which the family may also have used to their advantage. Investigators said that the pair defrauded the Japan Mutual Aid Association of Public School Teachers, who transferred the money into Kato's account. In November 2010, the Tokyo District Court sentenced Tokimi Kato to a 2¬Ω year sentence for fraud, suspended for four years. Judge Hajime Shimada said, \\"The defendant committed a malicious crime with the selfish motive of securing revenue for her family. However, she has paid back the pension benefits and expressed remorse for the crime.\\" Aftermath After the discovery of Kato's mummified corpse, other checks into elderly centenarians across Japan produced reports of missing centenarians and faulty record keeping. Tokyo officials attempted to find the oldest woman in the city, 113-year-old Fusa Furuya, who was registered as living with her daughter. Furuya's daughter said she had not seen her mother for over 25 years. The revelations about the disappearance of Furuya and the death of Kato prompted a nationwide investigation, which concluded that police did not know if 234,354 people older than 100 were still alive. More than 77,000 of these people, officials said, would have been older than 120 years old if they were still alive. Poor record keeping was blamed for many of the cases, and officials said that many may have died during World War II. One register suggested a man was still alive at age 186. Following the revelations about Kato and Furuya, analysts investigated why record keeping by Japanese authorities was poor. Many seniors have, it has been reported, moved away from their family homes. Statistics show that divorce is becoming increasingly common among the elderly. Dementia, which afflicts more than two million Japanese, is also a contributing factor. \\"Many of those gone missing are men who left their hometowns to look for work in Japan‚Äôs big cities during the country‚Äôs pre-1990s boom years. Many of them worked obsessively long hours and never built a social network in their new homes. Others found less economic success than they‚Äôd hoped. Ashamed of that failure, they didn‚Äôt feel they could return home,\\" a Canadian newspaper reported several months after the discovery of Kato's body. Japan is the most elderly nation in the world; as of October 2010, 23.1 percent of the population were found to be aged 65 and over, and 11.1 percent were 75 and over. This has largely been caused by a very low birthrate; as of 2005, the rate was 1.25 babies for every woman‚Äîto keep the population steady the number needed to be 2.1. However, the issue of aging in the country has been increased by the government's unwillingness to let immigrants into the country‚Äîforeign nationals accounted for only 1.2 percent of the total population as of 2005. A 2006 report by the government indicates that by 2050, of the population may be elderly. The inquiry also noted that many elderly Japanese citizens were dying in solitude. \\"Die alone and in two months all that is left is the stench, a rotting corpse and maggots,\\" The Japan Times said in an editorial, one of many comments from the country's press on the news. An editorial in Asahi Shimbun said that the findings suggested \\"deeper problems\\" in the Japanese register system. \\"The families who are supposed to be closest to these elderly people don't know where they are and, in many cases, have not even taken the trouble to ask the police to search for them,\\" read the editorial. \\"The situation shows the existence of lonely people who have no family to turn to and whose ties with those around them have been severed.\\" One Japanese doctor, however, said he was not surprised at the news. Dr. Aiba Miyoji, of the Tokyo Koto Geriatric Medical Centre, said many Japanese seniors were dying alone, ignored by their families. ‚ÄúSome patients come in with their families, but many are alone or come in just with their social workers,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt happens especially in Tokyo. There are more and more single-person families.‚Äù Dr. Aiba added that a key reason for the statistics was because people in Japan are living longer than ever before. \\"That achievement is placing new burdens on a society where a declining number of working-age Japanese have to fund rising health-care and pension costs,\\" The Globe and Mail reported. Dr. Aiba said that because Tokyo was so crowded, families cannot remain in the same household. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not enough space for families to live together any more,‚Äù he said. A national census in 2005 found that 3.86 million elderly Japanese citizens were living alone, compared with 2.2 million a decade before. 24.4 percent of men and 9.3 percent of women over the age of 60 in Japan have no neighbours, friends or relatives on whom they could rely, a more recent study discovered. In 2008, the Associated Press reported that the number of elderly people committing suicide had reached a record high because of health and economic worries. \\"In what appears to be a collective cry for help, more than 30,000 Japanese seniors are arrested every year for shoplifting. Many of those arrested told police they stole out of feelings of boredom and isolation, rather than any economic necessity,\\" The Globe and Mail reported after the discovery of Kato's corpse. Jeff Kingston, the Director of Asian Studies at the Japan Campus of Temple University, said, \\"It is a humanising phenomenon‚Äîthe Japanese are traditionally seen as sober, law-abiding people‚Äîwhen they are in fact scamsters like the rest of us. [The story of the missing centenarians] holds up a mirror to society and reflects realities that many in Japan do not want to accept.\\" See also *Aging of Japan *Elderly people in Japan *List of Japanese supercentenarians *Lists of centenarians Notes References Category:1899 births Category:1978 deaths Category:Hoaxes in Japan Category:People from Tokyo Category:2010 hoaxes ","title":"Sogen Kato"},{"id":"28204259","text":"Romansrivier,, United States National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency in Ward 2 Dwarsrivier, is a settlement in Witzenberg Local Municipality, Cape Winelands District Municipality, Western Cape province, South Africa.

As you move down the Helshoogte pass, from Stellenbosch en route to Franschhoek, you will find Kylemore, a small devout Christian town. Although a well-established community, with a remarkable level of generic skills and individual talent, its economy is still on the rise. With a population of 4000+ people, the community is largely dependent on employment in the bigger towns, predominantly Stellenbosch, Paarl, and greater Cape Town, and the adjacent farms provide seasonal jobs to farm labourers and students during the harvest season. This town has a vast array of talent and rugby is its idolised sport. After producing two Springboks in Ivan Jacobs and World Champion, Herschel Jantjies, this small settlement's local rugby club's numbers rose with more than 100%. The Kylemore Rugby Football Club's number of new signings skyrocketed at the start of the 2020 season, with both the senior and junior structures being overloaded with the new faces at the club. Kylemore's youngsters excel at provincial level as well. Apart from rugby, high school graduates often find themselves graduating as medical doctors, lawyers, chartered accountants and other top professions, which is a testament to the town's character. The natural beauty of Kylemore lies in its mountains and rivers. We are literally surrounded by them!

History SAR Class 23 locomotive plinthed in a park in Touws River The town of Touws River owes its existence to the Cape Government Railways, and to the route that their founder, Cape Prime Minister John Molteno, chose for a railway line over the Hex River Mountains.C. Schoeman: The Historical Karoo: Traces of the Past in South Africa's Arid Interior. Penguin Random House South Africa. 2013. p.20.The History of Touws River town A railway was needed from the port at Cape Town, to service the newly discovered diamond fields in Kimberley. However, several seemingly impregnable ranges of mountains separated Cape Town from the hinterland of the Cape. The Royal Commonwealth Society (1898) records how the route was chosen: When Mr. Molteno formulated his railway scheme he sent for his consulting engineer, who asked him what was the route he desired. Mr. Molteno asked for a map of South Africa, which was brought to him. Taking a ruler he drew his pen along it, in a direct line from Cape Town to Beaufort West. \\"But,\\" said the engineer, \\"that means you go slap bang through the Hex River Mountains.\\" \\"Never mind,\\" said Mr. Molteno, \\"that is the way I want it to go.\\" And that is the way it did go.Royal Colonial Society: Proceedings of the Royal Colonial Institute. Northumberland Avenue, London. 1898. p.26. \\"The Railway System of South Africa\\". In 1875, the engineers of the Cape Government Railways arrived to survey the region and found that, at the exact spot indicated, there was indeed a viable route through the formidable Hex River Mountains, starting from Worcester and descending on the other side, to a spot where the town of Touws River now stands.Burman, Jose (1984). Early Railways at the Cape. Cape Town. Human & Rousseau, p.57. On 7 November 1877, the Worcester-Matjiesfontein section of the Cape Government Railways' Cape Town-Kimberley main line was opened to traffic. The line included a station, originally named \\"Montagu Road\\", where the line bridged the Touws River. The name was given in reference to the town of Montagu, which lies about to the south by road. In 1883 the station was renamed \\"Touwsrivier\\". The name \\"Touws\\" originates from a Khoi word for ash, which also referred to the local \\"Ash-bushes\\" (Salsola aphylla). It is uncertain whether the name originally referred to the bushes, to the colour of the soil, or to the colour of the river (historically, the Touws river was occasionally known as the \\"Ash river\\").Etymology of Touws river The town of Touws River developed around this railway depot, at which locomotives were changed after the climb over the Hex River Pass. It was particularly busy because of the need to bank trains over the pass; banking locomotives were turned at Touws River to return to De Doorns. From 1924 it also served as the junction for the branch line to Ladismith. The closing of the Ladismith branch in 1981 and the opening of the Hex River Tunnel in 1989 reduced the importance of Touws River as a depot. Now a sleepy town, surrounded by farms, mountains and game reserves, it preserves open-air displays of steam engines in memory of its history as a railway centre. Governance Touws River received municipal government in 1962; with the transformation of local government in South Africa it has been incorporated into the Breede Valley Local Municipality. It is located in ward 1 of the local municipality, which in turn falls within the Cape Winelands District Municipality. the ward councillor was J.J. Januarie of the African National Congress. Geography Touws River is located at an elevation of on the southwestern edge of the Great Karoo, east of the Hex River Mountains and north of the Langeberg, at the point where the Donkeys River flows into the Touws River. It lies just to the south of the N1 highway, by road from Cape Town. The railway line passes through the town, with the yards and depot being located just to the north-east; by rail it is from Cape Town. Demography The 2001 Census recorded the population of Touws River as 6,781 people in an area of , giving it a population density of . Of the population, 87.7% described themselves as Coloured, 10.1% as White, 2.0% as Black African, and 0.2% as Indian or Asian.

It is the band's first album recorded with bassist Brent Harding, their first album of new material since 2004's Sex, Love and Rock 'n' Roll, and their first release on Epitaph Records. Work on the album began in 2006 and it was originally forecast for a 2007 release, but was pushed back several times while the band continued touring and writing new material. After four years of writing, Social Distortion recorded the album from February to July 2010 at Ocean Studios in Burbank, California. Drummer Atom Willard left the group during the recording sessions in favor of his other band, Angels & Airwaves. He was temporarily replaced by Scott Reeder before David Hidalgo, Jr. joined as the band's new permanent drummer. Despite being listed as a band member on the album, Hidalgo did not actually play on it; instead, the band hired session musician Josh Freese to record the drum tracks. History In August 2005, sources reported that Social Distortion was going to begin work on a seventh studio album to be released in 2006. However, frontman Mike Ness told Crush Music Magazine that a new Social Distortion album would \\"probably\\" not come out in 2006 or anytime soon. He explained, \\"I feel like we've got a great start on a new album, we'd like to do a new album soon but I doubt it will be that soon. I figure I will use my time off next year to do the writing and maybe start it toward the end of 2006 recording. It'll be soon but I don't know if it'll be quite that soon.\\" Also in that interview, Ness promised the album not to take another eight years; it instead was released within seven years of their previous album. In May 2006, it was reported that Social Distortion had started writing and rehearsing new material, with an intended release date of late 2006/early 2007. In July, Ness told The Desert Sun that the band would like to be in the studio in 2007 putting out their seventh album and revealed that \\"Bakersfield\\" was one of the new songs they were working on. Asked in that interview what things Ness was writing about, he replied, \\"the last record had a lot of songs about love and loss, maybe this record I want to be different... but I don't want to give it away... Every record you want better than the last one and a little different. I'm not sure of the direction yet honestly.\\" After embarking on a series of tours in the summer and autumn of 2006, Social Distortion returned to the studio in December to continue working on new material. Asked in April 2007 about Social Distortion's plans for the coming months, Ness replied, \\"I had a song that was pretty much the template for the new album, and we went in and recorded it. We're gonna release it sooner. We're gonna put it on the greatest-hits album. So if people want to get a taste of what the new album will sound like, they can hear it on that song. A song called 'Far Behind.' It's a song I wrote in the last year, and we went and recorded it and it came out awesome. We figure it's a great song for the greatest hits because it starts at the beginning of our career and ends right now.\\" In July 2007, Ness told Billboard.com that Social Distortion had \\"a lot of songs\\" that never appeared on Sex, Love and Rock 'n' Roll, and was revisiting demos that he had recorded in 1994. Asked in December what the current status of the album was, Ness told The Denver Post that the band was still writing new material and doing a new song in a setlist but would have to stop performing live before recording could take place. In April 2008, Ness told Spinner that Social Distortion was planning an acoustic album to be released in 2009, stating \\"I think it could be really, really neat. It's almost like a Bob Dylan/Bruce Springsteen/Johnny Cash kind of feel with a punk edge ... but acoustic. Sometimes [the songs] are more powerful stripped down than with full volume.\\" Ness also revealed plans for his next solo album, but he was not sure if it was going to be released before or after the follow-up to Sex, Love and Rock 'n' Roll or the acoustic album. In July 2009, Ness revealed to Russian's Tarakany! Bad TV that Social Distortion was planning to enter the studio in December 2009 or the beginning of 2010 to begin recording their new album. In September that year, he confirmed that the album would be recorded in January 2010 at Studio 606, a studio owned by the Foo Fighters. Asked when the album was expected to be released, Ness stated that it would \\"probably be out\\" in the spring or summer of 2010. In October, guitarist Jonny \\"2 Bags\\" Wickersham told Boston Examiner that Social Distortion was expected to enter the studio on February 1 for a late spring release. Asked what musical direction the band would be taking on the album, he said that it would be \\"very rock and roll,\\" and include a country song in the vein of the band's 1992 album Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell. Wickersham explained, \\"It's not like we're going to start putting out a record like we've been listening to The Dead or something. We've got a handful of songs right now that are finished, and bunch that we're still working on.\\" On February 7, 2010, Social Distortion announced on its Twitter account that it would start recording a new album on February 8. Also in February, Ness revealed to Spinner that the band had just tracked 12 songs, and was \\"going to probably track another five\\". He said the self-produced, still-untitled album, which he hopes to release before the end of the year, would feature the classic Social Distortion sound ‚Äì a combination of punk, rockabilly and country, presumably. He explained, \\"It's funny ‚Äì the record reminds me very much of Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell, but also I'm bringing elements of early New York '70s punk, influences that maybe haven't come out as prominently in my writing in the past. It's a little more Johnny Thunders. Some of the early first wave of punk was very blues-based rock 'n' roll, but it had this urban snottiness to it.\\" Ness also explained what happened to the acoustic album, which was announced back in 2008, \\"The acoustic thing is just a future project, which I think will be significant and equally important. But as far as the priority goes, it's more important now to get a studio record out that is a regular record\\". On May 20, 2010, Social Distortion updated their Twitter with this post saying, \\"the album is tracked... finishing up writing and getting ready to head back into the studio to record vocals.\\" The album was said to be a return to their punk rock roots and would focus on the New York punk of the 70's and early 80's. At a show in Poughkeepsie, New York on July 27, 2010, Ness revealed that the new Social Distortion album would be called Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes and also promised a November release date. A September 2010 issue of Rolling Stone magazine claimed the album would be released on November 23, 2010. However, Ness later said that its release date had been pushed back to January 2011. In October 2010, Social Distortion announced that Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes would be released on January 18, 2011. They also mentioned that \\"Machine Gun Blues\\" would be the album's first single and available for download via iTunes on November 16. Reception Critical reviews of Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes were mostly positive. AllMusic's Mark Deming gave the album a rating of three-and-a-half stars out of five and states that it \\"is clearly the work of a band that still gives a damn about their rock & roll, no matter how familiar the surroundings. While 2004's Sex, Love and Rock 'N' Roll saw Ness digging deeper into personal concerns, Hard Times finds him stepping back a few paces; while 'Can't Take It with You,' 'Gimme the Sweet and Lowdown,' and 'Still Alive' find Ness waxing philosophical, most of these songs exist in the world of cool cars, tough dames, and bad-luck guys who've been part of his regular cast of characters since the album Prison Bound in 1988.\\" By January 26, 2011, the album had reached number 4 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, marking Social Distortion's first ever top-10 album and highest ever peak on that chart in their entire 33-year career.

Retrieved May 2, 2012. and the Human Development Index at 0.749 in 2013. One of the main objectives of the Iranian revolution was to have no social classes. In the post-revolutionary era, access to political power, an important basis for measuring influence and elite status in pre-revolutionary Iran, has continued to be important for ascribing status, even though the composition of the political elite has changed. For 10 years after 1979, gaining entry to the political elite at the national or provincial level depended on having revolutionary credentials, that is, being able to provide evidence of having participated in the demonstrations and other revolutionary activities during 1978‚Äì79, and having a reputation for being a good Muslim, that is, attending public prayers and observing Islamic codes of conduct in one‚Äôs private life. Revolutionary credentials became less significant for the generation that matured after the early 1990s. Education, especially a college degree, became an informal substitute for revolutionary credentials.http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/pdf/CS_Iran.pdf Upper class The top ten percent earners in Iranian society pay 3% of all income taxes, while in the United States the top 10% pay more than 70% of the total income taxes (US billionaires are collectively richer than their Iranian counterparts, however). The postrevolutionary upper class consisted of some of the same social groups as the old elite, such as large landowners, industrialists, financiers, and large-scale merchants. Most of these groups have migrated out of Iran and their assets have been confiscated by the state. A minority of the pre-revolutionary upper class continue to work and live within Iran. For the most part, however, such persons did not occupy positions of political influence. Those with political influence comprised senior clergy, high- ranking bureaucrats, executive officers of public and private corporations and charitable foundations, and wealthy entrepreneurs; none had been part of the pre-revolutionary economic and social elite. Although a reputation for piety and loyalty to the ideals of the Revolution initially was a more important attribute than family or wealth for participation in the post-revolutionary political elite, those who attained politically powerful positions received generous salaries that elevated them to the top income brackets and opened access to multiple legitimate opportunities for acquiring more wealth. The children of the new elite generally have been encouraged to get college educations, and postgraduate degrees from foreign universities have become status symbols since the mid-1990s. These social trends have gradually but informally altered the criteria for recruitment into the political elite: Possessing a university degree and having ties to a prominent religious or revolutionary family have become advantageous in the competition for politically influential positions. As of 2016, Iran had an estimated three million people with more than 1 billion Tomans ($270,000), 32,000 \\"high net worth individuals\\" with a net worth of at least $3 million, 1,300 multimillionaires with net assets of $10 million or more and four billionaires. Then-Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad says 60 percent of his country's wealth is controlled by just 300 people in Iran (out of a population of 80 million in 2016). Rich Iranians, companies, and state-backed buyers will spend up to $8.5 billion on overseas real estate over the next five-to-10 years (2016). Middle class After the Revolution, the composition of the middle class in Iran did not change significantly, but its size doubled from about 15 percent of the population in 1979 to more than 32 percent in 2000.Iran, a country study, area handbook series After the revolution, the composition of the middle class did not change significantly, but its size doubled from about 15 percent of the population in 1979 to more than 32 percent in 2000. Several prerevolutionary social groups still were identifiable, including entrepreneurs, bazaar merchants, physicians, engineers, university teachers, managers of private and public concerns, civil servants, teachers, medium-scale landowners, junior military officers, and the middle ranks of the Shia clergy. New groups also emerged, including technicians in specialized fields such as communications, computers, electronics, and medical services; owners of small-scale factories employing fewer than 50 workers; owners of construction firms and transport companies; and professional staff of broadcast and print media. Merchants, especially those with ties to bazaar-based organizations even though their stores were physically located outside the traditional covered bazaars, gained access to political power that they had lacked before the Revolution. The prerevolutionary cultural divide between those middle-class individuals who had a secular outlook and those who valued a role for religion in both public and private life did not disappear. Since 1979, however, the political relationship between these two contrasting views has reversed. Whereas under the monarchy the state tried to restrict religion to the private sphere, under the Islamic Republic the state consciously has promoted religion in public life. Secularly oriented Iranians have tended to resent this dominant role of the religious outlook in politics and society, especially its manifestations in numerous laws and regulations that they perceive as interfering with their personal lives. Whereas the secular-religious divide cuts across all occupational groups, in general those who promote religious values and the public observance of prayers and religious rituals tend to be more heavily concentrated in the bazaar, security forces, and managerial positions in the bureaucracies than in other lines of work and other professions. Working class Unemployment rate, per-capita income growth and minimum wage (2000‚Äì2009). An urban industrial working class separate from the traditional artisan class of the towns has been in the process of formation since the early twentieth century. The industrialization programs of the Pahlavi shahs provided the impetus for the expansion of this class. By the early 1970s, a distinct working-class identity, 'kargar', had emerged, although those who applied this term to themselves did not constitute a unified group. Rather, the working class was segmented by economic sectors: the oil industry, manufacturing, construction, and transportation; also, many members of the working class were employed as mechanics. The largest component, factory workers, numbered about 2.5 million on the eve of the Revolution, double the number in 1965, accounting for 25 percent of Iran's total labor force. Since 1979, the urban working class has continued to expand; by the early 2000s, it constituted more than 45 percent of the employed labor force. As was the situation before the Revolution, however, the workers within any one occupation did not share a common identity but rather were divided according to their perceived skills. For example, skilled construction workers, such as carpenters, electricians, and plumbers, earned significantly higher wages than the more numerous unskilled workers and tended to look down on them. Similar status differences were common among workers in the oil industry and manufacturing. An estimated 7 percent of all workers were Afghan refugees in the early 2000s. These workers were concentrated in unskilled jobs, especially in construction. Because most Afghan workers did not have work permits after 1992 and thus worked illegally, employers could pay them less than the daily minimum wage rates and not provide them with benefits required for Iranian workers. Under both the monarchy and the republic, the government has strictly controlled union activity. After the Revolution, the Ministry of Labor established the Workers‚Äô House to sponsor Islamic unions in large manufacturing concerns. These unions discourage strikes through a combination of cooptation of workers through periodic raises and bonuses and cooperation with authorities to identify and discipline workers who exhibit tendencies toward independence. The Islamic unions generally have been effective in preventing major strikes by workers; a long history of factionalism among different working-class occupational groups and between skilled and unskilled workers within individual industries has contributed to this relative success. Nevertheless, since the early 1990s scattered strikes have defied union control. In some instances, the strikes have been resolved peacefully through negotiations, while in other cases they have been repressed violently by security forces. Lower class A homeless man in Ahvaz, Iran The working class is part of the overall urban lower class, or mostazafin, a social stratum that includes all families whose household incomes place them marginally above, at, or below the officially defined poverty line. In cities with populations greater than 250,000, the lower class makes up an average of 40 to 50 percent of the total population; the lower-class proportion generally is less in smaller cities (50,000 to 250,000 population) and towns. In 2010, Iran's Department of Statistics announced that 10 million Iranians live under the absolute poverty line and 30 million live under the relative poverty line. The lower class can be divided into two groups: the marginally poor, who receive regular incomes on a weekly or monthly basis; and the very poor, whose incomes vary from month to month and who thus experience difficulty in paying for food, housing, and utilities. Recipients of regular incomes include pensioners, industrial and construction workers, and people employed in the diverse services sector, such as attendants in barbershops, beauty salons, and public bathhouses, bakery workers, sales clerks, domestic servants, gardeners, garbage and trash collectors, painters and plasterers (of homes), porters, street cleaners, peddlers, street vendors, office cleaners, and laundry workers. These job categories, as well as others, also include at least one million workers who are employed only occasionally or seasonally, primarily as a result of the shortage of full-time positions in an economy that has had an official unemployment rate ranging between 10 and 15 percent of the labor force since the early 1990s. Although many government agencies and private charities provide assistance to the poor, a social stigma is associated with accepting such aid, especially among adult men, whom others judge according to their ability to support a family. Among some marginally poor people in the largest cities, especially families with female heads of household, there has been an increasing tendency since the mid-1990s to rely on begging to supplement income, A few poor neighborhoods in the largest cities, such as 'Khakh-e sefid' in southeastern Tehran Province, have acquired negative reputations because gangs have established safe houses there for illegal activities such as prostitution, gambling, and drug trafficking. Out of the 15,000 homeless persons in Iran, 10,000 are men. There are between 60,000 and 200,000 street children in Iran.

Gall came to prominence as a goalscorer with Greenwich Borough in the Kent League before the manager of Maidstone United, then a Conference club, took a chance on him. Gall reproduced his scoring form at the higher level, helping the club to promotion into the Football League and coming close to a second consecutive promotion. A move to the Second Division with Brighton & Hove Albion brought him another 14 goals and the club's Player of the Year award before a knee injury put an end to his professional career after only three seasons. Career Gall was born in Brixton, south London. A prolific scorer for Greenwich Borough in the Kent League, playing part-time while employed in his father's bakery, he was watched by representatives of several Football League clubs. Loss of form ‚Äì attributed by the player himself to an inability to concentrate because \\"so many clubs were watching me was on my mind a lot\\" ‚Äì caused him to lose his place. He signed for Conference club Maidstone United in February 1988 for a ¬£2,000 fee. Maidstone manager John Still was nevertheless surprised that no League club had been prepared to risk such a small sum on a player of potential, albeit one playing at an \\"fairly low\\" level. Gall scored 14 goals from as many games for Maidstone in what remained of the 1987‚Äì88 season, and added another four in the opening two games of the next. In October 1988, the player turned down the opportunity to go on loan to Second Division club Brighton & Hove Albion; Brighton were interested in taking the player on a permanent deal, but the price-tag of ¬£125,000 was too steep for them. By mid-December, Gall and his strike partner, former Brentford player Steve Butler, had 43 goals between them for the season, and were being described as \\"the most effective goalscoring partnership in non-League football\\", Gall's \\"exceptional pace and powerful shooting\\" complementing the \\"elegant and elusive\\" Butler. Still suggested that Gall's improvement since his arrival at Maidstone had been such that, with the benefit of full-time training, he could become an \\"exceptional player\\". An arrangement was made in January 1989 for him to train two days a week with Second Division club Crystal Palace. Butler and Gall contributed 26 goals apiece as Maidstone won the 1989 Conference title, thus earning promotion to the Fourth Division of the Football League. Gall and his club made their Football League debuts on 19 August 1989, as Maidstone lost 1‚Äì0 away at Peterborough United. His first League goals came on 16 September, scoring twice in a 3‚Äì2 defeat of Grimsby Town. Gall and Butler's partnership continued into the Football League. By the end of the regular season, they had scored 39 League goals between them to help the club to fifth position and a place in the semi-final of the first ever Fourth Division play-offs. Playing Cambridge United away from home, Maidstone fell a goal behind, but in the 90th minute of the match, Gall scored an equaliser: a long throw was headed against his own crossbar by Cambridge striker Dion Dublin, helping out in defence, and the rebound fell for Gall seven yards out. In the home leg, with the game goalless and \\"heading for injury time, Gall found himself clean through but could only put the ball wide\\". In the play-offs, the away goals rule applied only after extra time, and Cambridge scored twice in the extra 30-minute period to progress to the final. He scored 31 goals for the club from 85 League games before signing for Brighton & Hove Albion for a ¬£45,000 fee in October 1991, as a replacement for John Byrne, who had just transferred to Sunderland for ¬£225,000. Despite only joining the club two months into the season, the \\"ever-willing and speedy\\" Gall finished as Brighton's top scorer, with 14 goals in all competitions (13 in the League). He \\"quickly became a crowd favourite in a struggling side\\", and was chosen as the club's Player of the Season. He never played professional football again. After two operations on his left knee, Gall retired on specialist medical advice in December 1992 and resumed working in the family bakery.

A 20th century recumbent effigy at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, China A tomb effigy, usually a recumbent effigy or, in French, gisant (French, \\"lying\\"), is a sculpted figure on a tomb monument depicting in effigy the deceased.Lucie-Smith, Edward (1984), The Thames and Hudson Dictionary of Art Terms, Thames and Hudson, pg 89. These compositions were developed in Western Europe in the Middle Ages, and continued in use through the Renaissance and early modern period; they are still sometimes used. They typically represent the deceased in a state of \\"eternal repose\\", lying with hands folded in prayer and awaiting resurrection. A husband and wife may be depicted lying side by side. An important official or leader may be shown holding his attributes of office or dressed in the formal attire of his official status or social class. The life-size recumbent effigy was first found in the tombs of royalty and senior clerics, and then spread to the nobility. A particular type of late medieval effigy was the transi, or cadaver monument, in which the effigy is in the macabre form of a decomposing corpse, or such a figure lies on a lower level, beneath a more conventional effigy. In the same period small figures of mourners called weepers or pleurants were added below the effigy to important tombs. In the Early Modern period European effigies are often shown as alive, and either kneeling or in a more active pose, especially for military figures. During the Renaissance, other non- recumbent types of effigy became more popular. Variations showed the deceased lying on their side as if reading, kneeling in prayer and even standing. The recumbent effigy had something of a vogue during the Gothic revival period of the 19th century, especially for bishops and other clerics. Many graves at Monument Cemetery in Milan have recumbent figures. Some of the best-known examples of the form are in Westminster Abbey in London, Saint Peter's in Rome, Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice (twenty-five Doges), and the Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence. A celebrated poem describing and reflecting on a pair of stone effigies is An Arundel Tomb by Philip Larkin. History =Ancient precursors= Recumbent effigies were a common tradition in Etruscan funerary art, examples are known in both ceramic and stone. The deceased was typically depicted alive as at a feast, lying sideways, propped up on one arm and sometimes holding a cup. Usually these were rather smaller than life-size. The Romans continued this tradition, though they also created many other types of funerary effigy. Their faces are often clearly portraits of individuals. =Medieval= The first medieval gisants emerged in the 12th century. They were executed in low relief, and were horizontal, but appeared as in life. The faces were generalized rather than portraits. Gradually these became full high-relief effigies, usually recumbent, as in death, and, by the 14th century, with hands together in prayer. In general, such monumental effigies were carved in stone, marble or wood, or cast in bronze or brass. Often the stone effigies were painted to simulate life, but in the majority of the medieval monuments, this has long since disappeared. The cross-legged attitude of many English armoured figures of the late 13th or early 14th centuries was long supposed to imply that the deceased had served in the Crusades, had taken crusading vows, or more specifically had been a Knight Templar; but these theories are now rejected by scholars. By the early 13th century, effigies began to be raised on tomb-style chests (known as tomb chests or altar tombs) decorated with foliage, heraldry or architectural detailing. Soon such chests also stood alone with varying degrees of decoration. By the end of the century, these often had architectural canopies and figured \\"weepers\\" or \\"mourners\\" ‚Äî representing friends or relatives and identified by their coats of arms ‚Äî were popular decorative features. In Britain the \\"large-scale production of military effigies\\" began in the middle of the 13th century, as the result of the \\"emergence of a new patron class\\" of knights, who were fewer in number but wealthier than before.Stone, 114 Another late medieval fashion was to show the person in an advanced state of decomposition, perhaps as a secondary effigy. This type of tomb is known as a transi. =Later= In Spain the iconography of Christ lying ('Cristo yacente'), as though an effigy, was very popular until the late 18th century. One of the famous sculptors known for this iconography was Gregorio Fern√°ndez, see Cristo Yacente of El Pardo. A late example of a stone effigy is that of T. E. Lawrence (\\"Lawrence of Arabia\\") by Eric Kennington, in St Martin's Church, Wareham, Dorset, installed in 1939. Another example is the effigy of Aubrey Herbert (d. 1923) in the Church of St Nicholas, Brushford in Somerset.

The journal served liberal-minded readers, known as the intelligentsia. Such major novels as Ivan Goncharov's Oblomov (1859) and Fyodor Dostoyevsky's The Adolescent (1875) made their first appearance in Otechestvennye Zapiski. Founded by Pavel Svinyin in 1818, the journal was published irregularly until 1820. It was closed down in 1830 but resurfaced several years later, with Andrey Krayevsky as its publisher. The renovated magazine regularly published articles by Vissarion Belinsky and Alexander Herzen, catering to well-educated liberals. Other notable contributors included: * Mikhail Bakunin * Timofey Granovsky * Nikolay Nekrasov * Ivan Turgenev * Vladimir Dahl * Vladimir Odoyevsky * Aleksey Pisemsky * Afanasy Fet In 1846 Nekrasov persuaded Belinsky and other contributors to leave Otechestvennye Zapiski for his own Sovremennik. As a result, the former declined in circulation and influence. It was overshadowed by the more radical Sovremennik for 20 years, until the latter was banned in 1866. In 1868 Nekrasov acquired Otechestvennye Zapiski from Krayevsky and started editing it jointly with Saltykov-Shchedrin. After Nekrasov's death Saltykov-Schedrin was its sole editor-in-chief, radicalizing the journal even further. In the 1870s it was transformed into a mouthpiece of the Narodnik movement.The Russian Humanitarian Encyclopaedic Dictionary Despite Saltykov's mastery of \\"Aesopian\\" language, the tsarist authorities closed Otechestvennye zapiski in 1884 as \\"an organ of the press which not only opens its pages to the spread of dangerous ideas, but even has as its closest collaborators people who belong to secret societies\\".Quoted from: Geoffrey A.

These keywords or language are applied by training a system on the rules that determine what words to match. There are additional parts to this such as syntax, usage, proximity, and other algorithms based on the system and what is required for indexing. This is taken into account using Boolean statements to gather and capture the indexing information out of the text. As the number of documents exponentially increases with the proliferation of the Internet, automatic indexing will become essential to maintaining the ability to find relevant information in a sea of irrelevant information. Natural language systems are used to train a system based on seven different methods to help with this sea of irrelevant information. These methods are Morphological, Lexical, Syntactic, Numerical, Phraseological, Semantic, and Pragmatic. Each of these look and different parts of speed and terms to build a domain for the specific information that is being covered for indexing. This is used in the automated process of indexing. The automated process can encounter problems and these are primarily caused by two factors: 1) the complexity of the language; and, 2) the lack intuitiveness and the difficulty in extrapolating concepts out of statements on the part of the computing technology. These are primarily linguistic challenges and specific problems involve semantic and syntactic aspects of language. These problems occur based on defined keywords. With these keywords you are able to determine the accuracy of the system based on Hits, Misses, and Noise. These terms relate to exact matches, keywords that a computerized system missed that a human wouldn't, and keywords that the computer selected that a human would not have. The Accuracy statistic based on this should be above 85% for Hits out of 100% for human indexing. This puts Misses and Noise combined to be 15% or less. This scale provides a basis for what is considered a good Automatic Indexing System and shows where problems are being encountered.  History  There are scholars who cite that the subject of automatic indexing attracted attention as early as the 1950s, particularly with the demand for faster and more comprehensive access to scientific and engineering literature. This attention in indexing began with text processing between 1957 and 1959 by H.P. Lunh through a series of papers that were published. Lunh proposed that a computer could handle keyword matching, sorting, and content analysis. This was the beginning of Automatic Indexing and the formula to pull keywords from text based on frequency analysis. It was later determined that frequency alone was not sufficient for good descriptors however this began the path to where we are now with Automatic Indexing.Historical Note: The Past Thirty Years in Information Retrieval Salton, Gerard Journal of the American Society for Information Science (1986-1998); Sep 1987; 38, 5; ProQuest pg. 375 This was highlighted by the information explosion, which was predicted in the 1960s and came about through the emergence of information technology and the World Wide Web. The prediction was prepared by Mooers where an outline was created with the expected role that computing would have for text processing and information retrieval. This prediction said that machines would be used for storage of documents in large collections and that we would use these machines to run searches. Mooers also predicted the online aspect and retrieval environment for indexing databases. This led Mooers to predict an Induction Inference Machine which would revolutionize indexing. This phenomenon required the development of an indexing system that can cope with the challenge of storing and organizing vast amount of data and can facilitate information access. New electronic hardware further advanced automated indexing since it overcame the barrier imposed by old paper archives, allowing the encoding of information at the molecular level. With this new electronic hardware there were tools developed for assisting users. These were used to manage files and were organized into different categories such as PDM Suites like Outlook or Lotus Note and Mind Mapping Tools such as MindManager and Freemind. These allow users to focus on storage and building a cognitive model. The automatic indexing is also partly driven by the emergence of the field called computational linguistics, which steered research that eventually produced techniques such as the application of computer analysis to the structure and meaning of languages. Automatic indexing is further spurred by research and development in the area of artificial intelligence and self-organizing system also referred to as thinking machine.

It stars Catherine Deneuve, G√©rard Depardieu, Fabrice Luchini, Karin Viard, Judith Godr√®che and J√©r√©mie Renier. Set in 1977, the film tells the story of a submissive wife who gets to run her husband's umbrella factory, after the employees rebel against their tyrannical manager. In French, a potiche is a decorative vase, but by extension means \\"window dressing\\" or, roughly, \\"trophy wife\\". The film competed at the 67th Venice International Film Festival and received two Magritte Award nominations, winning Best Supporting Actor for J√©r√©mie Renier. Cast * Catherine Deneuve as Suzanne Pujol ** √âlodie Fr√©g√© as Young Suzanne * G√©rard Depardieu as Maurice Babin * Fabrice Luchini as Robert Pujol * Karin Viard as Nad√®ge Dumoulin * Judith Godr√®che as Jo√´lle * J√©r√©mie Renier as Laurent Pujol * Bruno Lochet as Andr√© Ferron * √âvelyne Dandry as Suzanne's sister Production Fran√ßois Ozon saw the play Potiche by Pierre Barillet and Jean-Pierre Gr√©dy about ten years before he made the film. According to Ozon, the genesis of the film version was, partly, that he had been approached by the producers √âric and Nicolas Altmayer and asked to make a biographical film about Nicolas Sarkozy, and, partly, his experiences from the 2007 presidential campaign, where he followed the Socialist Party's candidate S√©gol√®ne Royal. While writing the screenplay, Ozon regularly met with Barillet, who gladly approved the tweaks made in order to enhance the story's relevance for contemporary society. The 1970s setting was, however, retained; this was both because the distance allowed the director to make a more humorous film, and because France was more politically divided in the 1970s, which made the class relations more remarkable. The political career of Suzanne was entirely Ozon's own addition to the story, which in its original incarnation ended when Robert returns to the factory. The project was led by Mandarin Cin√©ma, with co-production support from Production Services Belgium. Principal photography took place in Belgium from 26 October 2009 and lasted eight weeks. The film was deliberately given a theatrical look in order to create distance and give the audience a constant awareness of watching a work of fiction. An important influence for the visual style was the cinema of Jacques Demy. The soundtrack includes Mich√®le Torr with \\"Emm√®ne-moi danser ce soir\\", \\"Il √©tait une fois\\", \\"Viens faire un tour sous la pluie\\" and Jean Ferrat's \\"C'est beau la vie\\". Release The film premiered on 4 September 2010 in competition at the 67th Venice International Film Festival. It was released in France and Belgium on 10 November. Launched in 440 prints through Mars Distribution, Potiche had 875,000 admissions during its first week in French theatres. At its peak the film was playing in 542 venues. When the theatrical run ended, the total number of tickets sold in France had reached 2,318,221. As of 28 June 2011, Box Office Mojo reported that the worldwide theatrical revenues of the film corresponded to 23,157,170 US dollars. =Overseas= A subtitled version in English was released on DVD in October 2011. Clips from the film were used in \\"trailers\\" subtitled by Orange, with all the dialogue reworded to be about mobile phones, in order to illustrate how phones can ruin a film. Reception On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 82%, based on 114 reviews, and an average rating of 6.7/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 68 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".

Lawton (born October 3, 1961) is an American author, motivational speaker, ex-convict, and YouTuber. He is known as America's biggest jewel thief, who after being incarcerated, reformed his ways and now helps and inspires younger people stay out of prison and change their life path. He is also an advocate for prison reform.  Early life and organized crime  Born in North Hempstead, New York on October 3, 1961, Lawton is the son of David A. Lawton, a sheet metal worker, and Irene Geoffrion, a registered nurse. He is the fourth of five children: two older sisters, an older brother, and one younger sister. Lawton was raised in the Bronx, New York. Lawton attended St. Francis de Chantal Catholic School for grades one through six. At age 12, Lawton was drawn to organized crime. He sold football tickets in his middle- class neighbourhood of Locust Point and was introduced to gambling. He and his friends also stole and sold cars that were scrapped for parts during the 70s. He attended intermediate PS 192, followed by Lehman High School. Seeing no future in the Bronx, Lawton joined the Coast Guard in August 1979 at the age of 17. After seven years in the Coast Guard, Lawton was medically retired due to a back injury. He moved to Brooklyn, where Lawton was drawn back into organized crime as a bookmaker and collector while working in bars in Queens and Brooklyn. Lawton's acumen and aggressiveness eventually caught the attention of higher-ups in organized crime. This led to his occupation as a jewelry thief and robbing stores all along the East Coast of the United States. He also used part of his earnings to purchase an Italian pizza restaurant in North Lauderdale, Florida, which he later burned down in an insurance fraud scam.  Arrest and prison sentence  Lawton went to prison alone on a Hobbs Act racketeering case. He was arrested December 2, 1996, in connection with organized crime and jewelry store robberies and sentenced to 12 years in federal prison.Lawton and Golenberg. 130‚Äì150. In 1997 he was sent to USP Atlanta, Georgia, and for the remaining 11 years to the following institutions: FCI Coleman, Florida, FCI Jesup, Georgia, FCI Edgefield, South Carolina, FCI Yazoo, Mississippi, FCI Forrest City, Arkansas.Lawton and Golenberg. 209‚Äì224. In 2003, Lawton spoke out against the abuse suffered by prisoners in the Federal prison system, claiming that a large portion of inmates suffered extraordinary abuse at the hands of prison guards, in some cases leading to inmate deaths‚Äîincluding ignoring an inmate with serious cancer until he died of hemorrhaging in his cell, and ignoring a man with pain in the chest and arm who died in front of Lawton. When Lawton sent letters to U.S. senators outlining this abuse and the lack of proper medical care at the facilities in which he was housed, he was placed in solitary confinement for eleven months. In all, he spent nearly three years in solitary confinement. Lawton served his time and on August 24, 2007, was released and started three years' supervised release. While in prison, Lawton earned a paralegal degree and became a gang mediator. Following his release, he became an advocate for many ex-offenders' issues, including prison conditions as well as post-release debt loads and their influence on unemployed ex-convicts.  Post-release career  = Reality Check Program = Since his release from Federal prison in 2007, Lawton has worked with teens and young adults in an effort to educate them about the realities of crime and prison. The main vehicle through which Lawton has done this is the Reality Check Program, which uses lectures, DVDs, and other educational materials to reach at-risk youth before they end up in prison. Lawton's Reality Check Program consists of four parts: Lawton's early life, what prison is really like, what you will lose, and avoiding and dissolving bad associations. The program is available for groups, organizations, schools, and corporations as well as private individual one on one sessions. Additionally, consulting and guidance are available from Lawton and the Reality Check Program. Lawton's programs have been used by judges, police chiefs, sheriffs, public defenders, state attorneys, the federal government weed and seed program, and families. Other activities provided by the program include an annual golf outing to allow at-risk youth the opportunity to interact with officials. The event also shows the officials, kids, when they are not in trouble. In 2010, Lawton filmed the pilot for a new reality show based on his work with at-risk youth which he called Lawton's Law. The Reality Check Program also began offering its quarterly \\"Community Champion\\" award, with the first recipient being Florida fire-fighter and avid volunteer Aldo Nunez. =Jewelry Robbery Prevention= In 2008, Lawton founded Jewelry Robbery Prevention, a consultancy firm that works with insurance companies, private individuals, jewelry stores, police, and the media on how to better prevent jewel robberies, as well as explaining the mindset of jewel thieves to potential targets. In an interview about what stores can do to protect themselves, he has said important things to consider are the ease at which pedestrians can see into the store from the window, using video cameras that upload all footage to an off-site server, and using care when dealing with customers that want to see progressively bigger stones while browsing. = Media personality = Larry Lawton has appeared on TV, radio, talked to audiences throughout the United States as part of the Reality Check Program, jewelry store robberies, crime issues, and prison issues. He hosted his own radio show on AM1300 locally in Melbourne, Florida and on the Internet. The show ended in 2012 due to Lawton's other commitments. His national TV appearances and radio broadcasts include The Daily Show with Jon Stewart on two occasions playing himself as a character in comedy sketches, on August 12, 2009 and April 15, 2010. He has also appeared on The 700 Club on the Christian Broadcasting Network and on the FOX News Huckabee show, where Larry discussed his criminal background and how he came to help at-risk youth. He also appeared many times on Bulldog's Rude Awakening Show in Ocean City, Maryland and The Mancow Show, as well as others. For example, Lawton was the Casey Anthony expert for FOX Orlando coverage of Casey's release from confinement, as well as for other current events cases involving prisoners. Since 2013 Lawton's media appearances have focused more on jewelry thefts in the news, including interviews with CNN, Fox Business, and ABC World News. Lawton also hosts a local cable television show entitled Lawton's Law in the Orlando area Bright House Networks. = Author of Gangster Redemption = In 2012 Lawton co-authored a memoir entitled Gangster Redemption. The book covered his life of crime, imprisonment, and the founding of his charitable organizations following his release.  Recognition  On August 16, 2013, Lawton became the first ex-con in American history to be named an honorary police officer. The Lake St. Louis, Missouri Police Department swore in Lawton for his law enforcement initiatives since leaving prison. On November 21, 2013, Congressman Bill Posey recognized the Reality Check program and Lawton's honorary police officer status in an open session of the United States Congress.
