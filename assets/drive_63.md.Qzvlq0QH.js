He Is best known for his work as color commentator for World Championship Wrestling (WCW). Madden hosts a weekday afternoon show from 3-6 PM on local radio station, 105.9 The X, and serves as a part-time sports columnist for TribLive. Career A 1982 graduate of Duquesne University, and member of Tau Kappa Epsilon International Fraternity, Madden wrote for Pro Wrestling Torch from 1992 to 1994 before beginning work as a TV color commentator and magazine writer for World Championship Wrestling. Shortly before Vince McMahon purchased WCW in March 2001, Madden was fired for making disparaging remarks about the company, lobbying for the return of the fired Scott Hall, and disclosing information about the sale of WCW. He spent several years as a regular columnist for Wade Keller's Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter. He currently writes occasional Editorials for the Wrestlezone.com website, having previously featured on their Chair Shot Reality, weekly discussion show. Madden has also worked within mainstream sports journalism, including fifteen years at the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, where he primarily covered high schools for the paper's suburban sections, as well as stints at the now- defunct Penguins Report and the weekly Pittsburgh City Paper. He subsequently appeared as a featured guest on Action Sports Sunday on WTAE-TV, a half-hour sports discussion show. The Post-Gazette reported on November 17, 2006 that WTAE-TV dropped Mark Madden as a freelance sports commentator on its Sunday night sports show. In 2015, Madden joined WPNT for a nightly televised sports talk show, an edited replay of his radio show, which was removed from WPNT's schedule in 2016. Madden often nicknames himself the \\"Super Genius\\" on his programs and social media due to having an IQ score of 166, of which he was tested on in the fourth grade.https://thealmanac.net/sports/super-genius- raising-money-for-south-fayette-hockey- program/article_4ccfef76-0cf5-11e8-a2ca-03e07e947075.html Madden wrote a weekly column called \\"Monday Madden\\" for the Beaver County Times, a Pittsburgh-area newspaper, starting in May 2007; the column continued for over a decade until his departure to work for TribLive in 2018. In May 2008, Madden was fired from his talk show on Pittsburgh's 1250 ESPN radio station for the following comment: \\"I'm very disappointed to hear that Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts is near death because of a brain tumor. I always hoped Senator Kennedy would live long enough to be assassinated.\\" Another area of sports in which Madden is heavily involved is the game of street hockey. Madden runs Street Hockey USA, and is also involved in the American Street Hockey Institute, a non-profit organization dedicated to growing the game of street/dek/ball hockey in America. He has coached numerous National Champion teams over the years (most notably his Pittsburgh Wizards team), as well as coaching the United States Junior team to a gold medal in the 2006 World Junior Championship in Germany. On April 3, 2011, his Beaver County Times column addressed a then-current grand jury investigation into alleged child sexual abuse by former Penn State football assistant coach Jerry Sandusky, suggesting the possibility of a Penn State cover-up. After Sandusky was indicted on over 40 felony charges, Madden appeared on The Dennis and Callahan Show, a Boston sports talk radio program, on November 10. During his appearance, he reported a rumor being investigated by two prominent columnists that Sandusky and his Second Mile children's charity may have been \\"pimping out young boys to rich donors.\\" Madden's views on Pittsburgh's three major professional sports teams are mixed. While Madden usually defends the Penguins, he has mixed views about the Pittsburgh Steelers and is harshly critical of the Pittsburgh Pirates. Madden often praises the Rooney family for going all-out to win but questions the team's decisions regarding off-field actions of their players, and was particularly critical of Antonio Brown. With regards to the Pirates, Madden is highly critical of team owner Robert Nutting placing profits ahead of putting a competitive product on the field and is critical of Pirates fans who continuously support the team, feeling that the team will not be consistently a contender unless Nutting sells the team. Madden is also known for his running feud with Diamond Dallas Page. Madden has often blamed Page for his firing from WCW (though he was happy to go at the time) and has often referred to him as \\"DDMe\\" on his online articles and radio shows. While Page has offered to appear on Madden's show, Madden declines each time. While Madden gave Page credit for turning around the lives of Jake Roberts and Scott Hall, he cited Page's use of TV cameras to film the progress of their rehabilitation in Page's home, which he felt was unnecessary and more or less was used to fuel Page's ego.http://www.mandatory.com/wrestlezone/news/873519-mark-madden-gives-his- thoughts-on-jim-cornette-the-wcw-vs-wwe-product-if-wcw-management-was-ever- upset-with-him-hawaiian-shirts- morehttp://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2015/0801/598978/ex-wcw-announcer- rips-ddp/ Personal life Madden is an avid fan of Liverpool F.C, and the Pittsburgh Penguins, and idolizes Penguins center Mario Lemieux. Late in Lemieux's career, Madden made note of his \\"repeatedly trying to score directly off faceoffs.\\" He once bet Lemieux $66 that he could not score directly off a draw. Lemieux thought the $66 bet was \\"cheap,\\" and challenged Madden to a $6,600 bet. Madden accepted, and agreed that all the money would go to the Mario Lemieux Foundation. Lemieux had attempted the shot several times, with the closest effort being a post shot against the Calgary Flames on December 21, 2002. On December 23, 2002, Lemieux lined up against Buffalo Sabres faceoff specialist Chris Gratton. With the Penguins tied 2-2 and Gratton being a left-handed draw, Lemieux used the opportunity to take the shot on net. Lemieux shot the puck as it was dropped, going between Gratton's legs, off defenseman Alexei Zhitnik's skate, and eventually past goaltender Mika Noronen. Lemieux immediately looked to the pressbox, where he knew Madden was watching the game, and raised his arms. Lemieux admitted to trying the shot several times and that it was a tough shot to do without a good bounce. After the goal, Madden said he was planning a telethon to help him raise the $6,600 promised to the Mario Lemieux Foundation. In addition to his love for the Penguins, Madden is known for his unabashed hate of the Philadelphia Flyers and often pokes fun at the fact that while they were the only Expansion Six team to win a Stanley Cup within the teams' first decade, the Flyers have had lack of success in winning the Cup again (despite regular season and postseason success) while the Penguins have doubled the Flyers in Cup wins. This eventually led to Madden creating a parody Twitter account \\"Since Flyers Last Cup\\", which daily counts how many days it has been since the Flyers last won the Cup. The account became so popular among Penguins fans and non-Flyers fans that the official Flyers Twitter account eventually blocked the \\"Since Flyers Last Cup\\" account. Madden was hospitalized on January 29, 2006 after suffering a heart attack during a dek-hockey tournament in Reading, Pennsylvania. Madden drove himself to a local hospital after feeling nauseated, and had the heart procedure done a day after checking in. He resumed his radio show three days later, although in a different time slot.

Early life Jullian was born in Bordeaux in 1919. His maternal grandfather was the historian Camille Jullian, known for his multi-volume history of Gaul; his mother had married a man named Simounet, a war veteran whose life ended in poverty and whose name Philippe rejected in favor of his more distinguished grandfather's.Ian Buruma, \\"Occupied Paris: The Sweet and the Cruel,\\" The New York Review of Books 56 (17 December 2009), online edition. Jullian studied literature at university but left to pursue drawing and painting. In his later years, he resided in England but regularly spent winters in Africa. He also travelled extensively in India and Egypt. Works One of his first officially noted works was the first \\"artist's\\" label for the famous wine from Ch√¢teau Mouton Rothschild in 1945, in memory of the World War II victory over Germany. Jullian's book illustrations are witty, ornate, and often grotesque. He produced illustrations for his own books as well as works by Honor√© de Balzac, Colette, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Ronald Firbank, Marcel Proust, and Oscar Wilde, among others. His books and articles on Art Nouveau, Symbolism, and other art movements of the fin-de-si√®cle helped bring about a revival of interest in the period. These include the biography Robert de Montesquiou (1965), Prince of Aesthetes (1967), Esth√©tes et Magiciens (1969) translated as Dreamers of Decadence (1971), Les Symbolistes (1973), and The Triumph of Art Nouveau (1974). Among others, he admired French painter Antonio de La Gandara. A collector, he published his autobiography, La Brocante, which detailed the \\"love of small objects\\", in 1975. Works of fiction by Jullian dealt with the decadent, sensual, and macabre. He explored the themes of homoeroticism, sado-masochism, transvestism and the aesthetic life. His gift for satire is evident both in fiction such as La Fuite en Egypte (1968; published as The Flight into Egypt, 1970) and in his works of social satire, including Dictionnaire du Snobisme (\\"The Snob-Spotter's Guide\\", 1958), Les Collectioneurs (\\"The Collectors\\", 1967), and most notably his collaboration with the British novelist Angus Wilson, For Whom the Cloche Tolls: A Scrap- Book of the Twenties (1953), which he also illustrated. Other books include Montmartre (1977) and Les Orientalistes (1977), works of art history; and biographies of Edward VII (1962), Wilde (1967), Gabriele D'Annunzio (1971), Jean Lorrain (1974), Violet Trefusis (1976), and Sarah Bernhardt. Jullian's Journal, 1940‚Äì1950 (published 2009) documents his experiences and responses to the German occupation of France. On 22 March 1944 he wrote: An article written by Jullian appeared in 1977 in the Architectural Digest about the Shah of Iran's new palace. Death In the 1970s Jullian experienced a series of personal tragedies: the death of his friend Violet Trefusis in 1972; the destruction of many of his possessions, including his pictures after a fire broke out in his apartment; and in September 1977 the stabbing to death by a stranger of his Moroccan manservant and companion, Hamoud, on whom he had increasingly depended. Five days afterwards he committed suicide by hanging. Bibliography * Edward and the Edwardians. Sidgwick & Jackson. (1967) * The Flight into Egypt Elek Books.

It is typically mostly mineral oil with a small amount of other ingredients, although synthetic oils are increasingly available.  Uses  Besides lubricating the moving parts of the valve, valve oil provides corrosion protection to the bare metal of the inner valve. While the valve piston or rotor is made of a metal which is more resistant to corrosion, the inner valve casing is typically bare brass. (The brass on the outside of a modern instrument is lacquered or plated to prevent corrosion.) The oil also completes the seal between the valve casing and the piston or rotor. Although a clean and unoiled valve of a well maintained instrument should move without unusual force, the inside of a musical instrument is a very inhospitable environment for a delicate valve mechanism. The musician constantly blows warm moist air through the valve. Worse, impurities may be blown from the musician's mouth into the instrument. Even if nothing grows in the valve, the condensation and changing temperature of the metal can cause an untreated valve to bind, possibly resulting in a stuck valve. Even a minor binding of a valve affects the play-ability of the instrument and is at least very annoying. Also, woodwind musicians use valve oil (called key oil for woodwinds since they do not have valves, they have keys) to lubricate the mechanism of the keys to improve the springback action. However, woodwinds usually oil their keys only every few months, whereas some brass players lubricate their valves several times a week.  Types  There are two main valve types on brass instruments: piston and rotor. Accordingly, vendors sell different types of oil, including scented varieties. Some vendors recommend up to three different types of oil for some valve types. Slide oil for trombones is also a very similar solution. The difference between oil types is primarily the viscosity. The minerals in the valve oil are dangerous and can cause serious health problems if swallowed. Synthetic valve oils have become more readily available. Their characteristics include, but are not necessarily limited to, greater compatibility with other related oils without chemical reactions (some types of mineral based oils or their additives were known to react with each other, forming thick solids - this required disassembly and complete cleaning of the valves to restore operation), slow evaporation or total lack of evaporation resulting in fewer oilings required, and less dissipation on contact with moisture inside the valve. Some synthetics have the additional advantage that they do not act as thinners for mineral-based slide greases (previously, mineral-based valve oil inserted into a valve by way of a tuning slide could carry some slide grease with it, fouling the valve). Finally, high-viscosity synthetic oils can increase valve compression and improve feel in instruments with worn valves, returning such instruments to playable condition.

Author of 23 books and more than 280 scientific papers and book chapters, his research articles include multiple papers from his longitudinal study in Milwaukee, WI, his development of a theory of ADHD as a disorder of executive functioning and self-regulation, his early research on family interaction patterns in ADHD children, his more recent studies on the nature of ADHD in adults, early intervention for children at risk for ADHD, training parents to manage ADHD and defiant behavior, and the nature of sluggish cognitive tempo. His research has been cited by more than 91,000 other authors and he has a H-index (citation impact factor) of 133 on Google Scholar. Barkley also edits The ADHD Report, a newsletter for clinicians and parents. Besides his clinical work, he is also an expert in the neuropsychology of executive function and self-regulation. He has given more than 800 invited lectures in more than 30 countries during his career, and is board certified in three clinical specialties: clinical neuropsychology, clinical psychology, and clinical child and adolescent psychology. Early life and education Barkley was born in Newburgh, New York. He was one of five children, born to Donald Stuart Barkley (27 February 1916 ‚Äì 15 June 1999) and Mildred Minerva (10 September 1914 ‚Äì 25 April 2008). Barkley had a twin brother, Ronald Foster Barkley, who was killed in a car crash on 24 July 2006. Barkley attributes his brother's history of dangerous and reckless behavior, including not wearing a seat belt and speeding at the time of his crash, to untreated ADHD. Ronald was several times over the legal alcohol limit, speeding and not wearing a seat belt at the time of his fatal crash.ADHD Nation ‚Äì Schwarz (2016). Barkley married his wife Patricia on 15 March 1969. He graduated from school in Maryland and did a tour of duty in the US air force including a year in Vietnam. He divorced in November 2019.

He was among the leaders of the y≈çga (or Western-style) movement in late 19th and early 20th-century Japanese painting. His real name was Kuroda Kiyoteru, which uses an alternate pronunciation of the Chinese characters. Biography =Early years= Kuroda was born in Takamibaba, Satsuma Domain (present day Kagoshima Prefecture), as the son of a samurai of the Shimazu clan, Kuroda Kiyokane and his wife Yaeko. At birth, the boy was named Shintar≈ç; this was changed to Kiyoteru in 1877, when he was 11. Even before his birth, Kuroda had been chosen by his paternal uncle, Kuroda Kiyotsuna, as heir; formally, he was adopted in 1871, after traveling to Tokyo with both his birth mother and adoptive mother to live at his uncle's estate. Kiyotsuna was also a Shimazu retainer, whose services to Emperor Meiji in the Bakumatsu period and at the Battle of Toba‚ÄìFushimi led to his appointment to high posts in the new imperial government; in 1887 he was named a viscount. Because of his position, the elder Kuroda was exposed to many of the modernizing trends and ideas coming into Japan during the early Meiji period; as his heir, young Kiyoteru also learned from them and took his lessons to heart. In his early teens, Kuroda began to learn the English language in preparation for his university studies; within two years, however, he had chosen to switch to French instead. At 17, he enrolled in pre-college courses in French, as preparation for his planned legal studies in college. Consequently, when in 1884 Kuroda's brother- in-law Hashiguchi Naouemon was appointed to the French Legation, it was decided that Kuroda would accompany him and his wife to Paris to begin his real studies of law. He arrived in Paris on March 18, 1884 and was to remain there for the next decade. =Studies in Paris= By early 1886 Kuroda had decided to abandon the study of law for a career as a painter; he had had painting lessons in his youth, and had been given a watercolor set by his adoptive mother as a present upon leaving for Paris, but he had never considered painting as anything more than a hobby. However, in February 1886 Kuroda was attending a party at the Japanese legation for Japanese nationals in Paris; here, he met the painters Yamamoto H≈çsui and Fuji Masazo, as well as art dealer Tadamasa Hayashi, a specialist in ukiyo-e. All three urged the young student to turn to painting, saying that he could better help his country by learning to paint like a Westerner rather than learning law. Kuroda agreed, formally abandoning his studies for the study of painting in August 1887 after trying, and failing, to reach a compromise between the two to please his father. In May 1886, Kuroda entered the studio of Rapha√´l Collin, a noted Academic art painter who had shown work in several Paris Salons. Kuroda was not the only Japanese painter studying under Collin at the time; Fuji Masazo was also one of his pupils. =Kuroda and Impressionism= Kuroda Seiki, Withered Field (Grez), c.1891, Kuroda Memorial Hall, Tokyo In 1886, Kuroda met another young Japanese painter, Kume Keiichiro, newly arrived in France, who also joined Collin's studio. The two became friends, and soon became roommates as well. It was during these years that he began to mature as a painter, following the traditional course of study in Academic art while also discovering plein-air painting. In 1890 Kuroda moved from Paris to the village of Grez-sur-Loing, an artists' colony which had been formed by painters from the United States and from northern Europe. Here he found inspiration in the landscape, as well as a young woman, Maria Billault, who became one of his best models. In 1893, Kuroda returned to Paris and began work on his most important painting to date, Morning Toilette, the first nude painting to be publicly exhibited in Japan. This large work, which was sadly destroyed in World War II, was accepted with great praise by the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts; Kuroda intended to bring it with him to Japan to shatter the Japanese prejudice against the depiction of the nude figure. With the painting in hand, he set out for home via the United States, arriving in July 1893. =Back in Japan= Kuroda was in France when the mandolin was spreading in the early 1890s. He painted this in France within a couple years of returning to Japan, about 10 years before the mandolin arrived in his home country. Soon after arriving at home, Kuroda traveled to Kyoto to soak up the local culture, which he had missed after spending a full third of his life abroad. He translated what he saw into some of his best paintings, such as A Maiko Girl (1893) (n.d., Tokyo National Museum) and Talk on Ancient Romance (1898, destroyed). At the same time, Kuroda was taking on an ever-greater role as a reformer; as one of the few Japanese artists who had studied in Paris, he was thus uniquely qualified to teach his countrymen about what was going on in the Western art world at the time. Furthermore, Kuroda was prepared to teach painting, passing the lessons he had learned along to a new generation of painters. He took over the painting school founded by Yamamoto H≈çsui, the Seikokan, and renamed it the Tenshin Dojo; the two men together became its directors. The school was modeled on Western precepts, and students were taught the basics of plein-air painting. Until Kuroda's return to Japan, the prevalent style was based on the Barbizon school, which were advocated by the Italian artist Antonio Fontanesi at the Kobu Bijutsu Gakko from 1876. Kuroda's style of bright color tones emphasizing the changes of light and atmosphere were considered revolutionary.

Although he was awarded a prize for the painting, the exhibition of a picture of a nude woman before so many visitors outraged many, and led to a furor in the press where critics condemned the perceived flouting of social standards. None criticized the technical aspects of the painting, choosing instead to lambaste Kuroda for its subject matter. Kume, Kuroda's friend from his Paris days, wrote a spirited defense of the nude figure in art for newspaper publication, but this helped little. For his part, Kuroda maintained a public silence on the issue; privately, however, he expressed the opinion that morally, at least, he had won the day. Further controversy erupted in October of the same year, when Kuroda exhibited 21 of his works done in Europe at the 7th Exhibition of the Meiji Bijutsukai (Japan's only group of Western-style painters at the time). Kume entered some of his work in the exhibition, as did several students at the Tenshin Dojo. Visitors were struck by the vast differences between Kuroda's plein-air-derived style and the more formal work of the other artists, leading critics to focus on the difference as one between the old and the new. Some even went so far as to suggest a factional difference between two \\"schools\\" of painting. Displeased by the bureaucratic methods inherent in the hierarchy of the Meiji Bijutsukai, Kuroda spearheaded the formation of a new artists' society the following year; he was joined in his effort by Kume, as well as by a number of their students. The new group was christened Hakubakai, after a brand of unrefined sake called Shirouma favored by the men. The Hakubakai had no set rules; rather, it was a free, equal gathering of like-thinking artists whose only goal was to find a way for members to display their works. The group held exhibitions every year until it dissolved in 1911; in total, thirteen shows were set up. A number of artists received their first exposure in these exhibitions; among them were Fujishima Takeji and Aoki Shigeru. =Academic career= Kuroda Seiki, study for Talk on Ancient Romance (Composition II), 1896 In 1896, a Department of Western Painting was formed at the Tokyo Bijutsu Gakko (the forerunner of the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music), and Kuroda was invited to become its director. This allowed him to design an even broader curriculum, meant for general students of art, and to be better equipped to reach a broader public. An academic role, with its emphasis on structure and conformity, contrasted with the painter's focus on individuality, but Kuroda nonetheless approached his new role with zeal. Kuroda also insisted that courses in anatomy and the sketching of a live nude model be included in the curriculum. Ultimately, Kuroda set as his goal the teaching of history painting, feeling that it was the most important genre for students to learn. In his opinion, paintings depicting myths, history, or themes such as love or courage, in which figures painted in poses and compositions reflecting these issues had the highest social value. Coinciding with this was the creation of one of his most ambitious works, the Talk on Ancient Romance. The painting was a large undertaking; it seems to have been among the first for which Kuroda employed charcoal drawings and oil sketches. He would go on to employ this technique in most of his later work, teaching it to his students as well. Talk on Ancient Romance appears to have been intended as a wall panel; as with much of Kuroda's work, it was destroyed during World War II, leaving only preparatory studies to indicate its possible grandeur. =Later career= Kuroda Seiki, Lakeside, 1897, Kuroda Memorial Hall, Tokyo Kuroda was by this time well-regarded not only by the Japanese, but by the art world at large; his triptych Wisdom, Impression, Sentiment (completed 1900) was exhibited alongside his 1897 work Lakeside at the International Exposition held in 1900 in Paris; it received a silver medal. In 1907, members of Hakubakai, Kuroda among them, exhibited in the first Bunten exhibition, sponsored by the Ministry of Education; their continued participation led to the disbanding of the group in 1911. Meanwhile, Kuroda had been appointed a court painter at the Imperial Court in 1910, becoming the first y≈çga artist so honored. From then until the end of his life his artistic activities were curtailed; he became more of a politician and an administrator, only creating small works intended for display. In 1917, on the death of his father, Kuroda inherited the kazoku peerage title of viscount, and in 1920, was elected to a seat in the House of Peers, the upper house of the Diet of Japan. In 1922, Kuroda was made head of the Imperial Fine Arts Academy. In 1923, he was awarded the Grand Cross of the Legion d'Honneur; this followed numerous other honors from the French government in the years before. Kuroda died at home in Azabukogaicho on July 15, 1924; immediately upon his death the Japanese government conferred upon him the Order of the Rising Sun. Work Kuroda Seiki, Wisdom, Impression, Sentiment, 1899, Kuroda Memorial Hall, Tokyo For most of his career, Kuroda painted in a style which, though basically Impressionistic, owed much to his academic training as well. Generally speaking, his plein-air works are more painterly, less finished, than his more formal compositions. Stylistically, he can be said to owe much to painters like √âdouard Manet, as well as to the Barbizon school and his teacher Collin. Legacy Few artists have influenced Japanese art as much as Kuroda. As a painter, he was among the first to introduce Western-style paintings to a broad Japanese audience. As a teacher, he taught many young artists the lessons that he himself had learned in Paris; among his students were painters like Wada Eisaku, who were to become among the preeminent Japanese painters of their generation. Many students also followed Kuroda in choosing to study in Paris, leading to a greater awareness of broader trends in Western art on the part of many Japanese artists in the twentieth century; a number of these, such as Asai Ch≈´, even went as far as going to Grez-sur-Loing for inspiration. Perhaps Kuroda's greatest contribution to Japanese culture, however, was the acceptance of Western-style painting he fostered on the part of the Japanese public. Despite their initial reluctance, he was able to convince them to accept the validity of the nude figure as a subject for art. This, coupled with the honors bestowed upon him later in his life, bespeak a broader understanding by the Japanese people, and by their government, as to the importance of y≈çga in their culture.

He notably played for Sunderland and Grimsby Town. He also appeared as a professional for Kilkenny City, Swindon Town, Hull City, Barnsley, York City and Sheffield Wednesday. Reddy retired from professional football in 2007 after failing to regain his fitness following three operations from a hip injury he endured while playing with Grimsby Town in 2006. He was capped eight times by the Republic of Ireland Under-21 side, scoring three goals. Career =Kilkenny City= He made his League of Ireland debut for his local senior side at Buckley Park on 15 March 1998 against Dundalk at the age of 17, scoring 2 goals giving Kilkenny City a 2‚Äì1 win . =Sunderland= A striker, Reddy signed for Sunderland, from Kilkenny City in 1999. He spent five years on Wearside, a time typified with many injury problems and loan spells; between 2001 and his departure in 2004, he was loaned out to Swindon, Hull, Barnsley, York, and twice to Sheffield Wednesday. He made 18 appearances for Sunderland, scoring twice and became an instant hero when he scored a late equaliser against Middlesbrough in the league. His other Sunderland goal came in the League Cup against Luton Town. He was highly thought of by manager Peter Reid who rated Reddy as the 'most exciting young player' he had ever worked with and was valued at ¬£5 million in 2001. He received the club's Young Player of the Year award and was also called in to the full Irish Squad in the same season. Michael's career at Sunderland came to an abrupt end after he ruptured his medial ligament in a training ground accident. =Grimsby Town= In July 2004 Reddy signed for Grimsby Town as one of the first new signings under the newly installed manager Russell Slade. He was a huge signing for the cash strapped and relegation hit club, as well as the addition of winger Andy Parkinson who had joined the club a few days previously. Reddy's first season was somewhat disappointing as the player was still recovering from a medial ligament injury and struggled to regain full fitness. Despite this Reddy was utilised as Town's favoured striker, mainly playing alongside Martin Gritton, Matt Harrold or Colin Cramb throughout this season. Notably though he did finish the season on a high scoring a hat trick against already doomed Kidderminster Harriers. He managed 9 goals throughout the season which was seen as a slightly disappointing season for all at the club, having seen the club finish in a lowly 18th place. The 2005-06 campaign began with Grimsby firing on all cylinders. With Reddy the star in a strong team that never dropped out of the top 4 all season. His ability to run with the ball, make play, create and score goals earned him hero status amongst the club's supporters. His impressive partnership with new signing Gary Jones was arguably one of the best in the league. Between them, Reddy and Jones managed to find the net 31 times throughout the season. During the season, the club had a decent run in the League Cup defeating both Derby County and Tottenham Hotspur, before losing to Newcastle United. Michael was involved in all three games. Reddy's impressive performances had also earned him the right named in the League 2 Team of the Year. But in an unfortunate twist of fate, Reddy's season was cruelly interrupted by a hip injury in March and as a result the striker did not complete another ninety minutes for the remainder of the campaign. The Mariners faltered and fell out of the automatic promotion places on the penultimate day of the season. Reddy was deemed fit enough to take part in the play-off campaign, but it was goals from Gary Jones and Ben Futcher that defeated Lincoln City in the semi final stages. Slade opted to play Reddy from the start in the final at the Millennium Stadium against Cheltenham Town but luck fell against him as he was substituted with concussion after a clash of heads. Grimsby attempted to use Junior Mendes and Gary Cohen to help cater for Jones in attack, but without Reddy, the club went on to lose the game 1‚Äì0, ending all hopes of promotion after a promising season. After failing to secure promotion, his manager Russell Slade resigned, and Reddy requested to be put on the transfer list, this was followed by several press reports linking him with a move to newly promoted Premiership side Sheffield United. Though eventually it was Leeds United and Bristol City who made more of a forward approach for the player. Grimsby had also made the signing of striker Isaiah Rankin in the hope of combining the pair in an attempt to make a second assault on promotion from League Two, but Michael still had to contend with his hip injury, which was still being largely persistent. The injury was rumoured to be so bad that it possibly threatened to end his career altogether. Reddy managed to play the odd game, and soon Slade's replacement as manager Graham Rodger was dismissed by the club after a poor start to the season. In turn the club appointed Alan Buckley as his successor, the new Grimsby boss made it clear he wanted to keep Reddy who had by now had undergone hip surgery. Buckley aimed to stick by him through his injury troubles and help the player back to fitness, but with Reddy still harbouring the interests of leaving Blundell Park, he subsequently snubbed fresh contract talks in favour of listening to potential offers from Bristol City. Due to the continued hip problem, City had by now had lost interest altogether in signing him. However Leyton Orient had also made an official approach for Reddy's services, but this came to nothing in the end. Reddy had failed to respond well from his hip surgery and was forced to retire from the game. Personal life Former Grimsby manager Russell Slade, who was the manager of Yeovil Town offered to help the player with his rehabilitation after he had a second hip operation. Reddy remained with Yeovil for several weeks before leaving the club. After an unsuccessful third hip operation Michael accepted defeat and was forced to retire from professional football. He has since taken up his UEFA B coaching licence with the English FA in 2009. As of 2012 Reddy is studying business at Manchester Metropolitan University.

The eldest son of Higuchi Kanetoyo, Kanetsugu was famed for his service to two generations of the Uesugi daimy≈çs. He was also known by his court title, Yamashiro no Kami (Â±±ÂüéÂÆà) ÊñáÊ≠¶ÂÖºÂÇô„ÅÆÊô∫Â∞Ü Áõ¥Ê±üÂÖºÁ∂ö or his childhood name, . Kanetsugu served first as a kosh≈ç (Â∞èÂßì) to Uesugi Kenshin.

Biography Kanetsugu was born , at Sakato Castle in Echigo Province. His father, Higuchi S≈çemon Kanetoyo, was a senior retainer of Nagao Masakage, the lord of Sakato Castle. ÊñáÊ≠¶ÂÖºÂÇô„ÅÆÊô∫Â∞Ü Áõ¥Ê±üÂÖºÁ∂ö When Yoroku came of age he married his first cousin Osen from his maternal side, the widow of Uesugi retainer Naoe Nobutsuna, and took the Naoe family name in order to become head of the family line since Osen did not have any children from the previous marriage nor have any male heir available to succeed the family. He became an Uesugi councilor at the age of 22, quickly distinguished himself as an outstanding commander, he fought at Battle of Tedorigawa and was involved in much of the fighting that took place on the Sea of Japan coast with Sassa Narimasa and Maeda Toshiie. In 1590, he fought in the Odawara Campaign at Hachi≈çji Castle. Kanetsugu was also responsible for the actions of the Uesugi clan against the allies of the Tokugawa during the lead-up to the climactic Battle of Sekigahara. Following the Uesugi clan's surrender to the Tokugawa, in 1601, their holdings were transferred to the much smaller fief of Yonezawa, with an income of 300,000 koku. Kanetsugu was granted a stipend shortly before he retired. After death Following his death, his wife Lady Osen („ÅäËàπ), per the custom at the time, took the tonsure, cutting her hair short and becoming a Buddhist nun. She was renamed Lady Teishin-ni (Ë≤ûÂøÉÂ∞º). Teishin-ni helped rear the young Uesugi heir, Uesugi Sadakatsu, eventually dying in 1637 at the age of 81. Personality Naoe Kanetsugu was respected for his judgment. In \\"The Life of Toyotomi Hideyoshi,\\" Walter and M.E. Dening recount an anecdote in which Hideyoshi, whose temporary unification of Japan paved the way for Ieyasu's shogunate, decides to visit Uesugi Kagekatsu, Kanetsugu's liege lord at the time, in person, accompanied by just a few retainers. On receipt of the news, Kagekatsu called a council to discuss what was best to do under the circumstances. The majority of the councilors advised the assassination of Hideyoshi, arguing that this was by far the simplest way of ridding themselves of a dangerous enemy. But Naoe Kanetsugu condemned this advice as unworthy of a man holding the position of Kagekatsu. \\"Hideyoshi's coming among us unguarded,\\" said Kanetsugu, \\"is proof of his profound respect for our master. With lesser personages Hideyoshi would not so expose himself to danger. Knowing that our lord is a man of noble disposition, he trusts himself among us. Were we take advantage of this and slay him, the story of our baseness and treachery would be handed down to distant posterity to our eternal shame. No: let our master meet magnanimity with magnanimity; let him have an audience with Hideyoshi and let them see whether they cannot come to an understanding. If they cannot agree, then we will fight, but not till Hideyoshi has been sent back to his own country.\\" In popular culture The 2009 48th NHK Taiga drama Tenchijin was a dramatization of his life.

Its studios are located on Smoketree Court in Raleigh's Highwoods Office Park and owned by iHeartMedia, along with B93.9, Alt 95.3, Classic Rock 100.7 WRDU, and 106.1 FM More Stimulating Talk. The transmitter site for the station is in Apex. WDCG is the Raleigh-Durham primary entry point for the Emergency Alert System. WDCG broadcasts in the HD radio format. History WDCG first began as a radio station on February 29, 1948 as WDNC-FM 105.1, a sister station to WDNC; both were owned by Durham Morning Herald and The Durham Sun. The sign-on of the 36,000-watt FM station coincided with the AM station's power increase and frequency shift from 1490 to 620 kilohertz. In 1953, the Herald-Sun group joined WTIK owners Floyd Fletcher and Harmon Duncan in securing a license to operate a television station in Durham, which would eventually become WTVD Channel 11 the following year. Until the mid-1970s, WDNC-FM simulcast the AM programming from an antenna located atop one of AM 620's three towers on Shocoree Drive in western Durham just off Interstate 85. (The old 105.1 FM antenna was visible on the easternmost tower until the site was razed in late 2017.) In 1974, WDNC-FM became a country station and changed its calls to WDCG-FM (Durham's Country Giant). The station later switched to rock music in the late 1970s before becoming a Top 40 station in Fall 1981. A year later, the station boosted their power to 100,000 watts and moved to the former WRDU- TV (now WRDC) tower at Terrell's Mountain in northern Chatham County. This allowed WDCG-FM to put a city grade into Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill, as well as a 60 dbu signal into Greensboro-High Point-Winston-Salem where the station even beat the local Top 40s from 60 miles away. WDCG, licensed to Durham, was the first station in the Raleigh-Durham market to obtain a dual city of license in terms of their station identification in 1982, and surprised the stations in Raleigh with its designation of WDCG-Durham, Raleigh, Chapel Hill. With no promotional dollars and against the powerhouses of WRAL-FM and WQDR-FM, WDCG grew every six months in Arbitron starting in the Fall of 1981 with a 1.8 - 4.5 - 9.0 - 9.8 - 11.1 - 14.5 by the Spring of 1984. WDCG was operated as a loss leader for years by the Durham Herald-Sun, as the owners felt eventually newspapers would be viewed on a computer screen - and they had the distribution system via WDCG's FM sub-carrier that the Raleigh News and Observer did not have. The Durham Herald-Sun had never separated the financial books of WDCG and WDNC. The combined stations had only been profitable in 2 of the 10 years prior to 1983 - with a $10,000 profit one year and a $59,000 profit in 1979. By 1984, WDCG alone was billing just under 4 million dollars (inflation adjusted about $16,000,000 today). Over $60,000 a month was coming in from the Greensboro-High Point market, 60 miles away, where WDCG had a dedicated salesperson. WDCG operated from the Herald-Sun building in Downtown Durham from its 1948 sign-on until 1992, when the station, along with WDNC, moved to more spacious studios at Park Forty Plaza in southern Durham near Research Triangle Park as the owners saw their loss leader turn into a cash cow. The new facilities included state of the art computer integration, including software controlled transmitters and audio playback from hard disk. In 1993, the Herald-Sun sold WDCG to Prizm Broadcasting, which had also purchased Vilcom's WZZU 93.9 (now WNCB). After following four different ownership changes, WDCG and its sister stations later moved into Raleigh's Smoketree Tower, now called the Highwoods Building, and are now owned by Clear Channel Worldwide. In 2004, the station's FM class was slightly downgraded from a class \\"C\\" to a class \\"C-0\\", allowing WZBL, a Clear Channel station in Roanoke, Virginia, to make an upgrade to its signal. No changes were necessary to WDCG's actual facilities in the short term. In March 2005, the FCC approved the station's moving their antenna from Terrell's Mountain to the former WLFL-TV analog tower in Apex in an effort to provide better, more centralized coverage of the market. The change involved a drop in power from 100,000 watts to 73,000 watts and another downgrade in class, this time to a class \\"C-1\\". On March 13, 2008, WDCG began broadcasting from the Apex site. The tower is 1112 feet (339 meters) The antenna system is 984 feet (300 meters.) The move actually increased the covered population inside the station's coverage by more than 500,000 persons, improved building penetration and placed the station as the second best signal in the market, just behind its sister station WKSL 93.9. By 2011, the station moved towards an adult top 40 direction because of WPLW taking the contemporary hit radio format and also due to no adult top 40 stations in Raleigh/Durham (the company also owned its sister rhythmic contemporary station WKSL), but is still billed as contemporary hit radio per Nielsen BDS and Mediabase. In addition, higher- charting songs are below 100 spins per week. On November 16, 2012, an alternative format, marketed as \\"95X\\" debuted on WDCG-HD2, which is simulcast on translator station W237BZ (95.3 MHz) in Clayton, North Carolina. A second translator, W236CA (95.1 MHz) in Durham, North Carolina, began simulcasting in late 2015.\\"95X\\" (Facebook.com) On January 9, 2018, 95X rebranded as ‚ÄúAlt 95.3‚Äù.

It tells the story of a superhero created for propaganda purposes in a world in which the Confederate States of America won their independence from the United States. Publication history Issues 1‚Äì12 were published beginning in 1986 by Steeldragon Press. A special edition of issue #1 was also published with some revisions. John M. Ford plotted three issues of the first series and wrote one, issue #10's \\"Driving North.\\" The series is, as of July 2015, available online ‚Äî in a somewhat revised form ‚Äî as well as having been collected in two trade paperbacks.Captain Confederacy paperbacks at CreateSpace.com The second series was published by Marvel's Epic Comics and can also be found on line.Second series of Captain Confederacy A connected story Yankee UFO, concerning a person from another alternative history where Ted Kennedy is President of the United States trapped in Captain Confederacy's world, was published on line in 2008. Title character The first Captain Confederacy, featured in the first series, is an out-of-work actor who agrees to undergo a biological experiment that grants him super strength, enhanced agility and healing abilities as well as limited psychic abilities, but those chemicals are addictive and are slowly killing him. In the second series, the new Captain Confederacy is a black woman, pregnant with the previous Captain‚Äôs baby. She has similar superpowers garnered from the same source. Plot The first series, published in the SteelDragon Press run, tells how the first Captain Confederacy, a white man, becomes disillusioned with Confederate society after the death of his friend. Both the Captain and his friend are actors in a series of staged TV \\"news events\\" which are actually propaganda designed to maintain and reinforce the Confederate ideals by portraying Confederate-themed superheroes Captain Confederacy and his female sidekick Miss Dixie battling a black supervillain Blacksnake (his friend in real life). When his friend becomes fed up with his status as a second class citizen within the Confederacy and his own culpability in perpetuating same for his race through his participation in the propaganda, he refuses to continue in his TV role, and he is shot. This leads Captain Confederacy to rebellion against his country. All of the superheroes/actors involved were given medical treatments which produced genuine superpowers (both physical and psionic), to enhance the realism of the propaganda news telecasts. They discover that the effects of these treatments have both made them addicts and are slowly killing them. The second series focuses on the struggle to control the politics of the North American countries, at a world superhero conference in Free Louisiana. World In the alternative history, the Confederacy won the Civil War, which resulted in a fracturing of the North American continent, mostly affecting what was the United States of America into eight nations. These nations are the Confederate States of America (also containing several Caribbean possessions), the Free State of Louisiana (smaller than the real state of Louisiana, but containing the city of New Orleans), the remaining Northern states as the United States of America, the Republic of Texas (also includes portions of what was Mexico), the Great Spirit Alliance (called \\"Tecumseh\\" in the original series's map ‚Äî also includes portions of Canada), the Mormon nation of Deseret, The People's Republic of California (including Baja California) and Pacifica (called \\"Sequoyah\\" in the original series's map ‚Äî also includes portions of Canada). Canada and Mexico exist, but have lost territory to the various other nations. The means by which the CSA managed to retain its independence was never explained in the series. Each of these nations has its own propaganda heroes similar to the original Captain Confederacy, though empowered through different means and technologies (armored suits, drugs, etc.). Canada exists in some form, although it is not as large as it is in the real world. A version of the Underground Railroad exists within the Confederacy to help oppressed minorities escape to either the United States or Canada. Outside North America, a Japan analogue, Nippon (a native name of Japan), exists as an ally to the People's Republic of California, having a military base there. Germany on the other hand, is a global power, with a system of militarized defensive satellites. A cold war of sorts exists between Germany and Nippon. The technology of this world's 1967 (the year in which the story begins) seems analogous to the real world in about 1980. Although advanced technology was used to create the superheroes, it does not seem to be in widespread use by the general public. Dirigibles seem a common means of air transportation. The Confederacy boasts a female president, hinted to be a descendant of Robert E. Lee. Medical science also is about the same as 1980s medicine, although whites receive much better care than minorities in the Confederacy. Governments do not seem inclined to share their technological means. Commercially, McDonald's is known for its fast food burritos ‚Äî although it has plans to introduce a new ground beef sandwich with cheese, while KFC sells catfish not chicken. Both chains seem ubiquitous within the Confederacy. Science fiction is known by Scientifiction and appears more popular than in the real world. Margaret Mitchell wrote a well known book, Glorious Tomorrows. The Beverly Hillbillies is a television comedy popular in the USA that makes fun of the CSA. Reception Southern Magazine found the plots are intricate and creative, but noted that this is not a comic for children. Comics Buyer's Guide found the comic an \\"excellent alternate- Earth science fiction.\\" In Reconstructing Dixie: Race, Gender, and Nostalgia in the Imagined South by Tara McPherson (Duke University), McPherson wrote, \\"From the retooled Stars and Bars of Captain Confederacy's costume to the mapping of urban and rural southern places, the series takes up the symbols of the South and imaginitively reconstructs them, shaking loose the stock figures, geographies, and temporalities of southerness. If Octavia Butler and Kara Walker alter the meaning of the southern lady, Shetterly reconfigures the southern gentleman, unfixing his location in an idealized Civil War past, instead deploying him for a different understanding of our present.\\" Heavy Metal found the comic to \\"address the South‚Äôs old ghosts\\" and that the determination of if the comic was a successful examination of the current southern society of merely provocative is left up to readers to decide. A family who gave an issue of the comic to their 11-year-old son found the comic offensive, creating a minor controversy. According to the Smithsonian Magazine, the comic was featured in 2017 at the American Civil War Museum in Richmond, Virginia.https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/costs-confederacy- special-report-180970731/ References * * External links *Captain Confederacy blog, where the comic is being posted in serial format by Will Shetterly, along with related material *Captain Confederacy at Don Markstein's Toonopedia.

Einar P√°lsson (1925‚Äì1996) was an Icelandic writer. He was born in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland. He is best known for his theories about the origin of the Icelandic Saga literature as relict mythology of pagan ritual landscapes. He acquired a cand. phil. degree in 1946, and a BA degree in English and Danish in 1957 (University of Iceland). He graduated from The Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London in 1948. In 1995 he was awarded The Knight‚Äôs Cross of the Order of the Falcon by the president of Iceland as recognition of his research into Old Icelandic literature. In 1969 he put forward his theories about the roots of Icelandic culture and developed them further in a series of 11 books. His theories can be grouped into four categories:Einarsson, √Årni 2005. Allt er baugum bundi√∞. Um kenningar Einars P√°lssonar. Gangleri (Reykjavik) 79: 22-27 (\\"All is bound by circles: about the theories of Einar P√°lsson\\") Theories =The mythology theory of Saga origin= The Old Norse (Icelandic) Saga literature has a mythological background. The characters of the Sagas originated as personifications of mythological concepts such as fertility, justice, time, death and the four elements. Einar argued that many of the potential symbols in the Sagas would become meaningful when matched with symbols occurring in Mediterranean and Celtic mythology. In Nj√°ls saga in particular, K√°ri would become associated with time and air, Nj√°ll with creation, fertility and water, Skarph√©√∞inn with death, justice and fire, H√∂skuldr with grain and fertility, Gunnar with the Sun, M√∂r√∞r with the Earth and Bergthora with the Underworld. The mythology was that of the Norse fertility deities Freyr and Freyja who were based on the same principles as fertility deities in the Mediterranean region, primarily Osiris and Isis. The fertility mythology became part of a local ritual landscape in each main valley of Iceland, - the same geographical unit as that of the Sagas. The establishment of the ritual landscape was, according to Einar's thesis, a vital part of the 9th-10th century settlement process, a way of taming the virgin landscape, - creating cosmos out of chaos. With time this localized mythology merged to a varying degree with historical characters and their actions, to become the material for the Saga writers centuries later. =The theory of the allegorical Sagas= Some of the Saga writers seem to have reworked their mythological material into full allegories. Nj√°ls Saga, for instance, became a major allegory about the conversion to Christianity. The burning of Nj√°ll at Berg√æ√≥rshvoll was a conflagration marking the end of the pagan (and Celtic Christian) world and the advent of the new Roman Catholic era. K√°ri, the wind and time (equivalent to Kairos), who escaped the ordeal like a phoenix, was converted into the Holy Spirit etc. The principal aim of the writer was to Christianize the pagan ritual landscape. Other allegories, like Hrafnkels saga, were more concerned with moral messages. =The landscape cosmogram theory= The ritual landscape described above had well defined and measured dimensions. Because it was a mirror image of heavenly order and acted as a time reckoning system the most natural geometry was a circle, symbolic of the horizon and the zodiac. The circle had spokes formed by lines defined by solar movements: two of the lines corresponded to the cardinal directions and other two were solstice lines. The dimensions of the system were standardised and measured by the ancients, conforming to a progression of numbers that harmonized distance and time. The circle diameter was an important dimension. In Iceland it was 216,000 Roman feet (about 64 km). Prominent features like hills, rocks and river mouths, aligning with the spokes, were used as landmarks to fix the wheel-shaped cosmogram to the landscape. Apart from the measurements, the system proposed by P√°lsson was similar to the huaca and ceques system of the Incas. =The socio-mythological theory= The Icelandic pagan society (930 - 1000 C.E.) was thought of as a mirror image of the heavenly organization. The (originally) 36 go√∞ar (the priest-chieftains of the free state) represent the heavenly circle and constituted a king in a mythological sense. The go√∞ar were the vehicles of the mythological knowledge associated with the ritual landscape. Einar assumed that German mythology was, like other neighbouring mythologies, imbued with Pythagorean/Platonic ideas about numbers and proportions as the organizing principles of the cosmos. He extended this idea to include the social organisation of pagan Iceland. Einar posed all his ideas as hypotheses for further investigations but most of them have remained untested by other scholars. Although other scholars have noticed the mythological elements in some of the Sagas,Bessason, Haraldur. 1977. Mythological overlays. In: Sj√∂t√≠u ritger√∞ir helga√∞ar Jakobi Benediktssyni 20. j√∫l√≠ 1977. Reykjav√≠k. Einar's hypotheses about the mythological origin of the Sagas remain untested. The most important prediction derived from his hypotheses is that ritual landscapes of certain well defined dimensions should have been present in pagan Europe. Einar's idea about the allegorical element in the Old Norse literature was original. A few studies have been made of allegories in the Old Norse literature since then (e.g. Ciklamini 1984,Ciklamini, Marlene. 1984. Veiled meaning and narrative modes in Sturlu thattr.

Description The Westport River has two branches. The smaller West Branch is approximately long,U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed April 1, 2011 rising from a confluence of brooks near the village of Adamsville, Rhode Island. It flows in a southeastward direction, passing around several small islands before meeting Westport Harbor west of Westport Point. The West Branch separates the village of Acoaxet (pronounced \\"a-KOKE-sett\\") from the rest of the town; one has to pass into Rhode Island in order to reach the rest of Westport from there by land. The larger East Branch is roughly long, rising at the town line of Westport and Dartmouth at Lake Noquochoke, which is fed mostly by the Copicut and Shingle Island rivers. After a short length the river meets the Bread and Cheese Brook before reaching the Head of Westport village, where the river widens and deepens. From here the river continues southward, being fed by several brooks before an initial widening to between 100-400 yards at Widows Point. From Widows Point, the river flows due southward, crossing under the Hix Bridge before passing Gull Rock and then widening at Cadman's Neck to approximately a half mile wide. The river flows southward, with several larger islands dotting the path, before meeting the Horseneck Channel (which in turn leads to The Let) at Westport Point. The East Branch then flows under the Normand Edward Fontaine Bridge and into Westport Harbor. Once in Westport Harbor, the combined branches bend around Horseneck Point across from The Knubble before flowing into Rhode Island Sound, just west of Horseneck Beach State Reservation and the point where Rhode Island Sound meets Buzzards Bay. Wildlife The Westport River estuary has long been known for its wildlife. Deer, coyotes, foxes, and turkeys can all be spotted at different times along the shore. Ospreys are very prevalent. There were 41 nesting sites confirmed in 1980. Now the population has spread to over 300 statewide, due to the Westport River estuary nesting program. MassWildlife continues to provide technical assistance to monitor a sample of the nesting population to determine productivity.

It was given its name in the Coinage Act of 1792, as a derivation from the US ten-dollar eagle coin. Its purchasing power in 1800 would be equivalent to $71.12 in 2015 dollars. History 1796 \\"Turban Head\\" or \\"Capped Bust\\" quarter eagle (with stars) The quarter eagle denomination was struck at the main mint at Philadelphia (1796-1929), and branch mints in Charlotte (1838-1859), New Orleans (1838-1857 only), San Francisco (1854-1879), and Denver (1911-1925). Years were skipped at the various mints, with no coins at all made between 1808 and 1821 and 1915 and 1925. The first issues weighed 67.5 grains, fineness .9167, until the weight was modified to 64.5 grains and the fineness changed to .8992 by the Act of June 28, 1834. The Act of January 18, 1837 established a fineness of .900. This means that 1837 and later quarter eagles contain 0.121 Troy Oz. of gold content. As relatively fewer coins were struck prior to 1834, combined with their higher gold content (promoting melting for their bullion content), all of the early issues range from scarce to rare. The first issues were struck in 1796. Any proof date prior to 1856 is rare, and will command a premium in any condition. The quarter eagle denomination was officially discontinued in 1933 with the removal of the United States from the Gold Standard, although the last date of issue was 1929. List of design varieties =Capped Bust= Also known as the \\"Turban Head\\", this interpretation of Liberty wearing a turban-like cap was designed by Robert Scot and was minted from 1796 to 1807. There were three varieties of this design. First came the Capped Bust facing right variety. There were two variations of this design, no stars on the obverse, and stars on the obverse. The 'no stars' variety was produced only in 1796, replaced with the stars. In 1808, Liberty was redesigned by John Reich, to be wearing more of a traditional cap rather than a turban. This design was minted for 1808 only, but in 1821 the mint reinstated the quarter eagle and it was produced again until 1827, slightly scaled down to 18.5 millimeters from the original 20. In 1829, the quarter eagle was reduced in size again to 18.2 mm, and featured smaller letters and stars. This version of the design was produced until 1834. =Classic Head= 1835 \\"Classic Head\\" quarter eagle The \\"Classic Head\\" variety was designed by William Kneass, which featured a traditional maiden with a ribbon binding her long, curly hair. This variety omitted E pluribus unum from the reverse of the coin. In 1840, a coronet and smaller head were designed to conform with the appearance of the larger gold coins, therefore making the Classic Head design obsolete. The Classic Head design was produced from 1834 to 1839. =Liberty Head= The 1848 \\"Liberty Head\\" quarter eagle punch-marked \\"CAL\\" Also known as the \\"Coronet Head\\", the Liberty head was designed to match the styles of the other gold eagles the government was producing. The Liberty Head design was created by Christian Gobrecht and was produced successfully from 1840 to 1907, the most popular of all of the models. Like its predecessor, this variety omitted E Pluribus Unum from the reverse. One notable date is 1848, when 230 ounces of gold were sent to the Secretary of War Marcy by Colonel R.B. Mason, the military governor of California. The gold was turned over to the mint and promptly made into quarter eagles. The distinguishing mark CAL. was punched above the heraldic eagle on the reverse side of the coin. Only 1,389 of these coins were minted and are highly sought after by collectors. There are several specimens with proof-like surfaces and the coins are highly sought after by collectors, often fetching prices from $30,000 to $100,000 if in good enough condition. =Indian Head= 1908 Indian Head quarter eagle The \\"Indian Head\\" design and the similar half eagle piece were created by Boston sculptor Bela Lyon Pratt. The coin was a departure from other examples of American coinage because it had no raised edges, instead featuring a design sunk into the planchet. Unfortunately, the public had much distaste for the experimental and unusual design. Many feared that the recessed surfaces would collect germs, and others simply thought it was ugly. Numismatists took little interest in the coin. This resulted in few examples in uncirculated condition and the coin slipped into obscurity for many years. Today, however, collectors adore the exotic design and the coin is recognized as part of the creative renaissance of American coinage. The Indian Head design was produced from 1908 to 1929. For sale to collectors it has been frequently counterfeited, so buying uncertified coins can be risky.Indian Head Quarter Eagles ‚Äì King of the Counterfeit Gold Coin Series! Commemorative issues Two of the early United States commemorative coins are quarter eagles. The 1915-S was produced for the Panama-Pacific Exposition in San Francisco. The obverse depicts Liberty riding a hippocampus, while the reverse shows an eagle. With only 6,749 sold it is quite valuable. Considerably more common is the 1926 issue struck to commemorate the Sesquicentennial Exposition in Philadelphia. A total of 46,019 pieces were sold. The obverse shows Liberty standing on a globe and holding a torch and the Declaration of Independence, while the reverse pictures Independence Hall. Since the resumption of commemorative gold coin mintage in 1984 none have been struck in this denomination. References External links *US Quarter Eagle by year and type.

His media company, Landmark Media Enterprises, once owned nine daily newspapers, more than 50 weekly newspapers, television stations in Las Vegas and Nashville, and a national chain of classified advertising publications. Batten assumed leadership in 1954 of two newspapers, The Virginian-Pilot and The Ledger-Star in Norfolk, Virginia, parlaying those papers into a media conglomerate by acquiring other newspapers, radio stations, and television stations and establishing a cable outlet as well as the national cable weather channel. Until 2008, the company, Landmark Communications, now Landmark Media Enterprises, was one of the country‚Äôs largest privately held media companies. Batten sold TeleCable (a multi-system cable TV company) in 1995 to TCI for $1 billion and the Weather Channel in 2008 to NBC Universal and two private equity firms for nearly $3.5 billion. Batten served as chairman of the Associated Press from 1982 to 1987. Early life Batten was born on February 11, 1927 to Frank Batten, a bank auditor, and Dorothy Martin Batten, the daughter of a wealthy Norfolk family. After the death of his father the following year, Batten and his mother moved in with his aunt and uncle, Fay and Samuel L. Slover. A Jewish native of Tennessee, Slover had taken ownership of a newspaper in Newport News, Virginia, which he sold in 1907 to buy what would become the Norfolk Ledger-Dispatch. Themselves childless, the Slovers raised young Frank as their own son. Batten attended the Culver Academies, a boarding school in Indiana, to graduate in 1945 and later attend the United States Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, New York. He received his undergraduate degree from the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia, where he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. He then received his MBA from Harvard in 1952. The Virginian-Pilot Batten professionalized the newspaper he inherited in 1954 at age 27, and went on to acquire the Portsmouth Star, which he later merged with the Ledger-Dispatch to form the Ledger-Star. During his early days as publisher of The Virginian- Pilot, Batten championed desegregation, a position not often taken in the state of Virginia during the 1950s; Virginia, like much of the American South, was undergoing deep resistance to the movement. In 1960 The Virginian-Pilot received a Pulitzer Prize for articles written in support of racial desegregation. Media acquisitions In 1965, Batten acquired The Greensboro Daily News and The Greensboro Record, adding The Roanoke Times in 1969. Together with The Virginian-Pilot, these papers made up the core of the Landmark Publishing business. Under Landmark Publishing many other papers were started and acquired, including dailies, weeklies, community papers, and military papers across the southern and western parts of the United States. Birth of The Weather Channel When John Coleman, former WLS-TV Chicago chief meteorologist and Good Morning America forecaster, suggested creating a 24-hour cable weather station, the idea confirmed what Batten had learned at The Virginian-Pilot, that readers prioritized weather information as a primary reason for purchasing the daily paper. The Weather Channel debuted on May 2, 1982, after 10 months in development. Although initially criticized, The Weather Channel ultimately thrived and expanded to include its sister web site, Weather.com, which receives more than 300 million visits per month. In 2002, on its 20th anniversary, Batten co-authored The Weather Channel: The Improbable Rise of a Media Phenomenon, recounting the creation of The Weather Channel. Philanthropy Batten became the first Rector of Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, served on the boards of the College of William and Mary and Hollins University, and served as Vice Chairman of the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia. His gifts to schools and institutions include $32 million to the Harvard Business School, $60 million to the Darden Graduate School of Business Administration at the University of Virginia, $32 million to Old Dominion University, and various scholarships, such as the Batten Scholarship at the Culver Academies. On April 12, 2007, Batten made a gift of $100 million to the University of Virginia, the largest gift in the University's history, to establish the Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy, and in 2006, $2 million to Hollins University. Batten donated to the Norfolk Academy, for the school's library, as well as to the City of Norfolk for a new downtown library. In 2009, he also started the $50 million Batten Challenge at the Culver Academies, where he would match every dollar donated to the school during 2009-2010 with a dollar of his own. Personal life Frank Batten lived in Virginia Beach, Virginia with his wife Jane Parke Batten. They had two daughters, Mary Elizabeth and Dorothy, and son Frank Batten, Jr., who succeeded his father as Chairman and CEO of Landmark Communications on January 1, 1998, and has been leading Sunday night Bible study group at Tabernacle Church of Norfolk. In 2007 Frank Batten was listed as the 190th richest person in the United States, according to Forbes 400, with a net worth of approximately $2.3 billion. Batten owned one of the Chesapeake Bay's largest racing yachts, the Shadow.  References  External links * AP Obituary.

Thirteen episodes were filmed, of which eleven were actually aired. Produced by Aaron Spelling, the series was initially marketed as a \\"Dynasty for the new millennium,\\" attempting to emulate the style of Spelling's earlier hit series. However, low ratings led NBC to cancel the series before its first season was completed. Synopsis Aviation magnate Richard Williams (Perry King) is engaged to the much-younger Heather (Yasmine Bleeth), but is unaware that she previously had an affair with his son, Chandler (Casper Van Dien). A pilot, Chandler is unsure whether he should tell his father the truth, but Chandler soon discovers that Heather is pregnant with his child. Meanwhile, Heather clashes with Richard's former wife Gwen (Victoria Principal), who lives in a mansion across the street. After Richard and Heather marry, Chandler's scheming brother Peter (John Barrowman) finds out about her affair with Chandler.

Additional cast members included soap opera veterans Bleeth, Principal, David, and Wagner. Titans premiered on October 4, 2000, and four additional episodes were ordered in November 2000. Episodes ;Notes Broadcast Titans premiered on Wednesday, October 4, 2000, before the season two premiere of The West Wing. Titans attracted 11.6 million viewers and delivered key demographics for NBC, but ratings for the second and third episodes declined significantly. They climbed again for subsequent episodes, to a high of 8.5 for the sixth episode. Around this time, four additional episodes were ordered. The show averaged 8 million viewers over its initial eight weeks, ranking 83rd overall. Titans was moved to Mondays starting with its ninth episode on December 4, 2000, taking over the timeslot previously held by cancelled new sitcoms Daddio and Tucker. Ed, a dramedy which had premiered the same week as Titans and was also suffering from declining ratings, moved into the vacant Wednesday slot. While Ed saw ratings improvement, Titans attracted only 6.6 million viewers for its Monday debut, and was effectively canceled the next day with the announcement that NBC would not be ordering additional episodes. Though the remaining four produced episodes were expected to be aired, only two were broadcast in the United States, the last on December 18, 2000. Reception John Kiesewetter of The Cincinnati Enquirer called the series \\"a mindless soap about filthy-rich, amoral people\\" but added, \\"As much as I wanted to hate Titans, I couldn't stop watching. Perhaps Mr. Spelling and Mr. Vincent have reinvented Dynasty, creating a Young and the Shirtless for the new millennium.\\" David Zurawik of The Baltimore Sun called the acting \\"stunningly bad\\", citing Principal as \\"the one saving grace on the show\\". Phil Gallo of Variety singled out Bleeth as \\"eminently watchable\\". Despite the show's low ratings, Entertainment Weekly Kristen Baldwin called its cancellation \\"a mistake\\", suggesting that viewership would have grown over time.

It requires two machines that are connected via a serial connection. The serial connection may either be an RS-232 interface using a null modem cable, or via the UDP/IP networking protocol (KGDB over Ethernet, KGDBoE). The target machine (the one being debugged) runs the patched kernel and the other (host) machine runs gdb. The GDB remote protocol is used between the two machines.

A scaled-down version of the Linux patch was integrated into the official Linux kernel in version 2.6.26.

Aref is a resident of Albany, New York, who was arrested by Federal authorities in August 2004 as part of a counter-terrorism sting operation, convicted in October 2006 of conspiring to aid a terrorist group and provide support for a weapon of mass destruction, as well as money-laundering and supporting a foreign terrorist organization, Jaish-e-Mohammed, and sentenced to 15 years in prison in March 2007.Suspects raise domestic spy issue: 2 Albany Muslim men accused in FBI sting seek information, Times Union, January 5, 2006 In July 2008 the appellate court upheld the convictions, rejecting all of the defense's arguments. After finishing his 15-year prison sentence in October, 2018, Yassin was deported to Iraqi Kurdistan in June, 2019. Aref wrote a memoir, Son of Mountains: My Life as a Kurd and a Terror Suspect (2008). Background US forces found Aref's name, address, and phone number in a notebook in a bombed-out Iraqi encampment in 2003. The information was classified, and the defense, despite defense counsel having received security clearances, was provided with almost no information about the notebook. Originally the government claimed that the notebook entry said \\"commander\\" next to Aref's name; however, when the judge asked the government to provide the notebook page, the government admitted that there had been a \\"mistranslation\\" and the word in question was \\"kak,\\" which means \\"brother,\\" not \\"commander,\\" and is a common Kurdish term of respect.Error In Albany 'Terror' Case Terror Camp Document Said Defendant Was 'Brother,' Not 'Commander', CBS News, August 18, 2004 Aref is from (Iraqi Kurdistan), and his grandfather was a famous imam; Aref was already known and respected in the area. There was no way to know what group was bombed by US forces at the encampment; at times, groups such as the Kurdistan Islamic Group, run by Ali Bapir, were bombed by the US, even though they did not oppose US forces.Kurd chief who taught mercy to Saddam's men, Guardian Unlimited, May 27, 2005 The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) claimed that Aref is tied to Mullah Krekar, the founder of Ansar al-Islam.Terror suspect wants own trial: Albany pizza shop owner says case against imam hurts his chance with jurors, Times Union, December 10, 2005 When Aref left Iraq as a refugee in 1994, he lived in Syria for 5 years. During that time he was approved by the UN as a refugee to be sent to a third country, which ended up being the US. While in Syria, Aref worked first as a gardener for a rich businessman, and then for the Damascus Office of the IMK (Islamic Movement in Kurdistan), an Islamic Kurdish group which had worked with the US to oppose Saddam Hussein, and which helped Kurdish refugees in Syria. IMK was never claimed to be a terrorist organization. Mullah Krekar was an IMK official who, at the end of 2001, two years after Aref had left Syria and the IMK job, split from IMK to form Ansar al Islam, which is a designated terrorist organization. While Aref had met Krekar briefly a couple of times through his IMK job, he did not really know him, and was opposed to his extremist politics. Aref came to the US as a United Nations refugee in 1999 with his wife and three young children. He initially found work as a janitor at a local hospital and as an ambulance driver.[3] After a year he was hired as the imam of the Masjid As Salam Mosque. Sting operation Based perhaps on the discovery of the notebook in Iraq in 2003, the FBI launched a sting operation targeting Aref. FBI agents convinced a Pakistani informant (who was facing a long prison sentence and deportation for fraud) to approach a friend of Aref's, Mohammed Mosharref Hossain, as a means of getting to Aref.Mosque welcomed in informant, Times Union August 8, 2004 The FBI plan was that the informant, Shahed Hussein, would offer to loan $50,000 cash to Hossain, and get back $45,000 in checks from Hossain's business (a pizza shop), telling him that the money was made from buying a Chinese surface-to-air missile, which was to be provided to a group called JEM (Jaish-e-Mohammed), which was to use it to attack the Pakistani Ambassador in New York City. However, none of that was true. Needing a witness to the loan, as is obligatory for Muslims, the men then brought Aref into the arrangement, solely as a witness to the loan transactions. The government eventually arrested both men, claiming that Aref chose to support money laundering by witnessing the loan. The defense argued that Aref, who spoke very poor English at the time, did not understand that this was anything other than a legitimate loan. Defense attorneys claimed that both Aref and Hossain were unfairly convicted‚Äìthat Hossain was entrapped, and that Aref did not realize any laws were being broken. Pakistan protested the sting having been based on a fictional plot to assassinate the Pakistani ambassador to the United Nations.From one blunder to the next, Asia Times, August 11, 2004 Shahed Hussein The informant, Shahed Hussein, went on to target people in at least two other cases (and appeared unknowingly in two documentaries), was paid over $100,000 by the FBI, and then started a limousine business which ignored safety regulations and caused an accident which killed 20 people in 2018. Hussein targeted James Cromitie in the Newburgh 4 sting case, where he promised Cromitie $250,000 when he became uninterested in the plot. The case was the subject of a 2014 HBO documentary called The Newburgh Sting. The prosecution admitted that Hussein lied on the stand during the trial, and the judge later wrote to prosecutors (see page 7 of the link) recommending they investigate, but that never occurred. In 2012, Hussein was brought in to join an FBI sting operation in Pittsburgh, targeting Khalifah Al-Akili. As documented in the award-winning documentary, (T)error (available on Netflix) Al-Akili realized Hussain was an FBI informant and blew the whistle on the sting. Al-Akili still got an eight-year sentence on an un-related gun charge, and was interviewed by Democracy Now in prison in 2015, before his release in 2018. In October, 2018, the brakes on one of Hussein's limousines completely failed, killing 20 people in the worst US transportation disaster since 2009. Hussein had left the country shortly before, leaving his son, Nauman, to run it in his absence. As of September, 2019, Nauman Hussein is facing 20 homicide counts while his father, Shahed Hussain, has not returned to the US. Trial The trial occurred in September and October 2006. Hossain was convicted of all the counts, and Aref was convicted of 10 of the 30 counts, of conspiring to aid a terrorist group and provide support for a weapon of mass destruction, as well as money-laundering and supporting a foreign terrorist organization, Jaish-e-Mohammed, a group in Pakistan that the informant told the men he supported. Both men filed appeals. The Aref defense attorneys argued on appeal that there was insufficient evidence, and that this was shown by the fact that Aref was acquitted of all the counts based on the most significant of the recorded conversations with the informant-the two conversations underlying the counts on which he was convicted provided him with no new information. On March 8, 2007, both Aref and Hossain were sentenced to 15 years in prison‚Äìhalf the sentence called for under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. Aref's defense counsel filed a lengthy sentencing memorandum which described Aref's background and the support shown for him in the community.United States of America v. Yassin Aref, Sentencing Memorandum, January 29, 2007 Aref professed innocence before his sentencing, and criticized the government's treatment of Muslims.United States of America v. Yassin Aref, Court Transcript, March 8, 2007 After sentencing, Aref was taken to the Communication Management Unit (CMU) at the federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana. He was assigned BOP# 12778‚Äì052. The Times Union ( ) and the Daily Gazette (), Albany's two main daily newspapers, both ran editorials at the time of the sentencing asking for extreme leniency, the Times Union on March 8 and 9 and the Gazette on March 9. In addition, Times Union columnist Fred LeBrun, who had followed the trial closely, wrote, prior to the sentencing, > Someday we'll look back on the present national paranoia over terrorism and > the excesses done in its name with the same national embarrassment that > Americans feel for Sen. Joe McCarthy's communist witch hunts of the 1950s > and our appalling treatment of Japanese-Americans during World War II. > Someday. But not anytime soon, and certainly not before Yassin M. Aref, the > former imam at an Albany mosque, and Mohammed M. Hossain, a pizza shop > owner, are sentenced ... Looking up from a warm seat somewhere, Senator Joe > must be viewing all this with a knowing smile.History will remember Albany > terrorism sting as a witch hunt, Times Union, January 12, 2007 Carl Strock, the columnist for the Gazette, wrote many columns attacking the process as extremely unfair.The View from Here, Daily Gazette, February 4, 2007 The FBI responded by contacting the editorial boards of the Times Union and the Gazette and running an op-ed piece in the Gazette upholding the sting operation as legitimate. Muslim Solidarity Committee After the convictions, the Muslim Solidarity Committee (MSC)Muslim Solidarity Committee was formed to support Aref, Hossain, and their families. It generated over 50 letters, and nearly 1,000 signatures on a petition, to the judge in support of leniency,Summary of Letters in Support of Yassin Aref and raised over $30,000 to support the two families. Its founders won an award from the NYCLUNYCLU Annual Awards Ceremony, November 8, 2007 in November 2007. In 2008, supporters formed another group, Project Salam, which started studying other Muslim ‚Äúterrorism‚Äù convictions, and advocating for others they believed had been treated unfairly. In 2010, Project Salam joined with other groups to form the National Coalition to Protect Civil Freedoms (NCPCF) (later shortened to the Coalition for Civil Freedoms [CCF]) which does essentially the same thing, on a larger scale. In 2018, members of Project Salam recorded a podcast, Terror Talk in which they discussed the Aref/Hossain case and the larger context over several episodes. Appeal Aref's appeal, along with that of Hossain, was denied by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals on July 2, 2008. A petition for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court was denied on March 9, 2009. As reported on the front page of The New York Times on August 26, 2007, the Aref appeal could have been an important test case for the NSA warrantless wiretapping program, as it appeared to be the only criminal case where there was strong evidence that the program was used to target a defendantSpying Program May Be Tested By Terror Case, August 26, 2007 Both the ACLU and the NYCLU got involved in the case. However, in its opinion, the Second Circuit held that Aref had no right to know about this because it was classified. In an accompanying summary order, the court also sidestepped the issue by claiming that Aref hadn't shown a ‚Äúcolorable basis‚Äù for asserted he had been wiretapped under the NSA program. In July, 2009, the Inspector General for the Department of Justice published a report saying that DOJ should re-examine criminal cases to see if exculpatory evidence had been unfairly kept from the defense due to the evidence having been classified. Nothing ever came of that. On April 5, 2010, the Albany, NY Common Council passed a resolution asking DOJ to act on the Inspector General's Report and re-examine the Aref case as well as others. That never occurred. Background on the Wiretapping Issue in the Case In December 2005, The New York Times revealed that President Bush had taken the controversial step of secretly authorizing the NSA to expand its surveillance to within the US.Bush Lets U.S. Spy on Callers Without Courts, December 16, 2005 A month later another NYT article quoted government officials as saying that the NSA program led them to Aref.DOMESTIC SURVEILLANCE: THE PROGRAM; SPY AGENCY DATA AFTER SEPT. 11 LED F.B.I.

Approximately two hours later Judge McAvoy denied the defense motion in a \\"Classified Order,\\" something even more unheard of.Secret Prosecution; Secret Judicial Decisions; Illegal Surveillance, Daily Kos, March 11, 2006 Then on March 22, 2006, the defense filed a petition for mandamus with the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, challenging Judge McAvoy's decision and arguing that the process had violated Aref's constitutional rights‚Äìthe NYCLU also filed a brief supporting the right of public access to court decisions. United States of America v. Aref et al. Case Description, NYCLU, March, 2006 In July 2008, the Second Circuit turned down the petition. The federal appeals court upheld the conviction. \\"The evidence sufficed for a jury to conclude that Aref [and Hossain] intended to aid in preparing a missile attack on American soil.\\" PBS program On April 20, 2007, the Aref/Hossain case was featured on the PBS Documentary \\"Security Versus Liberty: The Other War,\\" which contained interviews with defense attorneys, the mosque President, and representatives from the FBI and the US Attorney's Office.Security versus Liberty: The Other War, PBS, April 20, 2007 Son of Mountains While he was in Rensselaer County Jail awaiting sentencing, Aref wrote a memoir. Stephen Downs helped him put the story into standard English, and editor Jeanne Finley did further editing. The book was published in March 2008. Son of Mountains is the non-fiction story of the life of Aref, an Iraqi Kurd who grew up under the rule of Saddam Hussein and later risked his life opposing him. Aref traverses the landscape of his childhood in Iraqi Kurdistan under Saddam; details the decision to leave Kurdistan for Syria, where he and his wife and children, although poor, make a new life, and then as UN refugees come to the United States; describes his brief residence in America as an immigrant and imam at a small mosque before his arrest, prosecution, and conviction in the \\"terror case\\"; and records his experiences over 18 months at the Rensselaer County Jail. Yassin Comes Home Yassin Aref made it home to Iraqi Kurdistan on June 11, 2019 after finishing his 15-year sentence in October, 2018. When Yassin was released from prison, he didn't want to fight deportation - he was taken to York County Prison (an ICE detention center) to await an eventual flight home to northern Iraq, where his wife and daughters were waiting for him. After his attorney filed a habeas petition, and a hearing was held in Scranton, PA on June 7, Yassin called his son, Salah, on June 9 to say he was being taken to the airport. Yassin made it safely home on June 11, 2019. A few days later his two sons flew there, and the family was reunited in freedom for the first time since 2005, before the youngest daughter was born. On August 4, 2019 Yassin's Albany, NY supporters held their annual commemoration of the August 4, 2004 arrests of him and Mohammed Hossain, and Yassin spoke to the gathering over video link from Kurdistan. Salah then returned to the US in mid-August, 2019 to start Harvard Law School. On August 30, a long Kurdish TV interview with Yassin was aired.

Hossain and an associate, Yassin M. Aref, were convicted of conspiring to aid a terrorist group, supporting a foreign terrorist organization, and money-laundering, and sentenced to 15 years in jail. In July 2008 the appellate court upheld the convictions, rejecting all of the defense's arguments. Hossain was born in Bangladesh. The Albany Times Union reports that US forces found Aref's name, address, and phone number in a notebook found in a bombed out Iraqi encampment. The FBI sent an informer to make contact with Aref through Hossain, to try to get them to participate in an illegal arms deal. The Times Union reported that their lawyers filed motions to learn whether the pair were subjected to warrantless surveillance by the NSA. Normally the NSA is not authorized to conduct electronic surveillance of Americans, only foreign nationals. However, in December 2005, the New York Times revealed that President Bush had taken the controversial step of secretly authorizing the NSA to expand its surveillance to within the United States. Bush claimed that the US Constitution empowered him to authorize warrantless wiretaps when the US Congress granted him the authority to use force in Iraq. According to their lawyers, if it is determined that President Bush's authorization of warrantless wiretaps were unconstitutional, and Aref had been investigated through warrantless wiretaps, the prosecution's case would be \\"jeopardized\\". A grand jury indicted Hossain and Aref on October 1, 2005. He was convicted of conspiring to aid a terrorist group, supporting a foreign terrorist organization, and money-laundering, and sentenced to 15 years in jail. In June 2020, Mohammed Hossain, who was imprisoned for nearly 15 years following his arrest for money laundering in a 2004 FBI militant operation, would leave federal jail early after a federal judge approved his legal appeal for early release.

It was released in North America on July 1994. Unlike other games of the era, Super Godzilla is not a straight action game. Instead, the player must guide Godzilla into the different levels by pressing the adequate button in the appropriate place. The game is split in two screens: the top one shows the actions Godzilla is making at the moment, while the bottom one shows his location on the current level. When Godzilla finds a monster to battle, the game switches into a standard side-view fighting segment. This game uses Bagan, a monster that was originally supposed to fight Godzilla in a feature film. It substitutes the Heisei Mechagodzilla with the original Mechagodzilla in the North American version of the game because Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II had not been released in North America at the time. Story When King Ghidorah suddenly attacks Osaka, the military deploys the Super X II to locate Godzilla, and they use a transmitter to control the mutant dinosaur. Godzilla is led to Osaka, where he fights and kills King Ghidorah. Immediately afterwards, Ghidorah's body vanishes and an alien spaceship appears. The invaders reveal that they were controlling Ghidorah, and demand that the human race surrender. Meanwhile, another Godzilla appears in Mt. Fuji, and the Super X II lures the real Godzilla there to fight it. Godzilla confronts the new Godzilla, who is revealed to be Mechagodzilla wearing an artificial skin. During Godzilla's fight with the robot, the aliens kidnap Dr. Shiragami and take him to Lake Ashino. Godzilla goes there to rescue the professor, and is confronted by Biollante, his plant- like clone. After defeating Biollante, the Super X II rescues Shiragami, it is revealed that the doctor had recovered DNA samples of Godzilla and King Ghidorah and had been experimenting on them to create a serum that enhances the physical attributes of any being. However, the aliens invaded his laboratory and stole the samples, using them to create Biollante. Dr. Shiragami injects some of the serum into Godzilla, making him stronger. The aliens unleash Battra in Yokohama, and it lays an egg that is threatening to hatch. Godzilla travels to Yokohama, kills Battra, and destroys the egg before it can hatch. King Ghidorah soon returns as Mecha-King Ghidorah, having been resurrected by the aliens, and begins to attack Yokohama. The aliens reveal that they have hidden several capsules around the city that are holding Shiragami's serum. If Godzilla can find them all before Mecha-King Ghidorah destroys fifty percent of the city, he will mutate into a more powerful form dubbed \\"Super Godzilla.\\" He succeeds, and confronts Mecha-King Ghidorah. The cyborg monster is easily outmatched by Godzilla's newfound power and is destroyed. However, the battle is far from over. The aliens travel to China, where they awaken an ancient creature called Bagan and inject him with sample of the serum, making him just as powerful as Godzilla. The two titans battle in the ruins of Yokohama, and Bagan proves to be more challenging than all the other monsters he faced. Eventually, Godzilla bests Bagan, and the aliens retreat, but not before promising revenge. The serum eventually wears off, and Godzilla returns to his original form. The Super X II disables the transmitter, releasing Godzilla from their control, and the mutant dinosaur returns to the ocean with humanity indebted to him for his aide. Playable characters *Godzilla - Defender of Japan, the atomic dinosaur that once destroyed civilization became humanity's only hope for survival. In his quest to rid the Earth of its aggressors, Godzilla was aided by a small band of humans that controlled the King of the Monsters as he faces other monsters. *Super Godzilla (Japanese Name: „Çπ„Éº„Éë„Éº„Ç¥„Ç∏„É©)- After King Ghidorah was resurrected as Mecha-King Ghidorah, the human characters determined that Godzilla must increase in power, and so Godzilla had to seek out the three capsules of Super S energy, only then would the monster transform into the godly stature of Super Godzilla. After defeating Mecha-King Ghidorah, Bagan, the ultimate enemy monster of the game appeared and Godzilla again changed into Super Godzilla in order to combat him. Enemy monsters *King Ghidorah *Mechagodzilla (the Japanese version has the Heisei Mechagodzilla; the US version has the original Showa Mechagodzilla) *Biollante *Battra *Mecha-King Ghidorah *Bagan (Godzilla) *UFO (must battle them consistently beginning in Stage 2 unless Godzilla finds and destroys the Mothership in each stage) Reception GamePro opined that the visuals and sounds \\"capture the essence of Godzilla movies\\" but that the gameplay moves too slow, with extensive time spent on a dull map screen culminating in battles which consist mostly of non-interactive cinemas. They concluded the game to be only for hardcore Godzilla fans. Electronic Gaming Monthly similarly criticized that the map roaming is too slow and boring and the battles are too lacking in interactivity, and additionally complained that frustrating \\"cheap hits\\" were too common. They gave the game a score of 6 out of 10.

It was originally founded in 1976 by the merger of two Trotskyist groups: the International Communist League, associated with the United Secretariat of the Fourth International and the Mexican Morenists. In 1977, the Marxist Workers' League, associated with the Organising Committee for the Reconstruction of the Fourth International, joined the party. In the following years, other small groups of Trotskyists also joined the PRT, but the group associated with Moreno left in 1979 to form the Socialist Workers' Party. (Partido Obrero Socialista) (POS) From their base in the 1968 student movement, the PRT grew quickly, soon gaining bases of support among some telephone, electrical, nuclear, and hospital workers. By the 1980s, it was the largest far-left party to challenge the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). In 1981, the federal government recognized the PRT as an official nationwide party. In the 1982 general elections, it was also the first Mexican party to raise gay rights as a campaign issue; the party fielded several openly gay candidates for the Chamber of Deputies. It also entered informal alliances with the other main party on the far left, the United Socialist Party of Mexico (PSUM). During the latter half of the 1980s, the PRT began to face a series of crises and in-fighting as its progress slowed. It has been alleged that the ruling PRI sent agents into the PRT to disrupt its activities. During the 1988 presidential election, the PRT lost ground as an electoral party because of the campaign of leftist Cuauht√©moc C√°rdenas, who soon formed the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD). In 1996, after losing federal recognition, what remained of the PRT (led by Edgard S√°nchez Ram√≠rez) formed Socialist Convergence. Further reading * Robert J.

Founded in 1947, CIES is a private organization with a staff of around 60 people supplemented by 300 voluntary peer reviewers, primarily academics. CIES is a division of the Institute of International Education (IIE). Over 800 Fulbright Scholar awards are granted annually to U.S. scholars and professionals to lecture, research or do both for a semester or an academic year. Awards are granted in all academic disciplines and a variety of interdisciplinary fields. A similar number of non-U.S. scholars come for research or lecturing in the United States as Fulbright Visiting Scholars. CIES also administers other Fulbright programs. The Fulbright Specialist Program provides short-term (2-6 week) grants enabling U.S. faculty and professionals to collaborate with counterparts in other countries on curriculum development, assist in institutional planning, and deliver lecture series. The Fulbright International Education Administrators Seminars allow U.S. higher education administrators to study the society, culture and higher education systems in Germany, Japan or Korea during intensive two- or three-week seminars. The Fulbright New Century Scholars Program gathers 30 outstanding research scholars and professionals from around the globe for collaboration on an annual topic of international significance. Other programs bring non-U.S. scholars to U.S. campuses for research or lecturing. The Occasional Lecturer Program provides travel grants for Fulbright Visiting Scholars to give guest lectures on campuses in other parts of the country from their primary host institution. The Fulbright Scholar-in-Residence program brings scholars from abroad to teach for a semester or a year on U.S. campuses that do not often have the opportunity to host visiting scholars. The Fulbright Visiting Specialists Program: Direct Access to the Muslim World brings scholars, from predominantly Muslim communities in the Middle East, North Africa and South Asia, as well as several countries in Central Asia, Southeast Asia, Europe and Africa, to U.S. institutions for three to six weeks to offer short courses, team-teach, or consult on curriculum development, as well as speak to community groups. The Fulbright Interfaith Community Action Program provides a multinational group of 10 to 12 religious leaders, scholars of religion, non- governmental organization and/or community leaders from diverse religious backgrounds, who are engaged actively in interfaith dialogue in their home countries, with a semester-long exchange experience at a U.S. host institution.

Early life Price was born in Norfolk on 21 September 1967 and was adopted shortly afterwards. In his early days, he attended Worth School, a Roman Catholic boarding school in Sussex. After school, he studied Italian at the University of Reading. However, he left university with the desire to become a journalist ‚Äì he enrolled into the BBC reporter training scheme in 1991. Career Once completed, Price pursued his desire and in 1993, he became a reporter on Radio Berkshire ‚Äì soon to move to Radio Solent. In March 1994, he joined BBC Radio 5 Live to eventually become a Senior Broadcast Journalist. He sometimes stood in for Sybil Ruscoe, and occasionally presented Up All Night. Price joined BBC News 24 when it was launched in November 1997 and presented a mixture of news, fashion, and entertainment in a 10:30 pm slot. However, after nine months, he was called to the office of a senior colleague and told that he was too camp to read the news. He and the producer Chris Wilson put together a nightly entertainment news discussion programme called Zero 30. =Liquid News= After Stuart Murphy said that he enjoyed the programme he was persuaded to take it to digital television channel BBC Choice where it became Liquid News on 30 May 2000. The show became a cult hit on BBC Choice. Even though the viewing figures were not very large, the critical reaction to the show was excellent, and Liquid News quickly became the flagship programme of the channel. In 2001, Price hit the headlines when he signed a ¬£280,000 two-year contract. Under his new contract, he hosted extra editions of Liquid News for BBC One, BBC Prime and BBC America, raising his profile further. Some sections of the press considered his salary to be too much for a presenter on a digital channel. However, the BBC recognised Price's potential and were keen to keep him from \\"defecting\\" to a rival network. At the time, Price himself was quoted as jokingly saying that he didn't understand why people would want to watch a programme presented by a \\"fat, balding, homosexual\\". Under proposals which were awaiting government approval, Price and Liquid News would have been the centrepiece of a new BBC channel, BBC Three. Price hosted his last edition of Liquid News on 16 April 2002. =Other work= In 2002, Price co-hosted BBC One's A Song for Europe competition to choose the UK entry into the Eurovision Song Contest. He had previously hosted BBC Choice shows relating to the contest, including the preview programmes. He had been scheduled to host BBC Choice's alternative coverage of the contest in May 2002. Before his death, Price was linked to a new BBC quiz show and a breakfast show on Channel 4.  Death  Towards the end of April 2002, Price was off work for a week with an acute ear infection. He died of heart failure on the night of 21 April 2002 caused by meningoencephalitis ‚Äì an 'extremely rare' condition that had probably spread from his ear infection. On 22 April 2002, he failed to turn up for work and his close friends Robert Nisbet and Stephanie West went to his flat in Wells Street, off Oxford Street, in central London and found Price dead. Celebrities such as singer Kylie Minogue, comic actor Ralf Little, game show host Anne Robinson and BBC newsreader Huw Edwards paid tribute to him. Within a few days of his death, the BBC website had received over 5000 e-mails paying tribute to him. Price's funeral was a traditional requiem mass, which was held at the London Oratory on 8 May 2002. A private cremation later took place at Mortlake Crematorium.

Monastery of El Paular (Spain). Blessed John Rochester (c. 1498‚Äì1537) was an English Catholic priest, Carthusian monk and martyr. He was hanged at York for refusing to concede King Henry VIII's supremacy over the church. Camm, O.S.B., Bede. \\"The blessed John Rochester\\", Lives of the English Martyrs, Longman's, Greene and Company, 1914, p. 249 Background The government was at first anxious to secure the public acquiescence of the monks of the London Charterhouse regarding royal supremacy in ecclesiastical matters, since for the austerity and sincerity of their mode of life they enjoyed great prestige. Having failed in this, the only alternative was to annihilate the resistance since a refusal engaged the prestige of the monks in the opposite sense. On 4 May 1535 the authorities sent to their death at Tyburn Tree three leading English Carthusians, John Houghton, prior of the London house, Robert Lawrence and Augustine Webster, respectively priors of Beauvale and Axholme. Little more than a month later, it was the turn of three leading monks of the London house: Humphrey Middlemore, William Exmew and Sebastian Newdigate, who were to die at Tyburn Tree on 19 June. This process of attrition was to claim as its victims no less than fifteen of the London Carthusians. Life John was the third son of John Rochester, of Terling, Essex, and Grisold Writtle, daughter of Walter Writtle, of Bobbingworth. He was the brother of Sir Robert Rochester, Comptroller of the Household and a member of the Privy Council under Queen Mary. He joined the Carthusians, was a choir monk of the Charterhouse in London, and strenuously opposed the new doctrine of the royal supremacy.Brown, C.F. Wemyss. \\"Bl. John Rochester.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 8. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 12 Jan. 2013 Four more monks of the London community were seized; two being taken to the Carthusian house at Beauvale in Nottinghamshire, while Dom John Rochester and Dom James Walworth were taken to the Charterhouse of St. Michael in Hull, Yorkshire. =Pilgrimage of Grace= That autumn, the government had just succeeded in putting down a rising in Lincolnshire, when on 13 October 1536, the far more serious Pilgrimage of Grace broke out, mustering an enormous multitude of adherents, perhaps as many as 40,000. This time, having dealt with the problem, the government was desperate to stamp out any centres of resistance. Since one of the flashpoints had been the Northern capital of York, it was necessary for the government to mount a lesson in the city. =Executions= The two London monks were brought from Hull to York and brought before the Lord President of the North, the Duke of Norfolk, on trumped up treason charges.

The incident took place just weeks after Croatia's first multi- party elections in almost fifty years in which the parties favouring Croatian independence had won the majority of votes. The riot resulted in over sixty people wounded, including some stabbed, shot or poisoned by tear gas.Commemoration article on 17th anniversary Background Tension between Dinamo Zagreb and Red Star Belgrade was always high as they consistently placed at the top of the Yugoslav First League and often won the national championships. In 1990, this fierce rivalry was heightened due to rising ethnic tensions in Yugoslavia. The first multi-party elections were held in most of Yugoslavia and communism was ousted in favour of more nationalist parties. The second round of voting in Croatia was held on 6 May when the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) won under Franjo Tuƒëman. Croatia and Slovenia, under new leadership, were the leading forces behind a drive to reorganize Yugoslavia into a confederation, but were opposed by Serbia under Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá and the still powerful communist system at state-level. Approximately 3,000 Delije (Red Star fans) made the trip to Zagreb. Between 15,000 and 20,000 spectators were estimated to have attended the game. The Delije were led by ≈Ωeljko Ra≈ænatoviƒá (also known as \\"Arkan\\"), a Serbian nationalist who led the Serb Volunteer Guard. Many fans of both Red Star and Dinamo would fight in the subsequent Yugoslav Wars, with some of the Delije joining Arkan's paramilitary organization. Both Dinamo and Red Star had violent undertones and essentially functioned as paramilitary organizations, rather than mere football clubs. The clash Up to several hours before the kick-off, skirmishes were reported around Zagreb between Red Star fans (Delije) and Dinamo fans (Bad Blue Boys), which then carried over to Maksimir Stadium. Provoked by stones reportedly being thrown by the Bad Blue Boys, the Delije, situated in the stadium's segregated area reserved for visiting fans, began to tear up the advertising plates and eventually made their way to Dinamo fans. The Delije proceeded to attack them with torn-off seats after reportedly chanting Serbian nationalist slogans like, \\"Zagreb is Serbian\\" and, \\"We'll kill Tuƒëman\\". Revolted by what they saw, the Bad Blue Boys at the north and east stands attempted to storm the pitch, but were quickly pushed back by the police wielding batons and tear gas. Within minutes the situation got out of hand as the Bad Blue Boys could no longer be held back. They breached the fence and took to the pitch to charge at their Serbian counterparts. The police were quickly overwhelmed but came back with reinforcements, using armored vans and water cannons to disperse the rioters. More than an hour later, after the stadium was set on fire, the riot was brought under control. The police were later deemed to have been too lenient with Delije during their early sporadic outbursts, which sparked the larger riot. =Zvonimir Boban's kick= Amidst the chaos several Dinamo players still remained on the pitch, the Red Star players having already left for the locker rooms. Zvonimir Boban, the Dinamo captain, kicked a police officer, Refik Ahmetoviƒá, who was allegedly mistreating a Dinamo supporter. The Bad Blue Boys came to Boban's defence, acting as human shield. The event would later come to symbolize in the minds of Croat nationalists the beginning of Croatian resistance against Serbian aggression. Boban was proclaimed a national hero of Croatia, but also attained a Croat nationalist reputation in Serbia. He was suspended by the Football Association of Yugoslavia (FSJ) for six months, missing the 1990 FIFA World Cup, and had criminal charges filed against him. The officer he had attacked (who turned out to be Bosniak) publicly forgave Boban for his actions several years later. Aftermath The riot marked the beginning of the end for the Yugoslav First League. After playing the entire following 1990‚Äì91 season, clubs from Slovenia and Croatia withdrew from competition. The league lasted for one more season after that as by the end of 1991‚Äì92 season the country disintegrated. Impact The Dinamo-Red Star riot is widely believed by some to have sparked the ensuing Croatian War of Independence. This narrative has been popularized through documentaries and journalistic pieces. However, recent examinations show that this myth reflected the subsequent events to come rather than the other way around. Detractors from this view also cite other football-related controversies that followed the rest of that summer. For Croatians, Boban's actions along with those of the Bad Blue Boys came to be symbolic, representing a foundational moment in their desire for an independent Croatia. In Croatian media, unsubstantiated theories have been presented to demonstrate that the violence was planned by Yugoslav secret services and Serb police chiefs. Columnist Franklin Foer writes, \\"To anyone watching, it was clear that both Serbs and Croats had come ready to fight. Rocks had been carefully stockpiled in the stadium before the game, waiting to be thrown. Acid had been strategically stored so that Croatian fans could burn through the fences separating them from their Serbian counterparts\\".

Plot synopsis During World War II, Nazi sympathizers begin a ritual using Dr. Occult to bring a being known as Koth to Earth, in order to ensure an Axis victory in the war. Hourman and several magical heroes attempt to stop them, but are unsuccessful. The spell goes wrong, however, and the Nazis release a villain known as Stalker, whose sole purpose is to end life everywhere. The magical heroes are either killed or captured by Stalker, and only Hourman and Dr. Occult escape. Hourman informs the rest of the Justice Society of America about Stalker, and the group battles with him in Washington, DC. The JSA manages to wound Stalker enough so that he must create seven disciples (the men who originally brought Stalker to earth) to carry on his work while he recuperates. The JSA splits up to battle each of the disciples. Each team is able to defeat a disciple. Dr. Occult gathers everyone together to battle Stalker in Antarctica, where Stalker is building a machine that will destroy all life on Earth. After a long fight, the machine is destroyed and Stalker is defeated. Collected editions The story arc was collected in the trade paperback The Justice Society Returns (), published by DC Comics in 2003.

She was a leader of a movement promoting Mizrahi Jewish consciousness in Israel. She was an advocate of equal rights and played a key role in the fight for the advancement of Mizrahim (Jews who originate from Arab or Muslim countries). She was among the founders of The Mizrahi Democratic Coalition and the Feminist group Achoti, and is considered one of the founding mothers of the Mizrahi feminist movement. Early life  Victorine \\"Vicki\\" Ben Natan was born in Cairo, to parents Salvo and Fortuna Ben Natan. Salvo, originally from Alexandria, had an accounting degree, but worked as a laborer in a textile factory. The family, including her sisters Odette (b. 1944) and Verjane (b. 1950), immigrated to Israel in 1951, when she was 4. Her brother Uzi was born there, in 1956. She spent her childhood in the Hatikva (hope in Hebrew) slum of Tel Aviv. In 1960, her father lost his job in the recession, and she was forced to leave school at the age of 13, and go to work to help support her family. She completed her matriculation exams at 17, by going to night school. In 1974, she married Haim Shiran (Shakiran), a filmmaker originally from Meknes, Morocco. They had two daughters.  Academics  Shiran received her BA in literature, history and criminology, and her MA in criminology from Tel Aviv University. In 1991 she completed another master's degree and a PhD at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice at New York University. Her doctoral dissertation was titled \\"Political Corruption ‚Äì The Power of the Game: The Case of Israel\\". The work was based on archival, legal and media research, dealing with corruption in Israeli politics and discrimination against Mizrahi politicians. Shiran analyzed prominent cases of political corruption and white-collar crime in Israel between 1948 and 1988. According to Shiran's analysis, the political and legal systems tend to severely punish Mizrahi and Arab politicians belonging to small parties, while on the other hand showing restraint towards, or even ignoring the actions of politicians who are closer to the ruling hegemony. In the 1990s she taught criminology and gender at Beit Berl Academic College, and taught at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem's Department of Law and Criminology. In 2003, she founded the Women's and Gender Studies Program at Beit Berl and was appointed as its first chairwoman. Mizrahi Activism Shiran was a prominent activist against all forms of oppression of human rights in Israel. She made her mark in particular in three main areas: The struggle for Israeli-Palestinian peace, feminism, and the rights of the Mizrahim. She often expressed herself in ways that were considered by some to be provocative. For example, she said, \\"For anyone living in a distressed neighborhood, it means that the state fucked them. As simple as that... In Israeli society there is inequality. The inequality is not only according to class, it also has color.\\" Shiran identified with leftist organizations in Israel and often protested the occupation of the Palestinian territories and expressed support for the establishment of a Palestinian state. She became active in Mizrahi-identified organizations and struggles against the occupation starting in 1970, including the Mizrahi Democratic Rainbow and the East to Peace. She participated in numerous peace conferences and demonstrations in Israel and Europe. As a feminist, Shiran was one of the founders of the Mizrahi Women's Group, which was created to awaken the public feminist discourse in Israel, in light of what she saw as the failure of the second wave of feminism: \\"It is possible that because Israeli feminism remained insular from, and even disregarded social issues, it has remained as a wallflower in the public discourse.\\" In 1999, this group became the Mizrahi feminist movement Achoti - for Women in Israel, which promotes economic, social and cultural justice, and solidarity with women of low socio- economic status in Israeli. Shiran began her Mizrahi activism in her youth in the Hatikva neighborhood: First, as a leading figure in the Mizrahi youth social protest movements, and then throughout 1970s and 1980s in the Black Panthers, Citizens for Neighborhoods, the Eastern Front, and more. From 1969 to 1975 she directed the community theater in Jaffa. In 1981 she initiated The \\"Israel-That's Me!\\" conference, discussing the rifts between the Ashkenazi establishment and Mizrahi and Palestinian-Israeli citizens of Israel in the open for the first time. This led her to establish the New Direction Stage at the HaTikva slum, where she and her activist friends invited Ashkenazi politicians and public figures so that they hear their criticism about the overlap between Israel's ethnic and class divides. In the early 1980s, she headed the \\"Tsalash\\" movement (Zionism for Equality), whose members included Daniel Ben Simon and sociologist Sammy Smooha. In 1981 the movement petitioned the High Court of Justice against the Israel Broadcasting Authority. The suit claimed that the historical series \\"Pillar of Fire\\" ignores the existence of the Mizrahim and denies their role in building the nation. Shiran demanded that the series be banned until this bias is corrected. Shiran's claim was rejected by the High Court of Justice, but the verdict, known as \\"the Shiran Appeal\\", became a milestone in the Mizrahi struggle against discrimination in Israel. In 1981, she joined Tami (Traditional Movement of Israel), a political party that appealed to the traditional Mizrahi religious community, and was headed by Aharon Abuhatzeira. Shiran became the party spokesperson. In 1996 she was one of the founders of the Mizrahi Democratic Rainbow Coalition, a movement that fought for social, economic and cultural justice. In 2003, together with other activists from the Mizrahi Democratic Rainbow, Shiran won a High Court of Justice's claim against the Israel Lands Administration regarding fair housing and just land distribution. In 1983, she ran for mayor of Tel Aviv-Jaffa as part of the Tami list, but received only 1.6 percent of the vote, while the list itself won 1.9 percent of the votes and did not enter the city council.  Mizrahi Feminism  Shiran is considered one of the \\"founding mothers\\" of MIzrahi feminism, and the movement's first public persona. The birthplace of Mizrahi feminism ‚Äì the feminist movement that deals with the particular intersection of oppressions of Mizrahi women ‚Äì is considered to be the 10th Feminist Conference that took place at Givat Haviva in 1994. At the time, Mizrahi women in the feminist movement had been fighting for recognition of their issues and their inclusion on the feminist agenda, as well as for representation in the key decision-making organizations and centers of power in the movement. Israeli feminism had been mostly imported from the United States in the 1970s and 1980s, and adopted mostly by the hegemonic group of white Ashkenazi Jewish women in Israel. There was a great deal of resistance to the idea that the issues facing women are not universal, and the MIzrahi women felt unheard and marginalized within the feminist movement that claimed to represent them. At the conference, when it became clear that the agenda and topics would not be adjusted to their needs, several Mizrahi women, including Shiran, Ella Shohat, Tikva Levy, Mira Eliezer, Henriette Dahan-Kalev, Neta Amar, and others, initiated an action to \\"take the mic\\" at the conference. This time, they consciously chose a plan of action that would ensure they could not be ignored or their issues tabled, even at the cost of open confrontation with the Ashkenazi feminists. The Mizrahi feminists engaged in angry protest at the event, and stormed the stage during the ideological debate, accusing Ashkenazi feminists of racism, oppression and exclusion, and began narrating and describing their experiences as Mizrahi in Israel. Among their stories, the women recounted how their names were taken from them and changed to Israeli names upon their arrival in Israel, the degrading treatment and racism that was and continues to be endemic to Israeli society and institutions, attitudes that pressured or forced them to deny and abandon their Arab culture and their languages of origin in order to integrate into Israeli society. The original discussion planned for the evening was wholly disrupted, displaced by an open battle between the participants, who were divided according to their positions on the Mizrahi issue. The Ashkenazi women vehemently rejected the claims that they were partners in the oppression of Mizrahi feminists and claimed that the ethnic issue was irrelevant to feminism and that it was obsolete. The Mizrahi women, on the other hand, accused the Ashkenazi women of silencing them, and of blindness to the intersections of gender, ethnic and class identity of Mizrahi women and demanding Ashkenazi recognition that the Mizrahi and ethnic struggles also affect women's lives and should be integrated immediately into the Israeli feminist struggle. After the conference, and the refusal of Ashkenazi feminists to recognize the demands of Mizrahi feminists, some Mizrahi women felt that they had no choice but to separate themselves from the feminist movement and to act independently. They organized the first Mizrahi feminist conference in 1996, which dealt with the history of Mizrahi oppression in Israel. Shiran became one of the primary formulators of Mizrahi feminist theory and was a leader in the cohesion of the group into a solidly independent movement, but also participated in grassroots feminist activities. She was one of the founders of Ahoti (my sister), For Women in Israel, a Mizrahi feminist movement founded in 1999. The movement began promoting the labor rights of women from oppressed classes in Israel, and then expanded to various other areas, such as highlighting women's creations and publishing, fair trade, establishment of the Ahoti House, which serves as a community center, gallery and activism headquarters, and more. She was also one of the prominent leaders of the campaign against pornography in the media, and her last achievement as an activist before her death was he successful legislation drive and lost Supreme Court suit against the broadcast of pornography on public TV. Shiran was the formulator of the \\"quarters\\" principle of representation, according to which resources should always be equally divided between Israeli-Palestinian, Mizrahi, Ashkenazi and lesbian women. The principle is also applied to institutional representation, such as the makeup of committees, conferences and panels.  Media Activity  Shiran was on the board of directors of the Israel Broadcasting Authority (2000‚Äì2004), a member of the Second Authority for Television and Radio and a director of the Channel 2 News Company (2000‚Äì2004) and a member of the board of directors of Am Oved Publishers (2001‚Äì2004). Shiran became a well-known media figure, appearing extensively on television, radio and in the news, promoting the social issues she worked on. She published hundreds of articles in Yedioth Ahronoth and other newspapers. In her interviews, she insisted on the principle of equal representation of women and other marginalized groups in the media. Her last campaign was with the \\"Coalition of Women Against Pornography\\", which fought against pornographic broadcasts on Israeli television channels. \\"She was a legend. Everyone knew her politics, but her politics were only relevant within the human context,\\" said Zamira Ron of Achoti. \\"She always wanted us to go into the distressed neighborhoods, to seek out women and men in their forties, who had never had the opportunity to go to school, and convince them to go back and get a higher education. She spoke to them like a friend, one by one, simply and at eye level.\\" Shiran was the scriptwriter for The Salt Statue (1981), produced by Israel Educational Television, which won the International UNESCO Award and the prestigious Israeli David's Harp Prize.  Death  In 1997, Vicky Shiran was diagnosed with breast cancer. Despite her illness, she continued to invest all her talents and resources in promoting cultural and public welfare. At the beginning of 2004, her health deteriorated. She died on March 15, 2004 and was buried in the civilian cemetery at Kibbutz Einat. In 2005, about a year after her death, a book of her poetry, Breaking the Wall published by Am Oved. The book To My Sister, Mizrahi Feminist Politics, was published in 2007 and is dedicated to her memory. The Vicki Shiran Prize was awarded to the best documentary film at the International Women's Film Festival of Rehovoth, every until the festival closed in 2014. In 2013, Itzhak Halutzi directed the film Breaking the Wall, about Shiran's life story.

The park is located about southwest of Duluth and is one of the ten most visited state parks in Minnesota. The western half of the park contains part of a rocky, gorge. This was a major barrier to Native Americans and early Europeans traveling by canoe, which they bypassed with the challenging Grand Portage of the St. Louis River. The river was a vital link connecting the Mississippi waterways to the west with the Great Lakes to the east. Today Minnesota State Highway 210 runs through Jay Cooke State Park. The of the route between Carlton and Highway 23‚Äîwhich include the park‚Äîare designated the Rushing Rapids Parkway, a state scenic byway. The park is named for Pennsylvania financier Jay Cooke, who had developed a nearby power plant, which is still in use. The Grand Portage trail and three districts of 1930s park structures are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History The first of land on which the park is situated were donated to the state by the Saint Louis Power Company in 1915. The park remained generally undeveloped until 1933, when a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp was established on the site. The CCC camp built a rustic swinging bridge over the St. Louis River just slightly downstream from some torrential rapids and waterfalls. This camp also built a picnic shelter. The camp was disbanded in 1935, but a second camp was set up in 1939. This camp rebuilt the swinging bridge and built the River Inn, which now houses the visitor center. This camp was disbanded in 1942, shortly before the federal government ended the CCC entirely. In 1945 the state began to add more land to the park, eventually giving it its current size of . In 2012 the Duluth area experienced a record-setting rainstorm that resulted in flooding that filled the gorge with debris, devastated the park's roads and trails, and destroyed the historic Swinging Bridge that crosses the St. Louis River. By 2014, extensive repair work had repaired most of the trails and replaced the bridge, and further work is ongoing. In June 2015 the park celebrated its 100-year anniversary; today Jay Cooke State Park is one of the ten most visited state parks in Minnesota, with 378,000 visitors in 2014. Architecture Jay Cooke is noted for its Rustic Style historical structures. These structures were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps between 1933 and 1942. All the major landmarks in Jay Cooke are built with local basalt or gabbro stone and dark planks and logs. Most famous of all landmarks is the swinging bridge, which is one of only two suspension bridges in any Minnesota state park. The bridge was designed by Oscar Newstrom. It runs long, of which run over the river itself. It is supported by two large concrete pylons also faced with gabbro. The bank of the river near the River Inn is too steep to walk along, so anyone who wishes to hike the length of the river generally must cross this bridge. In the major floods of June 20, 2012, the swinging bridge was severely damaged. According to an early report from the Pine Journal, at least one stone pillar and half of another were washed away, and the bridge decking was \\"twisted and mangled.\\" The CCC structures are grouped into three historic districts which are separately listed on the National Register of Historic Places. These districts are the Rustic Style District, including the River Inn and Swinging Bridge; the Rustic Style Picnic Grounds, including the shelter, water tower and latrine, and drinking fountain; and the Rustic Style Service Yard, including the custodian's cabin and pump house. Early canoe route Saint Louis River drainage basin Minnesota geography is dominated by three major watersheds which carry the surface waters of the state north to Hudson Bay, east to the Great Lakes, and south into the Mississippi River. The rivers, creeks, and associated lakes within these drainage basins essentially describe the route geography of the thoroughfares used by American Indians for centuries, and later by European explorers, missionaries, and fur traders. But water travel was subject to interruption caused by rapids, falls, or shallows, and not all of the major lakes and rivers were interconnected, making it necessary to portage from time to time. \\"Shooting the Rapids\\", 1871 by Frances Anne Hopkins (1838-1919) A large Montreal canoe running rapids. The avant stands in front with a steering paddle and the gouvernail steers from the rear. The milieux provide power under the instructions of the avant. Voyageur canoe during the fur trade era The earliest North American fur trading did not include long distance transportation of the furs after they were obtained by trade with the Indians; it started with trading near settlements or along the coast or waterways accessible by ship. But later, Coureur des bois achieved business advantages by traveling deeper into the wilderness and trading there. By 1681, the French authorities decided to control the traders. Also, as the trading process moved deeper into the wilderness, transportation of the furs (and the products to be traded for furs) became a larger part of the fur trading business process. The authorities began a process of issuing permits. Those travelers associated with the canoe transportation part of the licensed endeavor became known as voyageurs, a term which literally means \\"traveler\\" in French. The rocky gorge of the St. Louis River was not navigable to canoes, so Native Americans blazed a portage around it. Later, the voyageurs employed it too and dubbed it the \\"Grand Portage of the St. Louis.\\" It was a rough trail of steep hills and swamps that began at the foot of the rapids above the present day Fond du Lac (\\"head of the lake\\") neighborhood and climbed some to the present-day city of Carlton. Above Carlton travelers proceeded upstream and continued on to Lake Vermilion and the Rainy River. Or they may have traveled southwest up the East Savanna River, portaged the grueling six mile long Savanna Portage (now a state park), and then paddled on to the Mississippi River. Canoe rest on Smoke Lake Portage (present day Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness) ~ 1939 ~ The Saint Louis River Grand Portage was divided into 19 pauses (stopping/resting places) spaced one-third to one-half mile apart. To portage the freight, each voyageur carried two or three packs weighing up to 90 pounds each. These were supported by a portage strap, which passed around the voyageur's forehead and reached to the small of his back. Once he reached a pause with his load, the voyageur would jog back to the last stop for more packs. It took an average of three to five days for a crew to complete the Grand Portage, sometimes longer under bad conditions. It was backbreaking labor, and the voyageurs would be plastered with mud and covered with mosquito and fly bites. The Grand Portage was still in use as late as 1870, but a new railroad meant the end of the old passage. Also, fur animals became less plentiful and the amount of North American fur trading declined. A portion of the trail has been renovated for hiking and information is available at the park shelter. Geology =Bedrock= The oldest bedrock visible in Jay Cooke State Park is the Thomson Formation, dating to the Paleoproterozoic era 1.9 billion years ago. The southernmost unit of the Animikie Group, the Thomson Formation is named for the nearby town of Thomson, as this is its type locality. It began as mud, silt, and clayey sand deposited by turbidity currents at the bottom of a deep sea. These sediments compacted into horizontal layers of shale and greywacke. Ripple marks are still visible in the resulting rock, but there are no signs of life as complex organisms had not yet appeared. 1.85 billion years ago a mountain-building event to the south called the Penokean orogeny subjected the sediments to intense pressure and heat. This metamorphosed the shale into dark, thin layers of slate. The slate also developed a pattern of vertical cleavage, but the more massive greywacke deposits were largely resistant to this foliation. Both types of rocks, though, were folded and fractured, giving them the wildly tilted appearance that distinguishes them today. 1.1 billion years ago the Midcontinent Rift System cracked the Thomson Formation, creating southwest-to-northeast trending fractures. Volcanic eruptions sent magma through these gaps, forming the distinctive flood basalts of Minnesota's North Shore. Magma remaining in the underground fractures cooled more slowly into gabbro. Several of these dikes are exposed around the swinging bridge and also just outside the park where Highway 210 crosses the river below the Thomson Dam. They are nearly the same color as the Thomson slate, but can be distinguished by their horizontal columnar joints and lack of slaty cleavage. Around Jay Cooke State Park, the basalt from the Midcontinent Rift eruptions eroded away long ago. In fact the rock layer immediately above the Thomson Formation is the Fond du Lac Formation, which dates from the late Mesoproterozoic era, an unconformity of about 800 million years. This red and brown sedimentary layer is composed of sandstone, siltstone, and shale. The bottommost layer is a conglomerate of quartz pebbles originating from quartz veins in the Thomson Formation. Above, cross-bedding of the sandstone, several layers of mud-chip conglomerate, and mudcracks indicate deposition in a broad river plain. Only small portions of the Fond du Lac Formation are visible within Jay Cooke, primarily along the Little River in the northeast part of the park. Better exposures are found in Fond du Lac, a neighborhood on the outskirts of Duluth just outside the park's eastern border. Many of Duluth's brownstone buildings were constructed from quarries there. =Glaciation= Although the rocky riverbed around the swinging bridge is Jay Cooke's best- known feature, this Precambrian formation is only exposed in a portion of the park. Elsewhere the land is characterized by glaciation. Most of the park lies on red clay sediments deposited 10,000 years ago at the bottom of a proglacial lake. Ice sheets covered Minnesota as many as twenty times over the 2 million years of the Quaternary glaciation, each advance largely obliterating the results of the previous. Nearly all of Minnesota's glacial landforms derive from the last of them, the Wisconsin glaciation. One feature of this time in the park are the rock ridges near the campground, scoured smooth by the glacier and known as roches moutonn√©es. Another is the Thomson Moraine, a ridge along the northwest boundary. This terminal moraine comprises rock and debris dropped at the farthest reach of the Laurentide Ice Sheet's Superior Lobe. As the climate warmed at the end of the Pleistocene epoch, the Superior Lobe shrank northeastward. The deep basin gouged by the ice filled with meltwater around 12,000 years ago as Lake Duluth. Since the eastern shore was formed by the towering wall of the ice sheet, the lake was higher than modern Lake Superior. The St. Louis River, flowing into Lake Duluth, dropped its sediment load onto the lakebed, forming layers of silt and sand alternating with clay. The clay layers include incongruous cobbles and boulders, dropstones which melted free from icebergs floating above. As the Laurentide Ice Sheet receded further, lower elevation outlets were exposed and the lake level dropped significantly. The St. Louis River flowed across the now-exposed lakebed, etching wide and changeable meanders into the soft sediments. On the south side of the river are several steep, curving valleys that are former meanders. Slumping of the unstable clay walls further widened the main valley. The river's downcutting eventually passed through the Pleistocene lake sediments and into the Precambrian bedrock, exposing the rocky, gorge that characterizes the western half of the park. Wildlife The park is inhabited by 46 species of mammals and is an important wintering area for White-tailed Deer. Black Bears, Wolf packs, and Coyotes have been spotted within the park. The park houses 173 species of birds including the Pileated Woodpecker, Northern Harrier, and the Great Blue Heron. Sixteen species of (non-venomous) reptiles are found within the park. Recreation The swinging bridge over the St. Louis River, prior to flood damage in June 2012 The park has over 50 miles of hiking trails, with several scenic overlooks over the Saint Louis River. Certain trails, such as the Greely Creek Trail, Triangle Trail, and Gill Creek Trail, are also open to mountain biking. The Willard Munger State Trail runs through the park. From the park, one can bike or skate to Duluth, about away. This segment of the trail features very scenic views of the Duluth harbor, as well as cuts in the rock made for the building of the St. Paul and Duluth Railroad. The North Country National Scenic Trail, a hiking trail that stretches approximately 4,600 miles (7,400 km) from Crown Point in eastern New York to Lake Sakakawea State Park in central North Dakota, passes through the park. It is the longest of the eleven National Scenic Trails and was designed to provide outdoor recreational opportunities in some of the America's outstanding landscapes. Park activities include camping, hiking, biking, cross-country skiing and kayaking. Park rangers offer over 400 naturalist outreach events each year including nature walks, evening campfire talks, snowshoe-building lessons, and geocaching. As part of the \\"I Can!\\" program for kids and families, the park provides a number of classes and guides to help with camping skills, canoeing, fishing, archery, and other activities. Brown trout are taken in the Saint Louis River (some walleye and northern in slower stretches) and in Otter Creek. Brook trout are found in Silver and Otter creeks. There are two dams on the Saint Louis River near the park; the Thomson Dam (near the northwest boundary) and the Fond du Lac Dam (near the northeast boundary).

The impressive monastery which has remained in relatively good condition also houses one of the world's finest examples of a khachkar.  History  Goshavank was erected in the place of an older monastery once known as Nor Getik, which had been destroyed by an earthquake in 1188. Mkhitar Gosh, a statesman, scientist and author of numerous fables and parables as well as the first criminal code, took part in the rebuilding of the monastery. At Goshavank, Mkhitar Gosh founded a school. One of its alumni, an Armenian scientist by the name of Kirakos Gandzaketsi wrote The History of Armenia. The architect Mkhitar the Carpenter and his disciple Hovhannes also took an active part in the building of the monastery. The complex was later renamed Goshavank and the village named Gosh in his honor.  Complex  thumb300pxComplex Floorplan: 1\\\\. St. Astvatsatsin Church (1191-1196) 2\\\\.

Bell tower and book depository (1241-1291) 8\\\\. School building (13th century) 9\\\\. Gallery (13th century) Goshavank does not have outer walls, and is surrounded by village homes. All of the buildings are attached to each other except for S. Hripsime Chapel, which is located on the opposite hillside and within view. Numerous religious and monumental civil buildings show that in the twelfth to thirteenth centuries the monastery was full of life. The churches are decorated in accordance with the traditions of the time. As a rule, the door portals and windows are framed in rectangular or arched platbands some of which are profiled. The fa√ßade niches have multifoil or scalloped tops like those of the niches of the main church at Geghard. The unusual and artistically framed sun dial on the southern fa√ßade is an eye- catching decorative element. =S. Astvatsatsin= The main churches belong to the types widespread in the tenth to the thirteenth centuries; the domed tall or the cross-winged domed building with four annexes in the corners of the central crossing. =St. Gregory Church= St. Gregory Church is found between the three chapels. = Grigor Lusavorich Church = Grigor Lusavorich Church in Goshavank, started in 1237 and finished by Prince Grigor-Tkha in 1241, while being true to the type of Armenia's fifth-century basilicas, is distinguished by the extravagance of its decorations. The small interior has intricate carvings over most of the surface. Exterior portal fa√ßade of Grigor Lusavorich church. It is a small vaulted structure. The bottom of the altar apse is trimmed by a graceful arcature topped with a band which is ornamented with an intricate geometrical pattern and garlands of alternating trefoils and spheres. The columns of the interior lining the sides of the apse and supporting the wall arch of the arched floor are covered with twisted flutings and fillets; a floral ornament of an ingenious design fills the middle of the lintels of the doors leading to annexes. The exterior decoration of the church is also rich. The graceful arcature with ornamented spandrels, engirdling the edifice, is topped with half-arches on the corners. This creates not only an interesting decoration of the facets of the edifice, but also a smoother transition of the arcature from one facade to the other. The decoration of the butt facades, especially of the western one, is divided in height into separate parts to produce an impression of a substantial size. The framings of the twin window of the eastern facade and of the western entrance are original. The tympanum of the pointed arch of the latter is filled with a fine ornament composed of an intricate interlacement of floral shoots forming a combination of rosettes of various sizes. A similar ornament covers lintel stones, abaci of the columns, individual parts of the archivolt and a hand of eight-pointed stars trimming the portal in a rectangular frame. The carving is so perfect that the overall impression is that of openwork lace. The distinctiveness and richness of the church's decoration evidence the artistic taste and consummate skill of the craftsmen who created it. =Chapels= The double chapels are attached to the gavit, and are found behind the church of S. Grigor Luysavorich. There is also a single chapel found behind St. Gregory Church. = Gavit of St. Astvatsatsin Church = Gavit The gavit of S. Astvatsatsin Church belongs to the most common square plan, with roofing supported by four internal abutments. It has a squat octahedral tents above the central section, making it similar in structure to the Armenian peasant home of the glkhatun type. The gavit has small annexes in the corners of the eastern side of the building. Decorated with various rosettes, these sections contain sculptures of human figures in monks' attires, carrying crosses, staffs, and birds. =Bell tower and book depository= Bell tower and book repository to the left of the gallery The book depository with a bell tower in Goshavank is a structure of unusual composition. Originally, before 1241. there had been in its place a small building with niches for keeping books with a wooden glkhatun type ceiling. Adjacent to it on the western side was a vast premise which probably served as a refectory and an auditorium. It also had wooden roofing which, judging by its size, had three tents and four internal wooden abutments. Then, a two-floor bell tower was built over the book depository. The construction was carried out in two stages. Eight wall- attached abutments and a stone roofing consisting of two pairs of intersecting arches were constructed in the book depository for the cross-plan superstructure. The top floor was elevated only to the height of two rows of stone masonry, as evidenced by the incomplete half-columns situated on the facades. In the second stage, accomplished in 1291 by the patrons Dasapet and Karapet, the top ‚Äì a small church with two altar apses, crowned with a multicolumn rotund belfry ‚Äì was completed. The entrance to the church was from the roof of the auditorium by a cantilever stone stair. The decoration of the building was rather modest. The book depository's semi-circular and dihedral grooved abutments were topped with plain slabs with the lower corners sloped in the shape of trefoils. The roofings of the corner sections, designed on the false vault principle, are composed of triangles differing in size and shape and arranged in such a way as to form eight-pointed stars. The decoration and design of the base of the rotund belfry, which reproduces in stone modified details of the ‚Äúglkhatun‚Äù wooden tent, is more imposing. The bell tower was taller than Grigor church, and therefore dominated Goshavank ensemble. The outer appearance of the building is marked by the gradation of its bulks from the heavy bottom part to the openwork top which emphasizes the domination of the vertical in the building's composition. The architectural peculiarities of the composition of the bell tower influenced the design of the structures like the two-story sepulchral churches in Yeghvard and Noravank built in Armenia in the second quarter of the fourteenth century. =School building= The school building lies in ruins. =Gallery= The gallery is a covered area between the gavit and the bell tower, like a passage, and open on both ends (at least today). =Khachkars= The famous khachkar at Goshavank known as \\"Aseghnagorts\\" (The Needlecarved) The khachkars created by the carver Pavgos in Goshavank stand out among the rest. The best of them is a 1291 khachkar with the maker's name carved in the bottom left star, which is one of the most intricate examples in existence. The finely carved lacy ornaments are arranged in layers in which the basic elements of the composition ‚Äî a cross on a shield-shaped rosette and eight-pointed Starr filling the corners of the middle-cross section‚Äîshow clearly. The intricate openwork ornaments vary ‚Äî a clear-cut geometrical pattern constitutes the background, and the accentuating elements form a complicated combination of a floral and geometrical ornament which never repeats itself. =S. Hripsime Chapel= St. Hripsime chapel (1254), situated south-west of the main group on an opposite hillside consists of a square, domed building.  UNESCO  The monastery of Goshavank, together with that of Haghartsin, may become part of a natural site based on the state protected area of Dilijan National Park, an important forest in north-eastern Armenia.

They were then acquired by Amtrak and NJ Transit, where they lived short lives; all were retired by the mid-1980s. One is preserved at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania. Design By the late 1950s, with its P5a fleet aging, the Pennsylvania Railroad needed new electric freight locomotives. In fact, the PRR had never really had a successful electric freight locomotive. The P5a was originally built to haul passengers, being bumped from that duty by the more powerful GG1. The GG1s were best at hauling passenger trains; while also adequate for fast, time-sensitive freights, they were not as efficient on heavy freights (especially coal and ore trains), at a time before roller bearings were widely used on freight cars. The PRR had purchased E2b, E2c, and E3b demonstrators, but was not particularly impressed, for a variety of reasons. The railroad even considered complete freight dieselization, and commissioned studies on this from builders Alco, GM's EMD and General Electric; however, all three builders recommended retaining all existing electrification and acquiring new electric locomotives. The PRR took special note of twelve state-of-the-art EL-C electrics built by GE for the Virginian Railway, who was satisfied with their performance on their coal trains in the Blue Ridge Mountains. The PRR then approached GE about building a similar locomotive, resulting in an order for 66 such units in 1959. The E44 was essentially a more powerful version of the EL-C (later known as the E33), with compared to the EL-C's . One of the most notable differences in appearances between the two locomotives was the pantograph(s): the El-C had one double-arm (Stemmann) pantograph, whereas the E44 had two single-arm (Faiveley) pantographs, a characteristic born of the PRR's operating practice of having two pantographs per locomotive. The EL-C, while of utilitarian design, also had a slightly more rounded appearance than the rather boxier E44. While the E44 was short on aesthetics compared with the GG1 and P5 (\\"bricks\\" being a particularly common sobriquet), the units were long on performance. General Electric constructed the first 60 E44s (4400-4459) using Ignitron rectifiers, and the final six units (4460-4465) with air-cooled silicon diode rectifiers. GE subsequently upgraded 22 of the units (a few at a time) to an E44a designation, boasting upgraded traction motors and silicon rectifier packages for an output of 5,000 horsepower. The 22 E44a's were numbered ; the E44a program was terminated in 1970 due to the Penn Central bankruptcy. Conrail subsequently swapped out the Ignitrons in all of the remaining units for silicon diodes in the late 1970s and early 1980s, in-house and without any horsepower upgrades. In 1980, GE took E44a 4453 in hand for rebuilding with upgraded electronics and uprating to 6,000 horsepower. Made redundant by Conrail's discontinuance of electrified freight operations, the rebuilt 4453 was briefly tested on the Northeast Corridor in 1984 by GE, who then scrapped the unit several years later after salvaging the newer components. In the late 1960s, General Electric constructed two upgraded 5,000 horsepower (25,000 volt, 60 cycle) units of the same E44 body style (known as E50Cs) for the Muskingum Electric Railroad, a private coal-carrying railroad owned by American Electric Power. Until it closed in 2002, MERR shuttled coal in two automated consists from the mine to a powerplant at Relief, Ohio (across from Beverly, OH). History =Pennsylvania Railroad= The Pennsylvania took delivery of 66 E44s between 1960‚Äì63 and they quickly displaced the P5s. The Pennsylvania used the E44s on just about any freight assignment imaginable, on all of its electrified lines. They could work both singly or lashed together as multiple units. They quickly proved to be very versatile and could handle just about any train, without helpers. The E44's dynamic braking, a novelty under PRR wires, made them just as sure-footed descending grades as climbing them (although the brakes were not regenerative). They even occasionally hauled passenger trains in emergencies, although they were not very adept in this role, being (officially) limited to , having a pronounced oscillating tendency at speed on jointed rail, and of course lacking steam generators for passenger service. The units were delivered in an entirely new paint scheme. While adorned in the familiar PRR Brunswick Green, the units carried the sans-serif road name in yellow, flanked by two small PRR keystones, together with a keystone on the front and rear, and a large yellow road number. This scheme was unique to the E44; all subsequent diesel orders omitted the road name. The impact of the lettering was diminished by the fact that the units were seldom washed and became very grimy, due to the assignment of the units to diesel service facilities whose automatic car washers lacked overhead wiring. =Penn Central and Conrail= A Penn Central E44 on the Northeast Corridor in 1972. After the 1968 Penn Central merger, the E44s remained in freight service, over the same territory as before, and (unlike much of the Penn Central diesel fleet), as reliably as before. The paint scheme for most units was Penn Central black with the \\"worms in love\\" logo. At least one unit wore the short-lived \\"red-P\\" logo, with the 'P' in the logo red instead of white. Not all units received a full Penn Central paint scheme, mainly due to the cash-strapped nature of the railroad, which went bankrupt in June 1970. For example, some had white PC numbers and small \\"worms\\" on the ends, while a few never received any new lettering at all, instead having all their PRR markings simply patch-painted over except for their yellow numbers. In 1976, they were passed to the newly formed Conrail. However, things changed when Conrail eliminated their electrification in 1981. All 66 E44s were retired at that time, though some units were already stored due to economic downturn; no unit had ever been retired or seriously wrecked. Most, though not all, of the E44s got to be repainted blue with Conrail's white \\"wheel on rail\\" logo. =Amtrak and NJ Transit= Despite their versatility, the E44's were suddenly about to be used in something they were never intended for: passenger service. Amtrak and New Jersey Transit, both short of electric locomotives, saw in the E44's an opportunity to obtain needed power at bargain-basement prices Amtrak painted them in its standard switcher paint (gray body with black lettering), and switching work was mostly what they ended up doing. They did this adeptly for some years, until Amtrak decided maintaining these aging locomotives was not worth it. The PCB-laden coolant in their transformers also cut short their lives. Many were stored at Wilmington Shops in Wilmington, DE during the early to mid-1990 and they were eventually scrapped. It is not certain what exactly NJ Transit was looking for, but it evidently was not the E44. All were sold to Amtrak. Like many of NJ Transit's second-hand locomotives, their paint scheme was the previous owner (Conrail)'s herald being painted out, and \\"NJDOT\\" (New Jersey Department of Transportation) written below the number. Preservation PRR 4465, the final production E44, is preserved at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania. 4465 was completed in July 1963, and later saw service with Amtrak as No. 502.

The Inter-Entity Boundary Line (, ), commonly abbreviated IEBL, subdivides Bosnia and Herzegovina into two entities and one district, the Republika Srpska, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Brƒçko District. The total length of the Inter-Entity Boundary Line is . History The present political divisions of Bosnia and Herzegovina is based on Annex 4 of the General Framework Agreement for Peace, also known as Dayton Agreement, concluded at the Dayton Peace Conference in November 1995, and subsequently signed in Paris on December 14, 1995. A key component of this was the delineation of the Inter-Entity Boundary Line (IEBL), to which many of the tasks listed in the other Annexes referred. In particular the IEBL affected the tasks of the Military Annexes, such as the initial and immediate \\"Separation of Forces\\", the creation of an initial \\"Zone of Separation\\", the \\"Transfer of Areas\\" between the entities and the district, and the \\"Removal of Forces\\" to \\"Containment Areas\\". During this initial \\"Implementation Period\\", enforced by NATO-led Implementation Force or IFOR, it was required that along the IEBL a so-called 2 km \\"Zone of Separation\\" be established, which stretched toward both entities, making a zone 4 km wide in total. The IEBL mostly follows along the military front-lines as they were at the end of the Bosnian War, with some major adjustments, most notably in the western part of the country, and in-and-around Sarajevo). Mapping technology Dayton marked the first occasion when three-dimensional satellite image technology and digital cartography was used to determine and delineate boundaries in an official treaty. Due to the speed and intensity of the negotiations (especially towards the end), a series of Inter-Entity Boundary Line commissions still needed to be held over the first 6 months of the NATO- led Implementation Force (IFOR) operation to iron out the remaining details of some of the boundaries (especially within Sarajevo). Over 40 changes to the IEBL were negotiated by the parties in meetings facilitated by the Chief of Staff HQ ARRC, Major General Michael Willcocks. These were signed off by IFOR Commander Admiral Leighton W. Smith, Jr. in July 1996. The IEBL between Republika Srpska, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Brƒçko District is no longer controlled by the military and is not policed. There are no \\"Zone of Separation\\", or any kind of border controls and crossings. The IEBL is akin to crossing a U.S. state boundary. Ruling of the Constitutional Court The Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina has, in its first partial decision number U 5/98, ruled on the issue whether the Constitution of the Republika Srpska can use the word \\"border\\" instead of the \\"boundary\\" in its text. The Court declared: Thus, the Constitution of the RS had to be amended, which was done with the Amendment number LXVIII, which changed the word \\"border\\" in the Amendment number LV on the Article 2 paragraph 2 of the Constitution of RS. Municipalities divided by the line 48 out of 109 municipalities were divided into two or more segments.

Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Inc., 2011. Web. 26 December 2011. It was mentioned as one of four independent kingdoms in southern India during Ashoka's time, the others being the Cholas, Pandyas and Satyaputras. The Cheras transformed Kerala into an international trade centre by establishing trade relations across the Arabian Sea with all major Mediterranean and Red Sea ports as well those of the Far East. The early Cheras collapsed after repeated attacks from the neighboring Cholas and Rashtrakutas. During the early Middle Ages, Namboodiri Brahmin immigrants arrived in Kerala and shaped the society on the lines of the caste system. In the 8th century, Adi Shankara was born at Kalady in central Kerala. He travelled extensively across the Indian subcontinent founding institutions of the widely influential philosophy of Advaita Vedanta. The Cheras regained control over Kerala in the 9th century until the kingdom was dissolved in the 12th century, after which small autonomous chiefdoms, most notably Venadu, arose. In 1498, Vasco Da Gama established a sea route to Kerala and raised Portuguese settlements, which marked the beginning of the colonial era of Kerala. European trading interests of the Dutch, French and the British East India companies took centre stage during the colonial wars in India. After the Dutch were defeated by Travancore king Marthanda Varma, the British crown gained control over Kerala by allying with the newly created princely state of Travancore until India was declared independent in 1947. The state of Kerala was created in 1956 from the former state of Travancore-Cochin, the Malabar district and the Kasaragod taluk of South Canara District of Madras state.  Traditional sources  Parasurama, surrounded by settlers, commanding Varuna to part the seas and reveal Kerala.alt= = Mahabali = Perhaps the most famous festival of Kerala, Onam, is deeply rooted in Kerala traditions. Onam is associated with the legendary king Mahabali (Maveli), who according to tradition and Puranas, ruled the Earth and several other planetary systems from Kerala. His entire kingdom was then a land of immense prosperity and happiness. However, Mahabali was tricked into giving up his rule, and was thus overthrown by Vamana (Thrikkakkarayappan), the fifth Avatar (earthly incarnation) of Lord Vishnu. He was banished from the Earth to rule over one of the netherworld (Patala) planets called Sutala by Vamana. Mahabali comes back to visit Kerala every year on the occasion of Onam. = Other texts = The oldest of all the Puranas, the Matsya Purana, sets the story of the Matsya Avatar (fish incarnation) of Lord Vishnu, in the Western Ghats. The earliest Sanskrit text to mention Kerala by name as Cherapadah is the Aitareya Aranyaka, a late Vedic work on philosophy. It is also mentioned in both the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. = Parasurama = There are legends dealing with the origins of Kerala geographically and culturally. One such legend is the retrieval of Kerala from the sea, by Parasurama, a warrior sage. It proclaims that Parasurama, an Avatar of Mahavishnu, threw His battle axe into the sea. As a result, the land of Kerala arose, and thus was reclaimed from the waters.  Prehistory  A alt= Archaeological studies have identified many Mesolithic, Neolithic and Megalithic sites in Kerala. These findings have been classified into Laterite rock-cut caves (Chenkallara), Hood stones (Kudakkallu), Hat stones (Toppikallu), Dolmenoid cists (Kalvrtham), Urn burials (Nannangadi) and Menhirs (Pulachikallu). The studies point to the indigenous development of the ancient Kerala society and its culture beginning from the Paleolithic age, and its continuity through Mesolithic, Neolithic and Megalithic ages. However, foreign cultural contacts have assisted this cultural formation. The studies suggest possible relationship with Indus Valley Civilization during the late Bronze Age and early Iron Age. Archaeological findings include dolmens of the Neolithic era in the Marayur area. They are locally known as \\"muniyara\\", derived from muni (hermit or sage) and ara (dolmen). Rock engravings in the Edakkal Caves in Wayanad are thought to date from the early to late Neolithic eras around 5000 BCE.Tourism information on districts‚ÄìWayanad , official website of the Govt. of Kerala Historian M. R. Raghava Varier of the Kerala state archaeology department identified a sign of \\"a man with jar cup\\" in the engravings, which is the most distinct motif of the Indus valley civilisation.  Classical period  alt= = Early ruling dynasties = Kerala's dominant rulers of the early historic period were the Cheras, a Tamil dynasty with its headquarters located in Vanchi. The location of Vanchi is generally considered near the ancient port city of Muziris in Kerala. However, Karur in modern Tamil Nadu is also pointed out as the location of the capital city of Cheras. Another view suggests the reign of Cheras from multiple capitals. The Chera kingdom consisted of a major part of modern Kerala and Kongunadu which comprises western districts of modern Tamil Nadu like Coimbatore and Salem. Old Tamil works such as Pati·πü·πüuppattu, Pati·πâe·πámƒìlka·πáakku and Silappatikaram are important sources that describe the Cheras from the early centuries CE. Together with the Cholas and Pandyas the Cheras formed the Tamil triumvirate of the m≈´vƒìntar (Three Crowned Kings). The Cheras ruled the western Malabar Coast, the Cholas ruled in the eastern Coromandel Coast and the Pandyas in the south-central peninsula. The Cheras were mentioned as Ketalaputo (Keralaputra) on an inscribed edict of emperor Ashoka of the Magadha Empire in the 3rd century BCE, as Cerobothra by the Greek Periplus of the Erythraean Sea and as Celebothras in the Roman encyclopedia Natural History by Pliny the Elder. The Mushika kingdom existed in northern Kerala, while the Ays ruled south of the Chera kingdom. = Trade relations = The region of Kerala was possibly engaged in trading activities from the 3rd millennium BCE with Sumerians and Babylonians.Striving for sustainability, environmental stress and democratic initiatives in Kerala, p. 79; , Srikumar Chattopadhyay, Richard W. Franke; Year: 2006. Phoenicians, Greeks, Egyptians, Romans, Jews, Arabs and Chinese were attracted by a variety of commodities, especially spices and cotton fabrics.Faces of Goa: a journey through the history and cultural revolution of Goa and other communities influenced by the Portuguese By Karin Larsen (Page 392) Muziris, Berkarai, and Nelcynda were among the principal trading port centres of the Chera kingdom. Megasthanes, the Greek ambassador to the court of Magadhan king Chandragupta Maurya (4th century BCE) mentions Muziris and a Pandyan trade centre. Pliny mentions Muziris as India's first port of importance. According to him, Muziris could be reached in 40 days from the Red Sea ports of Egypt purely depending on the South west monsoon winds. Later, the unknown author of the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea notes that \\"both Muziris and Nelcynda are now busy places\\". There were harbours of Naura near Kannur, Tyndis near Koyilandy, and Bacare near Alappuzha which were also trading with Rome and Palakkad pass (churam) facilitated migration and trade. Roman establishments in the port cities of the region, such as a temple of Augustus and barracks for garrisoned Roman soldiers, are marked in the Tabula Peutingeriana; the only surviving map of the Roman cursus publicus. The value of Rome's annual trade with the region was estimated at around 50,000,000 sesterces.According to Pliny the Elder, goods from India were sold in the Empire at 100 times their original purchase price. See Contemporary Tamil literature, Pu·πüanƒÅ·πâ≈´·πüu and Akana·πâ≈´·πüu, speak of the Roman vessels and the Roman gold that used to come to the Kerala ports in search of pepper and other spices, which had enormous demand in the West. The contact with Romans might have given rise to small colonies of Jews and Syrian Christians in the chief harbour towns of Kerala. Silk Road map. The spice trade was mainly along the water routes (blue). = Formation of a multicultural society = Buddhism and Jainism reached Kerala in this early period. As in other parts of ancient India, Buddhism and Jainism co-existed with early Hindu beliefs during the first five centuries. Merchants from West Asia and Southern Europe established coastal posts and settlements in Kerala. Jews arrived in Kerala as early as 573 BCE.De Beth Hillel, David (1832). Travels (Madraspublication).Lord, James Henry (1977). The Jews in India and the Far East; Greenwood Press Reprint; ISBN. The Cochin Jews believe that their ancestors came to the west coast of India as refugees following the destruction of Jerusalem in the first century CE. Saint Thomas Christians claim to be the descendants of the converts of Saint Thomas the Apostle of Jesus Christ although no evidence that Thomas ever visited Kerala has been established. Arabs also had trade links with Kerala, starting before the 4th century BCE, as Herodotus (484‚Äì413 BCE) noted that goods brought by Arabs from Kerala were sold to the Jews at Eden. They intermarried with local people, resulting in formation of the Muslim Mappila community. In the 4th century, the Knanaya Christians migrated from Persia and settled in southern Kodungallur.The Encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 5 by Erwin Fahlbusch. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing - 2008, Page 285. . Mappila was an honorific title that had been assigned to respected visitors from abroad; and Jewish, Syrian Christian, and Muslim immigration might account for later names of the respective communities: Juda Mappilas, Nasrani Mappilas, and Muslim Mappilas.* Bindu Malieckal (2005) Muslims, Matriliny, and A Midsummer Night's Dream: European Encounters with the Mappilas of Malabar, India; The Muslim World Volume 95 Issue 2 According to the legends of these communities, the earliest Christian churches, mosque, and synagogue (CE 1568) in India were built in Kerala. The combined number of Jews, Christians, and Muslims was relatively small at this early stage. They co-existed harmoniously with each other and with local Hindu society, aided by the commercial benefit from such association.  Early medieval period  = Political changes = Tharisapalli plates granted to Saint Thomas Christians testify that merchant guilds and trade corporations played a very significant role in the economy and social life during the Kulasekhara period. Much of history of the region from the 6th to the 8th century is obscure. From the Kodungallur line of the Cheras rose the Kulasekhara dynasty, which was established by Kulasekhara Varman. At its zenith these Later Cheras ruled over a territory comprising the whole of modern Kerala and a smaller part of modern Tamil Nadu. During the early part of Kulasekhara period, the southern region from Nagercoil to Thiruvananthapuram was ruled by Ay kings, who lost their power in the 10th century and thus the region became a part of the Cheras. Kerala witnessed a flourishing period of art, literature, trade and the Bhakti movement of Hinduism. A Keralite identity, distinct from the Tamils, became linguistically separate during this period. For the local administration, the empire was divided into provinces under the rule of Nair Chieftains known as Naduvazhis, with each province comprising a number of Desams under the control of chieftains, called as Desavazhis. The era witnessed also a shift in political power, evidenced by a gradual increase of Namboothiri Brahmin settlements, who established the caste hierarchy in Kerala by assigning different groups separate positions. As a result, many temples were constructed across Kerala, which according to M. T. Narayanan \\"became cornerstones of the socio-economic society\\". The inhibitions, caused by a series of Chera-Chola wars in the 11th century, resulted in the decline of foreign trade in Kerala ports. Buddhism and Jainism disappeared from the land. The Kulasekhara dynasty was finally subjugated in 1102 by the combined attack of the Pandyas and Cholas. However, in the 14th century, Ravi Varma Kulashekhara (1299‚Äì1314) of the southern Venad kingdom was able to establish a short-lived supremacy over southern India. After his death, in the absence of a strong central power, the state was fractured into about thirty small warring principalities under Nair Chieftains; most powerful of them were the kingdom of Samuthiri in the north, Venad in the south and Kochi in the middle. = Rise of Advaita = Adi Shankara (CE 789), one of the greatest Indian philosophers, is believed to be born in Kaladi in Kerala, and consolidated the doctrine of advaita vedƒÅnta.The Seven Spiritual Laws Of Yoga, Deepak Chopra, John Wiley & Sons, 2006, , Shankara travelled across the Indian subcontinent to propagate his philosophy through discourses and debates with other thinkers. He is reputed to have founded four mathas (\\"monasteries\\"), which helped in the historical development, revival and spread of Advaita Vedanta. Adi Shankara is believed to be the organiser of the Dashanami monastic order and the founder of the Shanmatatradition of worship. His works in Sanskrit concern themselves with establishing the doctrine of advaita (nondualism). He also established the importance of monastic life as sanctioned in the Upanishads and Brahma Sutra, in a time when the Mimamsa school established strict ritualism and ridiculed monasticism. Shankara represented his works as elaborating on ideas found in the Upanishads, and he wrote copious commentaries on the Vedic canon (Brahma Sutra, principal upanishads and Bhagavad Gita) in support of his thesis. The main opponent in his work is the Mimamsa school of thought, though he also offers arguments against the views of some other schools like Samkhya and certain schools of Buddhism.Sri Adi Shankaracharya, Sringeri Sharada Peetham, IndiaBiography of Sri Adi Shankaracharya, Sringeri Sharada Peetham, IndiaThe philosophy of Sankar's Advaita Vedanta, Shyama Kumar Chattopadhyaya, Sarup & Sons, 2000, , His activities in Kerala was little and no evidence of his influence is noticed in the literature or other things in his lifetime in Kerala. Even though Sankara was against all caste systems, in later years his name was used extensively by the Brahmins of Kerala for establishing caste system in Kerala. = Kingdom of Venad = Venad was a kingdom in the south west tip of Kerala, which acted as a buffer between Cheras and Pandyas. Until the end of the 11th century, it was a small principality in the Ay Kingdom. The Ays were the earliest ruling dynasty in southern Kerala, who, at their zenith, ruled over a region from Nagercoil in the south to Thiruvananthapuram in the north. Their capital was at Kollam. A series of attacks by the Pandyas between the 7th and 8th centuries caused the decline of Ays although the dynasty remained powerful until the beginning of the 10th century. When Ay power diminished, Venad became the southernmost principality of the Second Chera Kingdom Invasion of Cholas into Venad caused the destruction of Kollam in 1096. However, the Chera capital, Mahodayapuram, fell in the subsequent attack, which compelled the Chera king, Rama varma Kulasekara, to shift his capital to Kollam. Thus, Rama Varma Kulasekara, the last emperor of Chera dynasty, is probably the founder of the Venad royal house, and the title of Chera kings, Kulasekara, was thenceforth adopted by the rulers of Venad. The end of Second Chera dynasty in the 12th century marks the independence of the Venad. The Venadu King then also was known as Venadu Mooppil Nayar. In the second half of the 12th century, two branches of the Ay Dynasty: Thrippappur and Chirava, merged into the Venad family and established the tradition of designating the ruler of Venad as Chirava Moopan and the heir-apparent as Thrippappur Moopan. While Chrirava Moopan had his residence at Kollam, the Thrippappur Moopan resided at his palace in Thrippappur, north of Thiruvananthapuram, and was vested with the authority over the temples of Venad kingdom, especially the Sri Padmanabhaswamy temple. The most powerful kingdom of Kerala during the colonial period, Travancore, was developed through the expansion of Venad by Mahahrajah Marthanda Varma, a member of the Thrippappur branch of the Ay Dynasty who ascended to the throne in the 18th century. = Kingdom of Kozhikode = Historical records regarding the origin of the Samoothiri of Kozhikode is obscure. However, its generally agreed that the Samoothiri were originally the Nair chieftains of Eralnadu region of the Later Chera Kingdom and were known as the Eradis. Eralnadu province was situated in the northern parts of present-day Malappuram district and was landlocked by the Valluvanad and Polanadu in the west. Legends such as The Origin of Kerala tell the establishment of a local ruling family at Nediyiruppu, near present-day Kondotty by two young brothers belonging to the Eradi clan. The brothers, Manikkan and Vikraman were the most trusted generals in the army of the Cheras. M.G.S. Narayanan, a Kerala-based historian, in his book, Calicut: The City of Truth states that the Eradi was a favourite of the last Later Chera king and granted him, as a mark of favor, a small tract of land on the sea-coast in addition to his hereditary possessions (Eralnadu province). Eradis subsequently moved their capital to the coastal marshy lands and established the kingdom of KozhikodeTo corroborate his assertion that Eradi was in fact a favourite of the last Later Chera, M.G.S. cites a stone inscription discovered at Kollam in southern Kerala. It refers to \\"Nalu Taliyum, Ayiram, Arunurruvarum, Eranadu Vazhkai Manavikiraman, mutalayulla Samathararum\\" - \\"The four Councillors, The Thousand, The Six Hundred, along with Mana Vikrama-the Governor of Eralnadu and other Feudatories.\\" M.G.S. indicates that Kozhikode lay in fact beyond and not within the kingdom of Polanadu and there was no need of any kind of military movements for Kozhikode. They later assumed the title of SamudrƒÅthiri (\\"one who has the sea for his border\\") and continued to rule from Kozhikode. Samoothiri allied with Muslim Arab and Chinese merchants and used most of the wealth from Kozhikode to develop his military power. They became the most powerful king in the Malayalam speaking regions during the Middle Ages. In the 14th century, Kozhikode conquered large parts of central Kerala, which was under the control of the king of Kingdom of Kochi. He was forced to shift his capital (c. CE 1405) further south. In the 15th century, Kochi was reduced in to a vassal state of Kozhikode.  Colonial period  Vasco da Gama landing in Kerala The maritime spice trade monopoly in the Indian Ocean stayed with the Arabs during the High and Late Middle Ages. However, the dominance of Middle East traders was challenged in the European Age of Discovery. After Vasco Da Gama's arrival in Kappad Kozhikode in 1498, the Portuguese began to dominate eastern shipping, and the spice-trade in particular. = Portuguese period = The path alt= The Samoothiri Maharaja of Kozhikode permitted the Portuguese to trade with his subjects. Their trade in Kozhikode prospered with the establishment of a factory and fort in his territory. However, Portuguese attacks on Arab properties in his jurisdiction provoked the Samoothiri and finally led to conflict. The Portuguese took advantage of the rivalry between the Samoothiri and Rajah of Kochi‚Äîthey allied with Kochi and when Francisco de Almeida was appointed Viceroy of Portuguese India in 1505, he established his headquarters at Kochi. During his reign, the Portuguese managed to dominate relations with Kochi and established a number of fortresses along the Malabar Coast. Nonetheless, the Portuguese suffered severe setbacks due to attacks by Samoothiri Maharaja's forces, especially naval attacks under the leadership of admirals of Kozhikode known as Kunjali Marakkars, which compelled them to seek a treaty. The Portuguese Cemetery, Kollam (after the invasion of Dutch, it became Dutch Cemetery) of Tangasseri in Kollam city was constructed in around 1519 as part of the Portuguese invasion in the city. Buckingham Canal (a small canal between Tangasseri Lighthouse and the cemetery) is situated very close to the Portuguese Cemetery. A group of pirates known as the Pirates of Tangasseri formerly lived at the Cemetery. The remnants of St. Thomas Fort and Portuguese Cemetery still exist at Tangasseri. = French Region in Kerala = The French East India Company constructed a fort on the site of Mah√© in 1724, in accordance with an accord concluded between Andr√© Mollandin and Raja Vazhunnavar of Badagara three years earlier. In 1741, Mah√© de La Bourdonnais retook the town after a period of occupation by the Marathas. In 1761 the British captured Mah√©, India, and the settlement was handed over to the Rajah of Kadathanadu. The British restored Mah√©, India to the French as a part of the 1763 Treaty of Paris. In 1779, the Anglo-French war broke out, resulting in the French loss of Mah√©, India. In 1783, the British agreed to restore to the French their settlements in India, and Mah√©, India was handed over to the French in 1785. = Dutch period = Dutch commander De Lannoy surrenders to Marthanda Varma at the Battle of Colachel (1741). Depiction at Padmanabhapuram Palace. The weakened Portuguese were ousted by the Dutch East India Company, who took advantage of continuing conflicts between Kozhikode and Kochi to gain control of the trade. The Dutch Malabar (1661‚Äì1795) in turn were weakened by their constant battles with Marthanda Varma of the Travancore Royal Family, and were defeated at the Battle of Colachel in 1741, resulting in the complete eclipse of Dutch power in Malabar. The Treaty of Mavelikkara was signed by the Dutch and Travancore in 1753, according to which the Dutch were compelled to detach from all political involvements in the region. In the meantime, Marthanda Varma annexed many smaller northern kingdoms through military conquests, resulting in the rise of Travancore to a position of preeminence in Kerala. Hyder Ali of Mysore conquered northern Kerala in the 18th century, capturing Kozhikode in 1766. = British period = Captured Mappila prisoners of 1921 revolt, taken after a battle with British troops. Hyder Ali and his successor, Tipu Sultan, came into conflict with the British, leading to the four Anglo-Mysore wars fought across southern India in the latter half of the 18th century. Tipu Sultan ceded Malabar District to the British in 1792, and South Kanara, which included present-day Kasargod District, in 1799. The British concluded treaties of subsidiary alliance with the rulers of Cochin (1791) and Travancore (1795), and these became princely states of British India, maintaining local autonomy in return for a fixed annual tribute to the British. Malabar and South Kanara districts were part of British India's Madras Presidency. Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja (Kerul Varma Pyche Rajah, Cotiote Rajah) (3 January 175330 November 1805) was the Prince Regent and the de facto ruler of the Kingdom of Kottayam in Malabar, India between 1774 and 1805. He led the Pychy Rebellion (Wynaad Insurrection, Coiote War) against the English East India Company. He is popularly known as Kerala Simham (Lion of Kerala). Organised expressions of discontent with British rule were not uncommon in Kerala. Uprisings of note include the rebellion by Pazhassi Raja, Velu Thampi Dalawa and the Punnapra-Vayalar revolt of 1946. In 1919, consequent to their victory in World War I, the British abolished the Islamic Caliphate and dismembered the Ottoman Empire. This resulted in protests against the British by Muslims of the Indian sub-continent known as the Khilafat Movement, which was supported by Mahatma Gandhi in order to draw the Muslims into the mainstream national independence movement. In 1921, the Khilafat Movement in Malabar culminated in widespread riots against the British government and Hindu population in what is now known as the Moplah rebellion. Kerala also witnessed several social reforms movements directed at the eradication of social evils such as untouchability among the Hindus, pioneered by reformists like Srinarayana guru and Chattambiswami among others. The non-violent and largely peaceful Vaikom Satyagraha of 1924 was instrumental in securing entry to the public roads adjacent to the Vaikom temple for people belonging to untouchable castes. In 1936, Sree Chithira Thirunal Balaramavarma, the ruler of Travancore, issued the Temple Entry Proclamation, declaring the temples of his kingdom open to all Hindu worshipers, irrespective of caste.  Modern history  = Formation of Kerala state = The two kingdoms of Travancore and Cochin joined the Union of India after independence in 1947. On 1July 1949, the two states were merged to form Travancore-Cochin. On 1January 1950, Travancore-Cochin was recognised as a state. The Madras Presidency was reorganised to form Madras State in 1947. On 1November 1956, the state of Kerala was formed by the States Reorganisation Act merging the Malabar district, Travancore-Cochin (excluding four southern taluks, which were merged with Tamil Nadu), and the taluk of Kasargod, South Kanara. In 1957, elections for the new Kerala Legislative Assembly were held, and a reformist, Communist-led government came to power, under E. M. S. Namboodiripad. It was the first time a Communist government was democratically elected to power anywhere in the world. It initiated pioneering land reforms, aiming to lowering of rural poverty in Kerala. However, these reforms were largely non-effective to mark a greater change in the society as these changes were not effected to a large extend. Lakhs of farms were owned by large establishments, companies and estate owners. They were not affected by this move and this was considered as a treachery as these companies and estates were formed by and during the British rule. Two things were the real reason for the reduction of poverty in Kerala one was the policy for wide scale education and second was the overseas migration for labour to Middle east and other countries. = Liberation struggle = It refused to nationalise the large estates but did provide reforms to protect manual labourers and farm workers, and invited capitalists to set up industry. Much more controversial was an effort to impose state control on private schools, such as those run by the Christians and the NSS, which enrolled 40% of the students. The Christians, NSS and Namputhiris and the Congress Party protested, with demonstrations numbering in the tens and hundreds of thousands of people. The government controlled the police, which made 150,000 arrests (often the same people arrested time and again), and used 248 lathi charges to beat back the demonstrators, killing twenty. The opposition called on Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to seize control of the state government. Nehru was reluctant but when his daughter Indira Gandhi, the national head of the Congress Party, joined in, he finally did so. New elections in 1959 cost the Communists most of their seats and Congress resumed control. = Coalition politics = Later in 1967-82 Kerala elected a series of leftist coalition governments; the most stable was that led by Achutha Menon from 1969 to 1977. From 1967 to 1970, Kunnikkal Narayanan led a Naxalite movement in Kerala. The theoretical difference in the communist party, i.e. CPM is the part of the uprising of Naxalbari movement in Bengal which leads to the formation of CPI(ML) in India. Due to ideological differences the CPI-ML split into several groups. Some groups choose to participate peacefully in electoralism, while some choose to aim for violent revolution. The violence alienated public opinion.K. Sreejith, \\"Naxalites and the New Democratic Revolution: The Kerala Experience 1967-70,\\" Bengal Past & Present: A Journal of Modern Indian & Asian History (1999) 118#2 pp 69-82 The political alliance have strongly stabilised in such a manner that, with rare exceptions, most of the coalition partners stick their loyalty to the alliance. As a result, to this, ever since 1979, the power has been clearly alternating between these two fronts without any change. Politics in Kerala is characterised by continually shifting alliances, party mergers and splits, factionalism within the coalitions and within political parties, and numerous splinter groups. Modern politics in Kerala is dominated by two political fronts: the Communist-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) and the Indian National Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) since the late 1970s. These two parties have alternating in power since 1982. Most of the major political parties in Kerala, except for Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), belong to one or the other of these two alliances, often shifting allegiances a number of time. As of the 2016 Kerala Legislative Assembly election, the LDF has a majority in the state assembly seats (91/140).

The restriction enzymes break the foreign plasmid into a strand of nucleotides that can be added to the bacterial DNA. III: DNA ligase integrates the foreign nucleotides into the bacterial cell DNA. IV: Recombination is complete and the foreign DNA has integrated into the original bacterial cell's DNA and will continue to be a part of it when the bacterial cell replicates next. In microbiology, genetics, cell biology, and molecular biology, competence is the ability of a cell to alter its genetics by taking up extracellular (\\"naked\\") DNA from its environment in the process called transformation. Competence may be differentiated between natural competence, a genetically specified ability of bacteria which is thought to occur under natural conditions as well as in the laboratory, and induced or artificial competence, which arises when cells in laboratory cultures are treated to make them transiently permeable to DNA. Competence allows for rapid adaptation and DNA repair of the cell. This article primarily deals with natural competence in bacteria, although information about artificial competence is also provided. History Natural competence was discovered by Frederick Griffith in 1928, when he showed that a preparation of killed cells of a pathogenic bacterium contained something that could transform related non-pathogenic cells into the pathogenic type. In 1944 Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty demonstrated that this 'transforming factor' was pure DNA . This was the first compelling evidence that DNA carries the genetic information of the cell. Since then, natural competence has been studied in a number of different bacteria, particularly Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pneumoniae (Griffith's \\"pneumococcus\\"), Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae and members of the Acinetobacter genus. Areas of active research include the mechanisms of DNA transport, the regulation of competence in different bacteria, and the evolutionary function of competence. Mechanisms of DNA uptake In the laboratory, DNA is provided by the researcher, often as a genetically engineered fragment or plasmid. During uptake, DNA is transported across the cell membrane(s), and the cell wall if one is present. Once the DNA is inside the cell it may be degraded to nucleotides, which are reused for DNA replication and other metabolic functions. Alternatively it may be recombined into the cell's genome by its DNA repair enzymes. If this recombination changes the cell's genotype the cell is said to have been transformed. Artificial competence and transformation are used as research tools in many organisms (see Transformation (genetics)). In almost all naturally competent bacteria components of extracellular filaments called type IV pili (a type of fimbria) bind extracellular double stranded DNA. The DNA is then translocated across the membrane (or membranes for gram negative bacteria) through multi-component protein complexes driven by the degradation of one strand of the DNA. Single stranded DNA in the cell is bound by a well- conserved protein, DprA, which loads the DNA onto RecA, which mediates homologous recombination through the classic DNA repair pathway. Regulation of competence In laboratory cultures, natural competence is usually tightly regulated and often triggered by nutritional shortages or adverse conditions. However the specific inducing signals and regulatory machinery are much more variable than the uptake machinery, and little is known about the regulation of competence in the natural environments of these bacteria. Transcription factors have been discovered which regulate competence; an example is sxy (also known as tfoX) which has been found to be regulated in turn by a 5' non- coding RNA element. In bacteria capable of forming spores, conditions inducing sporulation often overlap with those inducing competence. Thus cultures or colonies containing sporulating cells often also contain competent cells. Recent research by S√ºel et al. has identified an excitable core module of genes which can explain entry into and exit from competence when cellular noise is taken into account. Most competent bacteria are thought to take up all DNA molecules with roughly equal efficiencies, but bacteria in the families Neisseriaceae and Pasteurellaceae preferentially take up DNA fragments containing short DNA sequences, termed DNA uptake sequence (DUS) in Neisseriaceae and uptake signal sequence (USS) in Pasteurellaceae, that are very frequent in their own genomes. Neisserial genomes contain thousands of copies of the preferred sequence GCCGTCTGAA, and Pasteurellacean genomes contain either AAGTGCGGT or ACAAGCGGT. Evolutionary functions and consequences of competence Most proposals made for the primary evolutionary function of natural competence as a part of natural bacterial transformation fall into three categories: (1) the selective advantage of genetic diversity; (2) DNA uptake as a source of nucleotides (DNA as ‚Äúfood‚Äù); and (3) the selective advantage of a new strand of DNA to promote homologous recombinational repair of damaged DNA (DNA repair). A secondary suggestion has also been made, noting the occasional advantage of horizontal gene transfer. =Hypothesis of genetic diversity= Arguments to support genetic diversity as the primary evolutionary function of sex (including bacterial transformation) are given by Barton and Charlesworth . and by Otto and Gerstein. However, the theoretical difficulties associated with the evolution of sex suggest that sex for genetic diversity is problematic. Specifically with respect to bacterial transformation, competence requires the high cost of a global protein synthesis switch, with, for example, more than 16 genes that are switched on only during competence of Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, since bacteria tend to grow in clones, the DNA available for transformation would generally have the same genotype as that of the recipient cells. Thus, there is always a high cost in protein expression without, in general, an increase in diversity. Other differences between competence and sex have been considered in models of the evolution of genes causing competence; these models found that competence's postulated recombinational benefits were even more elusive than those of sex. =Hypothesis of DNA as food= The second hypothesis, DNA as food, relies on the fact that cells that take up DNA inevitably acquire the nucleotides the DNA consists of, and, because nucleotides are needed for DNA and RNA synthesis and are expensive to synthesize, these may make a significant contribution to the cell's energy budget. Some naturally competent bacteria also secrete nucleases into their surroundings, and all bacteria can take up the free nucleotides these nucleases generate from environmental DNA. The energetics of DNA uptake are not understood in any system, so it is difficult to compare the efficiency of nuclease secretion to that of DNA uptake and internal degradation. In principle the cost of nuclease production and the uncertainty of nucleotide recovery must be balanced against the energy needed to synthesize the uptake machinery and to pull DNA in. Other important factors are the likelihoods that nucleases and competent cells will encounter DNA molecules, the relative inefficiencies of nucleotide uptake from the environment and from the periplasm (where one strand is degraded by competent cells), and the advantage of producing ready-to-use nucleotide monophosphates from the other strand in the cytoplasm. Another complicating factor is the self-bias of the DNA uptake systems of species in the family Pasteurellaceae and the genus Neisseria, which could reflect either selection for recombination or for mechanistically efficient uptake. =Hypothesis of repair of DNA damage= In bacteria, the problem of DNA damage is most pronounced during periods of stress, particularly oxidative stress, that occur during crowding or starvation conditions. Under such conditions there is often only a single chromosome present. The finding that some bacteria induce competence under such stress conditions, supports the third hypothesis, that transformation exists to permit DNA repair. In experimental tests, bacterial cells exposed to agents damaging their DNA, and then undergoing transformation, survived better than cells exposed to DNA damage that did not undergo transformation (Hoelzer and Michod, 1991). In addition, competence to undergo transformation is often inducible by known DNA damaging agents (reviewed by Michod et al., 2008 and Bernstein et al., 2012). http://www.hummingbirds.arizona.edu/Faculty/Michod/Downloads/IGE%20review%20sex.pdf https://www.novapublishers.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=31918 Thus, a strong short-term selective advantage for natural competence and transformation would be its ability to promote homologous recombinational DNA repair under conditions of stress. Such stress conditions might be incurred during bacterial infection of a susceptible host. Consistent with this idea, Li et al. reported that, among different highly transformable S. pneumoniae isolates, nasal colonization fitness and virulence (lung infectivity) depends on an intact competence system. A counter argument was made based on the 1993 report of Redfield who found that single-stranded and double-stranded damage to chromosomal DNA did not induce or enhance competence or transformation in B. subtilis or H. influenzae, suggesting that selection for repair has played little or no role in the evolution of competence in these species However more recent evidence indicates that competence for transformation is, indeed, specifically induced by DNA damaging conditions. For instance, Claverys et al. in 2006 showed that the DNA damaging agents mitomycin C (a DNA cross-linking agent) and fluoroquinolone (a topoisomerase inhibitor that causes double- strand breaks) induce transformation in Streptococcus pneumoniae. In addition, Engelmoer and Rozen in 2011 demonstrated that in S. pneumoniae transformation protects against the bactericidal effect of mitomycin C. Induction of competence further protected against the antibiotics kanomycin and streptomycin. Although these aminoglycoside antibiotics were previously regarded as non-DNA damaging, recent studies in 2012 of Foti et al. showed that a substantial portion of their bactericidal activity results from release of the hydroxyl radical and induction of DNA damages, including double-strand breaks. Dorer et al., in 2010, showed that ciprofloxacin, which interacts with DNA gyrase and causes production of double-strand breaks, induces expression of competence genes in Helicobacter pylori, leading to increased transformation. In 2011 studies of Legionella pneumophila, Charpentier et al. tested 64 toxic molecules to determine which ones induce competence. Only six of these molecules, all DNA damaging agents, strongly induced competence. These molecules were norfloxacin, ofloxacin and nalidixic acid (inhibitors of DNA gyrase that produce double strand breaks), mitomycin C (which produces inter-strand cross-links), bicyclomycin (causes single- and double-strand breaks), and hydroxyurea (causes oxidation of DNA bases). Charpentier et al. also showed that UV irradiation induces competence in L. pneumophila and further suggested that competence for transformation evolved as a response to DNA damage. =Horizontal gene transfer= A long-term advantage may occasionally be conferred by occasional instances of horizontal gene transfer also called lateral gene transfer, (which might result from non-homologous recombination after competence is induced), that could provide for antibiotic resistance or other advantages. Regardless of the nature of selection for competence, the composite nature of bacterial genomes provides abundant evidence that the horizontal gene transfer caused by competence contributes to the genetic diversity that makes evolution possible.

He sustained a serious leg injury at Sandown in November 1979 and was off the racecourse for over a year. He returned in 1981 with the Grand National as his target and established himself as a legitimate contender with a win in the Whitbread Trial Chase at Ascot in February. At Aintree the gelding was assigned a weight of 153 pounds, and started the 10/1 second favourite behind Spartan Missile, a dual winner of the Fox Hunters' Chase. Aldaniti took the lead at the eleventh fence and maintained his advantage for the rest of the race, fighting off a late challenge from Spartan Missile on the run-in to win by four lengths. The next day, more than 3,000 people turned out to welcome the horse back to his stable at Findon. Aldaniti also ran in the 1982 Grand National with Bob Champion, but fell at the first fence. Retirement Aldaniti was retired from racing in 1982 and spent the remainder of his life at his owner's farm in Sussex. He died of old age in March 1997.

Neural computation is affiliated with the philosophical tradition known as Computational theory of mind, also referred to as computationalism, which advances the thesis that neural computation explains cognition. The first persons to propose an account of neural activity as being computational was Warren McCullock and Walter Pitts in their seminal 1943 paper, A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity. There are three general branches of computationalism, including classicism, connectionism, and computational neuroscience. All three branches agree that cognition is computation, however they disagree on what sorts of computations constitute cognition. The classicism tradition believes that computation in the brain is digital, analogous with digital computing. Both connectionism and computational neuroscience do not require that the computations which realize cognition are necessarily digital computations. However, the two branches greatly disagree upon which sorts of experimental data should be used to construct explanatory models of cognitive phenomena. Connectionists rely upon behavioral evidence to construct models to explain cognitive phenomenon, whereas computational neuroscience leverages neuroanatomical and neurophysiological information to construct mathematical models which explain cognition. When comparing the three main traditions of the computational theory of mind, as well as the different possible forms of computation in the brain, it is helpful to define what we mean by computation in a general sense. Computation is the processing of vehicles, otherwise known as variables or entities, according to a set of rules. A rule in this sense is simply an instruction for executing a manipulation on the current state of the variable, in order to produce an specified output. In other words, a rule dictates which output to produce given a certain input to the computing system. A computing system is a mechanism whose components must be functionally organized to process the vehicles in accordance with the established set of rules. The types of vehicles processed by a computing system determines which type of computations it performs. Traditionally, in cognitive science there have been two proposed types of computation related to neural activity - digital and analog, with the vast majority of theoretical work incorporating a digital understanding of cognition. Computing systems which perform digital computation are functionally organized to execute operations on strings of digits with respect to the type and location of the digit on the string. It has been argued that neural spike train signaling implements some form of digital computation, since neural spikes may be considered as discrete units or digits, like 0 or 1 - the neuron either fires an action potential or it does not. Accordingly, neural spike trains could be seen as strings of digits. Alternatively, analog computing systems perform manipulations on non-discrete, irreducibly continuous variables, that is, entities which vary continuously as a function of time. These sorts of operations are characterized by systems of differential equations. Neural computation can be studied for example by building models of neural computation. There is a scientific journal dedicated to this subject, Neural Computation. Artificial neural networks (ANN) is subfield of the research area machine learning. Work on ANNs has been somewhat inspired by knowledge of neural computation.

It was published by Kodansha in Weekly Young Magazine from the 43rd issue for 2000 to the 48th issue for 2002 and collected in eight bound volumes. Chobits was adapted as a 26-episode-long anime television series broadcast on TBS from April to September 2002. In addition, it has spawned two video games as well as various merchandise such as figurines, collectable cards, calendars, and artbooks. The series tells the story of Hideki Motosuwa, who finds an abandoned , or personal computer („Éë„Éº„ÇΩ„Éä„É´„Ç≥„É≥„Éî„É•„Éº„Çø pƒÅsonaru konpy≈´ta) with anthro-human form, which he names \\"Chi\\" after the only word it initially can speak. As the series progresses, they explore the mysteries of Chi's origin together and questions about the relationship between human beings and computers. The manga is set in the same universe as Angelic Layer, taking place a few years after the events of that story, and like Angelic Layer, it explores the relationship between humans and electronic devices shaped like human beings. Chobits branches off as a crossover into many other stories in different ways, such as Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, xxxHolic and Kobato. In North America, the manga was licensed for an English- language release by Tokyopop in 2002 and was re-released by Dark Horse Comics in 2009 and later, Kodansha Comics in 2020. The anime series was licensed by Geneon in 2002 and re-licensed by Funimation in 2010. Plot The series centers on the life of Hideki Motosuwa, a held-back student attempting to qualify for university by studying at Seki prep school in Tokyo. Besides a girlfriend, he dreams of having a : an android used as a personal computer, which is expensive. On his way home one evening, he stumbles across a persocom in the form of a beautiful girl with floor-length hair lying against a pile of trash bags, and he carries her home, not noticing that a disk fell on the ground. Upon turning her on, she instantly regards Hideki with adoration. The only word the persocom seems capable of saying is , thus he names her that. Hideki assumes that there must be something wrong with her, and so the following morning he has his neighbor Hiromu Shinbo analyze her with his mobile persocom Sumomo. After Sumomo crashes during the attempt they conclude that she must be custom-built. Shinbo introduces Hideki to Minoru Kokubunji, a twelve-year-old prodigy who specializes in the field of custom-built persocoms. Minoru's persocoms, including Yuzuki, a fairly exceptional custom- built persocom, are not able to analyze Chi either, and thus they conclude that she may be one of the Chobits, a legendary series of persocoms rumoured to have free will and emotions. Although this is a possibility, Minoru is confident that it is only rumour. Yuzuki also adds that she does not resemble any persocom model in any available database and so she must be custom made after all. A major part of the plot involves Hideki attempting to teach Chi words, concepts, and appropriate behaviours, in between his crammed schedule of school and work. At the same time, Chi seems to be developing feelings for Hideki, at an emotional depth she is not supposed to possess, and Hideki struggles with his feelings for her. The need to figure out more about Chi and her mysterious functions and past becomes a pull for the characters in the series. Hideki's feelings intensify for Chi regardless of her being a persocom and despite his friends' painful experiences involving other persocoms. Chi becomes aware of her purpose through a picture book series called A City with No People which she finds in a bookstore. The books speak about many different things involving human and persocom relationships: persocoms and their convenience as friends and lovers, how there are things that they cannot do and questioning whether a relationship between a persocom and a human is really one-sided. It also speaks about the Chobits series; that they are different from other persocoms, and what they are incapable of doing unlike other persocoms. These picture books awaken Chi's other self, her sibling Freya who is aware of their past and helps Chi realize what she must do when she decides who her \\"person just for me\\" is. Together, Chi and Hideki explore the relationship between human beings and persocoms, as well as their friends' and their own. Characters ; : A 19-year-old (in the anime, 18) repeat student attempting to get into a university by studying at a cram school, while working at an izakaya. One night, while walking home from the convenience store, he finds a persocom lying in a pile of garbage. He takes her home, and upon activating her, finds that the only word she can speak is \\"Chi\\". Because of this, he gives her the name \\"Chi\\" (in the anime, \\"Chii\\") and takes her into his care, doing his best to protect and teach her. Despite his shortcomings and occasional moments of awkwardness with the bustling environment of Tokyo, Hideki is a genuinely kind and honest person, whose habit of thinking of others' well-being before his own can cause many problems. However, he is often embarrassed. When a friend is in trouble, especially Chi, he is always there to help. Although many characters in the series often tease him for being a \\"nice guy\\", they turn to him for advice with their problems, knowing he will always hear them out and do his best to assist them. Having grown up on a farm in Hokkaido with only cows for company, Hideki is very eager to make friends, tends to be preoccupied with what other people think of him, and often thinks aloud only to become embarrassed when he notices others have heard him discussing private subjects. ; : A \\"chobit,\\" a technologically advanced persocom with a sense of machine intelligence, with the ability to feel emotions and act on her own will, unlike other persocoms. Hideki finds her in a pile of trash as he makes his way home from work one night. Upon turning her on, she is only able to say the word \\"chi,\\" remembers nothing of her past life, and is unable to perform even simple tasks. Because of this, Hideki names her Chi and undertakes teaching her how to function. Chi reads a series of children's picture books, A City with No People, about a character searching for the \\"person just for me,\\" which were written pseudonymously by Chitose Hibiya, Hideki's landlady, as a way of reconnecting Chi to her past self, and to guide Chi's search. As the series progresses, Chi begins to have visions of another persocom who is identical to herself. This \\"other Chi\\" advises and protects Chi, and as the story nears its climax tells Chi something about her history before she was restarted; that Chi had been named \\"Elda\\" by her loving parents and had an older sister. When the older sister broke her heart for her father and would die, Elda offered to take all of her older sister's memories, at the cost of her own memories. Her older sister thus became the guardian of Elda's memories and Elda's protector. See the entry for Freya in the list of Chobits characters. At the end of the series, Hideki finally admits that he loves Chi, and is her special person. Production Clamp‚Äîa creative team consisting of Satsuki Igarashi, Ageha Ohkawa, Tsubaki Nekoi and Mokona‚Äîwrote and illustrated Chobits, which is the first of their manga to be targeted towards older male readers (seinen manga). The idea for Chobits originated from the group's experiences with computers, which would present indecipherable error messages when experiencing difficulties, to which they added a \\"sexier spin\\" to the concept. After completing their previous manga series Cardcaptor Sakura, the group successfully pitched Chobits to the Japanese manga magazine Weekly Young Magazine. Clamp completed fourteen pages per week for Chobitss weekly serialization, totaling fifty-six pages a month. The title of the manga has its origins in \\"Chobi\\", the name of a cat at the place of Nekoi's former employment, which the group made into \\"Chobits\\", as the characters Elda and Freya were twins. Ohkawa designed Hideki and Chi first. Chi's design as a personal computer resulted from Ohkawa's wish to increase the sense of \\"emotional discomfort\\" around becoming emotionally involved with something considered to be merely a lifeless machine. The characterization of the protagonist Hideki proved to be difficult for her; in the beginning, she considered an \\"aloof\\" man who gradually warms up emotionally or a sex-obsessed man. She decided that neither characterization would be a good fit for Chi and settled on one of a penniless and benevolent student. In keeping with the conventions of the romantic comedy genre, the group had planned to introduce conventional characters, such as an older female neighbor and a physically attractive friend from childhood; in the case of Chobits, the \\"childhood friend\\" never appeared. The artwork was done in ballpoint pen to evoke the sense of \\"rough\\" lines, and colored pages were done in acrylic gouache. Media =Manga= Chobits began as a manga written and illustrated by Clamp, a collective of four Japanese manga artists. It appeared as a serial in Weekly Young Magazine from the 43rd issue for 2000 to the 48th issue for 2002. Kodansha compiled the eighty-eight chapters into eight bound volumes and published them from February 14, 2001, to November 29, 2002. In 2002, Tokyopop licensed Chobits for an English-language translation in North America and marketed it as part of its new unflipped manga line, which reads from right- to-left. Previously, translated manga was typically flipped from its original reading order to a left-to-right one to better suit Western readers. Tokyopop published the series from April 23, 2002, to October 7, 2003, and its translation was distributed in Australia and New Zealand by Madman Entertainment. Tokyopop's license concluded in 2009. At San Diego Comic-Con International 2009, Dark Horse Manga announced an omnibus edition of the series in celebration of Clamp's 20th anniversary. In 2010, it published the two volumes on March 24, and September 29, respectively. After Dark Horse Comics' license expired, Kodansha Comics licensed it and began releasing the series in hardcover volumes in honor of the manga's 20th anniversary in 2020. Chobits is also published in Hong Kong in Traditional Chinese by Jonesky, in Singapore in Simplified Chinese by Chuang Yi, in South Korea by Daiwon C.I., in France by Pika √âdition, in Spain by Norma Editorial, in Mexico by Grupo Editorial Vid, in Italy by Star Comics (which serialized it in Express), in Germany by Egmont Manga & Anime (which serialized it in Manga Power), in Poland by Japonica Polonica Fantastica, in Brazil by JBC, and in Sweden by Carlsen Verlag. An art-book based on the series, titled Your Eyes Only, was published by Kodansha; it was licensed in North America by Tokyopop. In addition, A City with No People, the fictional picture book written in the series by Chitose Hibiya, was released in Japan as a picture book; =Anime= An animated adaptation of Chobits was produced by Madhouse, Tokyo Broadcasting System, Pioneer LDC and Movic and directed by Morio Asaka, with Hisashi Abe designing the characters and Keitar≈ç Takanami composing the music. The series was broadcast in 26 episodes from 2 April 2002 to 24 September 2002 on TBS. It was later released on 8 DVDs. The original episodes 9 and 18 are \\"recap\\" episodes, summarizing previous events. These episodes were re-numbered for the DVD release as episodes 8.5 and 16.5, respectively, and removed from their original sequence by being published together on the final DVD. As a result, the series is 24 episodes long on DVD. In addition, there are two DVD-only OVAs: a 27th episode recapping the series (numbered episode 24.5) and a 6-minute special, \\"Chobits: Plum and Kotoko Deliver\\". The opening theme is \\"Let Me Be With You\\" by Round Table featuring Nino. The ending themes are \\"Raison d'√™tre\\" (Reason to Be) by Rie Tanaka (episodes 1‚Äì13), \\"Ningyo-hime\\" (Mermaid Princess) by Rie Tanaka (episodes 14‚Äì25), and \\"Katakoto no Koi\\" (Awkward Love) by Rie Tanaka and Tomokazu Sugita (episode 26). The ending theme for the OVA is \\"Book End Bossa\\" by Round Table featuring Nino. Chobits was licensed in North America by Geneon in July 2002, which has released the series in 7 DVDs. This release is redistributed in the United Kingdom (on 6 DVDs instead of 7, placing the recap episodes and special as extras on disk 6) by MVM Films, and in Australia and New Zealand by Madman Entertainment. At Anime Boston 2010, North American anime distributor Funimation announced that they have rescued Chobits and would release the series on DVD and Blu-ray on April 26, 2011 and May 10, 2011, respectively. The anime series made its US television debut on May 9, 2011 on the Funimation Channel. The series is also licensed in Taiwan by Proware Multimedia, in France and the Netherlands by Kaz√©, in Germany by ADV Films and later Kaze Germany, and in Russia by MC Entertainment. The series was broadcast in Korea by AniOne TV, in France by Europe 2 TV, in Spain by both Animax Espa√±a and Buzz Channel, in Portugal on Animax Portugal, and in Poland by Hyper. =Soundtracks= Two soundtracks from the anime were released by Pioneer. Chobits Original Soundtrack 001 was released 1 July 2003 and Chobits Original Soundtrack 002 was released 7 October 2003. Three singles were released, the opening theme \\"Let Me Be with You\\" by Round Table featuring Nino, and two ending themes by Rie Tanaka, \\"Raison d'√™tre\\" and \\"Ningyo Hime\\".

The game was available bundled with a clear blue Game Boy Advance with a decal of Chi above the A+B buttons and a Chobits logo above the D-pad. In 2003 Broccoli released a PlayStation 2 game titled Chobits: Chii Dake no Hito, a Bishoujo visual novel. Like the Game Boy Advance game, this too was released only in Japan. Another PC-version game was also released in 2002, using Macromedia and QuickTime as the background support. This game is called Communication Game, in which the player can \\"talk\\" with Chi and teach her to speak. It also contained some small games inside such as a keyboard typing game. Reception Reviews have been mixed. Shaenon K. Garrity of Anime News Network criticized the series' description of persocoms as \\"obedient\\" and \\"perfect,\\" writing, \\"The persocoms are perfect women, stripped clean of everything that makes real women less than perfect servants to men‚Äîthat is, one might say, everything that makes women human.\\" Finn Clark wrote, \\"The show's thematic engine lies in women who are objects. In a genre that's always at risk of objectifying women, here it's been made literal.\\" The adaptation was criticized for shifting the focus from Hideki to Chi, in particular for having episodes devoted to Chi \\"doing cute things\\" and providing fanservice. Helen McCarthy in 500 Essential Anime Movies stated that the OVA's main strength is \\"its questioning of how we use technology, and whether it can be a substitute, rather than a support, for real life\\".McCarthy, Helen. 500 Essential Anime Movies: The Ultimate Guide. ‚Äî Harper Design, 2009. ‚Äî P. 49. ‚Äî 528 p. ‚Äî References Further reading * * External links * Official Chobits English DVD anime website (Archive) * TSB official Chobits anime site * * Chobits - The Official Anime Website from Funimation Category:2001 manga Category:2002 anime television series Category:Dark Horse Comics titles Category:Funimation Category:Geneon USA Category:Kodansha manga Category:Madhouse (company) Category:NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan Category:Robot comics Category:Romantic comedy anime and manga Category:Science fiction anime and manga Category:Seinen manga Category:Tokyo Broadcasting System original programming Category:Tokyopop titles Category:Works by Clamp (manga artists) ","title":"Chobits"},{"id":"3630503","text":"Buffalocomotive is an American rock band formed in 2012, in Joliet, Illinois-a suburb of Chicago.

He was an elder brother of General Douglas MacArthur (1880‚Äì1964). Biography A son of United States Army General Arthur MacArthur, Jr. (1845‚Äì1912), he chose a career in the Navy instead of following his father, graduating from the United States Naval Academy in 1896. During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Ensign MacArthur served aboard the steam yacht in the Battle of Santiago. He later participated in naval operations during the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War and the Boxer Rebellion. On August 21, 1902, in Newport, Rhode Island, he married Mary Hendry McCalla (1877‚Äì1959), the daughter of Rear Admiral Bowman H. McCalla. His brother Douglas, a cadet at the United States Military Academy at the time, was his best man. Arthur and Mary MacArthur had five children, Arthur (1904‚Äì1912), Bowman McCalla, Douglas (named in honor of his brother), Mary Elizabeth, and Malcolm (who died while attending the Naval Academy in 1933). From 1901 to 1903, MacArthur commanded the torpedo boat . While in this capacity, he was involved in early submarine boat testing. While also commanding the , he participated in Electric Boat's testing using their prototype Fulton, as a testbed for the s. In November 1901, he was aboard the Fulton when it set an underwater endurance record of 15 hours on the bottom of Peconic Bay, New York. Later, he was injured when, on a run from New Suffolk, New York, to Washington, D.C., to exhibit the submarine to naval committees of the House and Senate, the Fulton experienced a battery explosion off the Delaware Breakwater. By June 1903, he was at Mare Island Naval Shipyard in command of the submarine flotilla consisting of the and . He was transferred to the battleship prior to her commissioning in October 1904, making him a plank owner, and served aboard her until September 1906, when he was transferred to the United States Naval Academy. At the Naval Academy, he served initially as aide to the superintendent, Admiral James H. Sands and subsequently on the staff for the commandant of midshipmen. His other commands included destroyer , minelayer , armored cruiser and light cruiser . For distinguished service in protecting convoys from U-boats engaged in the Atlantic U-boat Campaign during 1918, he was awarded the Navy Cross and the Distinguished Service Medal. He was promoted to captain on January 1, 1921. MacArthur was a hereditary member of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States by right of his father's having served as a Union officer in the Civil War. Captain MacArthur died in Washington, D.C., of appendicitis in 1923, and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery near his parents.

He rode from 1952 to 1968, winning 105 races as a professional. He won the national road championship four times - 1960, 1962, 1963 and 1964. He was also world road champion in 1962, and won the Vuelta a Espa√±a in 1958. Biography Jean Stablinski was the son of Polish immigrants in the mining area of the Nord department of France. His father died in a work accident in 1946 and Jean, at 14, started working in the mine to provide income for his family. It was at this time that he won a bicycle in an accordion competition. Legend says that his mother was so displeased by her son's new hobby that she damaged his bike. Jean, still known as Stablewski, became naturalised as French at 16 and rode his first races. It was while riding the Peace Race that a journalist's error in writing his name 'Stablinski' created the surname by which he became known. Professional career Stablinski turned professional at 21. From 1958 until 1967 he rode in the same teams as Jacques Anquetil, always as a support rider, or domestique. Stablinski won the national road championship four times and came second twice, all within six years, an achievement no rider has matched. Stablinski stayed with Anquetil until his team-mate wrote a series of newspaper articles, one of which Stablinski believed criticised him even though he had devoted his career to Anquetil. The two rarely spoke after that and Stablinski joined the team headed by Anquetil's biggest rival, Raymond Poulidor. Stablinski was recognised as a rider who made up for physical limitations by his tactical sense and his chance to profit from the moment. His knack, riders recognised, was to recognise which breakaway attempt would count and not to waste effort on the others. Stablinski was twice suspended for doping. Retirement Stablinski in 1997 Stablinski retired from racing and was for six years manager of the Sonolor-Lejeune, signing Lucien Van Impe and Bernard Hinault as young unknowns. His son, Jacques Stablinski, born 1956, also became a professional cyclist and rode for Gitane-Campagnolo. He became known as \\"Petit Stab\\" but never had his father's talent. Jean Stablinski never stopped riding a bike until the illness that led to his death. He said he never put a drinks bottle on his bike when he rode for pleasure. He had spent too many years racing as a professional with no chance to stop and look around or to meet people, he told the historian Jean-Paul Ollivier on French television. If he had no water on his bike but a few euros in his pocket, he could stop and buy a drink at any bar he fancied and get into conversation with whomever he met. He became a member of Les Amis de Paris‚ÄìRoubaix, enthusiasts and workers for the spring classic. It was Stablinski who suggested the cobbled path through the Arenberg forest. His qualifications were impeccable: as a miner he had worked beneath the road and as a cyclist he had ridden along it. He died after a long illness. On 7 April 2008 he was remembered by a memorial beside the Wallers- Arenberg road he had introduced to Paris‚ÄìRoubaix. The memorial was made in blue limestone from Soignies by the sculptor Michel Karpovitch.

Location Cristalina is located directly south of the federal capital, Bras√≠lia, and is connected to that city by BR-040. It lies on a plateau between the basins of two rivers: the Corumb√° River and the S√£o Marcos. Cristalina is 274 kilometers from Goi√¢nia and 125 kilometers from Bras√≠lia. Cristalina belongs to the micro-region called Entorno do Distrito Federal, which consists of several cities in Goi√°s state located outside the boundaries of the Federal District. Cristalina has municipal boundaries with: *North: Federal District *South: Ipameri *East: Mundo Novo *West: Luzi√¢nia and Cidade Ocidental Cristalina is located at the junction of two important highways‚Äîthe BR 040, which links Bras√≠lia to Belo Horizonte, and the BR 050, which links Bras√≠lia to S√£o Paulo. This location alone has been responsible for much of the growth of the city, which had an increase in population with the foundation and continuous growth of Bras√≠lia, which is located at a distance of 125 km. As the name indicates the town is famous for being one of the largest centers of production and commerce of precious and semi-precious stones and crystals in Brazil. The immense variety of stones (such as amethysts, sapphires, emeralds, blue topazes, and tourmaline) and of crystals (found in diverse sizes, shapes and colors) are responsible for the large number of tourists that visit the city. Because of the altitude the climate is mild, with temperatures between 10 and 28 degrees Celsius. Economy Today Cristalina is known for its large production of grains, especially seeds. It produces soybeans (140,000 hectares), corn (21,000 hectares), beans (34,000 hectares), sorghum (5,000 hectares), and rice (3,000 hectares). The cattle herd is large with 125,000 head in 2006.

An abundance of rock crystal and in 1879 two Frenchmen, Etienne Lopes and Leon Laboissi√®re, residents of Paracatu, bought some of the crystal and exported it to Paris. They then settled in a place called Serra Velha where they set up their operations. Later, after the failure of the first miners, another Frenchman, Em√≠lio Levy, arrived trading cloth for crystal and built his house, stimulating others to arrive. In 1901 the district of Serra dos Cristais was created belonging to the municipality of Santa Luzia, now Luzi√¢nia. In 1916 it was emancipated as S√£o Sebasti√£o dos Cristais, later changed to Cristalina.

History  During the Edo period, the Tokugawa shogunate discouraged inventions in order to preserve the stability of the feudal society. In fact, Tokugawa Yoshimune, the eighth sh≈çgun of the Tokugawa dynasty, decreed in 1721 the \\"Ban on Novelty\\" (Êñ∞Ë¶èÂæ°Ê≥ïÂ∫¶ shinki gohatto), which was intended to prohibit everything novel, especially clothing of rich design. In 1868, the Tokugawa shogunate ended and a new reformist government took its place (the Meiji Restoration). The government studied the Great Powers and adopted a national policy of emulating them in various government areas. Industrial property rights were recognized as a means for catching up to Western governments. The first patent law in Japan was thus established in 1871, though it was abandoned in the next year. Today, the founding date of Japanese patent law and of the Japan's patent office is considered to be April 18, 1885, when the \\"Patent Monopoly Act\\" (Â∞àË≥£ÁâπË®±Ê¢ù‰æã senbai tokkyo j≈çrei) was enacted.

Her sister was the activist Maud Nathan and her nephew the author and poet Robert Nathan. Early years and education She was born in New York City in 1867, the daughter of Annie August and Robert Weeks Nathan. The Nathans are one of America's colonial-era Sephardic families. Meyer's childhood encountered many hardships as the Crash of 1873 damaged her parents‚Äô financial status. In 1875, the family moved from New York to Green Bay, Wisconsin for employment opportunities. Since she was withheld from public school by her mother's request, Meyer was self-educated and claimed to have read all of Dickens' work by the age of seven. Meyer tutored herself in order to enroll in the newly established Columbia College Collegiate Course for Women in 1885. The course did not recognize participants as fully enrolled students, because, at the time, Columbia University did not officially enroll women. She did not attend because she married Alfred Meyer, a prominent physician and a second cousin on February 15, 1887. Career Annie Nathan Meyer Within weeks of her wedding, Meyer began organizing a committee to fund a women's college at Columbia in an effort to provide young women the opportunity for an education that she herself had not enjoyed. In January 1888, Meyer wrote a 2,500 word essay to The Nation arguing New York City lacked culture in comparison to other major cities because it lacked a liberal arts college for women. Meyer understood that the idea was nothing without funding. So, working with Ella Weed, she created a committee of fifty prominent New Yorkers willing to support the projected college. She overcame the opposition of the Columbia University trustees by naming the college after Frederick Barnard, Columbia's recently deceased president and a strong advocate for coeducation. The college Meyer founded, Barnard College, is one of the Seven Sisters and ranks today as one of America's most elite colleges. She later became known as an opponent of woman suffrage (in direct conflict to her sister and suffragist Maud Nathan). At one time, Annie Nathan Meyer was associate editor of the Broadway Magazine. She edited Woman's Work in America (1891) and contributed a series of articles to the New York Evening Post. Selected works * Barnard Beginnings (1935) * Helen Brent, M. D.

The club is owned and coached by South African football legend Jomo Sono. History The club was founded on 29 January 1983, upon the remnants of the previously well-known and successful club Highlands Park, which Sono opted to buy when he ended his playing career in the United States. The club was named Dion Cosmos in its initial 1983 season, with the first part of the name representing the previous sponsor of Highlands Park and the second part being the fingerprint of Jomo Sono, who decided to name his newly bought club after his former NASL club, the New York Cosmos. Since 1984, the name of the club has been Jomo Cosmos. Sono's policy for development has always been to recognise and build upon raw talent. Sono's team accentuated and developed a strong youth policy and through the years has gained a reputation for discovering and developing some of the finest talent to have played in the league, for the South Africa national team and abroad. Under Sono's ownership, the club went on to achieve several successes: winning the South African Premier Division title in 1987, the Bob Save Super Bowl in 1990, the Coca-Cola Cup in 2002 and 2005, and the SAA Supa 8 in 2003. In 2008, Jomo Cosmos were relegated from top-flight football for the first time since 1993. After one season in the National First Division, they returned to the PSL for the 2009‚Äì10 season, having won the Inland Stream and the promotion play-off against Carara Kicks. They were immediately relegated again, leading several to question Sono's future as the club's manager. Sono stayed, and led the club to the 2010‚Äì11 National First Division title and promotion. They were yet again relegated in their first season back, finishing in last place. They would stay in the second tier for three seasons, before winning promotion through the 2014-15 PSL play-off tournament. Cosmos were relegated again in their first season back, after losing 3-1 to Maritzburg United on the final day, ending the season in last place.

Following the airliner's arrival at Kuwait International Airport, outside of Kuwait City, the flight was never resumed as a consequence of ongoing events on the ground. Prior to landing at Kuwait International, the neighbouring nation of Iraq had launched a full-scale invasion of Kuwait during the early hours of that morning. Within hours, elements of the Iraqi Army had rapidly advanced as far as Kuwait City and had taken control of the airport. Accordingly, the aircraft used to operate the flight, its passengers and its crew were all captured by the occupying Iraqi forces on the ground. Following their capture, the majority of the passengers and crew were initially detained at several nearby hotels along with other foreigners under armed guard. The airliner was later destroyed on the ground; the identity of who were responsible for its destruction remains unknown. During their detention, multiple passengers have alleged to have witnessed a number of atrocities performed by Iraqi forces and were subjected to abuse themselves. While women and children were offered the opportunity to return home during late August, the remaining detainees were dispersed to various sites in Iraq and Kuwait and were used by the Iraqis as human shields to deter offensive operations by opposing Coalition forces during the Gulf War. During one infamous incident, an Iraqi television broadcast showed Iraqi President Saddam Hussein alongside a number of the detainees as a part of wartime propaganda efforts. To secure their release, former British prime minister Edward Heath personally travelled to Baghdad to lead negotiations, which included direct talks between Heath and Saddam Hussein. One passenger from the manifest (a Kuwaiti citizen who had concluded his flight and disembarked the aircraft prior to BA 149's capture) was listed as having been killed by Iraqi troops while all remaining passengers were later released from their captivity following the conclusion of the conflict. BA 149 continues to be the subject of controversy and debate over whether the situation could have been averted, as well as accusations and conspiracy theories that the flight was used as a trojan horse to transport undercover British military and intelligence personnel into Kuwait. Several investigations have since been conducted into the incident, leading to official denials from Margaret Thatcher, Britain's Prime Minister at the time, of any government efforts to influence British Airways' actions in regard to Flight 149. Aircraft and crew Flight 149 was operated by a Boeing 747-136 with the manufacturer serial number 19764 and registration G-AWND. The aircraft bore the name City of Leeds and had initially been delivered to British Airways' predecessor BOAC before entering service with British Airways in 1974. At the time of the incident, G-AWND was one of the oldest aircraft in BA's fleet and was due to be replaced by a newer generation 747. The captain and pilot-in-command of the Heathrow-Kuwait leg was Richard Brunyate while the cabin crew were overseen by chief purser Clive Earthy. Peter Clark had been due to take over as captain for the Kuwait-Madras leg. Background At 18:05 GMT on 1 August 1990, British Airways Flight 149 (BA 149) departed from London Heathrow Airport with 367 passengers on board, its final destination was Kuala Lumpur with scheduled layovers in Kuwait City and Madras. The flight had been delayed at Heathrow for several hours; according to the captain of the first leg of the flight, Richard Brunyate, the cause was a fault in the aircraft's auxiliary power unit; some passengers claim to have heard crewmembers arguing if they should proceed or not.Jempson, Mike and Andrew Marshall. \\"Was BA 149 a Trojan horse?: The British government faces questions over whether a passenger flight into occupied Kuwait was planned or was an intelligence failure\\". The Independent, 9 August 1992.Marshall, Andrew. \\"The strange flight of BA 149: Why did no one prevent a British Airways flight into Kuwait after the invasion began? Andrew Marshall on a riddle that won't go away.\\" The Independent, 1 August 1992. The flight had a scheduled stopover at Kuwait City; however, this was not cancelled or changed despite media reports of the worsening political situation in the region. Kuwait's larger neighbour, Iraq, had issued demands for territory to be surrendered to its control and had been staging a military buildup on the border between the two nations for weeks. During the delay at Heathrow, the flight crew requested up to date reports on the situation in Kuwait and were told nothing untoward was happening despite news of growing tension. Shortly after the flight departed, the crew radioed ahead for another report, speaking to both Kuwaiti air traffic control (ATC) and British Airways Flight 148, a Lockheed Tristar which had departed from Kuwait earlier. Both claimed that the situation at Kuwait International Airport appeared normal. Captain Brunyate later testified that he elected to resume the stopover in Kuwait after again talking to Kuwaiti ATC during the final approach and being told that it was fine to land at the airport. He also stated that he asked permission to perform an additional circuit pattern to observe the airport from above and did not notice anything suspicious. However, on 1 August 1990, the same day as BA 149's flight, Iraq launched a military invasion of Kuwait. At 01:13 GMT on 2 August 1990, BA 149 landed at Kuwait International Airport and the passengers were disembarked for what should have been an hour wait. The airport was deserted and there was little-to-no staff on the ground; at the point of its landing, all other scheduled flights by other airlines had been cancelled or diverted for several hours already at this point. Thirty passengers were booked on the flight to finish their journey in Kuwait and disembarked the plane with the inbound crew who proceeded to set off for their hotel. According to some passenger accounts, those who were disembarking in Kuwait proceeded to immigration but found that their luggage was not being unloaded. There were reports that, prior to BA 149's landing, British military personnel had taken control of Kuwait Airport's control tower. Between 01.45 and 02:05 GMT, the crew for the onward flight and remaining passengers boarded the Boeing 747 in anticipation of the next leg to Madras which was to be captained by Peter Clark. During the preparations to takeoff, the flight crew were informed that the airport would be closed for two hours. At 02:20 GMT, Iraqi fighter-bombers reportedly bombed the airport's runway, preventing its use, and knocked out the airport's control tower. The cabin crew ordered an evacuation of the aircraft and the passengers were initially moved into the terminal building. At 03:00 GMT, Kuwaiti radio made a national announcement that Iraqi troops had crossed the border. Remains of the aircraft At 04:30 GMT, both the crew and passengers who had been on board Flight 149 were escorted from the terminal by the Iraqi army and transported by bus to the airport's onsite hotel. On 3 August 1990, it was reported that all of the 367 passengers and 18 crewmembers from BA 149 were safe and well.\\"British Airways Passengers, Crew Safe.\\" New Strates Times, 3 August 1991. p. 1. The empty aircraft, which had remained at Kuwait International Airport throughout the war, was destroyed on the ground by an aircraft attack during the latter stages of the conflict; the destruction may have been an intentional act of the US military to prevent its capture. Alternatively, the aircraft may have been destroyed by Iraqi ground forces during their withdrawal from Kuwait.Jempson, Mike and Andrew Marshall. \\"Fighters over Kuwait as BA 149 flew in.\\" The Independent, 30 August 1992. As a consequence of its destruction, British Airways was able to collect on the airliner's insurance. Two of the aircraft's landing gears were salvaged and are displayed at Waterside, British Airways' headquarters. Immediate reaction In the days that followed, British Airways expressed its outrage at Flight 149's situation. BA's chairman, Lord King, publicly blamed the Foreign Office and the British security services for their failure to promptly designate Kuwait as a war zone, which would have caused the flight to be diverted. BA's area manager for Kuwait and Iraq Laurie O'Toole later claimed to have contacted the British Embassy in Kuwait prior to BA 149's departure to ask if it was safe to continue flights within the region and was told that a full-scale invasion of Kuwait was unlikely. Very quickly, there was considerable public controversy over whether the British government would have been able to intervene to avoid Flight 149's detention, as well as when had it become aware of the invasion of Kuwait. During September 1990, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher stated that Flight 149 had landed in Kuwait hours prior to the invasion.\\"The Gulf.\\" House of Commons, 6 September 1990. However, passengers on board BA 149 reportedly heard gunfire and tank activity during their layover in Kuwait City and the inbound crew also claimed to have heard loud bangs whilst being ferried from the airport to their hotel; Margaret Thatcher's memoirs have also attributed an earlier point in time for the invasion. British Airways and the Foreign Office have both claimed that Flight 149 had landed in Kuwait two hours following the start of the invasion. Detention of passengers After leaving the aircraft, all the passengers and crew were captured on the ground by Iraqi forces who had overrun Kuwait City. The majority of the detained passengers were initially transferred to the airport hotel within the boundaries of the airport until the crew of BA 149 negotiated for everyone to be moved to the Regency Hotel where British Airways crew and staff flying into Kuwait were routinely based. The crew of BA 149 and some of the passengers unsuccessfully tried asking the British Embassy to be evacuated from the country. Later on as international opposition to the Iraqi occupation grew, the passengers were ordered from the Regency Hotel, separated into groups and confined to various hotels in Kuwait, also designated by the Iraqis for other foreigners to report to. The Iraqis claimed the passengers to be \\"honoured guests\\", and were moved in the following week under armed escort by a mix of policemen and soldiers from Iraq, to locations in Kuwait and Iraq. The British transferees were accommodated primarily on the upper floors of the Melia Mansour Hotel in Baghdad; hostages from other nationalities were housed in different hotels. During the early stages of the crisis, Brunyate stayed with the passengers and crew to reassure them but later escaped with help from members of the Kuwaiti resistance. Brunyate later explained that his father, who had worked in Iraq, had personally run afoul of Saddam Hussein and he feared reprisals if his surname was recognised by the Iraqi authorities. According to statements made by some of the ex-hostages, multiple passengers have claimed to have witnessed various atrocities during their detention, such as attacks made upon Kuwaiti citizens by Iraqi forces; some of the hostages themselves were subjected to forms of mental and physical abuse, which included instances of mock executions or rape, and were kept in unsanitary conditions with little food.\\"UK hostages describe Kuwait ordeal\\". BBC News, 16 October 2006.\\"Iraq's hostages subject to abuse, freed French say.\\" Lost Angeles Times, 31 October 1990. During a location transfer of the hostages by bus, a British Airways stewardess was raped by an Iraqi soldier. The soldier was reportedly executed near the hostages after cabin services director Clive Earthy complained about the incident to the lead officer of the Iraqi troops detaining them. Other female passengers claimed to have been sexually assaulted by Iraqi soldiers. One passenger Jennifer Chappell stated that she witnessed Iraqi tanks driving over cars with Kuwaiti civilians trapped inside while her brother John saw the execution of a Kuwaiti soldier at the hands of Iraqi troops. Another hostage, David Fort was injured after an Iraqi guard pushed him down a flight of stairs. A small number of passengers and crew managed to escape and were sheltered with help from Kuwaiti resistance fighters. After ten days, the detainees were dispersed to various military-industrial sites. Women and children were given the opportunity to return home in late August, whereas those who remained were used as human shields, and transferred between sites. Sites would contain between eight and 20 detainees of mixed nationalities, typically British and American citizens, as well as French, German, Japanese and others. Different groups of detainees were released at various stages, often dependent upon their nationality, but also including criteria such as ill health and the body of one individual who had died during captivity. While some passengers were detained only for a few weeks, others were detained for months, often in poor conditions. Former British prime minister Edward Heath travelled in person to Baghdad for direct talks with Iraq's President Saddam Hussein, and is credited with leading negotiations to successfully release the hostages taken.\\"1990: Iraq frees British hostages.\\" BBC - On This Day, 10 December 1990. During mid December 1990, the last of the remaining American and British hostages were released by Iraq.\\"Putting Noncombatants at Risk: Saddam's Use of \\"Human Shields\\" \\". Central Intelligence Agency, January 2003. Retrieved 29 October 2011. One passenger from BA 149, a Kuwaiti national (later described in various reports as a member of the Kuwaiti Royal Family or a security director) was listed as being murdered by Iraqi soldiers, although it is debated as to whether he is counted as a passenger fatality as he had already left the aircraft and finished his flight before his death. None of the other hostages were intentionally killed by Iraqi troops. Investigation Several court actions were raised by passengers against British Airways in respect of Flight 149, often accusing the airline of negligence by continuing to land in Kuwait hours after the invasion, as well as for loss of property.Watson-Smyth, Kate.\\"Jet passengers held hostage by Iraq sue BA.\\" The Independent, 8 August 1999. On 15 July 1999, a group of French passengers were awarded damages from British Airways valued at ¬£2.5 million; separately, the airline also chose to settle over compensation claims filed on behalf of US passengers.\\"Ba Flight 149.\\" House of Commons, 27 April 2007. During October 2006, several of the former hostages called for an independent public inquiry into allegations that Flight 149 had not been diverted by the British government due to the flight playing a role in a state intelligence operation.\\"Ex-hostages demand UK inquiry.\\" BBC News, 16 October 2006. Some passengers accused British Airways of using Flight 149 as an attempt to evacuate their staff from Kuwait. However, BA personnel in Kuwait were not instructed to board Flight 149 and the inbound crew left for their hotel once the flight had landed. The crew of BA 149 later criticised the British Embassy in Kuwait for what they saw as inaction in helping them to evade capture or to leave Kuwait while there was still a window of opportunity. A 2007 documentary, commissioned and shown by the BBC and shown elsewhere by Discovery Channel, claimed that the US and UK governments were aware almost as soon as Iraqi Armed Forces crossed the border and by 0300 Kuwaiti time were fully informed that an invasion had taken place and fighting had ensued. This awareness would have been at least an hour before BA149 touched down, during which several other flights had diverted to Bahrain or other alternative destinations to avoid a potential situation. During October 1992, Prime Minister John Major, who had taken over from predecessor Margaret Thatcher, denied any attempt to influence British Airways in regard to the decision to operate BA 149; however, this has been contradicted by sworn statements that British Airways had in fact been briefed by the British government and informed by them that it had been 'safe to fly'. It has been alleged that the British government had allowed Flight 149 to proceed for intelligence-gathering purposes by transporting British operatives to Kuwait. On 2 October 1992, in response to a question on the issue, Major said \\"I can confirm, however, that there were no British military personnel on board the flight\\". However, the 2007 documentary included an interview with an anonymous former SAS soldier, who claimed that he and his team had been on Flight 149 for the purposes of intelligence gathering in Kuwait. In 2007, British Member of Parliament Norman Baker claimed to be in possession of affidavits signed by \\"members of special forces,\\" which, according to Baker, said \\"that they were on that plane and were put there to carry out a mission at the request of the British Government\\". Baker claimed that external accounts had given corroboration to such statements, including from the then-United States Ambassador to Kuwait Nate Howell, former member of MI6 Richard Tomlinson, and individuals claiming to be Central Intelligence Agency operatives at the time. Some media sources commented on the fact that British Airways allegedly withdrew the computer database list containing the passenger manifest for Flight 149 the day after the aircraft was captured; however, British Airways have maintained that this is a standard procedure in the event of an emergency in order to protect the identities of people on board and so that next of kin can be notified. Aftermath British Airways continues to use flight number 149 but switched it to the Heathrow-Beirut sector, with the route currently operated by an Airbus A321. The Heathrow-Kuwait sector is now operated as BA157 using a Boeing 777-200. Flights to Kuala Lumpur from Heathrow now use flight number 33 and are flown non-stop using a Boeing 787.

The content of the IPDR is determined by the service provider, network/service element vendor, or any other community of users with authority for specifying the particulars of IP-based services in a given context. The IPDR specifications were originally produced by the Internet Protocol Detail Record Organization, Inc. (aka IPDR.org). In 2007 the IPDR.org organization was acquired by the TM Forum, an industry association of more than 900 global members in over 160 countries from across the converging industries of telecom, cable, media and the Internet. The IPDR specifications include requirements for IPDR collection, encoding and transport protocols to exchange IPDR records, the IPDR service specification design guidance, and several sample IPDR Service Definition documents. The IPDR specs are maintained and continue to evolve at the TM Forum Interface Program. The President/COO of IPDR was Kelly Anderson and the technical team lead of IPDR from 2004 until it was folded into the TM Forum was Amit Kleinmann of Amdocs.  Formation and History  During the summer of 1999, while the communications industry was grappling with massive growth in the use of Internet Protocol-based networks for voice and data communications, a group of industry veterans formed the IPDR Organization to begin to establish standards for use in operational and business support systems used by the communications carriers. Originally formed as an informal confederation of about 60 industry experts from 20 companies, including Narus, Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard, AT&T; and others who were active in the industry, the organization quickly matured into a formal structure, tackling a range of technical issues associated with the deployment of systems to support the growth of IP-based communications services. By 2002, the group was involving industry specific software development companies to perform interoperability testing and encompassed working forums around five distinct tracks of industry challenges, had hired a staff, and appointed Aron Heintz as President to guide the quickly growing body of technical work being conducted within the largely volunteer organization. IPDR had also established a formal board of directors structure, enlisting a range of industry experts from industry players in the United States and Canada to oversee the development of the standards and protocols being developed by the group, including Martin Demers (replaced in 2003 by Stefan Mihai) of Ace*comm, Kelly Anderson of Intrado, Mark Farmer of Amdocs, Tal Givoly of Xacct Technologies, Matthew Lucas of Telestrategies, Jeff Meyer of Hewlett-Packard, Kevin McCoy of Cisco Systems, Mike Norris of Telus, Steve O'Neal of Sprint PCS and Pankaj Patel of Convergys.

It is on the south coast, about 18 kilometres by road south of Batemans Bay. The area is administered by the Eurobodalla Shire. At the , Rosedale had a population of 221.  History  :The material in this section is derived from a brief history of Rosedale, written by Ian Harrison and published in the Rosedale Association newsletters of January 2004 and March 2004 There was clearing of bush at South and North Rosedale for grazing. There were very few buildings in Rosedale prior to the second world war. In the 1950s the council approved a subdivision plan by Miller, a builder, in which many blocks were below 600 m¬≤. However, notwithstanding this subdivision, Rosedale is one of very few seaside settlements in Australia where the bush is more prominent than the buildings. = Farming in the nineteenth century = The Rosedale valley includes portions 11, 12, 32, 81, 98, 118, 213, 214, 215 and 221 in the Parish of Bateman, County of St Vincent. Land intended for settlement was usually marked in lots due to the then official view that this was an area suitable for sustaining a living. Portions 11 and 12 were taken up by Thomas Hollands in 1878, while John Hollands was granted portion 32, also straddling the creek but further west, in the same year. However, there is no evidence that either man settled in the area. Rosedale Farm was first settled by James Sebbens, while the western end of the valley was settled by Karl Thomsen. Both men cleared the bush to establish their farms. The father of James, also called James Sebbens was born in Essex in 1814. He was transported as a convict on the ‚ÄòJohn Barry‚Äô in 1838 and was assigned to serve his time at Broulee. He received his certificate of freedom in 1848. In 1851 he married Celia Ann Barlings. Celia had arrived at Broulee from England with her parents in 1832 at the age of four years. The Sebbens family lived in the Tomakin area on a property called Oaks Ranch, southwest of Candlagan Creek. They had 14 children. James Sebbens died in 1876 and is buried at Moruya. His widow married Henry Rose (1820‚Äì1906), who is buried at Mogo. Cecilia‚Äôs father, Richard Henry Barling, who was a free overseer, formalised his conditional purchase of portion 5 in 1852. Portion 5 is now the site of the Barlings Beach caravan park. Joseph Sebbens, the eldest son of James and Cecilia, operated a steam mill at Malua Bay in the latter part of the 1800s with the help of his brother, William. This mill had been originally set up at Tomakin by a Robert Jennings in 1874 but was salvaged and moved by Joseph after Jennings abandoned it in the 1880s. James Sebbens (junior), born 1858, cleared and developed Rosedale and parts of Burri/Guerilla Bay. His wife's brother (maybe father?), Karl Thomsen, cleared all of portions 32, 213 and 221. A surveyor's report of 1884 noted that there was of cleared land, of land with ring barked trees, and a house. Sebbens cleared all the land in portions 81, 214, 215 and most of 98, although it is not clear whether he cleared right to the cliff edge at what is now called North Rosedale. While significant regrowth has occurred, particularly during the last decades, the distinction in tree height and density can be seen. From 1870 to 1908 the Sebbens family developed a farm of . They owned and occupied but had no title to of the land they farmed. They were mainly dairy farmers producing cheddar cheese. A set of old bails remains from this period near the creek downhill from the present farmhouse. The farmhouse burnt down in the late nineteenth century. The present day farmhouse was constructed from two existing houses. In 1908 the Sebbens family sold to Herman Nibbe and moved to western Sydney where they farmed poultry. At the time of the sale the property was consolidated into one title under freehold with all the conditional purchase areas being converted. = Twentieth-century developments = Nibbe had tried to farm sheep as well as maintaining production of cheddar. In financial difficulty he sold the property in 1913 but continued to farm under lease until 1921. Horace Benjamin O‚ÄôNeil purchased the farm in 1921. The farm was starting to become less productive as the soils were not good and became depleted once the trees were cleared. The first car in the district was an International Motor Buggy purchased in 1908 by Adolf Thomsen, a grazier at Tomakin. (The car is still owned by a Batemans Bay family.) The development of better transport through the availability of motor cars opened up the area.  Rosedale Association and the Keep Australia Beautiful NSW awards  Rosedale has an active association that was established in the early 1970s. Recent achievements include willing regional and state honours in the 2003 NSW Clean Beach Challenge, organised by Keep Australia Beautiful NSW. Rosedale was also awarded a highly commended certificate in the Natural Heritage Award (regional). An award was also received in 2004.

The waters split into two zones commencing at a north-east position on the rock ledge at the southern headland, with the boundary line extending eastwards along latitude 35‚Å∞ 49.030\\", via the north-east tip of Jimmies Island to a longitude 150‚Å∞ 14.341\\" position at sea. The Habitat Protection Zone extends northwards from the boundary line along Rosedale's beaches and coves, McKenzies Beach, Pretty Point and on past Batemans Bay to Wasp Island at Durras South. Minor restrictions apply to Recreational fishing and major restrictions on Commercial fishing in the Habitat Protection Zone. The Burrewarra Point Sanctuary Zone which includes Jimmies Island, commences south of the boundary line and extends around to Nuns Beach, Tranquil Bay, Guerilla Bay, around Burrewarra Point to Long Nose Point. All Recreational and Commercial fishing is prohibited in the Sanctuary Zone (there was an Amnesty for Recreational line fishing from mainland ocean beaches and headlands, with an exclusion area around Burrewarra Point that operated from March 2013 to December 2014). The Burrewarra Point Sanctuary Zone is a breeding ground for grey nurse sharks (critically endangered).  Nature walks  The Rosedale - Guerilla Bay Circuit is a popular walking track starting at the southern end of Tranquil Bay Place, Rosedale and ending up at Guerilla Bay. Highlights of the walk include possible sea eagle and cockatoo sightings, crossing Nuns Beach, and views of Jimmies Island and Guerilla Bay.

Sour mash is a process used in the distilling industry that uses material from an older batch of mash to start the fermentation of a new batch, analogous to the making of sourdough bread with a starter. The term can also be used as the name of the type of mash used in that process, and a Bourbon made using this process can be referred to as a sour mash Bourbon. ‚ÄúSour mash‚Äù does not refer to the flavor of the Bourbon. Sour beer may also be created with this process.  Process  In the sour mash process, the mash - a mixture of grain, malt and water - is conditioned with some amount of spent mash (previously fermented mash that still contains dead yeast, a good food source for live yeast). Spent mash is also known as spent beer, distillers' spent grain, and slop or feed mash because it is also used as animal feed. The acid introduced by the sour mash controls the growth of bacteria that could taint the Bourbon. An established and active strain of live yeast is introduced into the mash to be fermented. By using an established and known fermented \\"sour\\", this fermentation process controls the introduction and growth of foreign bacteria and yeasts that could damage the Bourbon and improves the consistency and quality of the liquor, ensuring every bottle tastes as similar as possible. Sour mashing is also a process sometimes used in brewing to make sour beers in a short time frame. In the brewing version of sour mashing, brewers mash in their grains to begin the brewing process, but instead of extracting the wort from the grains at the end of the mash (typically in less than 90 minutes), the brewer leaves the grains and wort together for as long as several days before draining the wort. During this time, the lactic acid bacteria naturally present on the grain ferment some of the sugars in the wort into lactic acid. This lactic acid adds sourness to the beer. In order to promote fast bacterial fermentation and reduce yeast activity, the mash is kept between . The brewer extracts the wort by sparging when they believe enough acid has been produced. Some beers employing sour mashing are fermented with the addition of brewing yeast but without a boil. Other brewers prefer to boil their sour mashed beer and then ferment it with brewing yeast. The resulting beers can range from mildly tart to noticeably sour.

It was built as a competitor to the GG1 design, but after trials the GG1 was selected for volume production on the basis of its superior tracking and riding qualities; the R1 prototype, however, remained in service. It was numbered 4800 originally, swapped numbers with the victorious GG1 prototype to #4899, but was moved in May 1940 to #4999 to make room for the expanding GG1 fleet. For many years, the R1's regular duties involved hauling the westbound Broadway Limited and returning eastward with a mail and express train. The long rigid wheelbase of the locomotive caused occasional derailments in Sunnyside Yard and elsewhere. The R1 was withdrawn from service and sent for scrap in 1958. The R1 design had four driven axles in a rigid locomotive frame, like a steam locomotive. Each was driven by two traction motors driving the wheels through a quill drive and sprung cups. Each end of the double-ended locomotive has a four-wheel truck to guide the locomotive at speed, giving the R1 a 4-8-4 wheel arrangement in the Whyte notation (AAR: 2-D-2; UIC: 2'Do'2). Besides the R1, the PRR did not build or order any other 4-8-4 locomotives, however the T1 duplex was essentially a 4-8-4 with 2 sets of driving wheels, making it a 4-4-4-4. In many respects the design resembled the earlier, lighter P5, but with an extra driving axle and lower axle loads.

The film deals with complex issues such as gay and lesbian related topics, the lower-middle class of Mexico City, and the lives of many people. The story is told from three perspectives: Don Ru (Ernesto G√≥mez Cruz), the owner of a cantina where most of the men in the story gather to drink and play dominoes, Alma (Salma Hayek), the beautiful girl of the neighborhood who dreams of passion, and Susanita (Margarita Sanz who won an Ariel Award for this role), the owner of the apartment complex where Alma and many of the other characters live. The film was critically acclaimed by international critics. It earned 11 Ariel Awards, including Best Picture at the 37th Ariel Awards and more than 49 international awards and nominations. Pan's Labyrinth and El Callej√≥n de los Milagros were named as the best Mexican films by IMDB.com and Entertainment Weekly. The film was selected as the Mexican entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 68th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences  Plot  The lives of the inhabitants of El Callej√≥n de los Milagros, in downtown Mexico City, are as closely knitted as the threads of a rug. Fifty-something Don Ru owns a small \\"cantina\\" where all the men spend afternoons playing domino. He's tired of his longtime marriage with Eusebia and has recently discovered new feelings inside his heart. It does not matter if these feelings are not aimed to a young lady but to a young clerk after all, as one of the characters says, \\"it's platonic love\\". Don Ru's son Chava does not like what he sees and almost kills his father's lover. Running away from Don Ru's anger, Chava escapes to the US with his friend Abel who is deeply in love with beautiful Alma, the daughter of Do√±a Cata, a tarot reader with bad luck in love. Susanita, the ugly landlady looking for love; Guicho, Don Ru's cynical employee, Maru, Don Fidel, Do√±a Flor, Zacarias and mean Jose Luis complete the cast of characters of this complex portrait of lives. = Structure = The film is divided into four successive and clearly labeled chapters. The first three are named after key individuals, and the fourth wraps up the story. Each chapter starts at the same time, with the same game of dominoes, and describes the same time period, but from the viewpoints of the named people; the chapters tell each person's story. Each chapter thus provides the viewer with details which help to explain things which happened in the other chapters. #Rutilio deals with Don Ru's dissatisfaction with his marriage and his poorly hidden homosexual love affair with a young man. #Alma deals with Alma's life and her falling in love with Abel. He leaves with Chava for the U.S. and Alma \\"disappears\\". She has been seduced and ends up in a whorehouse. #Susanita is the landlady with horrible teeth whose feelings and romantic hopes are awakened.

Despite being a childhood friend of Wu's founding emperor, Sun Quan, he was never given an important position or assignment before L√º Meng's invasion of southern Jing Province in 219, wherein he assisted in capturing the enemy commander, Guan Yu. Following the Battle of Xiaoting, Wu's rival state, Cao Wei, launched a three-pronged strike on Wu's northwestern, middle, and eastern borders. Zhu Ran was sent to the northwestern border, where he defended the city of Jiangling with only 5,000 troops against an enemy force about ten times greater. He rose to fame and became feared throughout Wei. He then participated in a series of military operations against Wei, during which he defeated several enemy units, but the overall objectives were never met. Before his death, Zhu Ran was granted authority to oversee matters within the army. Early life Originally from Guzhang County, Danyang Commandery (present-day Anji County, Huzhou), Zhu Ran was a maternal nephew of Zhu Zhi, who favoured his then 13-year-old nephew and asked his lord Sun Ce to grant him permission to adopt the child. Since Zhu Zhi had contributed considerably to Sun Ce's conquests in Jiangdong and had not bore a son, Sun Ce specifically ordered the Administrator of Danyang Commandery to bring presents to Zhu Ran's family for the ceremony and celebration. Thus, Zhu Ran became an adopted son of Zhu Zhi and had his family name changed from \\"Shi\\" to \\"Zhu\\". In addition, he studied together with Sun Ce's younger brother, Sun Quan, as a young boy, and the two became very intimate. Because of this, after Sun Ce died and was succeeded by Sun Quan, Zhu Ran was appointed as the Prefect of Yuyao County at the age of 19. Zhu Ran was later appointed as the Chief of Shanyin County, acting on authority of a Commandant, to oversee five local counties around the area. Pleased with his abilities, Sun Quan further promoted him to be the Administrator of Linchuan Commandery, and gave him command over 2,000 soldiers. Capture of Guan Yu During his tenure as an commandery administrator, Zhu Ran had the merit of subjugating the Shanyue ethnic group within his jurisdiction, and was able to do so in less than a month. However, when the warlord Cao Cao led his massive army to invade southern China, Zhu Ran stayed in the back just as most other officials at the time did; and was not assigned significant tasks for some time until the Battle of Ruxukou, where he proved his loyalty in personally going to the frontline to help resist Cao Cao's 400,000 strong army. Although Zhu Ran did not engage the enemy in this battle, he was promoted by Sun Quan to the rank of Major- General, as a way to reaffirm his trust in Zhu Ran. In 219, Zhu Ran participated in L√º Meng's Jing Province campaign as L√º Meng's aide. When the enemy commander, Guan Yu, was abandoned by his troops and trapped in Maicheng, Zhu Ran was ordered by L√º Meng to lay the first line of blockades to Guan Yu's escape. However, for reason unknown, Zhu Ran let Guan Yu slip by, and Pan Zhang, who was responsible for the second layer, succeeded in capturing Guan Yu alive. Regardless, Sun Quan credited both Pan Zhang and Zhu Ran for Guan Yu's capture. When L√º Meng laid on his death bed shortly after the Jing Province campaign, Sun Quan asked his input on who could succeed him as the new commander for the army, wherein L√º Meng highly praised the abilities of Zhu Ran and recommended the latter be the replacement. Heeding L√º Meng's dying words, Sun Quan gave the staff of authority to Zhu Ran, and tasked him with the defence of Jiangling County, the capital of Nan Commandery and a vital strategic stronghold on the frontline. Two years later, Liu Bei, the emperor of Shu Han, led a grand army of more than 100,000 troops to invade Wu, and Zhu Ran led his 5,000 troops to join the Wu commander, Lu Xun, for the tactical defence of Yiling and Xiaoting. When the next summer came, Zhu Ran led a separate force against Shu. After breaking Liu Bei's vanguard, Zhu Ran's forces took up a position at the rear of the Shu army, blocking their escape as they attempted to flee from a fire attack executed by Lu Xun. Together, Lu Xun and Zhu Ran pursued Liu Bei into the deep hills, pushing him back to Baidicheng, where he would admit defeat and die shortly afterwards. Defence of Jiangling Painted lacquerware table from the tomb of Zhu Ran (182-249) in Anhui province, Eastern Wu period, showing figures wearing silk Hanfu attire Throughout the whole course of the Wu-Shu conflict, the Wei military had assembled troops but never mobilised. However, immediately following the success of Lu Xun's battles against Shu, the Wei emperor Cao Pi suddenly launched a three-pronged campaign against Wu after Sun Quan refused to send his eldest son, Sun Deng, as a hostage. Even though Cao Pi's plan was detected by Lu Xun, who ordered Xu Sheng to perform a double-back to return to Wuchang (present-day Ezhou, Hubei) and informed Sun Quan to prepare for war, the Wu forces still faced a dire situation. Their troops were stretched thinly across at least four fronts; on the western front facing Baidicheng, where Liu Bei's declaration of war was still in effect; Nan Commandery (around present-day Jingzhou, Hubei), which was pressed by the Wei generals Zhang He, Xu Huang, Cao Zhen, and Xiahou Shang; at Ruxu (on the eastern side of Lake Chaohu in present-day Anhui), where the Wei general Cao Ren was leading his team to land on Zhongzhou; and at the eastern battlefield on the Yangtze, Dongkou (along the Yangtze near present-day Liyang, Jiangsu), where Zhang Liao and Zang Ba under the command of Cao Xiu defeated L√º Fan's navy. At the time, there was an extreme shortage of military personnel. Furthermore, an outbreak of disease greatly reduced the morale and number of soldiers in Zhu Ran's army, leaving him with only 5,000 men capable to do battles, who were intimidated by the news that the Wu reinforcements led by Sun Sheng (Â≠´Áõõ) were eliminated by Zhang He. At Jiangling County, Xiahou Shang had also built numerous pontoon bridges for his soldiers to cross the shallow waters and attack the castle. With each passing day, the number of Wei troops besieging the castle increased by the thousands. Not knowing how and where the Wei forces were crossing the shallows of the river, the Wu reinforcements under Pan Zhang and Zhuge Jin had no effective way to lift the siege. Surrounded in his castle, Zhu Ran was heavily outnumbered by Cao Zhen, who encircled the fortress with several layers and deployed a variety of siege weapons. Yet Zhu Ran showed no signs of fear, and encouraged his comrades and subordinates to counter the enemy. When Cao Zhen relaxed his guard, Zhu Ran's forces were able to destroy two of the Wei encampments. Six months had passed; however, the Wei army still continued the siege, and Cao Pi had arrived at Wan city to bolster their morale. One of Zhu Ran's officers, seeing that the Wei troops were numerous and that the food supply within Jiangling was running out, planned to defect to Wei. He secretly contacted the Wei troops outside of the castle walls and promised to open the gate to permit their forces entry. When the betrayer was about to open the castle gate, he was noticed by Zhu Ran and executed. At the time, Pan Zhang had gone upstream and collected one million bundles of reeds. He fitted these to rafts and set them on fire, sending them downstream so that they would burn the pontoon bridges being used by Wei. Knowing what Pan Zhang had done, the Wei forces returned north before the retreat route could be destroyed. Because of his extraordinary performance in this battle, Zhu Ran's name became known throughout Wei as a powerful enemy general. Later life In 241, Zhu Ran participated in a campaign against Wei and led an assault on Fancheng and surrounded it. However, the Wei army led by Sima Yi defeated him, and he retreated. In 246, he again invaded Wei and attacked Zuzhong (Êü§‰∏≠), and when his escape route was cut off by Li Xing (ÊùéËàà) of Wei, he defeated Li Xing's forces and withdrew. In 245, Lu Xun died and Zhu Ran was given command over the armies of Wu by Sun Quan. He died four years later in 249, and received the third largest funeral after L√º Meng and Ling Tong. At his funeral service, Sun Quan was said to have wept greatly for him. His son, Shi Ji, succeeded him and continued to serve Eastern Wu. Zhu Ran's tomb The tomb chamber In June 1984, during the construction of a factory, Zhu Ran's burial site was discovered in Ma'anshan, Anhui. Many historically important decorative items of clothing and some of the world's oldest discovered lacquer were unearthed after being discovered within. The tomb had been underground for nearly 1,700 years. Though the tomb was raided, it was still home to over 140 valuable items. Most of the remaining buried items included mainly lacquered items made of wood, such as wooden plates, wooden clogs, and some wooden tables with educational stories and images drawn on them. The road on which the site was discovered was renamed to \\"Zhuran Road\\" in his honour. In Romance of the Three Kingdoms Zhu Ran appears as a minor character in the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which romanticises the historical events before and during the Three Kingdoms period. In the novel, he is killed by Zhao Yun at the Battle of Xiaoting. (See Battle of Xiaoting#Zhao Yun killing Zhu Ran for details.) In popular culture Zhu Ran became a playable character in Koei's Dynasty Warriors 8: Xtreme Legends. See also * Lists of people of the Three Kingdoms Notes References * Chen, Shou (3rd century).

This is both a sequel and, in some ways, a prequel to Kingdom Come, also by Mark Waid. Both books form an Elseworlds saga, meaning they are abstracted from official DC Comics continuity. The storyline extended into one-shot books entitled New Year's Evil: Gog, The Kingdom: Kid Flash, The Kingdom: Nightstar, The Kingdom: Offspring, The Kingdom: Planet Krypton and The Kingdom: Son of the Bat. The entire storyline was later collected into a trade paperback. The Kingdom does not use the same visual style created by Alex Ross, which was used in the four-issue Kingdom Come series. The storyline in The Kingdom is a direct continuation and extension of the original storyline fleshing out areas of the future that were not explored in the original four-part miniseries. While Kingdom Come can easily exist as a stand-alone story, The Kingdom is not a complete storyline in and of itself and exists only as a continuation of the previous storyline. Plot summary 20 years after the events of Kingdom Come, a survivor of the Kansas disaster is granted power by four members of the Quintessence (Shazam, Ganthet, Zeus, and Izaya Highfather), who dub him Gog. The power drives him mad, and he takes out his anger on Superman, killing him and carving his \\"S\\" shield on the ground. He then travels a day backward in time and kills him again...and again. A shadowed figure vaguely resembling the Phantom Stranger, the fifth Quintessence member, opposes this action, as Gog now intends to accelerate the Kansas Holocaust, but the other four are prepared to let things unfold; Shazam hopes that Captain Marvel will no longer have to die, Ganthet hopes that Green Lantern will avert the catastrophe and become more renowned than Superman, Zeus hopes that the ancient gods may be 'worshiped' once more as Earth seeks something to believe in, and Highfather feels that a new war may fracture Earth in a manner similar to New Genesis and Apokolips. As Gog travels closer to the modern DC Universe, the Linear Men panic when they see that their ordered index of time is unraveling; Superman is dead in the 21st century, yet alive in the 853rd, and their instruments register no error. When Rip Hunter, acting upon the orders of the shadowed figure, tries to stop Gog from killing Superman on the day his and Wonder Woman's child is born (that being a day when 'anything seemed possible'), Gog manages to steal the infant (named Jonathan), whom he plans to raise and name Magog (in issue #2, this was revealed to be a red herring. The child did not grow up to become Magog; instead, he became the shadowed figure, whose true identity is then revealed to be Hyperman, a Hypertime-traveling superhero wearing a costume based on the costumes of his parents and his godfather, Batman). Although the other Linear Men object to the idea of the heroes of that time travelling back to defeat Gog, Rip Hunter recruits Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman from the Kingdom Come era to stop Gog in 1998, the heroes concluding that, since innocent people will die if they do or do not take action, they will take the heroic option and go back despite the apparent loss of their own reality by having them interfere in their own pasts in such a manner. Four young heroes-Kid Flash, Offspring, Nightstar, and Ibn al Xu'ffasch-come together to try stopping Gog on their own, and are recruited by Rip Hunter to assist in his plan. When Jonathan is seemingly erased from existence soon after being rescued, Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman team up with their 'past selves' and battle Gog to a final confrontation in a \\"Planet Krypton\\" restaurant outside of reality, where they use various weapons gathered from across Hypertime against Gog. During the fight, the future Wonder Woman reveals to the Superman of the present why Gog is after him, and Superman vows that the timeline of Kingdom Come will never happen in his universe, as he strikes back at Gog, finishing the battle once and for all. As the heroes return to their proper places in time, Hyperman reveals himself, assuring the future heroes that his infant self actually hid himself within the stream of Hypertime upon being rescued from Gog, and Rip Hunter explains the existence of timelines, so the Kingdom Come reality still exists, but it will no longer be the future of the DC Universe. Reaction The Kingdom received some criticism at its time of publication: Originally intended to be simply a prequel bridging the gap between the mainstream DC Universe and that portrayed in Kingdom Come, Ross left the project and Mark Waid revised his intentions into what finally saw print. In a Wizard magazine special, Ross also criticized such things as having the birth of Superman and Wonder Woman's child be a major world affair (Ross thought they would keep such a thing secret to give their child a normal life) and the number of characters Ross had intended to have been killed in the first series that are alive here (such as Zatara, Hawkman, and Kid Flash). The Kingdom was also criticized by some for its poor artwork, but was praised by others for the concept of Hypertime. Hypertime was an in-story metaphor for reader response and canonicity, variously described as a river and tributaries of continuity, a geometric construct, and in various other deliberately mutable ways.

The Perkow reaction In the related Michaelis‚ÄìArbuzov reaction the same reactants are known to form a beta-keto phosphonate which is an important reagent in the Horner‚ÄìWadsworth‚ÄìEmmons reaction on the road to alkenes. The Perkow reaction, in this respect is considered a side-reaction.  Reaction mechanism  The reaction mechanism of the Perkow reaction consists of a nucleophilic addition of the phosphite at the carbonyl carbon forming a zwitterionic intermediate. The zwitterionic intermediate rearranges to a cationic species while eliminating the halide. The cationic species then dealkylates through a second nucleophilic displacement in which the halide anion attacks one of the phosphite alkoxide substituents forming an enol phosphate.Organophosphorus chemistry. XVII. Kinetics and mechanism of the Perkow reaction'' Irving J. Borowitz , Steven Firstenberg , Grace B. Borowitz , David Schuessler J. Am. Chem. Soc.; 1972; 94 pp 1623‚Äì28; Perkow reaction mechanism  Scope  The Perkow reaction has been applied in the synthesis of a insect repellent based on hexachloroacetone and triethylphosphite which is able to engage in a secondary [4+3] cycloaddition with furan through the action of the base sodium 2,2,2-trifluoroethoxide. The authors report mediocre yields. Perkow reaction hexachloroacetone triethylphosphine adduct The Perkow reaction is also used in the synthesis of novel quinolines. When the substituent is n-butyl the reaction product is the classical Perkow adduct. In this reaction the leaving group is an electron deficient acyl group (owing to the presence of three fluorine groups). When the substituent on the other hand is phenyl (not shown) the phosphite has a preference for reaction with the acyl group leading to an ethyl enol ether. Key in explaining the difference in reactivity is the electron density on the Œ±-keto carbon atom. Perkow quinoline application Aryl enol phosphates formed in good yields (ca. 90%) in the Perkow reaction can be used as phosphorylating reagents, e.g. able to transform AMP into ATP.

He has worked with a wide range of artists and bands, including Nik Kershaw, Pink Floyd, 10cc, Il Divo, Westlife, Girls Aloud, Atomic Kitten, Paul Carrack, Dusty Springfield, Bonnie Tyler, Mike Rutherford, Mike + The Mechanics, Tom Jones, Jean Michel Jarre, Helene Fischer and Schiller. Early career As a young drummer/percussionist, Gary Wallis worked with a number of prominent British bands. From 1982 to 1984, he was the drummer for The Truth, working alongside Chris Skornia (Hammond organ/keyboards); Dennis Greaves (guitar); Mick Lister (guitar) and Brian Bethell (bass). After leaving The Truth, Wallis went on to perform as a percussionist with Style Council (1984‚Äì1985). He was invited by David Bowie to perform as a percussionist at the Live Aid concert at JFK Stadium, Philadelphia, 13 July 1985, with Robert Palmer and Power Station, as well as Duran Duran. In the mid to late eighties, Wallis was drummer for The Krew, the backing band for Nik Kershaw (Riddle and Radio Musicola tours) and Chris Farlowe (1988). It was at a Kershaw concert where his energetic playing and elaborate percussion set-up drew the attention of key Pink Floyd musicians to Gary Wallis. Pink Floyd (1987‚Äì1994) Wallis is perhaps best known as the percussionist for Pink Floyd in the post-Waters era for both their live and recorded performances. Pink Floyd's drummer Nick Mason described the first time that he and David Gilmour saw Wallis play: \\"Wallis was spotted playing percussion with Nick Kershaw at a charity show where Gilmour was also appearing. Neither of us had ever seen anything like it. Instead of sitting down to play Gary was working in a kind of cage stuffed full of percussion, some pieces of which were mounted so high that a three-foot leap was needed to strike the required object. With his obvious musical skills this additional showmanship seemed an ideal bonus for a stage that looked initially as though it might be occupied by the living dead.\\" Wallis was invited to join Pink Floyd, playing on their A Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour (which was released as Delicate Sound of Thunder in 1988). Blake (2008, p. 328) describes Wallis's playing as a \\"highly visual performing style ‚Äì attacking an array of gongs, drums and cymbals mounted around him in a cage ‚Äì was the perfect contrast to Mason's considerably more restrained approach.\\" He continued to perform with Pink Floyd until they took a break after their final tour concert at the Knebworth Festival in August 1990. Wallis has stated that performing live at Knebworth with Pink Floyd (1990) was one of the most memorable moments of his career. From 1990 to 1992, Gary Wallis performed alongside various members of Pink Floyd in different bands, including Blue Pearl (1990), Dream Academy with Gilmour and Guy Pratt (1991) and Jimmy Nail with Gilmour (1992). In December 1991, Wallis performed at the Amnesty International 30th Anniversary Concert, as part of a band directed by Gilmour. At the performance, the band backed Tom Jones and Spinal Tap, the \\"fictional\\" heavy metal band. Spinal Tap is known for its succession of drummers who \\"they claim died under odd circumstances\\", and Wallis was shown \\"exploding\\" at the end of the performance. The following year, he performed alongside Gilmour and other Pink Floyd band members at the Chelsea Arts Ball. In 1993-94 Wallis played percussion during sessions for Pink Floyd's then-upcoming album, The Division Bell (1994). He went on to perform with them on The Division Bell world tour, during the European leg of which, Pink Floyd recorded the Pulse live album and video, with Wallis playing percussion. In the same year, Wallis and Gilmour attended a concert in Croydon by the tribute band The Australian Pink Floyd, afterwards inviting the band to attend The Division Bell end of tour party. The Australian Pink Floyd was also invited to play at Gilmour's 50th birthday party in 1996. After their performance, members of Pink Floyd, including Wallis, were handed the Australian musicians' instruments and performed \\"Money\\", \\"What Do You Want from Me\\", and other songs. The drum sets used by Wallis and Mason on The Division Bell tour and Pulse DVD were from the Drum Workshop (DW). Mason states, \\"Gary Wallis and I ended up with thirty-odd drums, twenty pads, forty- odd cymbals and innumerable other bits of junk bolted to the drum risers, an installation that should have qualified us for the Turner Prize.\\" Wallis' playing with Pink Floyd can also be seen and heard in the upcoming box set, The Later Years 1987‚Äì2019. 10cc (1993‚Äì1995) After disbanding in the eighties, the original four members of the British rock group 10cc re-formed in 1992 to record new and previously recorded tracks. They subsequently undertook a tour of Japan in 1993, with Gary Wallis as their drummer. Their tour recording Alive in Japan featured Eric Stewart (vocals, guitar, keyboard), Graham Gouldman (vocals, bass, guitar), Rick Fenn (vocals, guitar, bass), Stuart Tosh (vocals, percussion), Stephen Piggott (keyboards) and Gary Wallis (drums). In 1995, 10cc released their album Mirror Mirror with Gary Wallis playing drums and percussion. Jean Michel Jarre (1999‚Äì2000) Gary Wallis performed in front of a crowd of 50,000 with French musician Jean Michel Jarre at a 12-hour The Twelve Dreams of the Sun concert at the Giza pyramids on New Year's Eve 1999/2000. The spectacular concert was part of Egypt's millennium festivities, which included a giant party at the pyramids. Wallis played drums and percussion alongside Jean Michel Jarre (musical direction, keyboards, laser harp, vocals), Francis Rimbert (keyboards), Joachim Garraud (keyboards), Christopher Papendieck (bass), as well as a thousand singers, dancers and musicians. Tom Jones (1991‚Äìpresent) Wallis has collaborated on various tours and concert events over two decades with legendary Welsh singer Sir Tom Jones, as his drummer and musical director, including residencies in Las Vegas. From 2009 ‚Äì 2011, Wallis toured extensively with Tom Jones, performing in the UK, Europe, USA, South America, Australia, New Zealand, South-East Asia, South Africa, the Middle East, and the Russian Federation. Other band members on the 2011 tour were: Davide Bronze (bass guitar); Jamie Moses (guitar); Toby Chapman (keyboard); Lutz Rainer Krajenski (keyboard); Laura Critchley (backing vocals); Sophie Hiller (backing vocals); Francis Samuel Walden (saxophone) and Trevor Mires (trombone). On earlier tours Wallis worked with musicians Christoph Papendieck (keyboards), Peter Honor√© (guitarist), Alex Meadows (bass), Janet Ramus (backing vocals) and Abbie Osmon (backing vocals). Wallis has appeared as the drummer for Tom Jones in significant televised performances, including the opening of the 2012 BAFTA (British Academy of Film and Television Arts) award ceremony and the Diamond Jubilee Concert at Buckingham Palace. He has also played many shows with Sir Tom in 2013, 2014, 2015 and is currently on a world tour with Sir Tom in 2016. Mike and the Mechanics (1995‚Äìpresent) From 1995 to 1999, Gary Wallis was the drummer for Mike + The Mechanics, working with Paul Young (vocals), Mike Rutherford (guitar, bass), Paul Carrack (vocals, keyboard), Tim Renwick (guitar) and Jamie Moses (guitar). In 1997, Wallis performed with Paul Carrack's band as part of the Beautiful World album promotion. Wallis played on 1999 Mechanics tour, which became the last for several years, due to Paul Young's untimely death. In 2003, a comeback of the band was announced by Rutherford, and Wallis performed in their concert at Shepherd's Bush Empire in London, which was filmed and released as a live DVD by Eagle Rock Entertainment. Wallis has been the drummer for the re-formed Mike + The Mechanics, from 2011 'till present day. He has played both in recordings and live acts, including last years' sold-out tours. He played on their returning album, The Road, released in April 2011, and their last-to- date album, Let Me Fly (2017). In 2011 he performed across the UK, Germany, and other European cities on their Hit the Road Tour, \\"The Hits Tour\\", and \\"Let Me Fly Tour\\". It's been announced a brand new album along 2019, while the band is touring again across Europe. Electronic drums and programming Gary Wallis has also worked extensively as a drum programmer. In an interview for Roland UK, Wallis declared his \\"complete thirst for electronic drums\\". He is known for performing on an elaborate, massive drum set-up featuring both acoustic and electronic drums. Wallis used this configuration of instruments during his work with the German band Schiller, among others. Schiller (2001‚Äì2004; 2018‚Äì)  Between 2001 and 2004 he toured Germany with the electronic ambient band Schiller, led by Christopher von Deylen. During this time, he worked alongside many prominent artists, including the celebrated musical theatre singer Sarah Brightman and renowned German pop singer Peter Heppner. Wallis played live on Schiller's first live concert, \\"Voyage,\\" on 9/19/2001 at Gum Club in Hamburg, Germany. Wallis also played on the Europe wide hit I Feel You. Wallis played percussion on Schiller's Live (Er)Leben album (2004) and drums/percussion on the Tag Und Nacht (Day and Night) album (tracks 2, 10, 15 and 18), released in 2005 by Island Records and Universal Music, Germany. The album was also released in Russia (2005 & 2008) and the USA (2007). Gary Wallis contributes drums to Schiller upcoming album \\"Morgenstund\\" and is expected to follow Christopher von Deylen on the next live tour in 2019. Producer Together with long-term colleague, Toby Chapman, Wallis has co-produced tracks for artists such as Paul Carrack (1996), Belinda Carlisle (1997), Rod Stewart (2000), Cher (2001), Swedish band Addis Black Widow (2001), and Zididada, a Danish act signed to Universal Denmark (2003). Musical director In the latter part of his career, Gary Wallis has been in demand as a musical director and drummer. From 2004 to the present, Wallis has toured extensively around the world in this role with various bands and solo artists, including Girls Aloud, Atomic Kitten, Il Divo, Westlife (Back Home Tour) and Sir Tom Jones. Philosophy on drumming In the Roland UK interview with Ben Stone, Wallis explains his own approach to drumming: \\"There's nothing you would call real 'drummer's drummer', cause, you know, that's not my thing. I like to play in a band and be part of the team. I like to watch all those other really good guys play the fancy stuff!\\" Stone then asked Wallis about the importance of this aspect of playing in the current musical climate, with so many drum clinics taking place. Wallis stated, \\"It's a very precarious subject really...Not for me. It doesn't work for me, 'cause I've never enjoyed that aspect of drumming at all. But, I really marvel in it and I wonder in it and I watch it myself and think, \\"wow!\\". I don't know how much it applies to any music that you record, or bands that you play with. I mean, it's great to have all those chops and it allows you to interpret whatever's in your mind, which is great, but, it's never really been for me. I mean, I like band drummers\\"...\\"I like to see bands as a cohesive unit and no-one sticking out too much.\\" Other Gary Wallis is the cousin of Pink Fairies guitarist and former member of Mot√∂rhead, Larry Wallis.

The term is also used as slang for a type of short riding boot, also called a paddock boot or a jodhpur boot, because they are worn with jodhpurs. Originally, jodhpurs were snug-fitting from just below the knee to the ankle, and were flared at the hip to allow ease for sitting in the saddle. Modern jodhpurs are made with stretch fabric and are tight fitting throughout. They are supportive and flexible.Price, Steven D. (ed.) The Whole Horse Catalog: Revised and Updated New York:Fireside 1998 p. 215 History Marwari horse in Rajasthan. Note the traditional long riding trousers, tight around the calf, reaching to Mojari slippers. Jodhpurs were adapted from traditional clothing of the Indian subcontinentHorse Riding Jodhpurs , Online for Equine as long trousers, reaching to the ankle, snug from the calf to the ankle, with reinforced fabric protecting the inner calf and knee from rubbing. The thighs and hips were flared, a traditional South Asian style that allowed free movement of the hip and thigh while riding. The jodhpurs were adapted from an ancient style of Indian trouser called the Churidar, which is tight around the calf and loose at the hips. It is still worn at traditional Jodhpuri weddings. This is a special traditional style of clothing in Northern India, especially in what is today the modern state of Rajasthan. Sir Pratap Singh, a younger son of the Maharaja of Jodhpur, popularised in England the style of riding trousers worn in Jodhpur, a design that he apparently improved and perfected and first had tailored in India around 1890.Photographs exist of Sir Pratap Singh mounted on a horse, apparently in England, wearing his tight-calfed riding trousers with traditional Indian riding footwear rather than tall boots, dated 1917 & 1918\\\\. Images, Hulton Archives: 7 March 1917, Sir Pratap Singh on Horseback, Editorial Image #3096959; & gettyimages.co.uk image # 104416011, 1 Jan 1918 Singh was an avid polo player. When he visited Queen Victoria in England during her Diamond Jubilee celebrations of 1897, he brought his entire polo team, who caused a sensation among the fashionable circles of the United Kingdom by their riding clothes. In addition, they won many polo matches. Singh's jodhpur style of flared thigh and hip was rapidly taken up by the British polo-playing community, who adapted it to the existing designs of English riding breeches, which ended snugly at mid-calf, and were worn with tall riding boots. The full-legged design of the true Jodhpur was not adopted as British polo apparel. Early photographs of European polo teams show the continued use of tall boots and breeches. Though the term \\"jodhpurs\\" was applied colloquially to this style of breeches, they were not true jodhpurs and are more accurately termed \\"flared-hip breeches\\". This British version was soon being produced by Savile Row tailors in London. The use of the Indian- style, ankle-length Jodhpurs allowed riders to use short, less expensive boots, as their calves were protected by the reinforced design and snug fit. Use =Riding= Classic riding jodhpurs, showing the extra width in the thigh area, which allows for lateral leg movement when in the saddle. Special adaptations for riding include a pattern cut with the leg seams on the outside of the leg; a patch on the inside of the knee, sometimes of a hard-wearing material such as leather; and in some cases similar leather or leather-like panel on the seat that helps the rider stay still in the saddle. Classic jodhpurs are beige or white, but for working purposes are now made in a variety of colours. They are particularly well-suited for children, as the shorter paddock boots cost less than tall boots to replace as a child's feet grow. Jodhpur boots, also called paddock boots, are worn with jodhpurs, but also may be worn with breeches if half-chaps are added which provide the functionality and look of a tall riding boot The word \\"jodhpurs\\" is often used interchangeably with riding breeches, though this is technically incorrect. Breeches are riding pants that come down to about mid-calf, and are designed to be worn with long stockings and tall boots. Jodhpurs are ankle length and are worn with short, ankle-high Jodhpur boots, also known as Paddock Boots. Sometimes knee-length half-chaps or leggings may be added. =Occupational uniform= Jodhpurs are sometimes worn as fashion or occupational clothing, not only for riding. In popular culture, jodhpur-style breeches worn with tall boots became particularly associated with military officers, who wore uniforms based on riding apparel, often derived from the aristocratic cavalry tradition from which many nations historically drew their corps of top commanders, viz. the quartering of the Commander-in-Chief of the Forces and Secretary at War in the Horse Guards building and the derivation of the rank and title marshal from what was originally a title for the commander of cavalry. Flared-hip breeches and tall boots formed part of the military uniform of army officers in Imperial Germany, the Second Polish Republic, Nazi Germany, and many Eastern Bloc countries, including the former USSR and East Germany,. Jodphurs, or flared-hip breeches, also were adopted as the uniform for some forces of motorcycle police. The style came to be associated with authority figures in general and was copied by certain Hollywood movie directors in the United States. Cecil B DeMille, 1937, wearing the flared-hip riding breeches that are often termed jodphurs. Early 20th-century African big game hunters are also associated with the look, due in part to early traditions of riding on horseback in search of quarry. In addition, tall boots protected against snakes and rough or thornbushes if the hunters were walking in rough country. =Fashion= Ladies began wearing jodhpurs during the 1920s, as they shifted away from riding horses sidesaddle and rode them astride. One of the first high-profile women to adopt the wearing of jodhpurs was Coco Chanel. She was inspired to copy the breeches as worn by a friend's groom. As part of the 20th-century trend of crossover fashions moving from sportswear to streetwear, various designers since the later 20th century have incorporated equestrian styles into their clothing, including jodhpurs. Ralph Lauren is the most well- known of such designers, and adapted equestrian styles and motifs as the basis of his Ralph Lauren Polo line. (Polo/Ralph Lauren presented \\"Man and the Horse\\", an exhibit of riding clothing and accoutrements from three centuries at the Metropolitan Museum of New York Costume Institute in 1984, curated by Diana Vreeland.) Kentucky jodhpurs A rider wearing Kentucky jodhpurs. Kentucky Jodhpurs are full-length riding pants designed exclusively for Saddle seat riding. Like Hunt Seat jodhpurs, they are close-fitting from waist to ankle. They are noticeably longer, ending with a flared bell bottom that fits over a jodhpur boot, usually extending below the heel of the boot in back, and covering the arch of the foot (but not the toe) in front. The overall look gives the impression of a rider with a long leg and heel lower than the toe, a desired equitation standard for this riding style. Like the hunt seat jodhpur, they have elastic straps that run under the boot to help hold the pant leg in place. Saddle seat riders, whose riding clothing styles were derived from men's business suits, wear Kentucky Jodhpurs in dark colors, usually black, navy blue, or a shade that matches the riding coat.Crabtree, Helen K.

The London Charterhouse, London, Kegan Paul, Trench & Co., 1889, p. 97 The Crown was at first anxious to secure the public acquiescence of the monks of the London Charterhouse in the matter of the break with Rome, since for the austerity and sincerity of their mode of life they enjoyed great prestige. When there was unexpected resistance, the only alternative was terror. On 4 May 1535 the authorities sent to their death at Tyburn Tree three leading English Carthusians, Doms John Houghton, prior of the London house, Robert Lawrence and Augustine Webster, respectively priors of Beauvale and Axholme. Two days later William Exmew and the vicar, Humphrey Middlemore, were denounced to Thomas Cromwell by Thomas Bedyll, one of the royal commissioners, as being \\"obstinately determined to suffer all extremities rather than to alter their opinion\\" with regard to the primacy of the pope. Three weeks later they and another monk of the community, Sebastian Newdigate, were arrested and thrown into the Marshalsea, where they were made to stand in chains, bound to posts, and were left in that position for thirteen days. After that, they were removed to the Tower of London. Named in the same indictment as Bishop John Fisher, they were brought to trial at Westminster on 11 June where they pleaded not guilty to a charge of high treason. They were steadfast, however, in asserting their adherence to Catholic teaching on the subject of spiritual supremacy and denied that King Henry VIII had any right to the title of head of the Church of England.Gurdon, Edmund. \\"Bl.

Monastery of El Paular (Spain). Humphrey Middlemore, (died 19 June 1535) was an English Catholic priest and Carthusian hermit, who was executed for treason during the Tudor period. He is considered a martyr by the Catholic Church, and, along with other members of his religious order to meet that fate, was beatified by Pope Leo XIII on 9 December 1886. Life Though the date of his birth is uncertain, his father was Thomas Middlemore of Edgbaston, Warwickshire, who had acquired his estate at Edgbaston by marriage with the heiress of Sir Henry Edgbaston. Humphrey's mother was Ann Lyttleton, of Pillaton Hall, Staffordshire. Attracted to the Carthusian Order, he entered the London Charterhouse, where he was professed and ordained. He was subsequently appointed to the office of procurator. He was esteemed by the prior, Dom John Houghton.Wintersgill, H.G. \\"Bl. Humphrey Middlemore.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 27 May 2013 In 1534 the question of King Henry VIII's marriage with Anne Boleyn arose. The king was determined that the more prominent of his subjects should expressly acknowledge the validity of the marriage, and the right of succession of any issue therefrom. The Crown was at first anxious to secure the public acquiescence of the monks of the London Charterhouse in this matter, since they enjoyed great prestige for the austerity and sincerity of their mode of life. Accordingly, the royal commissions paid a visit to the Charterhouse, and required the monks to take the oath to that effect. Doms John Houghton and Humphrey Middlemore refused, and were, in consequence, imprisoned in the Tower of London; but, after a month's imprisonment, they were persuaded to take the oath conditionally, and were released. In the following year, on 4 May 1535, the authorities sent to their death at Tyburn Tree for refusal to take the new Oath of Supremacy, three leading English Carthusians, first among them John Houghton, prior of the London house, but also Robert Lawrence and Augustine Webster, respectively priors of Beauvale and Axholme. This led to Middlemore becoming vicar of the community. Meanwhile, Thomas Bedyll, one of the royal commissioners, had again visited the Charterhouse, and endeavored, both by conversation and writing, to shake the faith of Middlemore and his community in the papal supremacy.Gurdon, Edmund. \\"Bl. William Exmew.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 2 Feb. 2014 His efforts left them unmoved, and, after debating with them, he obtained authority from Thomas Cromwell to arrest three leading monks of the London house: Middlemore, as the vicar, and with him Doms William Exmew and Sebastian Newdigate. All three were thrown them into prison, where they were treated with cruelty, being bound to posts with chains round their necks and legs, and compelled to remain thus day and night for two weeks. They were then brought before the Council, and required to take the oath. They refused, and gave arguments from Scripture and the Church Fathers in favor of the papal supremacy. They were accordingly condemned to death, and executed at Tyburn Tree on 19 June, being hanged, drawn and quartered. This was a little more than a month after their fellow monks. This process of attrition was to claim fifteen of the London Carthusians.

Australia implemented this decision, the only country to do so, by approving the establishment of the Central Flying School (CFS) in 1912. The location for the proposed school was initially to be at Duntroon, Australian Capital Territory, but in July 1913 Point Cook, Victoria, was announced as the preferred location. The first flights by CFS aircraft took place there in March 1914. The Australian Flying Corps (AFC) was formed as a Militia unit, with staff and students to be selected from the Citizen Forces. After an abortive deployment to German New Guinea at the end of 1914 as part of the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force, it earned a most creditable reputation in both Palestine and France during World War I as a part of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF). The Australian Flying Corps remained part of the Australian Army until 1919, when it was disbanded along with the AIF. Although the Central Flying School continued to operate at Point Cook, military flying virtually ceased until 1920, when the Australian Air Corps was formed. The Australian Air Force was formed on 31 March 1921. King George V approved the prefix \\"Royal\\" in June 1921 and it became effective on 31 August 1921. The RAAF then became the second Royal air arm to be formed in the British Commonwealth, following the British Royal Air Force. The service was rapidly expanded during World War II and at its height, it was the fourth largest air force in the world, consisting of 53 squadrons based in the Pacific and a further 17 in Europe. Formation, 1912 In 1911, the Imperial Conference that was held in London determined that the armed forces of the British Empire needed to develop an aviation branch. At the time, aircraft were a newly emerging technology, but nevertheless Australia implemented the decision, the only country to do so. The first step taken by the government was to approve the establishment of the Central Flying School (CFS) in 1912. Initially, it had been proposed to establish the school at Duntroon, in the Australian Capital Territory, where the Royal Military College had been established in 1911, but in July 1913 it was determined that Point Cook, Victoria, was the preferred location. The Australian Flying Corps (AFC) was subsequently formed as a Militia unit, with staff and students to be selected from the Citizen Forces, and the first flights by CFS aircraft took place in March 1914.Odgers, Air Force Australia, pp. 13‚Äì14 World War I and the Inter-war years An Australian Flying Corps aircraft c. 1918 Soon after the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the AFC sent aircraft to assist the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force in capturing German colonies in what is now north-west New Guinea. These colonies surrendered quickly however, before the planes were even unpacked.Dennis et al, The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History, p. 67 The first operational flights did not occur until 27 May 1915, when the Mesopotamian Half Flight was called upon to assist the Indian Army in protecting British oil interests in what is now Iraq. The corps later saw action in Egypt, Palestine and on the Western Front throughout the remainder of World War I. By the end of the war, four squadrons ‚Äì Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 ‚Äì had seen active service; another four squadrons ‚Äì Nos. 5, 6, 7, and 8 ‚Äì had also been raised to provide training in the United Kingdom. The AFC was disbanded along with the rest of the Australian Imperial Force in 1919, following the end of hostilities. Although the Central Flying School continued to operate at Point Cook, military flying virtually ceased until 1920, when the Australian Air Corps was formed. The following year, this was separated from the Army on 31 March 1921, when the Australian Air Force was formed as an independent service; in June that year King George V gave his assent for the service to use the prefix \\"Royal\\" and this came into effect on 31 August 1921.Dennis et al, The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History, pp. 68‚Äì69; 507 Upon formation, the RAAF had more aircraft than personnel, with 21 officers and 128 other ranks,Dennis et al, The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History, p. 507 and just 170 aircraft. Initially, it had been planned to expand the force to 1,500 personnel ‚Äì three-quarters permanent staff and one quarter reserves ‚Äì who would serve in six squadrons: two of fighter aircraft, two of reconnaissance aircraft, and two squadrons of seaplanes. These plans were scuttled a year after formation due to budget constraints and until 1924, the service's strength remained steady at just 50 officers and 300 other ranks; of the six planned squadrons, only five had been raised, albeit cadre strength, and these were subsequently merged into a single mixed squadron until 1925.Dennis et al, The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History, p. 508 A slightly improved economic situation in 1925 allowed the re- raising of Nos. 1 and 3 Squadrons, which were initially composite units equipped with fighters and bombers. Later in the decade, they were reorganised with No. 1 Squadron becoming a solely bomber formation, while No. 3 focused on army co-operation roles; smaller squadrons ‚Äì in reality only flights ‚Äì of fighters and seaplanes were formed within the RAAF's flying training unit, No. 1 Flying Training School, which had been raised at Point Cook. Throughout the inter-war years the fledgling RAAF focused on local defence and providing training opportunities to Australia's naval and military forces. It also undertook aerial survey missions, meteorological flights, public displays, and provision of defence aid to the civil community, undertaking search and rescue missions and bush fire patrols. In the late 1930s, the force was expanded amidst concerns about a future war in Europe. Additional squadrons were raised and bases established away from the south-east coast, including airbases in Western Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory. This expansion saw the RAAF increase its personnel from under 1,000 in 1935 to around 3,500 in 1939, and the establishment of a force of 12 squadrons, with plans for a further six, by the outbreak of World War II in September 1939. World War II Shortly after the declaration of war in Europe, although Australia's air force was small ‚Äì consisting of just 246 aircraft ‚Äì the Australian government offered to send six squadrons to Britain to fight, in addition to the 450 Australians who were already serving in the ranks of the Royal Air Force at the time.Armstrong, \\"History of the RAAF: 20 Years of Warfighting 1939‚Äì1959, Part 2\\", p. 43 The RAAF already had one squadron in the United Kingdom, No. 10 Squadron RAAF, which had been dispatched earlier in the year to take ownership of nine Short Sunderland flying boats and return them to Australia. They subsequently took place in their first operational mission on 10 October 1939, when they carried out a sortie to Tunisia. To rapidly expand, Australia joined the Empire Air Training Scheme,Armstrong, \\"History of the RAAF: 20 Years of Warfighting 1939‚Äì1959, Part 2\\", p. 42 under which flight crews received basic training in Australia before travelling to Canada or Rhodesia for advanced training. These crews were then posted to operational units. A total of 17 RAAF bomber, fighter, reconnaissance and other squadrons served initially in Britain, and/or with the Desert Air Force, in North Africa and the Mediterranean.Dennis et al, The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History, p. 509 An Australian Hampden from No. 455 Squadron RAAF at RAF Leuchars in May 1942. With British manufacturing targeted by the Luftwaffe, the Australian government created the Department of Aircraft Production (DAP), which was later known as the Government Aircraft Factories, to supply Commonwealth air forces and the RAAF was eventually provided with large numbers of locally-built versions of British designs like the Beaufort torpedo bomber. An Australian Halifax from No. 462 Squadron RAAF at RAF Foulsham in 1945. In the European Theatre of World War II, RAAF personnel were especially notable in RAF Bomber Command: although they represented only two percent of all RAAF personnel during the war, they accounted for 23% of the total number killed in action. This statistic is further illustrated by the fact that No. 460 Squadron RAAF, mostly flying Avro Lancasters, had an official establishment of about 200 aircrew and yet had 1,018 combat deaths. The squadron was therefore effectively wiped out five times over.Barnes, The RAAF and the Flying Squadrons, p. 299 An Australian Beaufighter flying over the Owen Stanley Range in New Guinea in 1942 The beginning of the Pacific War‚Äîand the rapid advance of Japanese forces‚Äîthreatened the Australian mainland for the first time. The RAAF was quite unprepared for the emergency, and initially had negligible forces available for service in the Pacific. Its four squadrons based in Malaya ‚Äì Nos. 1, 8, 21 and 453 ‚Äì equipped with a mixture of Hudsons, Wirraways and Buffalos, were the first to go into combat, but they suffered heavily against Japanese during the Malayan Campaign and the subsequent fighting on Singapore, highlighting the fact that the Japanese held the upper hand in the air.Armstrong, \\"History of the RAAF: 20 Years of Warfighting 1939‚Äì1959, Part 2\\", p. 44 The devastating air raids on Darwin on 19 February 1942 ‚Äì launched from four aircraft carriers stationed in the Timor Sea ‚Äì drove the point home. Defended by a small force of just 18 Wirraways and 14 Hudsons from two squadrons ‚Äì Nos. 12 and 13 ‚Äì the town was heavily damaged with the loss of 10 ships, 23 aircraft and a death toll of several hundred.Armstrong, \\"History of the RAAF: 20 Years of Warfighting 1939‚Äì1959, Part 2\\", p. 45 In response, some RAAF squadrons ‚Äì such as No. 452 Squadron.Barnes, The RAAF and the Flying Squadrons, pp. 260‚Äì261 ‚Äì were transferred from the northern hemisphere‚Äîalthough 15 remained there until the end of the war.Armstrong, \\"History of the RAAF: 20 Years of Warfighting 1939‚Äì1959, Part 2\\", p. 46 Shortages of fighter and ground attack planes led to the acquisition of US- built P-40 Kittyhawks, and the rapid design and manufacture of the first Australian fighter, the CAC Boomerang.Barrett, Significant People in Australia's History, Issue 7, pp. 21‚Äì22 RAAF Kittyhawks, such as those operated by Nos. 75, 76 and 77 Squadrons, came to play a crucial role in the New Guinea and Solomon Islands campaigns, especially in the Battle of Milne Bay and in the Kokoda Track campaign. In the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, imported Bristol Beaufighters proved to be highly effective ground attack and maritime strike aircraft. Beaufighters were later made locally by the DAP. Although it was much bigger than Japanese fighters, the Beaufighter had the speed to outrun them. The RAAF's heavy bomber force predominantly comprised 287 B-24 Liberators, which could bomb Japanese targets as far away as Borneo and the Philippines from airfields in Australia and New Guinea. In September 1942 most Australian squadrons were grouped under RAAF Command. The only Australian air combat units in the SWPA not under RAAF Command were those based in New Guinea as No. 9 Operational Group RAAF, which was controlled by Fifth Air Force.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, pp.585‚Äì588Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp.4‚Äì6Ashworth, How Not to Run an Air Force, pp.143‚Äì146 RAAF Command was charged with defending Australia, except in the north-east, protecting the sea lanes to New Guinea, and conducting operations against Japanese shipping, airfields and other installations in the Dutch East Indies.Bostock, William Dowling (1892‚Äì1968) at Australian Dictionary of Biography. Retrieved on 26 December 2010.Horner, \\"The Evolution of Australian Higher Command Arrangements\\", pp.17‚Äì18 Its role was thus \\"mainly defensive\\" at the outset, with the expectation that \\"in the event of developments in the North and North-West of Australia, this would be altered\\".Ashworth, How Not to Run an Air Force, pp.147‚Äì151 Bostock was to exercise control of air operations through the RAAF area command system, comprising North-Western, Western, Southern, Eastern, and North-Eastern Area Commands.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, p.144 By late 1945, the RAAF had received or ordered about 500 P-51 Mustangs, for fighter/ground attack purposes. The Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation initially assembled US-made Mustangs, but later manufactured most of those used. The RAAF's main operational formation, the First Tactical Air Force, comprised more than 18,000 personnel and 20 squadrons; it had taken part in the Philippines and Borneo campaigns and was scheduled to participate in the invasion of the Japanese mainland, Operation Downfall. So too were the RAAF bomber squadrons in Europe, as part of the proposed Tiger Force. However, the war was brought to a sudden end by the US nuclear attacks on Japan. As a result of the Empire Air Training Scheme, about 20,000 Australian personnel had served with other Commonwealth air forces in Europe during World War II. A total of 216,900 men and women served in the RAAF, of whom 9,780 lost their lives. At war's end, a total of 53 RAAF squadrons were serving in the Pacific and a further 17 in Europe. With over 152,000 personnel operating nearly 6,000 aircraft it was the world's fourth largest air force, after those of the USA, the USSR and the UK.Eather, Odd Jobs, p. xv. Post-World War II service =Korean War= Two F/A-18 Hornets and ground crew from No.75 Squadron in the Middle East during 2003. In the Korean War, Mustangs from No. 77 Squadron (77 Sqn), stationed in Japan with the British Commonwealth Occupation Force, were among the first United Nations aircraft to be deployed, in ground support, combat air patrol, and escort missions. When the UN planes were confronted by MiG-15 jet fighters, 77 Sqn acquired Gloster Meteors, which enabled some success against the Soviet pilots flying for North Korea. However, the MiGs were superior aircraft and the Meteors were relegated to ground support missions, as the North Koreans gained experience. The air force also operated transport aircraft during the conflict.Armstrong, \\"History of the RAAF: 20 Years of Warfighting 1939‚Äì1959, Part 2\\", p. 47 =Vietnam War= During the Vietnam War, from 1966‚Äì1972, the RAAF contributed squadrons of Caribou STOL transport aircraft (No. 35 Squadron), UH-1 Iroquois helicopters (No. 9 Squadron) and English Electric Canberra bombers (No. 2 Squadron). The Canberras flew a large number of bombing sorties, two were lost (in 1970 and 1971). Two crew members were killed, two squadron members died of disease, and three from accidents during the war. One of the Canberras lost (A84-228) was brought down by a surface-to- air missile from which the crew (including the squadron commander, W/C Frank Downing) safely ejected and were rescued by helicopter. The other (A84-231) was lost near Da Nang, during a bombing run. Its exact location and fate of its crew (FlgOff. Michael Herbert and Plt Off. Robert Carver) were unknown for 28 years, when it was located and their remains were returned to Australia.Bell, T.E. (2011). B-57 Canberra Units of the Vietnam War. Oxford, UK; Osprey, p.80.) RAAF transport aircraft also supported anti-communist ground forces. The UH-1 helicopters were used in many roles including Dustoff (medical evacuation) and Bushranger Gunships for armed support. =Peacekeeping and Iraq= Military airlifts were conducted for a number of purposes in the intervening decades, such as the peacekeeping operations in East Timor from 1999. Australia's combat aircraft were not used again in anger until the Iraq War in 2003, when F/A-18s from No. 75 Squadron operated in the escort and ground attack roles.

According to Bainbridge, Newdigate married Katherine Hampden, widow of Henry Ferrers, and daughter of Sir John Hampden of Great Hampden, by whom he had two daughters, Amphyllis and Elizabeth.

New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 12 Jan. 2013 However it is unlikely that Newdigate's admission as a postulant could have occurred prior to 24 October 1526, when the King granted him a wardship. Not long after Newdigate became a novice, his sister, Jane, who in 1512 had married Sir Robert Dormer of Wing, Buckinghamshire,. visited the Prior, William Tynbygh, to express her concern about Newdigate's suitability for the strictness of the monastic life after his early years at court.. Despite his sister's misgivings, Newdigate remained at the Charterhouse. He was ordained a deacon on 3 June 1531, and was ordained to the priesthood before his death. In 1534 Henry VIII required his subjects to take the Oath of Succession recognizing Anne Boleyn as his lawful wife. Newdigate signed the oath \\"in as far as the law of God permits\\" on 6 June 1534. However the Carthusian community at the Charterhouse refused to accept the King's assumption of supremacy over the English church, and on 4 May 1535 the Prior of the Charterhouse, John Houghton, was executed, together with two other Carthusian priors, Robert Lawrence and Augustine Webster, priors respectively of Beauvale and Axholme. Newdigate and two other monks, Humphrey Middlemore and William Exmew, were arrested on 25 May 1535 for denying the King's supremacy, and imprisoned in the Marshalsea, where they were kept for fourteen days bound to pillars, standing upright, with iron rings round their necks, hands, and feet.. Newdigate was visited there by the King, who is said to have come in disguise, and to have offered to load Newdigate with riches and honours if he would conform. He was then brought before the Privy Council, and sent to the Tower of London, where Henry again visited him, but was unable to change his mind. The three monks were condemned to death for treason on 11 June, and on 19 June were dragged to Tyburn on hurdles, and hanged, drawn and quartered..

The University of Melbourne. By this time he was married with two young daughters; his wife Mary held a master of science from the University of London. Johnson published several books on mysticism and psychical research during the 1950s and 1960s. His beliefs and writings eventually created concern within the Methodist Church and he retired from his university position in 1964. In the early 1960s Johnson visited India, where he met Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and lectured on spirituality. He also met the Indian mystics Vinoba Bhave and Swami Pratyagatmananda. Johnson was an advocate of Douglas Fawcett's philosophy of Imaginism which he believed could explain God and the purpose of human life.Robert Ashby. (1972). The Guidebook for the Study of Psychical Research. p. 83. He owned a property called \\"Santiniketan\\" (\\"abode of peace\\") at Ferny Creek in the Dandenong Ranges outside Melbourne. There he hosted regular meetings of a religious and philosophical discussion group led by the yoga teacher Anne Hamilton-Byrne. This group became known as \\"The Family\\",Supreme Court of Victoria 1999 Judgement in Kibby v.

Hamilton-Byrne and her husband Bill were extradited from the United States six years later and faced criminal charges. Twenty years after his death, an authorised biography was published, Raynor Johnson ‚Äì A Biographical Memoir (2007). Two further books authored by Johnson were published after his death ‚Äì Mysticism and Life (2010) and a collection of miscellaneous writings, A Late Lark Singing (2012). Reception In his book Psychical Research, Johnson endorsed psychical and spiritualist phenomena and cited reports by the Society for Psychical Research. In a review for The Quarterly Review of Biology M. Steinbach wrote that although Johnson was \\"quite earnest and certainly sincere in completely accepting the whole range of spiritualist phenomena\\", many of the cases he described could be easily explained by coincidence, delusion, hallucination, suggestion and that most of the mediums were exposed as fraudulent.M. Steinbach. (1957). Psychical Research. by R. C. Johnson. The Quarterly Review of Biology. Vol. 32, No. 3. pp. 318-319. Johnson believed that the material world was a creation of the mind, and claimed paranormal phenomena such as discarnate minds, mediumship, psi and telepathy could be explained by a \\"psychic ether\\". On this, Steinbach wrote \\"but to do that is to leave this world of reality and the firm basis of scientific thought for a speculative journey in an imaginary vehicle to a never-never-land.\\" Johnson's Nurslings of Immortality received a mixed review in The Journal of Religion, wherein William Hamilton wrote that the book endorsed a \\"pretentious philosophical quasi-idealism\\" called Imaginism but contained some interesting material about automatic writing and psychic phenomena.William Hamilton.

Georgians are the only Caucasian people who have their own undisputedly independent state‚ÄîGeorgia. Abkhazia's status is disputed. Other Caucasian peoples have republics within the Russian Federation: Adyghe (Adygea), Cherkess (Karachay‚ÄìCherkessia), Kabardins (Kabardino-Balkaria), Ingush (Ingushetia), Chechens (Chechnya), while other Northeast Caucasian peoples mostly live in Dagestan. =Indo-European= Ethno-linguistic groups in the Caucasus region 1887.

Elsewhere in the region, they reside in Nagorno-Karabakh (which is de facto independent republic, though not recognized internationally), Georgia (primarily Samtskhe-Javakheti, Tbilisi, and Abkhazia), and the Russian North Caucasus. The Ossetians live in North Ossetia‚ÄìAlania (autonomous republic within Russia) and in South Ossetia, which is de facto independent, but de jure is part of Georgia. The Yazidis reside in the western areas of Armenia, mostly in the Aragatsotn marz, and in the eastern areas of Georgia. An autonomous Kurdish region was created in 1923 in Soviet Azerbaijan but was later abolished in 1929. Pontic Greeks reside in Armenia (Lori Province, especially in Alaverdi) and Georgia (Kvemo Kartli, Adjara, the Tsalka, and Abkhazia). Pontic Greeks had also made up a significant component of the southern Caucasus region acquired from the Ottoman Turkish Empire (following the 1878 Treaty of San Stefano) that centred on the town of Kars (ceded back to Turkey in 1916). Russians mostly live in the Russian North Caucasus and their largest concentration is in Stavropol Krai, Krasnodar Krai, and in Adygea. Georgia and the former south Russian Caucasus province of Kars Oblast was also home to a significant minority of ethnic (Swabian) Germans, although their numbers have become depleted as a result of deportations (to Kazakhstan following WWII), immigration to Germany, and assimilation into indigenous communities. =Semitic= Caucasians that speak languages that belong to the Semitic language family *Assyrians in the Caucasus number approximately 35,000 people, and live in Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan and Southern Russia. There are up to 15,000 in Georgia, 3500 in Armenia, up to 15,000 in southern Russia and 1400 in Azerbaijan. They descend from the ancient Mesopotamians. They are Eastern Rite Christians, mainly followers of the Assyrian Church of the East, and speak and write Mesopotamian Eastern Aramaic dialects. *Caucasus Jews of two sub-ethnic groups Mountain Jews and Georgian Jews. There are about 15,000‚Äì30,000 Caucasus Jews (as 140,000 immigrated to Israel, and 40,000 to the US). *Arabs in the Caucasus: a population of nomadic Arabs was reported in 1728 as having rented winter pastures near the Caspian shores of Mughan (in present-day Azerbaijan). In 1888, an unknown number of Arabs still lived in the Baku Governorate of the Russian Empire. As well as descendants of Sayyid and Siddiqui ‚Äì the people with Arabian origin, but mostly assimilated by other Caucasian peoples. However, some people identify not just as Sayyid or Siddiqui with non-Arabian ethnicity, but as Arabs.Stephen Adolphe Wurm et al. Atlas of languages of intercultural communication.

In the Caucasus region, they live in Georgia, Russia (Dagestan), Turkey and previously in Armenia (before 1990). The total number of Azerbaijanis is around 35 million (25 million in Iran). Other Turkic speakers live in their autonomous republics within Russian Federation: Karachays (Karachay‚ÄìCherkessia), Balkars (Kabardino-Balkaria), while Kumyks and Nogais live in Dagestan. By location This gives ethnic locations about 1775 before the Russians came.Arthur Tsutsiev and Nora Seligman Favorov (translator) Atlas of the Ethno-Political History of the Caucasus, 2014, Map 4 supplemented by Maps 12,18 and 31. NWCLS means Northwest Caucasian Language speakers and NECLS means Northeast Caucasian Language speakers. The linguistic nationalities that we now recognize are somewhat artificial. Two hundred years ago a man‚Äôs loyalty was to his friends, kin, village and chief and not primarily to his language group. The difference between steppe, mountain and plain was far more important than difference of language. Only the southern half (and the southernmost part of Dagestan) had organized states, usually Persian or Turkish vassals and few, if any, of these states corresponded well to language groups. Northern Lowlands: The Turkic-speaking Nogai nomads occupied almost all of the steppe north of the Caucasus. In the nineteenth century they were pushed far southeast to their present location. Formerly part of the eastern steppe was occupied by Kalmyks ‚Äì Buddhist Mongols who migrated from Dzungaria about 1618. In 1771 many returned to their original homeland and they contracted to their present location in the far northeast, Nogais temporarily taking their place. In the southeast were the isolated Terek Cossacks. Their settlements later grew into the North Caucasus Line. There were a few Turkmens in the center of the steppe. North Slope: The western two thirds was occupied by Circassians ‚Äì NWCLS divided into twelve or so tribes. They long resisted the Russians and in 1864 several hundred thousand of them were expelled to the Ottoman Empire. To their east were the Kabardians ‚Äì NWCLS similar to the Circassians but with a different political organization. The term Lesser Kabardia refers to the eastern area. South of the eastern Circassian-Kabardians were three groups that seem to have been driven into the high mountains about 500 years previously. The Karachays and Balkars spoke similar Turkic languages. East of the Balkars were the Ossets ‚Äì Iranian speakers descended from the ancient Alans who controlled the future Georgian Military Highway and had a growing Christian minority. East of the future highway was a north-south band of Ingush ‚Äì NECLS similar to the Chechens. The numerous Chechens to the east were later to wage the long Murid War against the Russians. For the small groups south of the Ingush-Chechens see South Slope below. To the east along the coast were the Turkic Kumyks. Mountain Dagestan: All the peoples of mountain Dagestan were NECLS except the Tats. In the northwest were a number of small language groups (Tsez people (Dido) and Andi people), similar to the Avars. To their southeast were the numerous Avars with a khanate at Khunzakh who fought in the Murid War. Southeast were the Dargwa people and west of them the Laks who held the Kumukh Khanate. Southeast along the Samur River were the Lezgian people with many subgroups and then the Iranian-speaking Tats down to Baku. Caspian Coast: From Astrakhan to the Terek River there were the Buddhist Kalmykh nomads. Along the Terek were the isolated Terek Cossacks. From the Terek to Derbent were the Turkic-speaking Kumyks with a state at Tarki. The town of Derbent itself had a majority Persian () population, as it had for many centuries, until the late 19th century. On the coastal plain south of Derbent was a mixed population, mostly Azeri (\\"Transcaucasian Tatar\\"), and further south to Baku were the Iranian-speaking Tats. When Baku became a boom town the Tats retained a majority only in the mountains. The Mountain Jews, who had a number of villages inland from the coast, spoke a form of Tat called Judeo-Tat. The lowlands south of Baku were held by Azeris, Turkic-speaking Shiites. On both sides of the current Iranian border were the Iranian-speaking Talysh. Based on genetic studies the Gilaki and Mazanderani ethnic groups in northern Iran (near the Caspian Sea) have been proven to be genetically similar to Armenians, Georgians and Azeris. This indicates that the Gilaki and Mazanderani ethnic groups are people that immigrated from the Caucasus region to what is now northern Iran.Nasidze, Ivan; Quinque, Dominique; Rahmani, Manijeh; Alemohamad, Seyed Ali; Stoneking, Mark (April 2006). \\"Concomitant Replacement of Language and mtDNA in South Caspian Populations of Iran\\". Curr. Biol. 16 (7): 668‚Äì73. doi:10.1016/j.cub.2006.02.021. . Retrieved 4 April 2014. South Slope: Black Sea coast: In the northwest the mountains came down to the sea and the population was Circassian. Southward the coastal plain broadened and the population was Abkhazian ‚Äì similar to the Circassians but under Georgian influence. South Slope proper: On the south side of the Caucasus the mountains fall quickly to the plains and there is only a small transition zone. The inhabitants were either Georgians with mountain customs or northern mountaineers who had moved south. The Svans were Georgian mountaineers. In the center the Iranian Ossets had moved south and were surrounded on three sides by Georgians. East of the Ossets and south of the Ingush-Chechens were three groups of Georgian mountaineers on both sides of the mountain crest: Khevi, Khevsurs, and Tushetians. The Bats were NECLS entangled with the Tushetians and the Kists were Chechens south of the mountains. Near the Georgian-Azeri linguistic border there were some Avars and Tsakhurs (Lezgians) who had crossed the mountains. Associated with the Tsakhurs were the Ingiloy or Georgian-speaking Muslims. In the north Azeri area were a few Udins or southern Lezgians and Lakhij or southern Tats. Southern Lowlands: The western two thirds were occupied by Georgians ‚Äì an ancient Christian people with a unique language. The eastern third was Azeri ‚Äì a group of Turkic-speaking Shiites under Persian influence. On the fringe of the Georgian area were Georgian speakers who had either adopted Islam or mountain customs. Further South the land becomes higher. In the west were the Laz people or Georgian Muslims. In Kars province there were Turks, Kurds and Armenians. The Armenians were somewhat concentrated in modern Armenia but were mostly spread out as a minority all over Asia Minor. There were groups of Azeris west of their main area who tended to blend with the Turks. The Kurds were semi-nomadic shepherds with small groups in various places and concentrations in Kars province and Nakhchivan. In the far southeast were the Iranian Talysh. Genetic history Language groups in the Caucasus are closely correlated to genetic ancestry.

Extracts may be sold as tinctures, absolutes or in powder form. The aromatic principles of many spices, nuts, herbs, fruits, etc., and some flowers, are marketed as extracts, among the best known of true extracts being almond, cinnamon, cloves, ginger, lemon, nutmeg, orange, peppermint, pistachio, rose, spearmint, vanilla, violet, rum, and wintergreen. Extraction techniques Traditional extraction pot in Iran The majority of natural essences are obtained by extracting the essential oil from the blossoms, fruit, roots, etc., or the whole plants, through four techniques: 1) expression, 2) absorption, 3) maceration, and 4) distillation. Expression is used when the oil is plentiful and easily obtained, as in lemon peel. Absorption is generally accomplished by steeping in alcohol, as vanilla beans. Maceration is used to create smaller bits of the whole, as in making peppermint extract, etc. Distillation is used with maceration, but in many cases, it requires expert chemical knowledge and the erection of costly stills. The distinctive flavors of nearly all fruits, in the popular acceptance of the word, are desirable adjuncts to many food preparations, but only a few are practical sources of sufficiently concentrated flavor extract. The most important among those that lend themselves to \\"pure\\" extract manufacture include lemons, oranges, and vanilla beans. Artificial extracts The majority of concentrated fruit flavors such as banana, cherry, peach, pineapple, raspberry and strawberry, are produced by combining a variety of esters with special oils. The desired colors are generally obtained by the use of dyes. Among the esters most generally employed are ethyl acetate and ethyl butyrate. The chief factors in the production of artificial banana, pineapple, and strawberry extract are amyl acetate and amyl butyrate. Artificial extracts generally do not possess the delicacy of natural fruit flavor, but usually taste sufficiently similar to be useful when true essences are unobtainable or too expensive.

The brewery was founded in 1901 by Nikoline and Conrad Nielsen and it is best known for its strong export beers. In 1989 Faxe Bryggeri merged with Bryggerigruppen which later developed into Royal Unibrew. It is known around Germany for its 5% 1 litre cans, North America for its 8% and 10% 500mL cans, and Denmark where it is produced, and especially in Norway and in Greenland.  History  = The young widow's successful brewery = The brewery in Faxe was founded in 1901 under the name Fakse Dampbryggeri by Nikoline and Conrad Nielsen. After Conrad Nielsen's death in 1914, his young widow continued to run the company with great success. At the end of the 1920s, Faxe Bryggeri, as the company was renamed in 1914, supplied especially mild ale, but also carbonated soft drinks to most of Zealand, Lolland-Falster and the Copenhagen Area. The brewery grew concurrently with its sales success resulting in a problem: water shortage. In the 1930s, it was necessary to drill a well to ensure access to enough water. At 80 metres, they reached the limestone-filtered water that Faxe Bryggeri has since based its production on. The water turned out to be excellent as a mineral water and in beer, and Faxe Bryggeri now began to make a name for itself with lager and strong beers in its sales area. = New generations = In 1945, Nikoline retired, and Faxe Bryggeri was converted into a partnership headed by her three sons. In 1956, the brewery was converted into a limited company and under the management of the brothers the brewery steadily expanded until 1960. During that period, the three brothers all died within three years. In 1960, Nikoline's grandson, Bent Bryde-Nielsen, became head of Faxe Bryggeri. This was followed by a period of expansion, new product launches and the introduction of new marketing and distribution principles. = ‚ÄùDer grosse D√§ne‚Äù = Faxe gradually became one of Denmark's most dynamic breweries. The 1970s were golden years for the southern Zealand company: the draught beer Faxe Fad was launched in both cans and bottles, and the Danes were offered people's shares in the brewery. In the 1980s, Faxe made major investments in sales and marketing as well as in the brewery's production facilities, which by now produced beer and soft drinks for both the domestic and international markets. Especially Germans and Swedes appreciated the taste of Faxe's beer. ‚ÄúDen store dansken‚Äù and ‚ÄúDer grosse D√§ne‚Äù (the Great Dane), inspired by Faxe Fad, is how many Swedes and Germans know the beer today. Then there was the success of Faxe Kondi - today among leading brands of soft drinks in Denmark. Faxe Kondi was developed in 1971 in cooperation with Knud Lundberg, a sports physician and star footballer. = Major investments and high technology = In 1989, Faxe Bryggeri merged with Jyske Bryggerier to form Denmark's second largest brewery company, now known as Royal Unibrew. In 1997-98, Faxe was expanded with a new basement building with tanks, which can hold up to 600,000 litres and a new can line, which can tap 90,000 cans per hour. In 1999, DKK 115 million were invested in a high-tech and fully automated multi-storey warehouse with room for 18,500 pallets.

He served a total of twenty years in both chambers. From the late 1960s, the Republican Party had been attracting white southern conservatives into its ranks. In the last weeks of his last term as state senator in 1980, Knowles switched to the GOP. He had supported Republican David C. Treen for governor of Louisiana in 1979 and was appointed to state posts. From Lake Charles, Knowles was a United States Army Air Forces veteran and a survivor of the Bataan Death March in World War II. He was active in veterans' affairs and groups following his service during the war and served as national president of the 27th Bombardment Group Association. Early life and education Knowles was born in Merryville in Beauregard Parish, but his family moved to Lake Charles in 1935. Knowles graduated from Lake Charles High School (renamed Lake Charles Boston High School after consolidation). Military service In 1939, Knowles enlisted in the Army Air Corps and served in the Pacific Theater of Operations, where he was captured in 1942 >by the Japanese army at Bataan. Surviving the Bataan Death March, he was held in a number of prison camps for more than two years, a total of 1,228 days. He was last held in the camp in Mukden, Manchuria, where he was liberated by United States forces on August 15, 1945. The Death March was featured in a National Broadcasting Company documentary in 1982 entitled The Forgotten Hell. As a president of the Mayor's Armed Forces Committee in Lake Charles, Knowles had regular contact with the Fort Polk staff in Leesville in Vernon Parish. He urged members of the military to visit Lake Charles. He was a well-known speaker at school programs and veterans' ceremonies. Knowles served as a commander of his area and district Veterans of Foreign Wars. He was a legislative officer and a junior vice commander of the VFW Post 2130. He was also a member of W. B. Williamson American Legion Post 1, the Disabled American Veterans, and the American Ex-Prisoners of War. He served as a national president of the 27th Bombardment Group Association and was cited as \\"Man of the Year\\" by that group. He was a member of the American Defenders of Bataan and Corregidor. After Knowles was discharged from the military, he went to work as a draftsman for Amoco Oil Company. He became a fee land supervisor. Retiring in 1984 after thirty-eight years of service with Amoco, he later worked for the Lake Charles River Pilots. Entering Louisiana politics Knowles had joined the Democratic Party when it held nearly every public office in Louisiana. At the turn of the 20th century, Louisiana and other former Confederate states disenfranchised most blacks by raising barriers to voter registration. This move dramatically weakened the Republican Party in the South. Knowles was first elected to the Louisiana House of Representatives in the 1959-1960 election cycle. In 1964, Knowles was elected as a Democrat to the state Senate, in which he served for four terms. He was once named \\"Outstanding Legislator\\" by the Lake Charles Junior Chamber International. In 1969, Knowles emerged as a leading critic of sex education in public schools, an issue that was controversial in a period of social change. He referred to the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States, which prepared much of the sex education curriculum then under consideration, as \\"a communist conspiracy\\". He supported a measure to withdraw state funds from school districts that followed the suggested SIEUS curriculum. State Senator Edgar G. \\"Sonny\\" Mouton, Jr., of Lafayette, said that sponsors of the punitive legislation, including Knowles, were \\"storm troopers\\".\\"Sex Education Bill Killed in Senate by Vidrine Talk\\", Minden Press- Herald, June 10, 1969, p. 1. In the 1979 nonpartisan blanket primary, Knowles did not seek a fifth state Senate term but instead ran for lieutenant governor in a bid to succeed James E. \\"Jimmy\\" Fitzmorris, Jr., of New Orleans, who instead ran unsuccessfully for governor. Another Democrat, Bobby Freeman of Plaquemine in Iberville Parish, was elected as lieutenant governor for the first of two terms. Early in 1980, Knowles, with just a few weeks remaining in his state senate term, Knowles switched his party affiliation to Republican, and Governor Treen appointed Knowles as the secretary of the Department of Wildlife and Fisheries. Knowles, however, had to retire from office after suffering a heart attack twelve days into his appointment. After he recovered, Governor Treen appointed him to the Louisiana Rice Promotion Board. Knowles was also elected to the board of directors of the Louisiana Rice Council, of which he was later the president.

The United Nations and NATO later expanded the mission of the operation to include providing close air support for UN troops in Bosnia and carrying out coercive air strikes against targets in Bosnia. Twelve NATO members contributed forces to the operation and, by its end on 20 December 1995, NATO pilots had flown 100,420 sorties. The operation played an important role in shaping both the Bosnian War and NATO. The operation included the first combat engagementConflict in the Balkans: NATO Craft Down 4 Serb Warplanes Attacking Bosnia in NATO's history, a 28 February 1994 air battle over Banja Luka, and in April 1994, NATO aircraft first bombed ground targets in an operation near Gora≈æde. These engagements helped show that NATO had adapted to the post-Cold War era and could operate in environments other than a major force-on-force engagement on the plains of Central Europe. Cooperation between the UN and NATO during the operation also helped pave the way for future joint operations. Although it helped establish UN‚ÄìNATO relations, Deny Flight led to conflict between the two organizations. Most notably, significant tension arose between the two after UN peacekeepers were taken as hostages in response to NATO bombing. The operations of Deny Flight spanned more than two years of the Bosnian War and played an important role in the course of that conflict. The no-fly zone operations of Deny Flight proved successful in preventing significant use of air power by any side in the conflict. Additionally, the air strikes flown during Deny Flight led to Operation Deliberate Force, a massive NATO bombing campaign in Bosnia that played a key role in ending the war.  Background and Operation Sky Monitor  In October 1992, at the beginning of the Bosnian War, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 781. This resolution prohibited unauthorized military flights in Bosnian airspace. Following the resolution, NATO began Operation Sky Monitor during which NATO forces monitored violations of the no-fly zone, without taking any military action against violators. By April 1993, NATO forces had documented more than 500 violations of the no-fly zone.Beale, pp. 19‚Äì20 In response to these \\"blatant\\" violations of Bosnian air space, and implicitly of resolution 781, the UN Security Council issued Resolution 816. While Resolution 781 prohibited only military flights, Resolution 816 prohibited all flights in Bosnian air space, except for those expressly authorized by the UN Flight Coordination Center in Zagreb. The resolution also authorized UN member states to \\"take all necessary measures ... to ensure compliance\\" with the no-fly zone restrictions.\\"Resolution 816\\" In response to this resolution, NATO commenced Operation Deny Flight on 12 April 1993. Initially Deny Flight was intended only to enforce the no-fly zone; however several NATO members, including the United States, were eager to find ways to end the war and improve the situation of civilians, and hoped that military action could do so. The US had already taken unilateral actions to aid civilians caught in the conflict by dropping humanitarian supplies into Bosnia under Operation Provide Promise, and many US officials argued for the use of military force. These officials were eager to expand US air operations through Deny Flight, hoping that an aggressive no-fly zone and possible air strikes would end the conflict more quickly.Beale, p. 19 NATO forces suffered its first loss on the second day of operations, when a French Mirage 2000 crashed in the Adriatic Sea due to mechanical failure. The pilot ejected safely.  Enforcement of no-fly zone  A USAF F-15C takes off for a sortie to enforce the no-fly zone After its adoption, Operation Deny Flight was relatively successful in preventing fixed- wing aircraft from flying over restricted air space in Bosnia. During the monitoring phase of Operation Sky Monitor, unauthorized fixed-wing flights averaged twenty per month, but during Deny Flight, the average was three. During the conflict, there were only an estimated 32 fixed-wing military aircraft in Bosnia, all of them former Yugoslav National Army planes under the control of the Bosnian Serbs. Thus, NATO primarily needed to prevent incursions into Bosnian airspace from Croatia and Serbia.Beale, pp. 21 The first serious violation to the no-fly zone came on 28 February 1994, when six Serb J-21 Jastreb jets bombed a Bosnian factory. US Air Force F-16s shot down four of the six Serb jets over Banja Luka.Beale, pp. 2‚Äì3 This engagement was the first combat engagement of Operation Deny Flight, and its only significant air-to-air combat engagement. Perhaps more importantly, the Banja Luka incident was also the first combat engagement in the history of NATO.Owen, p. 21 The Serbs acknowledged the loss of a fifth aircraft in the incident.Serbian officially admitted 5 Aircraft lost (Serbian) While Deny Flight was relatively successful in stopping flights of fixed-wing aircraft, NATO forces found it very difficult to stop helicopter flights, which presented a more complicated challenge. All sides in the conflict used helicopters extensively for non- military purposes, and some of these flights were authorized by the UN. Under the operation's rules of engagement, NATO fighters were only authorized to shoot down helicopters that committed a hostile act. Otherwise, NATO fighters issued orders to \\"land or exit\\", in other words, land the aircraft or leave the no-fly zone. Typically, helicopters in Bosnian airspace complied with these orders by landing, but then took off again after NATO forces departed.Beale, p. 20 None of the parties in the conflict respected the ban on helicopter flights, as evidenced when Ratko Mladiƒá responded to a BBC journalist's question about his violation of the ban with the statement, \\"The commander of the Bosnian Serb armed forces does not ride on a donkey.\\"\\"Ratko Mladic's very personal war\\" Deceptive markings on helicopters further complicated matters for NATO pilots. Many of the combatants painted their helicopters to look like those of organizations that the UN's Zagreb Flight Coordination Center had authorized to fly in restricted space. For example, the army of the Republika Srpska often painted a Red Cross logo on their helicopters, and Croatian helicopters were given markings similar to those of UN humanitarian aid helicopters. The questionable identity of these helicopters became particularly problematic after the Black Hawk Incident in Iraq, because NATO pilots became more reluctant to engage potential belligerents without clear identification. As a result of the rules of engagement and difficulties in aircraft identification, NATO forces proved unable to stop most unauthorized helicopter flights, resulting in a documented total of 5711 unauthorized flights during the conflict.Beale, pp. 19‚Äì21  Close air support and air strikes  Even before Operation Deny Flight began, a number of US officials lobbied for a large role for NATO air power in Bosnia. In particular, as part of Bill Clinton's platform during his 1992 campaign for President of the United States he promised a \\"lift and strike\\" policy, which included the use of air strikes against Bosnian Serb forces. After the commencement of Operation Deny Flight, US officials, including President Clinton, pushed for an expanded mission.Safire After the Bosnian Serbs rejected the Vance-Owen Plan on 6 May 1993, Clinton and other US officials intensified these calls and they discussed the possibility of using large-scale strikes to coerce the Serbs into acceptance. Ultimately, no such strikes were approved or carried out, but American officials became more open to the idea of using air power for coercion. In June 1993, partly in response to pressure from the United States, the Security Council passed Resolution 836 which authorized NATO forces to provide close air support for UNPROFOR forces upon request. The procedure to request air support was quite difficult, as it involved the \\"dual key\\" of both UN and NATO approval. UN approval required contact with the United Nations headquarters in New York City, making effective coordination nearly impossible given the difference in time zones. The UN approval process was later somewhat streamlined when UN Secretary- General Boutros Boutros-Ghali delegated the authority to authorize air strikes to his special representative in Bosnia, Yasushi Akashi.AFSOUTH Fact Sheet Even after this simplification, however, \\"dual key\\" remained a problem as all requests first had to be processed through the UN Air Operations Center in Kiseljak then pass up the entire UNPROFOR chain of command to Akashi. After Akashi approved the request, he would make a request to NATO commanders who then had to pass orders back down their chain of command and coordinate with forces on the ground.Starr (1993) Due to the difficult \\"dual key\\" authorization measure, NATO did not fulfill its close air support mission for several months. Nonetheless, NATO soon began further planning for a third mission: coercive air strikes as advocated by the United States. NATO first prepared to use Deny Flight to carry out air strikes in August 1993 as part of a plan to end the Siege of Sarajevo. After diplomatic intervention, the plan was not executed, but a precedent was established for the possible use of air strikes. Thus, in February 1994, after the Sarajevo Marketplace Bombing, NATO issued an ultimatum to the Serbs to withdraw all heavy weapons from an exclusion zone around Sarajevo or face bombing. The Bosnian Serbs complied with NATO demands and no strikes were carried out.Beale, p. 22 = Attack on Gora≈æde = In April 1994, Bosnian Serbs forces launched an attack on the UN Safe Area of Gora≈æde. Initially, US Secretary of Defense William Perry told reporters that the United States would \\"not enter the war to stop\\" the Serbs from overrunning Gora≈æde, and other senior officials publicly downplayed the possibility of using air strikes.Gordon (April 5, 1994) Several days into the attack, however, a number of UNPROFOR soldiers were injured, and one was killed by Serb fire. Thus, General Michael Rose, the UNPROFOR Commander, requested NATO strikes under the mandate of UNSCR 836.Gordon (April 11, 1994) On 10 April, in response to the request, two US Air Force F-16s dropped 4 bombs on Serb targets, including a tank and a command post. The next day, two US Marine Corps F/A-18C aircraft strafed additional targets in the area. That same day, General Ratko Mladiƒá, the commander of the Bosnian Serb army, called General Rose and threatened the safety of his forces, saying \\"one more attack and I will shoot down aircraft ‚Äì cannot guarantee safety of UNPROFOR and will attack UNPROFOR and your headquarters\\".Burg, p. 147 Making good on his threat, from 12 April to 14 April, Mladiƒá ordered his forces to surround 150 UNPROFOR peacekeepers, effectively taking them hostage. Mladiƒá then telephoned General Rose and told him \\"that if NATO did not stop its actions, not one UN soldier would leave alive\\".Beale, p. 25 Some of the UNPROFOR hostages were from NATO member states, notably the United Kingdom and France, who pushed for an immediate end to the strikes out of fear for the safety of their personnel. In response to the British and French concerns, NATO temporarily recalled its forces, but on 15 April, in response to increased Serb attacks, aircraft were again deployed to the area.Bucknam, p. 137 As Mladiƒá had promised, the Bosnian Serb army around Gora≈æde attempted to shoot down NATO aircraft. On 15 April 1994, a French Dassault √âtendard IV jet was hit by ground fire while conducting a reconnaissance mission in the area. The jet was damaged, but returned safely to its carrier, the . On 16 April, a British Sea Harrier from the carrier HMS Ark RoyalOperation Deny Flight AFSOUTH Fact sheets was called in by UN forces to strike a tank. After making several unsuccessful passes at the target, the Sea Harrier was targeted by a Bosnian Serb shoulder-launched surface-to-air missile and was subsequently shot down. The pilot ejected safely and was rescued, but his plane was destroyed.Bucknam, p. 138 After the Harrier shootdown, NATO did not carry out any further strikes around Gora≈æde, and on 17 April, Mladiƒá released most of the hostages he had taken. Over the next several days, the Serbs agreed to, and then broke, several ceasefires in the Gora≈æde area. In an effort to secure Gora≈æde and to force the Serbs to honor agreements, NATO and the UN issued an ultimatum for Bosnian Serb forces to cease their attacks and withdraw their forces or face additional air strikes on 22 April. The Serbs complied with the ultimatum, requiring a withdrawal of heavy weapons from a zone and all forces from a zone. Because of the Serb compliance, NATO ceased its operations around Gora≈æde. = Sarajevo = In February 1994 (when air strikes were originally threatened), NATO had created a heavy weapons exclusion zone around Sarajevo, and collected weapons at a number of sites. On 5 August, the VRS seized several weapons from the Illid≈æa Weapons Collection site in clear violation of the exclusion zone agreement. During the seizure, Serb forces injured a Ukrainian UNPROFOR peacekeeper. In response to the attack, the UN once again requested NATO air support. Two U.S. A-10 aircraft repeatedly strafed Serb targets, and the Serbs returned the seized weapons to the collection site.Bucknam, p. 163 On 22 September, UNPROFOR again requested NATO air support in the Sarajevo area after Serb forces attacked a French armored personnel carrier. In response, two British SEPECAT Jaguar aircraft struck near a Serb tank, destroying it. = Banja Luka incident = On 28 February 1994, a NATO Airborne Early Warning aircraft flying over Hungary vectored two US F-16s to an area south of Banja Luka, where six J-21 Jastreb and two J-22 Orao were flying back to their base after bombing the \\"Bratstvo\\" military factory at Novi Travnik, in blatant violation of the non-fly zone. Four Serb aircraft were shot down and another crashed while trying to escape in low-level flight. This marked the first combat mission in NATO's history. = Attack on Bihaƒá, bombing of Udbina and hostages = In October and November 1994, during the Siege of Bihaƒá, the Muslim-Croat Federation launched a large offensive around the town of Bihaƒá, in far northwestern Bosnia. The Serbs soon launched a counterattack, and in support of their operations, launched air strikes with aircraft based at a former JNA military airport in Udbina, south of Bihaƒá, located in the Serbian Krajina. The Serb aircraft dropped napalm and cluster bombs. Although most of the ordnance came from old, unreliable stocks and failed to explode, the attacks were a clear violation of the no-fly zone, and a challenge to NATO.Beale, p. 28 NATO immediately looked for ways to respond, but its forces were not permitted to carry out operations in Croatian airspace, and due to Bihaƒá's proximity to the border, Serb aircraft could attack into Bosnia, then cross back into Croatia before being intercepted. As such, NATO was powerless to stop the incursions.Sudetic In recognition of the situation, the Security Council passed Resolution 958, which allowed NATO aircraft to operate in Croatia. On 21 November, NATO acted under its new authority with a strike on the Udbina airfield. The strike, which involved 39 aircraft, was the largest combat operation in NATO's history up to that time; nonetheless, it was criticized as a \\"pinprick\\" that did little real damage to Serb capabilities, only temporarily disabling runways. The NATO forces deliberately refrained from attacking Serb planes at the airfield, and only targeted runways and anti-aircraft capabilities.\\"NATO, Expanding Bosnia Role, Strikes a Serbian Base in Croatia\\" Following the Udbina strike, NATO continued to launch strikes in the area, and on 23 November, after a NATO reconnaissance plane was illuminated by the radar of a surface-to-air missile (SAM) system, NATO planes attacked SAM sites at Otoka and Dvor with AGM-88 HARM anti-radiation missiles.Bucknam, pp. 182‚Äì83 The Serbs reacted to these strikes by immediately seizing 250 UNPROFOR hostages, and a total of 500 by early December. While the hostages were treated fairly well, some were used as human shields, including three who were forced to lie on the tarmac at the Bosnian Serb airbase in Banja Luka.Beale, p. 29 After the strikes at Otoka and Dvor, Bosnian Serb forces continued to target NATO aircraft with surface-to-air missiles, while advancing against the Bihaƒá enclave. On 24 November, Serb forces fired radar- guided missiles at two British Tornado F3 aircraft. The next day, Serb forces fired on two NATO F-16s.Bucknam, pp. 183‚Äì84 In response to this growing SAM threat, and the UNPROFOR hostages, NATO suspended flights in Bosnian airspace on 2 December. Shortly after the suspension of NATO flights, former US President Jimmy Carter personally negotiated a four-month ceasefire in Bosnia. Although there were some violations of this ceasefire, most of the parties in the conflict heeded it. NATO ordered its planes back in the air, but due to the diminished hostilities, they did not engage in any significant operations for the next several months.Beale, p. 32 The reduced tensions resulting from the Carter ceasefire and the cessation of NATO air operations also led to the release of most of the UNPROFOR hostages over the next several weeks.\\"Serbs Release 55 Canadians But Renew Attack on Enclave\\"\\"Bosnian Serb leader parlays with Carter, promises peace moves\\"\\"Carter Undertakes Bosnia Peace Initiative\\"  Expansion of the air campaign in 1995  An right Although 1994 ended peacefully with the Carter ceasefire, NATO continued planning for new operations. Both NATO and UN officials believed that after the ceasefire expired in March, the fighting would resume. As such, planners at the Balkans Combined Air Operations Center (CAOC) began drawing up plans for new air operations. By late December, the planners developed a plan called \\"Dead Eye\\", designed to eliminate Serb SAM capabilities, so that NATO could regain uncontested air superiority. Over the next several months, the planning for \\"Dead Eye\\" gradually evolved into the plan for Operation Deliberate Force, a massive bombing of Serb targets that was eventually executed in August and September 1995.Bucknam, pp. 204-205 = Bombing of Pale and the hostage crisis = While NATO was planning its new strategy, the ceasefire expired, and, as predicted, fighting resumed. As the fighting gradually widened, Bosnian Muslim forces launched a large-scale offensive in the area of Sarajevo. In response to the attack, the Bosnian Serbs seized heavy weapons from a UN-guarded depot, and began shelling targets.Beale, p. 33 As a retaliation for these actions, the UN commander, Lt. General Rupert Smith requested NATO air strikes. NATO honored the request on 25 and 26 May 1995 by bombing a Serb ammunition dump at Pale. The mission was carried out by USAF F-16s and Spanish Air Force EF-18As Hornet armed with laser-guided bombs.Ripley, p. 23 The Serbs then seized 377 UNPROFOR hostages and used them as human shields for a variety of targets in Bosnia, forcing NATO to end its strikes.Bucknam, p. 215 Facing a second hostage crisis, General Smith and other top UN commanders began shifting strategies. The UN began to redeploy its forces to more defensible locations, so that they would be harder to attack or take hostage. More importantly, Gen. Rose established the UN Rapid Reaction Force, a heavily armed unit with more aggressive rules of engagement, designed to take offensive action if necessary to prevent hostage-taking and enforce peace agreements.Bucknam, p. 216 = Downing of Scott O'Grady = Captains T.O. Hantford, Scott O'Grady, and Bob Wright at a press conference after O'Grady's rescue After the seizure of the 377 hostages, NATO did not carry out further air strikes, but it did continue regular air patrol operations in support of the no-fly zone. On 2 June 1995, Captain Scott O'Grady of the United States Air Force was sent on a routine no- fly zone patrol in his F-16. While on patrol, O'Grady's F-16 was shot down by a Serb SA-6 surface-to-air missile system near Mrkonjiƒá Grad. O'Grady ejected safely, but found himself trapped in Serb-controlled territory. According to many US officials, he may have been deliberately targeted so that the Serbs could take an American hostage.Bucknam, p. 218 After O'Grady was shot down, tensions increased greatly between NATO and the Bosnian Serbs. A number of US commanders called for immediate retaliatory air strikes; however, the Serbs still held the majority of the hostages seized after the bombing of Pale. The threat to the hostages prevented NATO from acting more forcefully, and the Serbs released 121 hostages immediately after the incident in an effort to cool tensions. Nonetheless, the situation remained explosive for the next six days until O'Grady was rescued on 8 June by the 3rd Battalion 8th Marines 2nd Marine Division, ending the calls for immediate offensive action. Shortly thereafter, the Serbs released the remaining hostages.Bucknam, p. 220 As a result of the incident, NATO ordered that all further sorties be accompanied by aircraft designed for suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD).\\"Deny Flight shootdown may put USAF on the offensive\\" On 11 August,Predator/MQ-9 Reaper June 2010, p. 16 a USAF MQ-1 Predator UAV was shot down by Serb antiaircraft fire in the same area,Major Robert C. Nolan II: The Pilotless Air Force?. The Research DepartmentAir Command and Staff College, March 1997, page 6 while another was lost to mechanical failure on 14 August.University of Texas at Arlington = Response to Srebrenica = A month after the O'Grady incident, on 6 July, the VRS launched an offensive against the UN safe- area of Srebrenica. Dutch peacekeepers in the area considered calling for NATO air strikes in response to the attack, but they decided against them because the Serbs were not using heavy weapons, and out of fear of another hostage crisis.Bucknam, pp. 246‚Äì247 On 10 July, as the fighting intensified, the Dutch troops finally requested close air support from NATO, but due to communication problems in the \\"dual key\\" system, the request was not authorized until the next day.Bucknam, p. 248 On 11 July, NATO prepared for a large-scale mission in Srebrenica involving 60 aircraft. At 2:30 PM, the first wave of the assault, two Dutch F-16s, bombed two Serb tanks on the outskirts of the town. Two USAF F-16s were dispatched next to attack an artillery piece, but they failed to find their target. Soon thereafter, Bosnian Serb troops seized several Dutch peacekeepers as hostages and threatened to kill them if NATO did not call off its attacks. The Dutch commander reported this back to his government, and Dutch Defense Minister Joris Voorhoeve immediately telephoned the NATO operations center and ordered an end to the attacks.Bucknam, p. 249 By the end of the day, Srebrenica had fallen to Bosnian Serb forces, who began a brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing that left roughly 7,000 men dead. In the wake of this tragedy, many observers blamed NATO for failing to use its airpower more forcefully. David Rohde, a journalist, later wrote that \\"if NATO close air support had been used earlier ... the 7,079 missing might still be alive today\\".Rohde, p. 354. This feeling that NATO could have prevented thousands of deaths by acting more strongly led to increased planning for Operation Deliberate Force.Bucknam, pp. 250-252 = The London Conference = After the events at Srebrenica, sixteen nations met at the London Conference, which began on 21 July 1995, to consider new options for Bosnia. As a result of the conference, UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali gave General Bernard Janvier, the UN military commander, the authority to request NATO airstrikes without consulting civilian UN officials.Beale, p. 34 The North Atlantic Council, NATO's top political body, and the UN also agreed to use NATO air strikes in response to attacks on any of the other safe areas in Bosnia. The participants at the conference also agreed in principle to the use of large-scale NATO air strikes in response to future acts of Serb aggression.Bucknam, p. 253  Operation Deliberate Force  A US Air Force F-16C Fighting Falcon lands during Operation Deliberate Force On 28 August 1995, a mortar shell slammed into a Sarajevo marketplace, killing 37 people. The United States subsequently blamed Bosnian Serb forces for the attack.Shelling Kills Dozens in Sarajevo; U.S. Urges NATO to Strike Serbs Admiral Leighton Smith, the NATO commander, recommended that NATO launch retaliatory air strikes against the Serbs under the plan established for Operation Deliberate Force.Davis On 30 August 1995, NATO officially launched Operation Deliberate Force with large-scale bombing of Serb targets. This bombing superseded Operation Deny Flight's role for air strikes and close air support, but Deny Flight remained an active operation, still enforcing the no- fly zone over Bosnia.Beale, p. 36 Until 20 September 1995, when Operation Deliberate Force ended, the role played by Deny Flight was minimal. After the suspension of Operation Deliberate Force; however, several further operations were carried out under Deny Flight. On 4 October 1995, Deny Flight aircraft fired HARM missiles after being targeted by surface-to-air missiles. On 8 October 1995, the UN requested close air support near Tuzla. Due to bad weather conditions, NATO aircraft were unable to locate their targets, but on 9 October, in the final combat engagement of Deny Flight, NATO aircraft returned and destroyed a Serb command and control bunker.  Termination of Deny Flight  Adm. Leighton Smith speaks at the ceremony transferring authority to IFOR. After the adoption of the Dayton Accords, a peace agreement for Bosnia, Deny Flight's mission was no longer necessary. On 15 December 1995, the United Nations Security Council officially terminated the resolutions that had authorized the operation, and on 16 December, the North Atlantic Council agreed to terminate Operation Deny Flight, effective 20 December. On 21 December 1995, NATO held a formal closure ceremony for Deny Flight in Vicenza. Many of the forces assigned to Deny Flight were transferred to Operation Decisive Endeavor, to provide support for new IFOR peacekeepers in Bosnia.  Structure of forces  Throughout the course of its operation, Deny Flight was directed by Allied Forces Southern Europe (AFSOUTH) in Naples, under the command of the Commander-in-Chief of Allied Forces Southern Europe. At the beginning of the operation, Admiral Jeremy Boorda served as the commanding officer; he was replaced by Admiral Leighton W. Smith in 1994. Smith and Boorda, however, delegated day to day authority to Allied Air Forces Southern Europe (AIRSOUTH) commanded by Lieutenant General Joseph W. Ashy (until 1994) and then Lieutenant General Michael E. Ryan.Davis, p. 48 While AIRSOUTH maintained day to day command, \\"mission tasking and operational control\\" were delegated to the commander of the NATO 5th Allied Tactical Air Force (5ATAF), initially Lt Gen Antonio RosettiBucnman, p. 63 and later Lt Gen Andrea Fornaserio, both of the Italian Air Force. To simplify the chain of command and coordinate activities, NATO established the Combined Air Operations Center (CAOC) in Vicenza, Italy, which assumed practical day-to-day control of Deny Flight and reported to the commander of the 5ATAF. Each squadron participating in the operation sent a liaison officer to the CAOC to ensure coordination. The initial director of the CAOC was Lt Gen James Chambers of the US Air Force. In November 1994, Major General Hal Hornburg replaced him.Bucknam, p. 198 In practice, most tactical level decisions about Deny Flight were made by the director of the CAOC, and he had the authority to order NATO pilots to engage violators of the no-fly zone. Twelve NATO countries provided forces to Operation Deny Flight: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States. Together, these twelve states contributed a total of 4,500 personnel who were based at air bases in five countries: France, Germany, Greece, Italy, and the United Kingdom and on aircraft carriers in the region. Eight of the participating countries contributed a total of 239 aircraft to the operation, of which nearly half, 108, came from the United States. Within the United States, the US Navy and US Marine Corps provided the most support for the operation, and together they flew 70% of all of the air defense sorties flown during Deny Flight. American aircraft also provided the majority of the airstrikes during the conflict; of the 1,150 bombs dropped by NATO forces, 88% came from American aircraft.  Impact and legacy  Operation Deny Flight lasted for 983 days and included 100,420 sortiesAllied command structures in the new NATO, p. 39 carried out by 4,500 personnel from 12 NATO countries. It included the first combat engagement in NATO history, the Banja Luka incident, and many of NATO's first out of area operations. As such, Deny Flight \\"represented a momentous act, if only in symbolic terms, in that the alliance assumed a combat mission in a nondefensive capacity and out-of-area\\".Papacosma Beyond this symbolic effect, Deny Flight had important consequences for NATO military policy, international relations, and the war in Bosnia. = Effect on military policy = A US Marine Corps F/A-18 prepares for a mission in Bosnia in December 1995. As one of the first major combat tests of NATO airforces, Deny Flight provided several important military lessons. Most importantly, Deny Flight helped to prove the effectiveness, or drive the development of several technologies. For example, during the operation, the F/A-18D Hornet was proven to be a \\"highly resourceful multirole platform\\" for the United States Marine Corps.Slick Deny Flight was also important in the move towards precision-guided munitions, as nearly 70% of the munitions dropped by NATO during the conflict were precision-guided,Simmons versus only 8% during the Gulf War.Boot, p. 347 For the Royal Navy, Deny Flight led to a re-evaluation of the Sea Harrier and a number of upgrades to it. In particular, the Royal Navy added the Paveway II laser-guided bomb to the Harrier, giving it a precision capability, and upgraded electronics aboard the aircraft in response to the necessities of combat in Bosnia.\\"Flexing Joint Muscle: Mixed air groups aboard carriers\\" The lessons of Bosnia also led the Royal Air Force to deploy the Harrier GR7 aboard Royal Navy carriers for future operations in order to deliver more offensive force projection capability.\\"RAF Harriers could add teeth to RN carriers\\" The four NATO aircraft shot down during Operation Deny Flight also forced NATO members to consider new defensive measures for their aircraft, including increased stealth capabilities. Deny Flight also demonstrated the necessity of better communications and integration among forces operating together, and led to some calls for technical training of UN personnel to work with NATO military systems. Finally, the rules of engagement established under Deny Flight also played an important role in shaping the rules of engagement for later NATO operations other than war, including Operation Joint Endeavor, and even NATO operations in Afghanistan.Spence = Effect on the Atlantic relationship = Operation Deny Flight, and other NATO operations during the Bosnian War, resulted in significant tension within NATO and the Atlantic relationship. Deny Flight and other early operations \\"forced the Allies to consider the question of NATO's military responsibility for territory outside of its traditional defense perimeter, and it was one over which they were deeply divided\\".Moore, pp. 28‚Äì29 Disagreements between the United States and its European allies over when and how to use air power \\"made intra-alliance diplomacy more problematic\\" during the period.Foster, p. 15 Many of these problems in the relationship were the result of concerns from European nations who had forces on the ground in UNPROFOR that might be taken hostage. The fact that the United States pushed for air strikes without placing its own forces on the ground in Bosnia greatly exacerbated this problem.Foster, p. 16Burg, pp. 149‚Äì150 Deny Flight also helped set the path for future UN-NATO relations. Throughout the operation, NATO \\"felt the frustration of having its wings clipped by a parallel UN authority\\",Foster, p. 17 while United Nations officials worried about the effect that NATO air strikes would have on the perceived neutrality of the United Nations.Allin, p. 25 Frustration with the \\"dual key\\" procedure of authorization for NATO action also led NATO officers to reject such an arrangement in the future. Admiral Leighton Smith, the commander of NATO's forces during Deny Flight, expressed this sentiment quite bluntly, saying \\"Don't ever have another dual key.\\"Starr (1995) These difficulties in negotiating the UN-NATO relationship during Deny Flight were a major factor in the decision to place later NATO forces in the Balkans under the sole control of the NATO chain of command.Allin, p. 26Wallander, p. 719 While many of these effects on UN-NATO relations were negative, Deny Flight also had positive implications. During the operation, NATO and the UN exchanged liaison officers for the first time in their respective histories, establishing a precedent for military cooperation between the two.Leurdijk The communication and coordination failures during Deny Flight also instilled \\"a desire for mutual understanding and common solutions\\" between the two organizations.Schulte, p. 28 This desire for cooperation was crucial to the establishment of IFOR, and later UN-NATO cooperation in Bosnia and elsewhere. = Effect on the Bosnian War = Deny Flight also played a significant role in shaping the war in Bosnia, although its exact impact is debated. While Richard Holbrooke, the American special envoy for Bosnia, recognized Operation Deliberate Force as \\"a historic development in post-Cold War relations\\" and as a crucial element in ending the war in Bosnia,Holbrooke, p. 102 the actual impact of Deny Flight on the course of the conflict was more muted. None of the air strikes in Deny Flight were on the scale of those in Deliberate Force, and they did not significantly change the balance of power. Notably, however, Deny Flight was successful in that it \\"neutralised the Serbs' advantage in fixed-wing air-power\\".Schulte, p. 21 Deny Flight also paved the way for Operation Deliberate Force. According to Robert E. Hunter, then the US Ambassador to NATO, Deny Flight was crucial to the process of building \\"consensus support for increasingly robust use of airpower over Bosnia\\", which eventually culminated in Operation Deliberate Force.Owen While the material impact of Deny Flight was minimal, it did have a significant political impact. From the very beginning, according to Michael Beale, \\"the operation's implied objective was to demonstrate UN and NATO determination to stabilize the situation in Bosnia so that a peaceful settlement could be achieved\\". Given the many violations of Deny Flight by helicopters, and the frequent failure of coordination between NATO and the UN, it is uncertain whether Deny Flight accomplished this mission. Nonetheless, NATO's limited air strikes under Deny Flight \\"demonstrated its determination to protect United Nations personnel\\" and Bosnian civilians, according to Michael R. Gordon, chief military correspondent for The New York Times. This determination eventually held the key to peace.

Scene of the Crime follows private detective Jack Herriman as he is hired to track down a missing person in and around San Francisco. Herriman is in his mid to late twenties and runs his office from the first floor of an art gallery called Scene of The Crime which is owned and run by his uncle Knut Herriman. In the story Knut is a famous crime scene photographer and uses his reputation to aid Jack at several points throughout the story. Plot Jack Herriman is hired by Alex Jordan on the recommendation of Jack's father's friend Detective Sergeant Paul Reynolds SFPD. Jordan is trying to find her younger sister Maggie who has been missing for nearly a month. Herriman follows Maggie's trail to an open house for a commune called Lunarhouse. Lunarhouse is continuing the ideals of the Summer of Love in modern-day San Francisco, Jack confronts the charismatic leader Joseph Lunar about Maggie, Lunar feigns ignorance but directs Jack to the commune secretary. The secretary informs Jack that Maggie was indeed at the commune for a few weeks but left suddenly with no explanation. She also informs Jack that Maggie had slept with Lunar, but brushed off the detail saying that Lunar slept with everybody. Later, Jack sneaks outside and rifles though the house recycling bin, finding a phone message from Maggie and a contact number that leads to a motel upstate. Reluctant to stake out the motel himself Jack takes along his uncle Knut. When Maggie finally turns up at her motel room she is drunk and being robbed by the guy she came home with. Herriman tries to fight the man but is taken by surprise and winded, Knut then manages to scare the guy off with his camera flash. They take Maggie inside and dump her in the bathtub. When Maggie awakens, Jack interrogates her about her disappearance, and learns that Maggie has lived a wild life due to feeling lost. After talking for a while, Jack drops off Maggie back at her motel and leaves, with the idea of perhaps talking to her again later. It is also hinted that he is attracted to her. However, this all comes to an end the next morning, when Jack receives a phone call that Maggie's body was found shot to death in her motel, probably soon after Jack had dropped her off. Initially believing that Maggie was involved in some sort of blackmail scheme, police later discover that a suitcase filled with $10,000 was left untouched in Maggie's closet, meaning Maggie's death was not money-related, and that something bigger than blackmail was going on. Heartbroken and frustrated, Jack begins yet another round of investigations. In his investigations, Jack learns that the Joseph Lunar's name is actually Virgil. From pictures his Uncle Knut took several years before, Jack discovers that Virgil was the leader of yet another compound similar to Lunar House, and that it burned down. Knut further finds a photograph featuring a young Maggie, her sister Jordan, and their mother standing before a dead body. The body was that of their father, Geoffe, who died in the fire along with 12 other people. Virgil was also reported to have died in the fire, but Jack does not believe this. Jack decides to interrogate survivors of the fire for information. When asking one of the survivors about the fire, the girl revealed that the fire started in the children's dorm, and no one knows who started it. She also seems to harbor hatred towards Virgil, claiming that he ruined her life, and reveals, to Jack's horror, that half of her face is scarred from the burns. As the investigation continues, another twist in the case comes up when Maggie's mother visits Jack at Knut's house (where Jack has been living to try and clean up from his previous drug and alcohol addictions). Maggie's mother sees the photograph of herself standing with her daughters before her dead husband, which had been put on display in Knut's public gallery. The mother reveals that Maggie started the fire, and alludes that she was a pyromaniac. She further explains to Jack how free love at the communals, such as Lunar House, worked. The parents at the communal lived separate from their children. The children were all put together and placed in their own dormitory, where adults would take turns taking shifts to watch the kids. In the meantime, the parents would indulge in Free Love. However, Virgil soon began encouraging the children to participate in sexual activities too. He wanted the children to have experience and to \\"find themselves\\". This escalated to the men of the compound taking sexual advantage of the children. In proof of this, Jack finds a picture of Virgil raping one of the then-young Jordan sisters. Jacks investigation continues, and he finds further secrets, and discovers that the Jordans did not reveal all the details of their family problems to him...

In 975, Saint Wolfgang of Regensburg, then bishop of Regensburg and abbot of St. Emmeram's, voluntarily gave up the position of abbot and severed the connection, making the abbots of St. Emmeram's independent of the bishopric. He was one of the first German bishops to do this, and his example in this was much copied across Germany in the years following. The first independent abbot was Ramwold (later the Blessed Ramwold). Both he and Saint Wolfgang were advocates of the monastic reforms of Gorze. Saint Wolfgang, who was made bishop in 972, ordered that a library be constructed at St. Emmeram shortly after his arrival in Regensburg. An active scriptorium had existed at St. Emmeram in the Carolingian period, but it is not known whether it occupied a special building, and it appears that relatively few manuscripts, of poor quality, were produced there during the early tenth century.Kyle, Joseph D. (1980). The Monastery Library at St. Emmeram (Regensburg). The Journal of Library History (1974-1987), Vol. 15, No. 1 (Winter, 1980), pp. 1-21. University of Texas Press. Over time, some works in the scriptorium were copied by monks, some works were preserved from the Carolingian period, and others were acquired as gifts. The library became well supplied with works by early Christian writers such as Saint Augustine, as well as by ancient writers such as Virgil and Seneca. In addition to works that had an overt religious or inspirational purpose, the library held a large collection of manuscripts used in the monastery school, focusing on subjects such as logic, arithmetic, rhetoric, grammar, and even astronomy and music. By the early eleventh century, the library at St. Emmeram had acquired a reputation for its collection. Neighboring libraries began requesting to borrow books for copying. An eleventh-century librarian at the monastery, Froumund of Tegernsee, referred to the book room as a bibliotheca, a term implying an extensive manuscript collection. The scriptorium of St. Emmeram's in the Early Middle Ages became a significant centre of book production and illumination, the home of works such as the sacramentary of Emperor Henry II (produced between 1002 and 1014) and the Uta Codex (shortly after 1002). In 1295 the counter-king Adolf of Nassau granted the abbey the regalia and made it reichsunmittelbar (i.e., an Imperial abbey, an independent sovereign power subject directly to the emperor). After a decline in its significance during the 16th century the abbey enjoyed a resurgence in the 17th and 18th centuries under abbots Frobenius Forster, Coelestin Steiglehner, Roman Zirngibl and Placidus Heinrich, great scholars, particularly in the natural sciences. Under their leadership the abbey academy came to rival the M√ºnchner Akademie. St. Emmeram's had a long tradition of scientific enquiry dating from the Middle Ages, in witness of which the monastery preserved the astrolabe of William of Hirsau. In 1731, the abbots were raised to the status of Princes of the Empire (Reichsf√ºrsten). Between 1731 and 1733 there followed the magnificent Baroque refurbishment, by the Asam brothers, of the abbey church, which had been repeatedly burnt out and repaired. In 1803, St. Emmeram's, along with the Imperial City of Regensburg, the Bishopric of Regensburg and the two other Imperial Abbeys (Niederm√ºnster and Oberm√ºnster), lost its previous politically independent status to the newly formed Principality of Regensburg, often referred to as the Archbishopric of Regensburg, under the former Prince- Primate Carl Theodor von Dalberg. After the Treaty of Paris of 1810, the entire Principality of Regensburg was transferred to Bavaria. The treasures of St. Emmeram's (for example, the ciborium of Arnulf, now in the Residenz) and its valuable library (including Muspilli, the Codex Aureus of St. Emmeram, and Dialogus de laudibus sanctae crucis) were mostly removed to Munich.  Schloss Thurn und Taxis  In 1812 the monastic buildings were granted to the Princes of Thurn und Taxis, who had St. Emmeram's Abbey converted as a residence known from then on as Schloss Thurn und Taxis, sometimes called Schloss Sankt Emmeram. St. Emmeram Castle (or Abbey) is the largest non-palatial residence in Germany, with 517 rooms and a floor area of 21,460 m2 (231,000 sq. ft). The St. Emmeram Castle with its park in Regensburg's city center covers five hectares. The Thurn und Taxis princely family still uses the castle as its primary residence.  St. Emmeram's Basilica  Painted wooden ceiling depicting Saint Benedict of Nursia. The abbey church became a parish church, to which, on 18 February 1964, Pope Paul VI accorded the status of a basilica minor.Old church layout (JPEG image) The Romanesque basilica with three aisles, three choirs and a west transept is based on an original church building from the second half of the 8th century. Since that time it has been many times partly destroyed and rebuilt. The oldest extant part of the building is the ring crypt under the choir of the northern aisle. The three medieval, carved stone reliefs on the north portal, dating from about 1052, the oldest of their type in Germany, represent Christ, Saint Emmeram and Saint Denis. The west transept has a painted wooden ceiling depicting Saint Benedict of Nursia. The crypt of Saint Wolfgang is beneath the choir of Saint Denis. Next to Saint Denis's altar in the northern aisle is the tomb of Emma, Queen of the East Franks (died 876), let into the wall. The high altar dates from 1669. The tower has six bells. = Notable burials in St. Emmeram's = * Saint Emmeram * Saint Wolfgang * Blessed Ramwold * Emma, Queen of the East Franks (consort of Louis the German) * Blessed Aurelia, anchorite * The Blessed Bishops Wolflek, Gaubald and Tuto * Arnulf of Carinthia, King of the East Franks and Holy Roman Emperor * His son, King Louis the Child * Arnulf the Wicked, Duke of Bavaria * Relics of Saints Maximianus and Calcidonius * Johannes Aventinus, historian of Bavaria *Engelberga, wife of Louis II, Holy Roman Emperor St. Rupert  St. Rupert's church  St. Rupert's church was formerly the parish church of the monastery.

Established in the early part of the 20th century as a planned diamond mining community, Dundo has continued to grow, has its own airport and is now being superseded by a new city, New Dundo. The city is the home of the football club called Grupo Desportivo Sagrada Esperan√ßa, which plays at Est√°dio Quintal√£o. The local museum houses objects collected by social anthropologist, Hermann Baumann.  History  The settlement of Dundo was founded in 1912 after the discovery of diamonds in the Cuango River valley, located in the north-eastern border of Angola where it today adjoins the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Formed as a planned community to support the burgeoning mining operations, Dundo grew after the private investor company, Diamang (formed in 1917) were given the diamond mining concession in the entire region of Lunda, basing their headquarters in the town. Diamang was created under the auspices of Portugal, Angola's then colonial master, with further investment from other European nations. The region was mainly stable under colonial rule, but after independence in 1975, Angola was engulfed in civil war. This led to increased and unplanned population growth in the country's mining towns as people fled the insecurity of the countryside. In 1978 the Angolan government created the province of Lunda Norte and established the nearby town of Lucapa as the provincial capital. Up-until 1980 the mines south-east of Dundo annually produced close to 10 percent of the world's total gem-quality supply of diamonds. The effects of the Angolan civil war (1975-2002) impacted Dundo's diamond mining operations. The rebel forces of UNITA (Uni√£o Nacional para a Independ√™ncia Total de Angola) sought to disrupt the governmental mining companies of Diamang and Endiama, by allowing workers to act as wildcat prospectors. This and the continued violence saw the collapse of Endiama in Dundo with the loss of 18,000 jobs. This resulted in miners turning to UNITA, who either took a cut of their profits or sold the diamonds to fund their resistance to the government, this practice was known as blood diamonds. In 2000, the government changed the provincial capital of Lunda Norte from Lucapa to Dundo due to its 'greater architectural design, size and economic importance'. A new settlement, New Dundo, is being built next to Dundo to cement the cities importance in the region. Notable buildings The city has its own airport, Dundo Airport. Built within the heart of Dundo, it has seen constant expansion throughout the 2010s, with a new terminal constructed in 2012, and an extended main runway in 2014 to allow larger aircraft to access the city. The Dundo Museum, built in the 1950s has been described as having \\"one of the most distinguished collections of ethnographic art from wooden traditional masks and wooden sculptures of the local heterogeneous Chokwe people\\". As well as traditional pieces it holds modern media collections, such as photographic and audio recordings of the indigenous people. Dundo is also home to Sagrada Esperan√ßa Stadium, the Diamond Hotel and Middle Polytechnic Institute.  Sport  The city is home to the football club G.D. Sagrada Esperan√ßa that plays in Girabola, the highest national championship. The team plays its home games in the city stadium, the Est√°dio Quintal√£o.

An inducer functions in two ways; namely: *By disabling repressors. The gene is expressed because an inducer binds to the repressor. The binding of the inducer to the repressor prevents the repressor from binding to the operator. RNA polymerase can then begin to transcribe operon genes. *By binding to activators. Activators generally bind poorly to activator DNA sequences unless an inducer is present. Activator binds to an inducer and the complex binds to the activation sequence and activates target gene. Removing the inducer stops transcription. Because a small inducer molecule is required, the increased expression of the target gene is called induction. The lactose operon is one example of an inducible system. Function Repressor proteins bind to the DNA strand and prevent RNA polymerase from being able to attach to the DNA and synthesize mRNA. Inducers bind to repressors, causing them to change shape and preventing them from binding to DNA. Therefore, they allow transcription, and thus gene expression, to take place. For a gene to be expressed, its DNA sequence must be copied (in a process known as transcription) to make a smaller, mobile molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA), which carries the instructions for making a protein to the site where the protein is manufactured (in a process known as translation). Many different types of proteins can affect the level of gene expression by promoting or preventing transcription. In prokaryotes (such as bacteria), these proteins often act on a portion of DNA known as the operator at the beginning of the gene. The promoter is where RNA polymerase, the enzyme that copies the genetic sequence and synthesizes the mRNA, attaches to the DNA strand. Some genes are modulated by activators, which have the opposite effect on gene expression as repressors. Inducers can also bind to activator proteins, allowing them to bind to the operator DNA where they promote RNA transcription. Ligands that bind to deactivate activator proteins are not, in the technical sense, classified as inducers, since they have the effect of preventing transcription. Examples =lac operon= The inducer in the lac operon is allolactose.Slonczewski, Joan, and John Watkins. Foster. Microbiology: An Evolving Science. New York: W.W. Norton &, 2009. Print. If lactose is present in the medium, then a small amount of it will be converted to allolactose by a few molecules of Œ≤-galactosidase that are present in the cell.Biology Part 2. Berkeley, CA: Berkeley Review, 1995. Print. Allolactose binds to the repressor and decreases the repressor's affinity for the operator site. However, when lactose and glucose are both available in the system, the lac operon is repressed. This is because glucose actively prevents the induction of lacZYA. =ara operon= In the ara operon, arabinose is the inducer. Potency Index inducer or just inducer predictably induce metabolism via a given pathway and are commonly used in prospective clinical drug-drug interaction studies. Strong, moderate, and weak inducers are drugs that decreases the AUC of sensitive index substrates of a given metabolic pathway by ‚â•80%, ‚â•50% to <80%, and ‚â•20% to <50%, respectively.

As \\"Jude Fisher\\", she worked with cast and crew to create six Visual Companion books (2001 to 2014) for the film trilogies The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, Peter Jackson's adaptations of Tolkien. Johnson travelled to North Africa in 2005 to investigate a family legend about the abduction of a family in 1625 from a Cornish church by Barbary pirates, and there met the man who was later that year to become her husband, a Berber tribesman. She now splits her time between the UK and a small town in the Anti-Atlas Mountains. Her first adult mainstream novel was The Tenth Gift, based on the Barbary pirate story. This was followed by a desert epic, set in the Sahara among the Tuareg nomads, The Salt Road. The Sultan's Wife (2012) is set in the 17th-century court of Sultan Moulay Ismail and tells the story of two slaves, an African chieftain's son Nus-Nus and an Anglo-Dutch woman Alys. It also includes an account of the embassy sent from the Moroccan sultan to the court of King Charles II which is documented in John Evelyn's Diary. Her novels are translated and sold in more than 20 countries.. Living part of the year in Morocco, Johnson has made good use of her acquired knowledge of Moroccan culture and history as a background for the novels. In 2016 her 12th century epic, Pillars of Light, set largely inside the walls of Acre during the infamous siege during the Third Crusade was published by the University of Central Lancashire to considerable critical acclaim.

The only smudge on the Trojan record was a mid-season loss to powerful Notre Dame, 7‚Äì6. Drury had 180 yards and three touchdowns against Washington, prompting the crowd at Memorial Coliseum to give him a 10-minute standing ovation. Drury led the team in scoring (76 points) and rushing (1163 yards) and won first-team All-America honors. His 1163 yards marked the first time a USC player surpassed 1,000 yards rushing and stood as a USC record until Mike Garrett eclipsed the mark with 1440 yards during his 1965 Heisman Trophy campaign.

The Delaware Legislative Hall is the state capitol building of Delaware located in the state capital city of Dover on Legislative Avenue that houses the chambers and offices of the Delaware General Assembly. It was designed in the Colonial Revival architecture style by E. William Martin and Norman M. Isham, and built 1931-1933, with wings added 1965-1970, 1994. Architects The building was built of red brick with white wooden trim, designed in the Colonial Revival style by E. William Martin and Norman Isham, under the direction of the State Buildings and Grounds Commission, created by Governor C. Douglass Buck in 1931 during the Great Depression. Initially the commission was awarded to Isham, but his appointment was protested by Alfred Victor Du Pont (on the grounds that Isham was not a resident of Delaware); therefore, local architect Martin was brought in. The influence of Isham is clear when one notes the resemblance of many architectural details to Old Colony House in Newport, Rhode Island, a building which Isham had also restored in 1932. History and structure =Old State House= The original capitol of Delaware was the State House (now known as the Old State House), located on The Green in Dover. It was commissioned originally by Kent County as the Kent County Court House, and was constructed from 1787 to 1791, when it became the State House. Kent County and the state government shared the building until 1873, when the Kent County government relocated. The State House was used until the completion of Legislative Hall. Today, the Old State House has been restored to its 18th- century appearance and is now a museum that includes the site of a former courtroom and the former chambers of the state legislature. The House chamber contains portraits by Thomas Sully of Commodore Jacob Jones and Commodore Thomas Macdonough, of the United States Navy, Delaware heroes who served in the Barbary Wars and the War of 1812. =Legislative Hall= Legislative Hall is opposite the Old State House on the mall. The structure was completed and dedicated in 1933. From 1965 to 1970, flanking north and south wings were added on the sides of the building, giving each member of the Assembly an office in addition to a desk in one of the legislative chambers. The architect George Fletcher Bennet of Dover designed the expansion. Two more wings, providing more office space for legislators and staff as well as hearing and caucus rooms, were added to the east side / rear of the building in 1994. This expansion was designed by the Wilmington-based firm The Architects Studio. In addition, the entire interior of Legislative Hall was renovated in a three- phase project during the next three years during the summers of 1995, 1996 and 1997, including refurbishment of both the House and Senate chambers as well as the lobby, cafeteria, and many offices. This project was designed by the Wilmington firm Moeckel Carbonell Associates. In addition to the chambers of the Delaware House of Representatives and Senate, the Legislative Hall also includes space used by the General Assembly's two nonpartisan staff agencies, the Division of Research and the Office of the Controller General, as well as offices for the Governor and Lieutenant Governor while the General Assembly is in session.

Microsoft bundled Meiryo with Office Mac 2008 as part of the standard install, and it replaces MS Gothic as the default system font for Vista on Japanese systems. It was decided that a new Japanese font was needed, as the current ones (mainly MS Gothic and MS Mincho) are incompatible with Microsoft's ClearType subpixel rendering technology: Meiryo is intended to increase legibility of characters on LCD screens. ClearType has been available in Windows for Latin fonts since the release of Windows XP in October 2001. However, unlike Latin fonts which use the ClearType hinting system for all sizes, the Japanese fonts distributed with Windows included embedded bitmap versions of the fonts in small sizes. Although fonts using only hinted CJK glyphs exist (such as Arial Unicode MS), they had not been distributed with Windows prior to Vista. Meiryo UI Meiryo () compared to Meiryo UI () Meiryo UI is a version that uses condensed kana and reduced line height compared to Meiryo, introduced with Windows 7New Fonts in Windows 7 Beta and is also available as an update in Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. Similar to MS Gothic, the Meiryo UI fonts are bundled with the same Meiryo TTC files of respective weights. Meiryo UI update is also available for Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008.The Meiryo UI font is available for Windows Vista and for Windows Server 2008 Characteristics Meiryo was designed as the enhanced version of Verdana, regarded as a highly readable font. The font's baseline was raised slightly to improve readability when mixing Latin and CJK texts. Meiryo glyphs for kanji and kana also have a height-to-width ratio of 95:100. In previous Japanese fonts distributed with Windows, embedded bitmap glyphs are used whenever font size is set to around 9 points. Unlike previous fonts designed for CJK environments, Meiryo contains no embedded bitmaps. To improve readability under small font sizes without using embedded bitmaps, TrueType hinting language was used for stroke- reduction. Similar technology was used on MingLiU and PMingLiU versions 5.03. Meiryo is developed to comply with JIS X 0213:2004 and can also use the newest set of personal name characters provided by the Japanese Minister of Justice. In addition, it contains OpenType tables for JIS78, JIS83, JIS90 forms for legacy usages. Meiryo supports following OpenType layout features for Cyrillic, Greek, Han Ideographic, Kana, Latin scripts: nalt, afrc, dnom, dlig, frac, fwid, hwid, hkna, ital, jp78, jp83, jp90, numr, qwid, ruby, sinf, zero, smcp, c2sc, liga, sups, twid, vkna, vrt2, vert, kern. Meiryo also contains glyphs not normally accessible without a font editor. These glyphs include circled 00, 51‚Äì100; negative circled 00, 21‚Äì100, a‚Äìz, A‚ÄìZ, kana; (rounded) square-enclosed characters, negative (rounded) square-enclosed characters; 2x2 CJK words. The italic version of Meiryo only provides italicized glyphs for the Latin alphabet as written Japanese is traditionally not italicized. Availability For Microsoft Windows, Meiryo is distributed as two TrueType Collection files, with regular and bold glyphs stored in separate files. Each file also contains an italic variant of the font. As stated earlier, the font is included with the Windows Vista operating system. For Windows XP, the font has become available free of charge by obtaining the Japanese version of Microsoft Visual C# 2008 Express Edition and electing to install the Microsoft Silverlight runtime. Downloading and installing the Japanese ClearType fonts for Windows XP from Microsoft also makes Meiryo available on Windows XP. Meiryo is also distributed with Japanese version of Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac, Microsoft Office 2010 and Microsoft Office 2013.  Authors  The Japanese characters of Meiryo were designed by C&G; Inc. and Eiichi K≈çno, who also redesigned the Johnston font which is now used by London Underground as New Johnston. The Latin characters were designed by Matthew Carter, the British-born creator of the Verdana font, and are visibly similar to characters from Verdana. By having a font designed by a combination of Japanese and Latin font experts, Microsoft strived to create a font in which written English and Japanese could present themselves well together side-by- side on the screen. American Tom Rickner of Ascender Corporation did extensive programming and font hinting for Meiryo. Rickner helped create the first TrueType fonts at Apple and did all the font hinting for Microsoft‚Äôs Georgia and Verdana fonts. According to Rickner, Meiryo is one of the first Japanese fonts created on and for the computer screen and took two years to create and engineer.  About the name  The font name comes from the Japanese word meiry≈ç () , which means \\"clarity\\", referring to ClearType making text written in Meiryo appear clearer on the screen. The Japanese spelling is taken from the English pronunciation ; the actual Japanese spelling in katakana is . According to Eiichi K≈çno, the name was chosen for its exotic-sounding pronunciation and its compactness.ITmedia NewsÔºö2Âπ¥„Åå„Åã„Çä„ÅÆÊñ∞Êó•Êú¨Ë™û„Éï„Ç©„É≥„Éà„Äå„É°„Ç§„É™„Ç™„Äç Although it is a proportional font, the font name does not contain a 'P' to indicate this in Windows font lists, as with MS P Gothic() and MS P Minch≈ç(). Problems * At small sizes, dimensions of printed kanji characters are not even. However, small-size kanji rendering has been traditionally problematic involving trade-offs in legibility and other factors like spacing. That was fixed in Meiryo version 6 included with Windows 7.Windows 7‰∏≠ÁöÑÊñ∞Â≠ó‰Ωì * Sized between 11 and 13 points (96 dpi), glyphs have inconsistent stroke weight without the activation of ClearType. Sometimes, especially on the Mac OS X and Linux platforms, these problems can sometimes be avoided by displaying fonts in semi-bold or bold as their normal (lightest) font weight. * At small sizes, stroke reduction is not consistent with the methods used by other fonts such as MS Gothic. * Because of its compliance with Japanese Industrial Standard for encoding JIS X 0213:2004, variant characters have different stroke layouts from the ones used in older MS Gothic and other conventional fonts. To use older characters in a web page, for example, Meiryo needs to be activated manually.Âä†Ëó§„Åï„Çì: „É°„Ç§„É™„Ç™(Meiryo)„Å®Ôº≠Ôº≥ ÊòéÊúù„ÄÅÔº≠Ôº≥ „Ç¥„Ç∑„ÉÉ„ÇØ„ÄÅWindows Vista - Fonts update (MingLiU and PMingLiU version 5.03 follow the standards set by Taiwan's Ministry of Education and the reference rendering used in Unicode documents, which also causes similar dissatisfaction among users. On the other hand, MS Gothic, MS PGothic, MS UI Gothic, MS Mincho, MS PMincho can be updated to version 5.00, which include JIS X 0213:2004 support to match the characters used in Meiryo, and also incorporated JIS90 Forms OpenType Layout Table for users preferring the old glyphs.Microsoft Windows Vista:Windows XP „Åä„Çà„Å≥ Windows Server 2003 Âêë„ÅëJIS2004 ÂØæÂøú MS „Ç¥„Ç∑„ÉÉ„ÇØ & MS ÊòéÊúù„Éï„Ç©„É≥„Éà„Éë„ÉÉ„Ç±„Éº„Ç∏„Å´„Å§„ÅÑ„Å¶ For Vista users, Microsoft also offered an update to make MS Gothic and MS Mincho font families to use characters in JIS X 0208-1990.Microsoft Windows Vista: Windows Vista „Åä„Çà„Å≥ Windows Server 2008 Âêë„Åë MS „Ç¥„Ç∑„ÉÉ„ÇØ„ÉªÊòéÊúù„Éï„Ç©„É≥„Éà„Éë„ÉÉ„Ç±„Éº„Ç∏„Å´„Å§„ÅÑ„Å¶) * When italicized, only Latin characters are slanted, not CJK characters and kana. CJK characters use other methods of emphasis or quotation indication; thus differing from, for example, the typefaces of Romance languages (unrelated distinctions between cursive and non-cursive and other traditional writing styles do exist). Nowadays, however, italicization is used in advertising but usually combined with other, common forms of emphasis, such as bold weight, exclamation marks, and, in Japanese, katakana use. Academic texts, for example, do not use italicized CJK characters as opposed to those in non-CJK languages, e.g. in traditionally Latin-1 encoded European languages that use italics for things like inline quotations. Since these traditions of italicization do not exist in CJK, the decisions made for Meiryo is based on the existing general use. According to Microsoft, Meiryo uses a customized version of Verdana for italics instead of the generic slanting method.Fonts (Segoe UI) Although the font includes an OpenType table for italics, this feature only substitutes characters already included in the font, instead of applying transformation effects to the affected characters. Since Meiryo only has italic characters for Latin, Greek, Coptic, and Cyrillic characters, it is an indication that Windows Vista does not use emulated italic effects if it uses a substitute font for italic effect but cannot find the correct glyph in the italic font. Similarly, most of the OpenType tables used in the font (except kern) only work if substitute glyphs are available inside the font. * Characters for triple and quadruple dash box-drawing characters all have six dashes. Furthermore, all horizontal dash box-drawing characters have three dashes when using OpenType's half-width features.

Early life Insignia of Baronet Hesketh succeeded in the barony (and baronetcy) on 6 October 1955, aged four, when his father, Frederick Fermor-Hesketh, 2nd Baron Hesketh, died aged 39. He was educated at Ampleforth College, Yorkshire. He went on to work for Dean Witter Inc in San Francisco before returning to manage his family's businesses. Family Hesketh married Hon. Claire Georgina Watson, daughter of Joseph Rupert Eric Robert Watson, 3rd Baron Manton and Mary Elizabeth Hallinan, on 21 May 1977 and has three children: * Hon. Flora Mary Fermor-Hesketh (born 1981) * Hon. Sophia Christian Fermor- Hesketh (born 1984)Tatler http://www.tatler.com/the-tatler-list/h/sophia- hesketh * Hon. Frederick Hatton Fermor-Hesketh (born 13 October 1988) Lord Hesketh's children use the surname Hesketh day-to-day. In 2006, Lord Hesketh sold the family seat, Easton Neston, at Towcester, Northamptonshire‚Äîthe only surviving complete house by the English baroque architect Nicholas Hawksmoor‚Äîtogether with the estate, the furnishings of the house and family portraits. Political career Hesketh automatically became a member of the House of Lords but took no active part in politics until he met Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher after the Irish Republican Army's bomb attack on her in Brighton on 12 October 1984. Thatcher visited Easton Neston and in conversation, Hesketh explained that he did not occupy his seat in the House of Lords. He later explained, \\"Mrs Thatcher asked me if I served on a regular basis in the House, and when I told her no, she said, 'You must. It's your duty, and I expect you to be there.'\\" From that point Hesketh worked under Thatcher, whom he described as \\"the most outstanding person I ever worked with\\" and held the office of Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment between 1989 and 1990 and was Minister of State in the Department of Trade and Industry between 1990 and 1991. On 22 May of that year, he became Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms (Government Chief Whip in the House of Lords) under the next Prime Minister, John Major, a position he kept until 16 September 1993. During his period in office as Chief Whip he helped secure the Local Government Finance Act 1992, which introduced council taxes, and the European Communities (Amendment) Act 1993,European Communities (Amendment) Act 1993 Office of Public Sector Information which ratified the Maastricht Treaty. Hesketh lost his seat in the House of Lords in 1999, when the House of Lords Act 1999 removed all but 92 hereditary peers. He was not one of the 92 who were elected to keep their seats. In 2003, he became Treasurer of the Conservative Party, resigning in 2006 due to his own financial difficulties, and was formerly a board member of The Conservative Party Foundation. On 10 October 2011, Lord Hesketh defected to the UK Independence Party, in response to Prime Minister David Cameron ruling out a referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. During the years 2011/12 Lord Hesketh donated approximately ¬£31,000 to the UK Independence Party. Business Known for his love of motor racing, Lord Hesketh founded Hesketh Racing in 1972, best known for competing in Formula One from 1973 to 1978. The team was famous for its flamboyant and patriotic approach to the sport and for refusing sponsorship. Between 1973 and 1975 the team had some success with the English driver James Hunt, including winning the 1975 Dutch Grand Prix. He later was president of the British Racing Drivers' Club, from 1993 to 2000. Hesketh formed Hesketh Motorcycles plc. In 1982 a modern purpose built factory was set up to manufacture the Hesketh V1000 motorcycles in Daventry. However, there were numerous problems. The bikes were heavy, made worse by a high riding style; and unreliable, with numerous manufacturing problems adding to an overheating rear cylinder due to lack of air flow. The resultant bad press combined on top of an under- developed bike, lack of cash and a collapsing market meant that after the production of 139 bikes, the company went into receivership. The Triumph Motorcycles co-operative looked at buying the rights to the machine, as they lacked a new model beyond the aged Triumph Bonneville. A V1000 machine even appeared with a Triumph badge on its tank, but Triumph also lacked funding to buy and develop the machine. In 1983, Lord Hesketh formed a new company called Hesleydon Ltd to manufacture a revamped V1000 with a full fairing, called the Vampire. However, although the company had produced a motorcycle with export potential in mind, the Vampire retained too many of the V1000's faults and only 40 were produced before the company closed again in 1984. In 1994 Hesketh helped set up British Mediterranean Airways (BMED). He also became chairman of the new airline ‚Äì a role in which he continued until early 2007, when BMED was purchased for ¬£30 million by UK Airline BMI. He subsequently served as an \\"independent director\\" of Air Astana, the national carrier of Kazakhstan.Air Astana, \\"Board of Directors\\" Retrieved 11 November 2010. Hesketh joined the board of Babcock International Group on 6 October 1993, becoming non-executive Deputy chairman on 26 April 1996. He was forced to resign in November 2010 after a comment regarding the Royal Navy's new s to the Daily Telegraph newspaper, in which he was reported as saying the project would make the country a \\"laughing stock\\". Honours and arms In 1997, Hesketh was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE).

Many Redskins' fans and analysts consider Jacoby the greatest Redskins player not currently inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. College career Jacoby started off as an offensive tackle for the University of Louisville from 1978 to 1980. He was a three-year letterman, and the team co-captain in his senior season. Jacoby was inducted into Louisville's Athletic Hall of Fame in 2004.https://gocards.com/honors/athletics-hall-of-fame/joe-jacoby/56 Still, the team achieved limited success with Jacoby, posting a 16-16 overall record in his three seasons, with only one season with a winning record and no Bowl game appearances.https://www.sports- reference.com/cfb/schools/louisville/index.html Professional career After college, Jacoby went undrafted. He signed a free agent contract with the Washington Redskins in 1981, where he embarked on an enviable career‚Äîfour Super Bowl appearances, of which his team won three (XVII in 1983, XXII in 1988, and XXVI in 1992), plus four consecutive Pro Bowl selections from 1983 to 1986. Along with Jeff Bostic, Mark May, George Starke and Russ Grimm, Jacoby was a founding member of the Redskins' renowned \\"Hogs\\" offensive line of the 1980s and early 1990s (deemed one of the best front fives of NFL history), which was a mainstay of the Redskins' glory years during the first Joe Gibbs era. Jacoby was the lead blocker on John Riggins' famous touchdown run which ensured the Redskins' Super Bowl XVII win over the Dolphins in 1983. In that game, the Redskins set a Super Bowl record for most rushing yards with 276. The Hogs helped the Redskins break that record five years later in Super Bowl XXII, in which Washington trampled over the Denver Broncos with 280 rushing yards en route to the second of the Redskins' three championships.

(1869‚Äì1947) was an American educator. Ëî£ÂøóÊæÑÂíå‰øùÁæÖ¬∑Â≠üÁ•ø Biography He was born at North Madison, Indiana. He graduated at Franklin College, Franklin, Indiana in 1890, studied at the University of Heidelberg and took his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1897. He became professor at Columbia in 1899, his research involving education in its historic aspect. As well as Columbia, he lectured at Yale University and the University of California. During 1912-1913, he reported on the condition of education in the Philippines. Professor Monroe received the honorary degree of LL.D. from the University of Peking in 1913. Paul Monroe had a significant impact on the development of education in China and made a dozen trips there in the 1920s and 1930s. He contributed much to educational interaction between China and the United States, and his impact on Chinese students at Columbia who later became leading educators in China, such as Guo Bingwen, Tao Xingzhi, Chen Heqin, Jiang Menglin, Wang Tso-Yan (Zhuoran) and Zhang Boling, was considerable. These students, who enrolled at Teachers College at Columbia, were influenced by the theoretical educational innovations of John Dewey, but Paul Monroe exerted a practical influence on their ideas about curricular implementation. He advanced practical methods for democratizing Chinese education, which extended to the development of the ‚Äú6-3-3‚Äù educational program. Creativity and the development of self-confidence were major educational goals for Monroe. As he said: ‚ÄúThe essence of democracy is that all people, no matter whether intelligent or backward, should have the equal chance of full development.‚Äù Paul Monroe was invited and went to China to research and promote education in September, 1921. During the three months he visited more than 200 schools and institutions in 9 provinces, and made more than 60 speeches. In December China Education Improvement Society was founded, he was elected as an honorary member of the council along with several other figures including John Dewey, and his student T'ao Hsing-chih was elected as secretary-general, and through the society the educationists promoted the forming of modern educational system in China. Later he helped to establish Sino-American joint engineering college in Shanghai jointly founded by National Southeastern University (later renamed National Central University and then Nanking University), Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which soon ceased due to the wars outbroken in the area. In 1932, Monroe led an expedition of educators from the International Education Institute to Iraq, where they visited schools in the Baghdad and Basra areas before hosting a conference on education in the nation's capital and publishing their findings in the Monroe Report to the Government of Iraq. Monroe was accompanied by his doctoral student Muhammad Fadil al-Jamali, who contributed a chapter from his dissertation, New Iraq, to the Monroe Report, and also acted as interpreter for the expedition. His contributions to the study of education also gave Dr. Monroe an international reputation, and his textbooks have helped to give the subject a position of great importance in the United States.

In December 2005 bus drivers in Tehran were refusing to take passengers' fares, as a protest called by both Osanloo and the Workers' Syndicate. He and his colleagues could build up again their syndicate (union) after 24 years. In June 2005 (13 Khordad 1384) with great effort and resistance. This led to the arrest of several union activists on December 22, including Osanloo. He was imprisoned more than seven months, and suffered torture. Tehran bus workers were due to strike on 28 January 2006 calling for his release and other demands. However, early that morning, hundreds of union activists were arrested as were the families of many of the workers. The Scottish Socialist Party tabled a motion calling for his release before the Scottish Parliament. He was released on bail in July/August 2006 after being kept in solitary confinement for months. After that, he continued his duty with co workers to reestablish their rights. According to eyewitness accounts, Osanloo was arrested for a second time on November 19, 2006 under suspicious circumstances, along with Ebrahim Madadi, the vice-president of Workers' Syndicate. They were beaten by a group of armed militia and were taken away after shots were fired into the air.

They sent him to Rajaee Shahr jail, because he tried help to guard workers in Evin prison to organise their union, and they back paid their money of their bosses. In August 2010, he was sentenced to another year in prison after conviction of a new charge of \\"spreading propaganda against the system.\\" On 2 June 2011, Ossanlu‚Äôs wife stated that he had been granted a four-day medical leave for medical treatment.Mansour Ossanlu‚Äôs Temporary Freedom in Iran, June 6, 2011 Osanloo is an instructor of online, Persian-language courses on labor rights and labor organizing at Tavaana: E-Learning Institute for Iranian Civil Society.

A side-story and a derivative work of Masami Kurumada's Saint Seiya, it first started being serialized in the January 2003 issue of the monthly magazine Champion Red and was later compiled into 20 volumes by Akita Shoten, with the first being published on June 19, 2003. The story is set seven years before the events of the original Saint Seiya manga and six years after the death of the Sagittarius Gold Saint Aiolos, the brother of Episode.G's main character. It takes place in a fictional universe where the Greek gods cyclically reincarnate on Earth, often waging war on each other for dominance, and depicts the battle of the Gold Saints, warriors with superhuman powers who fight for Peace and Justice in the name of the Goddess Athena, to protect the Earth from the recently awakened Titan gods. Although no English version of Saint Seiya Episode.G exists, it has been translated into various other languages by publishers from around the world, where it was well received, but not without controversy regarding its differences to Saint Seiya. In Brazil, it was published by Conrad Editora; by Panini Comics in Italy, Germany and France; Gl√©nat in Spain; Editorial Ivrea in Argentina; Editorial Kamite in Mexico; and by Chuang Yi in Singapore. In December 2013, Megumu Okada announced via Twitter that he was working on a sequel manga titled . Serialization began on April 5, 2014, in the bimonthly Champion Red Ichigo magazine, and continued in the web magazine Champion Cross. The last chapter was published on August 27, 2019, and the series was compiled into 16 volumes. A second sequel titled began being serialized on January 28, 2020, also in Champion Cross. Plot The story of Saint Seiya Episode.G is set seven years before the events of Masami Kurumada's Saint Seiya, in the same fictional world in which the Greek gods cyclically reincarnate to dispute dominion of Earth. The story revolves around the Saints of Athena, humans with superhuman powers who are devoted to the Goddess of War Athena, and whose duty is to protect the world from evil. The protagonist is the Leo Gold Saint Aiolia, who is mistrusted by the rest of the Saints because of the seemingly traitorous actions of his brother Aiolos in the past. In turn, he holds a grudge against the Saints as a whole, and against the elite order of the Gold Saints in particular. While the Pope, the leader of the Saints, sends Aiolia on mission after mission to prove his loyalty, evil forces manifest that threaten to destroy Sanctuary, the home of the Saints. A modern-day Titanomachy begins as the Titans, ancient gods with a desire for revenge on the Olympian gods, attack Sanctuary to retrieve the \\"Megas Drepanon\\", the weapon into which Zeus had sealed their King, Kronos, in the age of mythology. Their first assault is thwarted by Aiolia, who subsequently gains the attention of the Titans as the \\"man of the evil omen\\" who is destined to free their King. With the Titans once again roaming the Earth, ancient monsters are also resurrected worldwide and the Saints have to contain them. Meanwhile, the Titans gather their forces to strike at Sanctuary a second time. In the course of their next assault, Kronos is inadvertently released from Zeus's lightning seal by Aiolia's own lightning-based technique, but the god appears to be amnesiac. The Titans determine that it was Aiolia's attack that was responsible for this condition and that the Leo Saint might hold the means to fix it as well. They retreat to their base at the Time Labyrinth and kidnap Aiolia's servant Lithos to lure him there. Aiolia does not hesitate to go to Lithos's aid and, together with five other Gold Saints, initiates a series of battles in which the Titans fall one by one. Throughout these battles, the primordial god Pontos, who first released the Titans from their imprisonment in Tartarus and initially claimed that he wished to help Kronos, reveals his true intentions, stating that he only revived the Titans as part of a larger plan and has been playing them in order to awaken his true mistress, Gaia. He means to help her take control of the Earth, destroying gods and humans alike in the process. Pontos's plan ultimately fails, as after fighting Aiolia Kronos comes to appreciate the worth of humans. The Titan King robs Gaia of his power, offering it to Hades instead so that the Saints of Athena and his followers will be spared from death. Production In the author commentary page published with the first volume, Megumu Okada explained that he had concerns about taking on the project because he had never written anything that was related to a pre- existing original work and because Saint Seiya was such a renowned piece. Original author Masami Kurumada left him free to write the story that would act as a prequel to the original manga. This resulted in a manga that is, visually, substantially different from its predecessor: character designs are slim and androgynous and details are enhanced to an extreme. Media =Manga= The first images of the manga appeared in the Champion Red magazine issue of January 2003, published on November 19, 2002, along with posters by and an interview with Masami Kurumada. The first chapter was then released on the following February issue of this monthly magazine, published on December 19, 2002, and the first volume (tank≈çbon) published on June 19, 2003, under Akita Shoten's Champion Red Comics imprint. Releases arrested in 2009, as author Megumu Okada put the manga on hiatus to dedicate himself to other projects following an unspecified dispute with the publisher, and resumed in Champion Red Ichigo's April 2011 issue, with the release of a new chapter, as well as a compilation of past chapters that had not been grouped in volume format yet (chapters 74‚Äì76) called \\"Volume 17.5\\". The manga entered a second hiatus after chapter 83 was published in the October 2011 issue of Champion Red Ichigo and, after the publisher announced that the manga would end at volume 20, resumed in the May 2013 issue. The final chapter was released on June 19, 2013; the final volume was published on August 8, 2013. Saint Seiya Episode.G has yet to be licensed in English, but it has been published in several countries outside Japan: in Brazil, by Conrad Editora; by Panini Comics in Italy, Germany and France; Gl√©nat in Spain; Editorial Ivrea in Argentina; Editorial Kamite in Mexico; and by Chuang Yi in Singapore. Special chapters The volumes usually contain short special chapters (gaiden), most of which in color, that tell little side-stories or highlight moments from previous chapters. Some have little relevance to the overall plot of Episode.G, with characters that play little part in the main story but who are well known to readers of Saint Seiya, while others explore the personality or the past of important characters and detail minor events pertaining to the plot. Champion Red serialized a short side-story along with the regular chapters between October 2007 and January 2008. It takes place a few years before the main plot and details the exploits of Sagittarius Aiolos in Egypt, revealing some plot points that influence the main story. A younger Aiolia and Galan also appear. This side-story appears compiled in a special volume called \\"Volume 0: , released on May 20, 2008, which also contains an encyclopedia with information on all the Episode.G manga published up to that date. Special editions In Japan, there are two versions of the Saint Seiya Episode.G volumes. One is the normal version and the other is a limited edition. The limited edition features different covers and includes various goodies packaged with the comic books. These goodies include postcards, pins, a coin key holder, a day planner, tarot cards, a T-shirt, puzzles, calendars, a pass case and a key chain. A bust figure of the protagonist, Leo Aiolia, has also been released. =Drama CDs= Two drama CDs were recorded for Episode.G. One was released with the Champion Red issue of April 2007 and the other along with the limited edition of volume 11. These CDs reproduce the events of several chapters with only slight modifications that reduce the cast: Aiolia's battle against the Giant in volume 1, Pontos's test of Aiolia through Galan from volume 1, and Camus's and Aiolia's fight against Okeanos from volumes 9 and 10. Voice actors include: Hiro Shimono as Leo Aiolia, Hikaru Midorikawa as Aquarius Camus, K≈çji Yusa as Galan, Chiwa Sait≈ç as Lithos, K≈çsuke Okano as Okeanos and Hiroki Yasumoto as Pontos. =Sequels= Saint Seiya Episode.G: Assassin In December 2013, Megumu Okada announced via Twitter that he was working on a sequel manga titled Saint Seiya Episode.G: Assassin. The first chapter was published on April 5, 2014, in the 43rd issue of the bimonthly magazine Champion Red Ichigo, after a short prologue was released in the Champion Red issue of February 2014 commemorating the 40 year anniversary of Masami Kurumada's career. After Champion Red Ichigo ceased publication in August 2014, the series was continued in Akita Shoten's web magazine Champion Cross, later renamed Manga Cross. With the change in venue, the chapters started being published entirely in colour. The final chapter was published on August 27, 2019. The chapters were compiled into 16 volumes, some of which include bonus chapters. The first volume was published on October 20, 2014, and the last on December 20, 2019. A special epilogue was published in Champion RED's March 2020 issue. Episode.G: Assassin includes original characters, characters from the first Saint Seiya manga and also from its sequel, Saint Seiya: Next Dimension. Saint Seiya Episode.G: Requiem A second sequel, the conclusion of the Episode.G series, titled Saint Seiya Episode.G: Requiem, began serialization on January 28, 2020, in the online manga magazine Manga Cross. Reception The manga was well received in France, where volumes 7, 8 and 9 sold thirty-one thousand copies each in 2006. Sales in Italy were equally successful, having been featured on multiple occasions in Planet Manga's Top 10 sales charts between June 2005 and February 2010. French critic Thomas Berthelon, writing for Actua BD, makes a note on the unoriginality of the plot. While the manga is full of references to Saint Seiya, the story is based on the same known schemes and the characters are too similar to the protagonists of the original series. The critic writing for Manga-News also notes that the exchanges between Saints and Titans can become repetitive. Meanwhile, for Brazilian critic Pedro Hunter of Omelete, Episode.G sets itself apart from the usual sh≈çnen manga by not featuring only endless battles and undeveloped storylines. He finds the way Okada depicts his characters as an integrating part of the real world particularly interesting and highlights the inclusion of real life events like the Three Mile Island accident into the plot. The critic writing for Manga-News regrets that the manga focuses on the youth of the known Gold Saints from Kurumada's work. This reviewer says that it takes away all suspense from the story, since the fates of the main characters are known from the start to any who have read Saint Seiya beforehand, and that the magnitude of the accomplishments of these characters in Episode.G is inconsistent with what was seen in the original series. In a later review, however, it is also noted that Episode.G retains the spirit of the original series, successfully portraying the emotions present in battles between warriors who can respect their opponents and admire their willingness to give their lives for what they believe is right. Generally praised as \\"impressive\\" is Okada's graphical skill, his use of composition and textures which enhance the divine aspects of the characters, although critics also note that the heavy amount of detail in a black and white manga often interferes with readability. Berthelon considers such difficulty reminiscent of passages from Kaori Yuki's manga Angel Sanctuary and recommends the manga for its \\"astonishing\\" artwork.

It is one of the two unincorporated areas in Volusia County along the coast that does not have a condominium or hotel (the other being Highbridge); instead, the area uses beachfront homes. Tom Wilbur Bay is a body of water that only has docks on the east side of the bay. The major roads of the area are State Road 441 and CR 4075; both roads border a body of water, Peninsula Drive on the west and South Atlantic Avenue on the east. History During the winter of 1911 Mr. J. W. Wilbur, a large real estate dealer of Boston, Mass. made an extensive tour of the east and west coasts of Florida in search of a location for a winter home for himself and family. He traveled up and down the coast from Jacksonville to Key West and at last found the present location of Wilbur-By-The-Sea. With the river on one side, and ocean on the other, and only 800 feet between the two, he came to the conclusion he had found the spot he was looking for. The high, dry land provided healthful conditions. The river offered boating and fishing, and the broad sandy beach, the surf bathing. Here were all the factors necessary to make up an ideal winter resort. He bought. On his return north he found many of his friends and acquaintances anxious to join him and build winter homes themselves. It was then he conceived the idea of a new winter colony on the east coast. More land was purchased; horses, teams, construction crews and carpenters were hurriedly collected together. Carloads of lumber, brick, and furniture were shipped, and in December 1912, Mr. Wilbur, together with his engineers, and friends started south. Work was started as soon as the party arrived, The dirt flew. Large gangs of men followed in the tracks of the surveyors, building roads and following them came the carpenters, masons, plumbers, etc. constructing the bungalows. In less than two months' time shell roads had been laid out, and cottages built, a water plant installed, and a steam boat wharf built on the river side. Parks, tennis courts and bungalows had taken the place of the wilderness of two months previous. As one tourist said, \\"It reminds me of the Arabian Nights story when houses were built in a night.\\" The new town had started. The opening of a wide boulevard with a cement approach, from the beach to the river brought hundreds of tourists in their autos, through this section, and many of them purchased. Mr..Wilbur soon found that he would not have enough land to go around, so he bought more land until he now has between 500 and 600 acres of the finest land on the east coast of Florida. It was in this way that Wilbur-By-The-Sea was started. Great care has been exercised in disposing of the lots and only a good class of people will be received at Wilbur-By-The-Sea. Excellent locations are to be had along the ocean and river fronts, where lots have been carefully laid out and restricted. Bungalows can be built here about 1-3 cheaper than in the north or west, A boat line runs between Daytona and Wilbur-By-The-Sea, making two trips daily. Autos and carriages may be hired at a reasonable cost which enables you to explore the beautiful country roads, or ride along the wide sandy beach. Geography Wilbur-By-The-Sea is located at , between Daytona Beach Shores and Ponce Inlet. The area of this place is a four-mile circumference around the unincorporated area limit. It is about seven miles south of Daytona, and two and one half miles from the city of Port Orange. A long bridge over the Halifax River at Port Orange connects \\"Wilbur-By-The-Sea\\" with the mainland. At \\"Wilbur-By-The-Sea\\" is the narrowest point on the entire peninsula, it being only 800 feet from Ocean to River; the land here rises from 20 to 30 feet above the River and Ocean, and is considerably higher than the mainland. *To the north-Daytona Beach Shores *thumbTo the south-Ponce Inlet *To the east-Atlantic Ocean *To the west-Port Orange See also *Atlantic Ocean *Halifax River References Category:Unincorporated communities in Volusia County, Florida Category:Unincorporated communities in Florida Category:Populated coastal places in Florida on the Atlantic Ocean Category:Beaches of Volusia County, Florida Category:Beaches of Florida ","title":"Wilbur-By-The-Sea, Florida"},{"id":"3631639","text":"New Manchester (formerly Fairview and Pughtown) is an unincorporated community in Hancock County, West Virginia.

The hotel was originally built by four British entrepreneurs in 1864. Its name derives from the stretch of lawn which it faces, known as the Galle Face Green. It began as a Dutch villa called Galle Face House. Land for the hotel's expansion was purchased between 1870 and 1894. In 1894, architect Edward Skinner completed the design of the hotel's current south wing, and the property has remained largely unchanged until the present day, though with many extensive restorations. Mignonne Fernando and The Jetliners regularly entertained guests at the Coconut Grove, the night club attached to the hotel. The venue was even popularised in a song. Radio Ceylon recorded music programmes from the Coconut Grove as well as the Galle Face Hotel itself, presented by some of the popular Radio Ceylon announcers in the 1950s and 1960s, such as Livy Wijemanne and Vernon Corea.

In 1908, the Northwestern Elevated Railroad extended service north from Wilson station and into Evanston using the right of way of the Milwaukee Road. The Northwestern Elevated took over the operation of passenger services from the Milwaukee Road, rebuilt the stations along the line, and added new stations including one at Howard Avenue (now Howard Street). The station was rebuilt in 1921 when the line through the station was elevated onto an embankment. An escalator was added in 1964. Between 2006 and 2009 the station was rebuilt. A new station house was constructed on Paulina Street providing an accessible path between the station platforms and the multi-story parking garage and bus terminal to the west of the station. The platforms and canopies were rebuilt, and the former main entrance on Howard Street entrance was renovated to be used as an auxiliary entrance to the new station.

The Gardens was located on the west side of Detroit at the southeast corner of the Joy Road and Southfield Freeway intersection close to what was then termed \\"some of the most affluent neighborhoods in the City of Detroit.\\" The Gardens were home to some notable individuals. Automobile giant John DeLorean, TV judge Greg Mathis, and classic Motown group The Spinners all called Herman Gardens home. After problems had occurred in the buildings from the illegal drug trade in the early 1980s, the Detroit Housing Commission (DHC) applied for HOPE VI funds under the 1996 Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA), it intended to reduce the number of public housing units from 1,573 to 672. By August 1996, HUD had approved the demolition of 685 units using other (non-HOPE VI) funds, and the HOPE VI application proposed demolishing another 538 units. The application proposed renovating 274 of those existing units and building 222 new houses, along with 92 single-family houses and 84 duplexes, for a total of 672 units at the revitalized site.

The remaining 66 units were built as single-family homes on 45 and 65-foot lots. Also included in the redevelopment of the site was the construction of the Detroit/NFL Boys and Girls Club Youth Education Town, an educational and recreation center for children, which was opened in May 2007.

The first part of the essay, \\"The Portrait of the Antisemite\\", was published in December 1945 in Les Temps modernes. The full text was then published in 1946. The essay deals with antisemitism and how Jews react to it. More broadly, the book tries to explain the etiology of hate by analyzing antisemitic hate. According to Sartre, antisemitism (and hate more broadly) is, among other things, a way by which the middle class lay claim to the nation in which they reside, and an oversimplified conception of the world in which the antisemite sees \\"not a conflict of interests but the damage an evil power causes society.\\" Definition Sartre begins by defining antisemitism as characterized by certain opinions: attributing \\"all or part of his own misfortunes and those of his country to the presence of Jewish elements in the community, ... proposes to remedy this state of affairs by depriving the Jews of certain of their rights, by keeping them out of certain economic and social activities, by expelling them from the country, by exterminating all of them ....\\" (p. 7)Sartre, Anti-Semite and Jew, Schocken Books, Paris, 1948 He then describes the concept that these antisemitic opinions are produced by external causes, such as the experience of objective situations involving Jews.(p.8-9) Sartre states that these non-contradictory conceptions are \\"dangerous and false\\" and refuses to \\"characterize as opinion a doctrine that is aimed directly at particular persons and that seeks to suppress their rights or to exterminate them.\\"(p.9) Sartre argues that antisemitism is not an \\"idea\\" in the commonly understood sense of the word: it is not a point of view based rationally upon empirical information calmly collected and calibrated in as objective a manner as is possible. Sartre states that \\"It is first of all a passion.\\" (p.10-11; 23; 53-54.) It is also often a deep passion, \\"Some men are suddenly struck with impotence if they learn from the woman with whom they are making love that she is a Jewess. It is an involvement of the mind, but one so deep-seated and complex that it extends to the physiological realm, as happens in cases of hysteria.\\" (p.10-11) Sartre tells of a classmate of his who complained that he had failed the agr√©gation exam while a Jew, the son of eastern immigrants, had passed. There was ‚Äì said Sartre‚Äôs classmate ‚Äì no way that that Jew could understand French poetry as well as a true Frenchman. But Sartre‚Äôs classmate admitted that he disdained the agr√©gation and had not studied for it. \\"Thus to explain his failure, he made use of two systems of interpretation‚Ä¶ His thoughts moved on two planes without his being in the least bit embarrassed by it.\\" (p.12.) Sartre‚Äôs classmate had adopted in advance a view of Jews and of their role in society. \\"Far from experience producing his idea of the Jew, it was the latter that explained his experience. If the Jew did not exist, the anti-Semite would invent him.\\" Anti-Semitism is a view that arises not from experience or historical fact, but from itself. It lends new perspective to experience and historical fact. The anti-Semite convinces himself of beliefs that he knows to be spurious at best. Bad faith Sartre deploys his concept of bad faith as he develops his argument. For Sartre, the anti-Semite has escaped the insecurity of good faith, the impossibility of sincerity. He has abandoned reason and embraced passion. Sartre comments that, \\"It is not unusual for people to elect to live a life of passion rather than of reason. But ordinarily they love the objects of passion: women, glory, power, money. Since the anti-Semite has chosen hate, we are forced to conclude that it is the state of passion that he loves.\\" He chooses to reason from passion, to reason falsely \\"because of the longing for impenetrability. The rational man groans as he gropes for the truth; he knows that reasoning is no more than tentative, that other considerations may intervene to cast doubt on it.\\" Anti-Semites are attracted by \\"the durability of a stone.\\" What frightens them is the uncertainty of truth. \\"The anti-Semite has chosen hate because hate is a faith.\\" He has escaped responsibility and doubt. He can blame anything on the Jew; he does not need to engage reason, for he has his faith. The anti-Semite is a prime example of a person who has entered into bad faith to avoid responsibility. He attempts to relinquish his responsibility to anti-Semitism and a community of anti-Semites. He \\"fears every kind of solitariness‚Ä¶ however small his stature, he takes every precaution to make it smaller, lest he stand out from the herd and find himself face to face with himself. He has made himself an anti-Semite because that is something one cannot be alone.\\" (p.22.) Anti-Semitism is a way of feeling good, proud even, rather than guilty at the abandonment of responsibility and the flight before the impossibility of true sincerity. The anti-Semite abandons himself to the crowd and his bad faith, he \\"flees responsibility as he flees his own consciousness, and choosing for his personality the permanence of the rock, he chooses for his morality the scale of petrified values.\\"(p.27.) He pulls down shutters, blinds, mirrors and mirages over his consciousness to keep himself in his bad faith away from his responsibilities and his liberty. The anti-Semite is afraid \\"of himself, of his own consciousness, of his own liberty, of his instincts, of his responsibilities, of solitariness, of change, of society, and the world ‚Äì of everything except the Jews.\\" He is \\"a coward who does not want to admit his cowardice to himself.\\" (p.53.) The anti-Semite wallows in the depths of an extreme bad faith. \\"Anti-Semitism, in short, is fear of the human condition. The anti-Semite is a man who wishes to be pitiless stone, a furious torrent, a devastating thunderbolt ‚Äì anything except a man.\\" (p. 54.) This is his bad faith. Jewishness and antisemitism In the final section of Anti-Semite and Jew, Sartre turns to consider the Jew. First he goes through the various ways in which the term or identity \\"Jew\\" has been defined. One by one he proves to his own satisfaction why each is fatally flawed. Then he borrows from his existentialist and phenomenological philosophy to define a Jew as a person that others look at and say, \\"look, he/she is a Jew\\". Just as a chair is a chair by virtue of our considering it a chair, as in Wittgenstein's later philosophy, so a Jew is a person whom others consider to be a Jew. Therefore, a Jew's Jewishness exists only to the extent they are considered Jewish by those around them.

The chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) is also referred to as monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1) and small inducible cytokine A2. CCL2 is a small cytokine that belongs to the CC chemokine family. CCL2 recruits monocytes, memory T cells, and dendritic cells to the sites of inflammation produced by either tissue injury or infection. Genomics In the human genome, CCL2 and many other CC chemokines are located on chromosome 17 (17q11.2-q21.1). The gene span is 1,927 bases and the CCL2 gene resides on the Watson (plus) strand. The CCL2 gene has three exons and two introns. The CCL2 protein precursor contains a signal peptide of 23 amino acids. In turn, the mature CCL2 is 76 amino acids long. The CCL2 predicted weight is 11.025 kiloDaltons (kDa). Population genetics In humans, the levels of CCL2 can vary considerably. In the white people of European descent, the multivariable- adjusted heritability of CCL2 concentrations is as much as 0.37 in the blood plasma and 0.44 - in the serum. Molecular biology CCL2 is a monomeric polypeptide, with a molecular weight of approximately 13-15 kDa depending on levels of glycosylation. CCL2 is anchored in the plasma membrane of endothelial cells by glycosaminoglycan side chains of proteoglycans. CCL2 is primarily secreted by monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. Platelet derived growth factor is a major inducer of CCL2 gene. CCR2 and CCR4 are two cell surface receptors that bind CCL2. CCL2 exhibits a chemotactic activity for monocytes and basophils. However, it does not attract neutrophils or eosinophils. After deletion of the N-terminal residue, CCL2 loses its attractivity for basophils and becomes a chemoattractant of eosinophils. Basophils and mast cells that are treated with CCL2 release their granules to the intercellular space. This effect can be also potentiated by a pre- treatment with IL-3 or even by other cytokines. CCL2 augments monocyte anti- tumor activity and it is essential for formation of granulomas. CCL2 protein become a CCR2 antagonist when it is cleaved by metalloproteinase MMP-12. CCL2 can be found at the sites of tooth eruption and bone degradation. In the bone, CCL2 is expressed by mature osteoclasts and osteoblasts and it is under control of nuclear factor Œ∫B (NFŒ∫B). In the human osteoclasts, CCL2 and RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted). Both MCP-1 and RANTES induce formation of TRAP-positive, multinuclear cells from M-CSF- treated monocytes in the absence of RANKL, but produced osteoclasts that lacked cathepsin K expression and resorptive capacity. It is proposed that CCL2 and RANTES act as autocrine loop in human osteoclast differentiation. The CCL2 chemokine is also expressed by neurons, astrocytes and microglia. The expression of CCL2 in neurons is mainly found in the cerebral cortex, globus pallidus, hippocampus, paraventricular and supraoptic hypothalamic nuclei, lateral hypothalamus, substantia nigra, facial nuclei, motor and spinal trigeminal nuclei, gigantocellular reticular nucleus and in Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. Clinical importance CCL2 is implicated in pathogeneses of several diseases characterized by monocytic infiltrates, such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis. Administration of anti-CCL2 antibodies in a model of glomerulonephritis reduces infiltration of macrophages and T cells, reduces crescent formation, as well as scarring and renal impairment. CCL2 is involved in the neuroinflammatory processes that takes place in the various diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), which are characterized by neuronal degeneration. CCL2 expression in glial cells is increased in epilepsy, brain ischemia Alzheimer's disease experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), and traumatic brain injury. Hypomethylation of CpG sites within the CCL2 promoter region is affected by high levels of blood glucose and TG, which increase CCL2 levels in the blood serum. The later plays an important role in the vascular complications of type 2 diabetes. CCL2 induces amylin expression through ERK1/ERK2/JNK-AP1 and NF-Œ∫B related signaling pathways independent of CCR2. Amylin upregulation by CCL2 contributes to the elevation of the plasma amylin and insulin resistance in obesity. Adipocytes secrete various adipokines that may be involved in the negative cross-talk between adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. CCL2 impairs insulin signaling in skeletal muscle cells via ERK1/2 activation at doses similar to its physiological plasma concentrations (200 pg/mL), but does not involve activation of the NF-Œ∫B pathway. CCL2 significantly reduced insulin- stimulated glucose uptake in myocytes. CCL2 may represent a molecular link in the negative cross-talk between adipose tissue and skeletal muscle assigning a completely novel important role to CCL2 besides inflammation. Incubation of HL-1 cardiomyocytes and human myocytes with oxidized-LDL induced the expression of BNP and CCL2 genes, while native LDL (N-LDL) had no effect. Treatment with melatonin in old mice with age related liver inflammation decreased the mRNA expression of TNF-Œ±, IL-1Œ≤, HO (HO-1 and HO-2), iNOS, CCL2, NF-Œ∫B1, NF-Œ∫B2 and NKAP in old male mice. The protein expression of TNF-Œ±, IL-1Œ≤ was also decreased and IL-10 increased with melatonin treatment. Exogenous administration of melatonin was able to reduce inflammation.

Family Little Hawk was born about 1836. His father was the holy man variously called Makes the Song or Crazy Horse I. Makes The Song was also the father of Worm (Crazy Horse II), who became the father of the famous Crazy Horse III. Little Hawk was born to a different mother from Worm; her name was Good Haired Otter. In the Lakota extended family scheme, Crazy Horse was thus a brother of Little Hawk. His wife in the census records is always listed as Sunk-ska-win White Horse Woman (sometimes by misreading as 'White House'). In the Pine Ridge Agency allotment records she is noted as a sister of Iron Hawk. White Horse Woman stated that she was married to Little Hawk for thirty years before his death, which indicates that she was probably not the mother of Little Hawk's children born before 1870, which would be Made an Enemy, Hard to Kill, Yellow Wolf, and Iron Tail. White Horse was the mother of Little Hawk's children born after 1870 ‚Äì including Chase in Morning, Many Cartridges, and Luke Little Hawk (also known as Hairless). Name One of Little Hawk's nephews (younger brother of Crazy Horse 3), whom he gave his name to and took the name Long Face. Nephew Little Hawk was killed in 1871 around the age 29 on a war expedition south of the Platte River. 'Long Face' then took back his name Little Hawk. This naming custom sometimes leads to confusion in attributing deeds to family members Life Through the 1860s and 1870s, Little Hawk had participated in the fights alongside his famous nephew ‚Äì just four years younger - Crazy Horse. According to official data, he was one of the participants in The Battle of the Little Big Horn. Committed by political and personal imperatives to preserve his people's hunting grounds, and reluctant to follow Sitting Bull (Lakota: Tatanka Yotanka) into Canadian exile, Little Hawk chose to fight alongside his nephew against the U.S. troops. According to General George Crook's notes, Little Hawk \\" ... appeared to rank next to Crazy Horse in importance, was much like his superior in size and build, but his face was more kindly in expression and he was more fluent in speech; he did most of the talking.\\" Photographed by D.S. Mitchell. Lt. Willam Philo Clark stands next to Little Hawk at the Red Cloud Agency in 1877 National Anthropological Archives Crazy Horse arrived at Fort Robinson near the Red Cloud agency on May 6, 1877; together with Little Hawk, He Dog, Little Big Man, Iron Crow, they met in a solemn ceremony with First Lieutenant William P. Clark as the first step in their formal surrender. Some who witnessed the surrender caught the glint of silver on Little Hawk's neck. The shimmering came from a peace medal stamped with the image of President James Monroe. According to John G. Bourke's On the Border with Crook, when Little Hawk and Crazy Horse surrendered in 1877 Bourke noticed \\"...Little Hawk wore pendent at his neck the silver medal given to his father at the Peace Conference on the North Platte, in 1817 it bore the effigy of President Monroe.\\" However, other accounts note that Little Hawk mentioned that the peace medal had been presented to his grandfather and that his grandfather had passed it along to him. After sixty years' wear, the symbol of friendship had become a mere decoration. The last of the Northern Oglala tiyospaye was the Hunkpatila, Crazy Horse's own band. The Hunkpatila was an offshoot of Young Man Afraid of His Horses agency band, and the chief had sincerely attempted to integrate his Northern kinsmen into the smooth running of reservation life. Since the death of Crazy Horse, Hunkpatila leadership devolved to his father's half-brother Little Hawk, whose loyalties to his nephew's memory deeply conflicted with the interest of Commission of Indian Affairs. The festering resentment against Little Big Man focused within the Hunkpatila. (after surrendering along with Crazy Horse, Little Big Man switched allegiance and is suspected of involvement in Crazy Horse's murder at Fort Robinson in Nebraska.) At beginning of 1878, convinced by their warriors, Little Hawk's and He Dog's Oglala tiyospaye \\"escape\\" from the agency to join the resistance by Sitting Bull. A few Brul√©s, led by Black Eagle, a Sans Arc Indian, and the Miniconjou leader Roman Nose - had nevertheless resisted pressure to assimilate to the reservation bands - are between the group. In all, some eighty lodges fled, including approximately twenty lodges of Miniconjous, fifty lodges of Oglalas, and ten lodges of straggling Brul√©s and Sans Arcs. Northern Oglala headmen Iron Crow, leader of a mixed Hunkpatila- Oyuhpe band, and White Twin, a Bad Face leader, fled about the eleventh. The fugitives hurried northwest, pausing to regroup at the staging camp near the junction of Elk Creek and the south fork of the Cheyenne River. The fugitives reorganized, the council of warriors nominating Little Hawk as the Pipe Owner for the projected flight. A Sun Dance was held to promote the spirit of solidarity. They \\"called to the Great Spirit to protect them, and carry them safely through to the British Possessions.\\" Sending ahead nine men and a woman to inform Sitting Bull of their march, the village pressed on. Little Hawk coordinated the journey well, skillfully eluding army patrols to slip over the Canadian line during March and reuniting with the November breakaways in a village estimated at 250 lodges by the Canadian authorities. Including the earlier departures, Sitting Bull's alliance had been strengthened by some 280 lodges in spring 1878, almost doubling its numbers. For the next three years, the exiles sought to maintain their independence in Canada, but conditions deteriorated rapidly. The buffalo herds, which through the 1870s had contracted northward across Montana Territory, vanished under relentless pressure from the exiles, Canadian Indians and M√©tis, and American hide hunters. A final series of surrenders followed as hungry Lakota bands capitulated at military posts along the upper Missouri and Yellowstone and Little Hawk surrendered at Fort Keogh with Big Road in September 1880. In 1881 the interned Lakotas were transported to Standing Rock Agency and held pending transfer to their home agencies. One year later, 656 Northern Oglalas were released from custody and, under the leadership of Little Hawk, Big Road, He Dog, and Low Dog, transferred home to their kin at Pine Ridge. At the same time, 172 Northern Brul√©s led by Bull Dog were returned to the new Brul√© agency at Rosebud. Little Hawk participated at Lakota Delegation to Washington on 1888. On January 6, 1891, after Wounded Knee Massacre, Little Hawk, Big Road, He Dog, Jack Red Cloud, and High Hawk had negotiated the terms of surrender. On January 24, he led a group with about twenty Indians that came to Pine River agency to surrender thirty-one guns, attended the order of General Miles civilians to disarm the Indians. Death Little Hawk's last occurrence in the Pine Ridge census is for 1899: he presumably died late that year or early 1900.. Notes  References  * Mari, Sandoz.

She was often considered to be an outspoken and controversial swimmer, who switched to distance freestyle after starting as backstroker. Her first international achievement was her debut at the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, where she claimed a silver in the 800-metre freestyle, and the following year, she claimed gold and silver in the 800- and 400-metre freestyle events at the Pan Pacific Swimming Championships, setting a Commonwealth 800-metre freestyle record of 8 minutes 23.18 seconds, and defeating world record-holder Janet Evans of the United States. McDonald came to the 1988 Seoul Olympics as one of the fancied competitors in the 800m freestyle, and claimed the bronze medal, behind Janet Evans and East Germany's Astrid Strauss. McDonald was the subject of controversy at the 1990 Commonwealth Games in Auckland when she apparently showed disdain at the selection of fellow distance swimmer, the flame-haired Janelle Elford. McDonald was quoted as saying \\"I thought a typical Aussie had blonde hair, blue eyes and a tan . . . I feel snubbed and unrecognized. After all I've got an Olympic bronze and hold the Commonwealth record.\\" She later claimed to have been misquoted. McDonald proceeded to win gold and silver medals in the 800- and 400-metre freestyle events, finishing one position ahead of Elford in both cases. She also claimed a gold in the 4√ó200-metre freestyle relay alongside Elford. The Queensland swimmer finally got her recognition, when she was named as the Australian swimming captain for the 1991 World Championships in Perth. After failing to qualify for either the 400- or 800-metre freestyle final at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, she retired, but made a comeback in 1995 in an unsuccessful attempt to qualify for the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.

It is at the north of Hung Hom, south of Quarry Hill and east of Lo Lung Hang. Collapse of building at 45 Ma Tau Wai Road (2010) Collapse site On 29 January 2010, Block J of 45 Ma Tau Wai Road, a rundown five-storey residential building in Hok Yuen, collapsed with little warning, resulting in the deaths of four people. The event took place at around 1:30pm. Renovation work was being carried out on the commercial unit located on the ground floor of the building, when construction workers noticed signs of an imminent collapse and rushed out to raise the alarm. It is speculated that the unauthorised renovation was the primary factor that led to the collapse of an already decaying and structurally weak building. Some of the residents were alerted by the commotion and evacuated seconds before the entire building caved in. A squad of fireman arrived at the scene just as the disaster unfolded, having received an emergency call from a passer-by prior to the collapse. Several hundred emergency workers were deployed in the ensuing rescue operation, which had to take place under adjacent buildings that were themselves subject to collapse at any moment. Temporary reinforcements were erected to support and stabilise the remaining structures to give added protection to the rescue teams. The Chief Executive Donald Tsang later visited the site to inspect the rubble. A repair order had been issued by the authorities months before, but at the time of the inspection, the extent of the symptoms did not indicate the gravity of the situation. The walk-up building, which was 55 years old, was the last block in a group of ten identical buildings. Each floor housed four apartments of around 150 square feet (14 square metres), which in some cases were further partitioned by their owners. Residents in the adjoining blocks were subsequently relocated to temporary shelters in the immediate aftermath and then on to interim housing at public estates. This type of building is typical of many over the territory. Implications and further action The case was the first of its type in several decades, and raised new awareness amongst the public of the potential dangers faced by residents of such buildings. A thorough investigation into this particular incident, as well as a plan to prevent similar cases from occurring was ordered by the Government. The approximately four thousand buildings of the same classification that were constructed before 1960 were subsequently earmarked for inspection within one month.Govt press release re. investigation report on the collapse, 26 April 2010Fatal collapse due to \`external forces' , The Standard, April 27, 2010 The Urban Renewal Authority later announced development of the other blocks in the row.URA commences the Ma Tau Wai Road/Chun Tin Street project with special measures, Urban Renewal Authority, 24 February 2010 References Category:Hung Hom Category:Places in Hong Kong ","title":"Hok Yuen"},{"id":"3631882","text":"Glen Clifford Housman (born 3 September 1971) is an Australian former long- distance freestyle swimmer of the 1980s and 1990s, who won the silver medal in the 1500-metre freestyle, swimming at the 1992 Summer Olympics. His career was overshadowed by fellow Australian Kieren Perkins, and was also marred by illness. Housman entered the international stage after winning the 400-, 800- and 1500-metre freestyle events at the 1989 Australian championships, gaining selection for the Pan Pacific Championships in Tokyo, where he claimed gold in the 1500-metre event. He continued to improve, breaking the 1500-metre world record in Adelaide at the 1990 Australian championships to qualify for the 1990 Commonwealth Games in Auckland. However, this record was disallowed as the electronic timing equipment failed as he touched the finishing wall, even though he was clearly ahead of the world record as he touched. This incident caused considerable embarrassment to Adelaide as they were later unsuccessful in their bid for the 1998 Commonwealth Games, losing to Kuala Lumpur. Housman proceeded to win a gold and silver in the 1500- and 400-metre freestyle events respectively in Auckland. In 1991, Housman was struck down by illness, and was forced to sit on the sidelines as Perkins claimed the 1500-metre freestyle world record. He returned at the 1992 Summer Olympics, where despite swimming a fine race, he was completely overshadowed as Perkins swept all before him. Housman was once again absent in 1993 due to illness, returning to the pool for the 1994 Commonwealth Games only to finish 3rd in the 1500-metre freestyle, trailing Perkins and Daniel Kowalski. He also won gold in the 4√ó200-metre freestyle relay. Housman's final international campaign at the 1996 Summer Olympics was a disappointment.

Description This woodpecker has a length of , a wingspan of , and an average weight of ; its maximum lifespan in the wild is 6 years. It closely resembles the black- backed woodpecker, which is also three-toed. Until recently, it was considered to be the same species as the Eurasian three-toed woodpecker, P. tridactylus. Adults are black on the head, wings and rump, and white from the throat to the belly; the flanks are white with black bars. The back is white with black bars and the tail is black with the white outer feathers barred with black. The adult male has a yellow cap. Breeding The breeding habitat is coniferous forests across western Canada, Alaska and the western United States. It has also been breeding in various spots in Michigan's upper peninsula, and has been recorded breeding in Minnesota five times. The female lays 3 to 7 but most often 4 eggs in a nest cavity in a dead conifer or sometimes a live tree or pole. The pair excavates a new nest each year. Three-toed woodpeckers rely on disturbed, old-growth forests and are strongly associated with active Spruce Beetle infestations, with beetle-infested trees being important for the woodpeckers and other species that depend on the cavities they excavate. Movements and foraging This bird is normally a permanent resident, but northern birds may move south and birds at high elevations may move to lower levels in winter. Three-toed woodpeckers forage on conifers in search of wood- boring beetle larvae or other insects. They may also eat fruit and tree sap. These birds often move into areas with large numbers of insect-infested trees, often following a forest fire or flooding. This bird is likely to give way to the black-backed woodpecker where the two species compete for habitat.  Subspecies  *P. d. dorsalis, nominate Western race. *P. d. fasciatus, Rocky Mountain race.

During his career, he won twelve Australian Championships. Initially trained by his mother, Kerry enjoyed success in swimming and surf lifesaving as a teenager. His swimming career progressed to senior Australian standards after he switched to the tutelage of John Rigby and moved to Queensland. He made his debut at the 1976 Australian Championships and promptly won the 200 m freestyle and backstroke events to win selection for the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal at the age of 16. At the Olympics, Kerry reached the final in two events, coming seventh and fifth in the 100 m and 200 m backstroke respectively. Kerry was disappointed with his performances, but they attracted the attention of American coach Doc Counsilman, who invited Kerry to swim under him at the Indiana University. Kerry set Australian records while in the United States, but his international career hit trouble when he was expelled from the 1978 Commonwealth Games team for breaking a curfew. Kerry returned to Australia in 1980 for the national championships and gained selection for the Moscow Olympics by winning the backstroke double. Kerry declined financial inducements and resisted political pressure from the government of Australia to boycott the Olympics in protest at the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. He went on to win bronze in the 200 m backstroke after missing the final in the 100 m. The peak of his career came in the 4 √ó 100 m medley relay, where he led off the winning team. The race remains the only time the United States did not win the event at the Olympics. After the games, Kerry took an extended break from the sport, before returning for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. He claimed a bronze in the medley relay and came fifth in the 100 m backstroke. He then retired and took up a television and modelling career in the United States. After returning to Australia, he ran and owned Dunhill Management, one of the largest recruiting firms in the nation, with his brother. In 2001, the Kerry brothers sold Dunhill for , with up to A$13.8 million in additional payments depending on the success of the company. They later founded a new recruitment firm, K2.  Early years  Born in Temora, New South Wales, near the regional centre of Wagga Wagga, Kerry was one of two sons born to a car salesman. Kerry's mother was a swimming teacher who ran her own aquatic school. Kerry was taught to swim by his mother, whom he regarded as a perfectionist who emphasised technique and turned him to backstroke.Howell, p. 234. Kerry grew up participating in a wide range of sports, representing Wollongong High School in tennis, athletics and swimming. He also competed four times in the state cross-country championships. Once his family had moved to the seaside city of Wollongong, Kerry developed a love of the surf. He found the ocean water much more exciting due to its unpredictability. Kerry steadily rose through the surf lifesaving ranks, competing at the state and national championships. In 1974, Kerry won the Cadet Malibu event in the Australian Championships, and in 1975 he came second in the surf race at the Australian Open Surfing Championships. In the pool, Kerry had his first competitive race at the age of 12 in 1971. At the time, Brad Cooper--who went on to win the 400 m freestyle at the 1972 Summer Olympics--was living in Wollongong and he and Kerry trained together on a regular basis. In 1974, Kerry competed in the Australian Age Championships in freestyle, before moving north to train with John Rigby in Brisbane, Queensland in the following year. At the time of his move, Kerry was ranked around 200th in the world in backstroke.Howell, p. 235.  International debut: 1976 Olympics  The Olympic pool in Montreal, where Kerry competed in 1976. Kerry had improved to such an extent that by November 1975, his times in the 200 m backstroke had dropped from around 2 m 10 s to around 2 m 3.0 s, ranking him third in the world. As a result of his strong performances in the pool, Kerry retired from surf racing. Kerry made his debut at the 1976 Australian Championships, winning the 200 m freestyle and backstroke events in 1 m 54.33 s and 2 m 3.58 s respectively, as well as the 4 √ó 200 m freestyle and the 4 √ó 100 m medley relays for New South Wales, leading off both relays. Aged 16, Kerry won selection for the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal in the 100 m and 200 m backstroke, the 200 m freestyle, the 4 √ó 200 m freestyle relay and the 4 √ó 100 m medley relay. Kerry was second in his heat of the 200 m freestyle heat in a time of 1 m 54.86 s, but was four seconds off the pace and did not qualify for the final. His time was 2.08 s behind the slowest qualifier, placing him 16th. Kerry did not get to swim in the 4 √ó 200 m freestyle relay. The fastest Australian in the corresponding individual event, he was rested in the qualifying round; Australia came third in their heat and ninth overall to miss the final by 1.88 s after Peter Dawson swam his split in a time four seconds slower than Kerry's effort in the individual event. Had Kerry repeated his individual time in the relay in place of Dawson, Australia would have qualified fifth. Kerry found more success in the 100 m backstroke, winning his heat in 57.99 s to qualify third fastest for the semifinals. He then scraped into the final as the second slowest qualifier, after coming fourth in his semifinal in a time of 58.04 s. His time of 57.94 s placed him seventh in the final, ahead of fellow Australian Mark Tonelli, but more than two seconds behind the victorious John Naber of the United States. In the 200 m event, Kerry put in a personal best time of 2 m 3.58 s in the first heat to qualify fourth fastest for the final, but swam slower in the decider to finish fifth in a time of 2 m 4.07 s, one place behind Tonelli and 2.72 s away from bronze. Kerry combined with Paul Jarvie, Neil Rogers and Peter Coughlan in the 4 √ó 100 m medley relay, placing sixth.Howell, p. 236. The quartet qualified in sixth place, and Kerry had them in fourth place after posting a time of 57.94 s in the first leg, but his teammates were unable to keep up with the leaders and finished more than four seconds out of medal contention. Kerry was disappointed with his performances, feeling that he had failed to perform to his potential amid the pressure and excitement of an Olympics. However, he felt that his experience of racing against the likes of Naber and Roland Matthes would hold him in good stead. On a brighter note, Kerry's performances impressed the leading American coach Doc Counsilman, who invited him to come and swim at Indiana University after Kerry finished his secondary schooling in Australia. Kerry successfully defended his 200 m backstroke national title in 1977, but the time was more than four seconds slower than his effort in the previous year. He combined with his New South Wales teammates to win all three relays, again in times substantially slower than in the preceding Olympic year. The performances earned him selection for the Australian team for the Coca-Cola Meet in London, but Kerry felt that he lacked motivation after the Olympics. Upon returning, he decided to absent himself from such events.  US college stint and expulsion for disciplinary issues  The swimming pool at the University of Southern California, where Kerry trained. In January 1978, Kerry arrived at Indiana University, studying theatre, drama and telecommunications. Based on the times that he recorded for Indiana, Kerry was named in the Australian squad for the 1978 Commonwealth Games in Edmonton, Canada. However, his international career appeared to be in disarray when along with two teammates, Tonelli and Joe Dixon, he was expelled from the Australian team for breaking a curfew on American Independence Day during a training camp in Honolulu, Hawaii.Howell, p. 239.Andrews, pp. 440-441.Andrews, pp. 231-232.Forrest, p. 85. According to Tonelli, Kerry was late because he was courting a female he had met, while Tonelli and Dixon had been drinking. Tonelli also admitted to the officials that he had smoked marijuana--not illegal under Hawaii law--on the night.Tonelli, pp. 83-86. In the aftermath of the incident, Tonelli appeared on Australian television, strongly denying rumours that he had been involved in a drug-fuelled orgy with teammates. He admitted to smoking marijuana, but defended his actions, saying that it was not illegal. Supporters in Australia, including future Prime Minister Bob Hawke, launched a petition for the reinstatement of the trio, which garnered thousands of signatures, but to no avail.Tonelli, p. 88. Kerry returned to Indiana and continued his training. He competed at the 1979 U.S. National Championships at Fort Lauderdale, setting Australian records in the 100 m and 200 m backstroke in times of 56.50 s and 2 m 2.61 s respectively. Over time, Kerry became increasingly discontented with Counsilman, who he felt was losing focus and becoming preoccupied with various business commitments and an attempt to swim across the English Channel. Kerry transferred to the University of Southern California, which was coached by Naber's mentor Peter Daland.  1980 Olympics  Kerry returned home to compete in the 1980 Australian Championships, winning both backstroke events, albeit in a slower time than his Australian records. Kerry added two titles as a member of the 4 √ó 100 m medley and freestyle relay teams for New South Wales. This earned Kerry his second trip to the Olympics, this time in Moscow.Howell, p. 237. However, another obstacle arose with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, which resulted in a boycott of the Games by a large part of the Western world, led by the United States. The Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser was also the patron of the Australian Olympic Committee, and significant political pressure came to bear on the athletes to boycott the Games. Kerry's teammate Tonelli, however, realised that only the sportspeople would suffer from a boycott and that trade relations would continue unabated. He took a leadership role among the athletes to fight for their right to compete.Gordon, p. 334. Kerry was equally adamant that he was going to compete, unlike some other swimmers who made personal boycotts. He received offers from Australian government officials to boycott the Games in return for financial payments. He said: Upon leaving the US for the Olympics, Kerry was threatened with the cancellation of his US visa.Forrest, p. 201. Kerry arrived in Moscow facing a four event schedule: he was nominated in both backstroke events and the 4 √ó 200 m freestyle relay and the 4 √ó 100 m medley relay. With the Americans and many other western swimmers absent, Australian officials were confident that their three entrants in the 100 m backstroke, Kerry, Tonelli and Glenn Patching, would all make the final and win medals. Kerry came in third both in his heat and in the semi-final, clocking 58.08 s and 58.07 s respectively, missing out on the final by just 0.02 s. He was the ninth fastest in the closely run semifinals, with the third fastest qualifier being only 0.18 s faster. Patching missed the final after slipping on the starting wall in his race, while Tonelli went on to finish seventh. Had Kerry matched his personal best of 65.50 s, he would have won the gold medal ahead of Sweden's Bengt Baron. Kerry bounced back in the 200 m backstroke and won his heat to qualify third-fastest, before claiming bronze in a time of 2 m 3.14 s behind the Hungarian duo of S√°ndor Wlad√°r and Zolt√°n Verraszt√≥. He edged out the Soviet Union's Vladimir Shemetov by 0.34 s, becoming the first Australian to win a medal in an individual backstroke event since David Theile in 1960. In the 4 √ó 200 m freestyle relay, he combined with Tonelli, Graeme Brewer and Ron McKeon as Australia came seventh after qualifying fourth. The Australians were sixth at the halfway point when Kerry jumped in for the third leg. Kerry moved Australia into fifth by the end of his leg, just 0.78 s from the bronze medal position, after posting a split time of 1 m 52.64 s, the 18th fastest split in the race. However, McKeon could not keep pace with the opposition anchor swimmers, and Australia finished seventh, 1.52 s outside the medals. = Relay victory = The 4 √ó 100 m medley relay was the focal point of Kerry's Moscow campaign. The event had always been won by the United States since its inception at Olympic level in 1960, and their boycott had opened up the field in the event. In the five times the event had been contested, Australia's best result was a silver in the inaugural race. A bronze in 1964 was the only other medal success and the 1976 edition of the medley relay had seen Australia eliminated in the heats. This time, Australia was regarded as a medal chance, but was not seen as the main threats--Sweden, Great Britain and the Soviet Union were seen as the most likely winners. The host's team included the silver medallists in the 100 m backstroke and breaststroke, and their butterflyer had come fifth; their freestyler would later place fourth. The British had Duncan Goodhew, the breaststroke gold medallist, while Sweden's butterflyer and backstroker had won their respective events and their freestyle swimmer would come second in the 100 m.Howell, p. 233. Australia's team paled in comparison on paper. Neil Brooks, the freestyler, later came 14th overall after having an asthma attack, and Peter Evans was the only individual medallist in the corresponding individual event.Andrews, p. 148. Kerry had been eliminated in the backstroke semifinals, while Tonelli was swimming as a makeshift butterflyer, despite having performed better than Kerry in the 100 m backstroke. Adding to the pressure was the fact that Australia won no gold medals at the 1976 Olympics in any sport, and were yet to win in Moscow, so the public were still awaiting their first victory since Munich in 1972.Gordon, p. 333. Coming into the Olympics, Australia were ranked seventh out of the thirteen competing countries.Forrest, p. 212. Australia's prospects improved after the morning heats in which Sweden was disqualified. Tonelli, the eldest swimmer in the quartet at the age of 23, convened the team as its de facto leader. He asked his teammates to commit to swimming their legs in a certain time; Kerry vowed to swim the backstroke in 57 s, Evans the breaststroke in 63 s flat, Tonelli the butterfly in 54 s and Brooks promised to anchor the team in 49.8 s, even though he had never gone faster than 51 s. Tonelli named the foursome as the Quietly Confident Quartet, and they exhibited a quiet confidence as they lined up for the race.Howell, p. 234. As Patching had slipped earlier in the meet, Kerry decided to rub a sticky red substance onto the soles of his feet. The Soviet hosts had installed a carpet following the incidents, resulting in Kerry leaving red footprints in the stadium. Kerry led off in a time faster than his effort in the individual event, but it was still two seconds slower than his personal best time of 57.87 s, leaving Australia in fourth place at the end of the first leg. Evans then swam a personal best of 63.01 s, drawing Australia almost level with the host nation at the halfway mark. Tonelli swam his leg in 54.94 s, almost two seconds faster than he had done over the distance. Tonelli did so with an uneven arm technique due to the uneven strength in his arms.Howell, p. 242. He began to lose ground in the last 50 m and was a bodylength behind until a late surge brought him to within a metre by the end of his leg. Brooks then executed a powerful, well-timed dive and surfaced almost even with his Soviet counterpart. He had drawn level by the halfway mark and made a superior turn to take the lead. The Soviet freestyler pulled level at the 25 m mark before Brooks again sprinted away to seal an Australian victory by 0.22 s. Brooks had finished his leg in 49.86 s as he had vowed to his teammates.Andrews, p. 63. The time of 3 m 45.70 s sealed Australia's first ever win in a medley relay at the Olympics, for men or women. The team then made a celebratory dive into the pool and were interviewed poolside. In 2000, Kerry and the other members of the quartet were each awarded the Australian Sports Medal for their victory in Moscow.  Break and comeback  After the Olympics, Kerry took an extended break from competitive swimming. He was asked to return for the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane, so he made a comeback, but did only two weeks of solid training and missed selection, failing to win either backstroke event. In 1983, he began preparing for the Olympics, but did not start serious work until October. Kerry was confident in his ability to perform at international standards with sporadic preparation after long sabbaticals. He attributed this to his technique and ability to keep his 190 cm, 80 kg body in shape while not training. He returned to Australia in 1984 and after training in Brisbane, he was selected for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles despite winning neither backstroke event at the Australian Championships. Arriving in the United States, Kerry was scheduled to compete in the 100 m backstroke and 4 √ó 100 m medley relay. Kerry swam quickly to win his heat in the 100 m in a time of 57.15 s, qualifying third fastest for the final. However, he was unable to improve his pace in the final, finishing fifth in a time of 57.18 s, 0.69 s from the bronze medal. In the medley relay, Kerry and Evans joined Glenn Buchanan and Mark Stockwell, who swam the butterfly and freestyle respectively. They were no match for the Americans, who had three of the four gold medallists in the corresponding individual events and finished almost four seconds ahead. Kerry had Australia in third place at the first change, finishing his leg in a time of 57.12 s, but by this point the Americans were already 1.71 s ahead. Australia remained third at every change and were beaten by the second-placed Canadians by just 0.02 s.Gordon, p. 356.  After swimming  After the Games, Kerry retired from competitive swimming. He then worked in Los Angeles as a model and hosted a fashion show on cable television. According to Tonelli, Kerry's mother told her son to \\"look after that face, [because] that's all you've got\\".Tonelli, p. 7. Tonelli disagreed, opining that \\"he was always much more than that\\". Tonelli reported that Kerry was busy preening himself just before the start of their Olympic-winning relay performance, claiming that although Australia was unlikely to win the race, he needed to look good because a prospective employer might be watching. Kerry went on to model on the catwalks of Milan and Paris.Tonelli, pp. 10-11. Kerry married his American wife Lynda, and they split their time between Australia and the United States. They have two children, a son Tanner who is a semi- professional basketball player, and a daughter Madison, who is an actress appearing on Home and Away. Along with his brother Phil, Kerry founded Dunhill Management, one of Australia's largest recruiting firms. In 2001, the brothers sold Dunhill to the British firm Robert Walters for A$22.7 million, with up to A$13.8 million in extra payments depending on the future success of the company. After this, Kerry worked as the managing director of another firm, before starting a new recruitment business with his brother, K2 Recruitment & Consulting.

Tonelli unofficially led the relay team and was an athletes' spokesperson who fought for the right of Australian Olympians to compete in the face of a government call for a boycott to protest against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Tonelli took up swimming due to his asthma, and quickly came to prominence. Selected to represent Australia at the 1973 World Championships, he came sixth in the 200 m backstroke at the age of 16. He won his first Australian titles in 1974 in the 100 m backstroke and 200 m butterfly and went on to the 1974 Commonwealth Games in Christchurch, where he won his first major international race, the 100 m backstroke, and took silver in the 200 m backstroke. In 1975, Tonelli won his only individual medal at global level, a silver in the 200 m backstroke at the World Championships in Cali, Colombia. In 1975, Tonelli enrolled at the University of Alabama in the United States, studying and competing in the collegiate sport system. He was selected in both backstroke events for the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, but struggled and missed the medals in both events. During his stay in America, Tonelli set times that would have placed him among the world's leading swimmers, but he was expelled from the 1978 Commonwealth Games team for breaches of discipline. After finishing his American university career, Tonelli returned to Australia and gained selection for his second Olympics. Having cleared the political obstacles, Tonelli was given a heavy schedule of six events: both backstroke races, the 100 m freestyle and butterfly, and two relays. He made little impact in the individual events, only reaching one final. Australia lacked butterfly swimmers and Tonelli was versatile, so he swum the stroke in the medley relay. He performed above his previous record, posting a time fast enough to win silver in the corresponding individual event and helping Australia to an unexpected win. Upon returning to Australia, Tonelli retired with eleven individual Australian championships in three different strokes.  Early years  Tonelli was born Mark Lyndon Leembruggen into a working-class family in Ipswich, a city southwest of Brisbane, the capital of Queensland. His father Lyndon was a blue-collar worker of Dutch origin and his Irish mother Muriel worked in the Queensland Department of Industrial Relations. Muriel was pregnant with twins, but miscarried one of the babies and gave birth only to Mark. The family moved to the northern outback mining town of Mount Isa, where Lyndon worked as a miner. There, Muriel left her husband and married Renato \\"Ray\\" Tonelli, an Italian immigrant labourer. Still a toddler, Tonelli and his stepfather left the town and returned to Brisbane.Tonelli, pp. 20-23. He adopted his stepfather's surname, but did not officially change his name until he was 18.Tonelli, p. 58. Tonelli was effectively an only child; his half-sister was not born until he was 14. A decade later, he discovered two half-sisters from his biological father's remarriage.Tonelli, p.22. His family moved around frequently due to his stepfather's work, before settling permanently in Brisbane.Howell, p. 238. Tonelli's family had no history of athletic success, and had little knowledge of swimming, but his mother encouraged him to take up the sport to ease his asthma. In his first year, Tonelli came third in his age group at Western Districts Club, prompting his mother to send him at age nine to John Keating-- a swimming coach who had guided several swimmers to national selection-at the Centenary Pool in the hope that he could improve to Olympic standards. Tonelli said the reality was that he could hardly swim at all.Tonelli, p. 25. By the age of 10, Tonelli was regularly winning at school carnivals and at 11, came seventh in the 100 m freestyle in his division at the Queensland Championships, before winning the event the following year. Tonelli rates his win over Stephen Holland, the future 1500 m freestyle world champion and world record holder, in a 200 m freestyle race at a schoolboys' carnival as his favourite race.Tonelli, p. 36. Holland was to break his first world record just a few months later.Andrews, pp. 212-213. Keating motivated Tonelli by showing him the best times recorded by American boys of the same age, as documented in Swimming World Magazine. Unaware that the Americans were swimming in 50 yd pools, roughly 10% shorter than those in Australia, Tonelli could not understand his inability to match and better their times.Tonelli, pp. 27-28. He said that his greatest motivation was the desire to impress his parents.Tonelli, pp. 31-32.  National and international debut  In 1973, at the age of 15, Tonelli competed in his first Australian Age Championships in Hobart, winning the 100 m and 200 m freestyle, and the 200 m backstroke. These results allowed him to swim at the preliminary qualifying trials for the 1973 World Aquatics Championships, where he managed four fourth placings. However, the selectors held another set of trials just before the World Championships, which offered swimmers a final chance to gain selection. Tonelli said \\"Everyone, except me, knew it was a ploy simply to keep the team on its toes\\".Tonelli, p. 39. Upon returning to Brisbane after the first round of trials, Tonelli tore rib cartilage while participating in judo at high school. The pain of the injury restricted him to swimming backstroke for four months, and his times steadily improved during this period under the guidance of John Rigby at the Valley Pool. At the final selection event, he came second in both the 100 m and 200 m backstroke behind Olympic gold medallist Brad Cooper to earn his international debut. At the World Championships in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, he came sixth in the 200 m backstroke behind East Germany's Roland Matthes, who set a world record. Tonelli self-deprecatingly noted that \\"I didn't get to see him [Matthes] swim in the final, because I was in the same race five sets of speedos behind\\".Tonelli, p. 43. Tonelli won his first Australian titles in 1974, claiming both the 100 m backstroke and 200 m butterfly; it was his first race in the latter stroke at senior national level. He completed the victories in times of 59.55 s and 2 m 7.30 s respectively. Tonelli also claimed victory as part of the Queensland teams in the 4 √ó 200 m freestyle and the 4 √ó 100 m medley relays--it was the first time that Queensland had won the former race. In total, Tonelli had claimed gold medals in three different strokes at his first Australian Championships.  Commonwealth gold  Tonelli was selected for the 1974 Commonwealth Games in Christchurch, New Zealand, where he had his first medal success at international level. He won gold in the 100 m backstroke, where he won his heat comfortably before setting a Games record of 59.65 s in the final. Tonelli was second behind Cooper in the 200 m backstroke, finishing in a time of 2 m 9.47 s, more than three seconds in arrears.Howell, p. 240. He claimed a silver in the 4 √ó 100 m medley relay as Australia were thwarted by Canada despite setting a national record, and was eliminated in the heats of the 200 m butterfly. In 1975, Tonelli won the 100 m backstroke, 200 m backstroke and 200 m butterfly events at the Australian Championships. Although he won more individual titles than in the previous year, his times were slower; he completed the distances in 59.70 s, 2 m 10.50 s and 2 m 10.00 s respectively. Tonelli was also part of the Queensland team that successfully defended their medley relay title. Tonelli was thus selected for the 1975 World Championships in Cali, Colombia. He qualified fastest for the 200 m backstroke final and had planned to pursue an aggressive strategy to attack from the start. However, he was advised to swim conservatively in the first half of the race by Australian coach Terry Gathercole so that his main rivals Matthes and John Naber would not be able to draft behind him in the early stages. The tactic backfired and Tonelli ended with the silver medal. He had swum faster in the second half of the race--something exceedingly rare in top-level swimming and an indication of strategic error--and felt that he had too much unused energy left at the end of the race. Tonelli vowed that from then on, he would always back his judgment and race strategy.Tonelli, pp. 56-57.  1976 Olympics and move to US college system  The Olympic pool in Montreal, where Tonelli competed in 1976. After the World Championships, Tonelli accepted a swimming scholarship from the University of Alabama to train under John Gambril, having rejected offers from Stanford and Harvard. Tonelli was almost killed before ever swimming for the university, suffering a mid-air parachute malfunction during an activity with the campus skydiving club.Tonelli, pp. 68-71. Tonelli eventually completed a BA in Communications and Film. After enrolling at Alabama, Tonelli's parents paid for him to return home for the 1976 Australian Championships, which were the selection trials for the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Tonelli won the 100 m backstroke in a time of 58.35 s but was relegated to silver in the 200 m event by Mark Kerry. Along with Kerry, Tonelli was selected for both backstroke events and the 4 √ó 200 m freestyle relay. In Montreal, Tonelli came eighth fastest in every round of the 100 m backstroke. He came second in his heat in a time of 58.53 s, making him the eighth of sixteen qualifiers for the semifinals. He then scraped into the 100 m final as the slowest qualifier--0.01 s ahead of fellow Australian Glenn Patching--after finishing fourth in his semifinal in a time of 58.14 s. He came eighth in the final in a time of 58.42 s and did not threaten the medals; Naber of the United States won in a time of 55.49 s. As Kerry outpaced Tonelli to finish seventh in the event, he was selected ahead of Tonelli for the backstroke leg in the 4 √ó 100 m medley relay.Howell, pp. 236, 240. In the 200 m event, Tonelli came second in his heat to qualify sixth fastest for the final. There he came fourth and missed the medals-- which were swept by the Americans--by 1.82 s. He was 3.98 s behind Naber, who broke the world record and became the first person to break two minutes for the event. Australia struggled in the 4 √ó 200 m freestyle relay, eliminated in the preliminary round after finishing third in their heat, and ninth overall. Tonelli swam the second leg in a time of 1 m 55.94 s. Tonelli returned to Alabama after the Olympics and intensified his training regimen, He recalled that \\"The coach really supplied me with the environment to improve. I got used to pressure. You had to stand up and race in dual meets almost every other weekend, no matter how you felt. In Australia you are lucky if you get two top meets a year.\\" In 1977, he won the 100 m backstroke at the US Open Championships at Mission Viejo, becoming one of the few Australians to win a US title.  Expelled from Australian team  Tonelli continued in the United States in 1978, recollecting \\"I really hit my straps\\", reporting that he had swum world records in time trials at training. Because he was in the United States, he was allowed to qualify for the 1978 Commonwealth Games in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada by swimming fast times in events in North America. Tonelli raced in five events at the Canada Cup held in Edmonton, winning four. During a drunken party after the competition, Tonelli and some fellow swimmers decided to steal three giant flags from poles in the city centre: those of Canada, the City of Edmonton, and Alberta. In the process, Tonelli fell off the staff and was hospitalised, his arm put in plaster.Tonelli, pp. 79-82. He returned to Mission Viejo and continued his build-up despite his arm injury, before flying to the Australian training camp in Hawaii, where he was made team captain.Forrest, p. 79. However, his international career appeared to be in disarray when along with teammates Kerry and Joe Dixon, he was expelled from the team for breaking a curfew on the American Independence Day holiday.Forrest, p. 85. Tonelli also admitted to the officials that he had smoked marijuana and been drinking on the night.Tonelli, pp. 83-86. In the aftermath of the incident, Tonelli appeared on Australian television, strongly denying rumours that he had been involved in a drug-fuelled orgy with teammates. He admitted to smoking marijuana, but defended his actions as being legal under Hawaii law. Supporters in Australia--including future Prime Minister Bob Hawke--launched a petition for the reinstatement of the trio. They gathered thousands of signatures to no avail.Tonelli, p. 88. Tonelli returned to the United States, while his compatriots competed for Australia. In the meantime, Tonelli again won the 100 m backstroke title at the US Nationals in a time two seconds faster than Patching's Commonwealth gold- winning effort.Howell, p. 239. He said that his career was \\"never the same again\\" after his expulsion by a \\"kangaroo court\\", feeling that the punishment had weakened his will. Tonelli predicted that he could have won eight Commonwealth Games gold medals and possibly set a world record in the 200 m backstroke if he had not been expelled.Tonelli, p. 91.  1980 Summer Olympics  Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser (pictured) pressured the Australian athletes to boycott the Olympics. Tonelli took a leadership role in fighting for the opposite. In 1979 Tonelli failed to defend his US title in the 100 m backstroke, but managed third in the event at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Championships in his final year of university. In his four years at Alabama, he was an eight-time All-American in the 100 m and 200 m backstroke. His triumph at the NCAA Championships came amid the backdrop of a teammate's death in a waterskiing accident during a social event with a group of fellow swimmers. Tonelli was driving the powerboat when he did a U-turn that resulted in his teammate being thrown off his skis and into the water. The boat's propellor then struck the man, who died due to severe cuts and blood loss.Tonelli, pp. 100-102. Tonelli graduated,Forrest, p. 43. returned to Australia, and won the 100 m freestyle, butterfly and backstroke events at the 1979 Australian Championships. The following year, he repeated the freestyle and butterfly victories in times of 51.80 s and 56.64 s to gain selection for the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow; he was also chosen for the 100 m and 200 m backstroke after finishing second to Kerry. However, another obstacle arose with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, which resulted in a boycott of the Games by a large part of the Western world, led by the United States. The Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser was also the patron of the Australian Olympic Committee, and significant political pressure came to bear on the athletes to boycott the Games. Tonelli however, knew that only the sportspeople would suffer from a boycott and that trade relations would continue unabated. He took a leadership role among the Australian athletes to fight for their right to compete.Gordon, p. 334. According to women's captain Lisa Forrest,Forrest, p. xiv. Tonelli adopted populist tactics in championing the athletes' cause. He said that Fraser was sending \\"wheat to feed the Russian army, wool to clothe the army and Australian metal to make Russian guns\\", saying that this contradicted the proposed boycott in protest against Soviet military policy. Tonelli's anti- authoritarian and individualistic style manifested itself during media appearances, including a news interview in which he debated with Reverend Lance Shilton, who had referred to the athletes as traitors.Forrest, p. 163-164. Shilton expressed sympathy to the athletes, which Tonelli interpreted as condescension. Unaware that the camera was broadcasting images of him, Tonelli responded by rolling his eyes and twirling his finger, a gaffe that was shown on national television. Forrest said that \\"the damage was done--one of our most prominent anti-boycott lobbyists ... looked like a smart alec\\". Tonelli arrived in Moscow facing a heavy schedule: he was nominated in the 100 m freestyle, backstroke and butterfly, the 200 m backstroke and the 4 √ó 100 m medley and the 4 √ó 200 m freestyle relays. Tonelli came third in his heat of the 100 m freestyle to qualify fourth with a time of 52.04 s. However, he swam slower in coming fifth in his semifinal in a time of 52.17 s to miss the final by 0.26 s. Overall, he was ranked 10th, but if he repeated his Australian record of 51.80 set at the selection trials, he would have come sixth. Tonelli had another let-down in the 100 m backstroke. He won his heat--which was relatively slow--in a time of 58.66 s, and scraped into the semifinals as the second slowest of 16 qualifiers. He then came second in his semifinal in a time of 57.89 s to qualify third fastest, before again swimming slower in the final and finishing seventh in a time of 57.98 s. However, the event was closely contested; only 0.18 s separated third and ninth places in the semifinal and there was only 0.35 s between bronze and seventh in the final. Tonelli rued his individual performances in Moscow: \\"I fell apart. I had swum only one big race in the past twelve months and lacked the competitive edge.\\" He came third in his heat of the 200 m backstroke in a time of 2 m 7.04 s, four seconds slower than his effort in the previous Olympics. This placed him in fifteenth position, more than two seconds from qualification for the final. Tonelli then withdrew from the 100 m butterfly to concentrate on the 4 √ó 200 m freestyle relay. He combined with Kerry, Graeme Brewer and Ron McKeon as Australia qualified fourth before coming seventh.Howell, p. 237. Tonelli swam the second leg in the final after leading off in the heats. The Australians were third after the first leg, which was swum by Brewer, the bronze medallist in the corresponding individual event. However, Tonelli split 1 m 53.47 s, the fifth slowest time among the 32 swimmers, resulting in Australia falling back to seventh place by the end of his leg. Kerry and McKeon could not overtake any swimmers in the last two legs and Australia ended the race in seventh place, 1.52 s outside the medals.Howell, p. 240. Tonelli was disappointed with the relay result, feeling that the Australians--who came into the race ranked second in the world in the event--were too casual before the race, incorrectly believing that four fast legs from four fast swimmers would yield the desired result.Tonelli, pp. 5-6. = Relay gold = The 4 √ó 100 m medley relay was the focal point of Tonelli's Moscow campaign. The event had always been won by the United States since its inception at the Olympics at the 1960 Games, and their boycott had opened up the field. Australia's best result had come in the inaugural race, when it out-touched Japan to claim silver. The only other time that it had won a medal was in 1964, taking bronze, and the previous outing in 1976 had seen Australia eliminated in the heats. Australia was regarded as a chance of a medal, but were not seen as the main threats, with Sweden, Great Britain and the Soviet Union the most heavily fancied teams. The hosts' team included the silver medallists in the 100 m backstroke and breaststroke, and their butterflyer had come fifth; their freestyler would come fourth in his event. The British boasted Duncan Goodhew, the breaststroke gold medallist, while Sweden's butterflyer and backstroker had won their respective events and their freestyle swimmer would come second in the 100 m.Howell, p. 233. On paper, Australia's team paled in comparison. Neil Brooks, the freestyler, would come fourteenth in the corresponding individual event after having an asthma attack, while Peter Evans was the only individual medallist in the distance, claiming bronze in the 100 m breaststroke.Andrews, p. 148. Kerry had been eliminated in the backstroke semifinals, while Tonelli was swimming as a makeshift butterflyer.Howell, p. 234. Adding to the pressure was the fact that Australia won no gold medals at the 1976 Olympics in any sport, so the public were still awaiting their first victory since the 1972 Games in Munich.Gordon, p. 333. Coming into the Olympics, Australia were ranked seventh out of the thirteen competing countries.Forrest, p. 212. Australia's prospects improved after Sweden was disqualified in the morning heats. Tonelli, the eldest swimmer in the quartet at the age of 23, convened the team as its de facto leader. He asked his teammates to commit to swimming their legs in a certain time; Kerry vowed to complete the backstroke in 57 s, Evans the breaststroke in 63 s flat, Tonelli the butterfly in 54 s and Brooks promised to anchor the team in 49.8 s, even though he had never gone faster than 51 s. Tonelli named the foursome the Quietly Confident Quartet, and they exhibited a calm self- belief as they lined up for the race.Howell, p. 234. Kerry led off in a faster time than he had clocked in the individual event, but it was still two seconds slower than his personal best time of 57.87 s. This left Australia in fourth place at the end of the first leg. Evans then swam a personal best of 63.01 s, leaving Australia almost level with the host nation at the halfway mark. Tonelli then swam the butterfly leg in 54.94 s, almost two seconds faster his previous best over the distance. He did so with an uneven arm technique due to the unequal strength in his arms.Howell, p. 242. Tonelli's butterfly leg would have been good enough for a silver medal if he had replicated it in the individual event.Andrews, pp. 440-441. He began to lose ground in the last 50 m and was a bodylength behind until a late surge brought him to within a metre of his Soviet opponent by the end of his leg. Brooks then executed a powerful, well-timed dive and surfaced almost even with his Soviet counterpart. By the 50 m mark, he had drawn level and made a superior turn to take the lead. The Soviet freestyler pulled level at the 25 m mark before Brooks sprinted away again to seal an Australian victory by 0.22 s. He had finished his leg in 49.86 s as he had vowed to his teammates.Andrews, p. 63. The time of 3 m 45.70 s sealed Australia's first ever win in a medley relay at the Olympics, for men or women. After the win, Tonelli said \\"I was totally stunned. After all the hassle, and my being the athletes' mouthpiece, we'd come through and done it.\\" In 2000, Tonelli and the other members of the quartet were each awarded the Australian Sports Medal for their victory in Moscow. Relations between the Olympians and the Australian Government remained tense after months of political struggle regarding the boycott.Forrest, p. 213. The quartet did not receive the customary congratulations from Fraser, who initially resisted complaints the next day from the media and government members at his failure to applaud the Australian victory. In a radio interview, he said \\"I hope that circumstances do not arise over the next few years which will cause them to have very great regrets about the fact that they've gone\\". Fraser relented and late in the night, his office sent a telegram indirectly, through the Australian Embassy in Moscow. Fraser had ordered the Australian diplomatic mission to shun the Olympians,Forrest, p. 202. so the embassy staff had to pass the envelopes containing the message through the Olympic Village fence. Fraser's telegram said:Forrest, p. 214. \\"You know I did not and do not approve of Australia being represented at these Olympic Games. I do want to say however that your performance in the relay was a truly great sporting achievement. My personal congratulations.\\" The swimmers tore up the message. Tonelli retired after the Games. His aquatic success was not derived from any physical advantage, as he was relatively small for a swimmer. He was only 185 cm tall and weighed 70 kg, with relatively small hands and feet. Tonelli felt that his success was based around his ability to make fast starts from the blocks, and attributed his success to his mental approach and his ability to convert his energy into a fast swim in under one minute. He had a deliberate strategy of making himself nervous before the race, feeling that he thrived on pressure.Howell, p. 240.  After the 1980 Olympics  After retiring from competition, Tonelli did television commentary for the 1984 and 1988 Olympics in Los Angeles and Seoul respectively. Since 2004, he has been a swimming commentator on Sky News Australia. Outside swimming, he worked at a spastic centre for children in Brisbane in the 1980s before opening his own swimming school. He also completed a series for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on their Lifestyle TV program and produced movies on swimming and child development. Tonelli later set up his own computing business, which he ran for three years. He also served as a sports administrator, completing a term on the Australian Sports Commission in its early years in the 1980s.Gordon, p. 368. One policy that he proposed was the creation of an athletes' appeal tribunal similar to the Court of Arbitration for Sport so that \\"officials are now held accountable for their actions\\". He cited his expulsion from the Australian team as his motivation for having an appeals mechanism.Tonelli, p. 91. As of 2007, Tonelli was working as a real estate agent and corporate speaker. He married his wife Lee in the late 1990s.Tonelli, See also * List of Commonwealth Games medallists in swimming (men) * List of Olympic medalists in swimming (men)  Notes  References  * * Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:Australian male swimmers Category:Alabama Crimson Tide men's swimmers Category:Male butterfly swimmers Category:Male freestyle swimmers Category:Male backstroke swimmers Category:Olympic swimmers of Australia Category:Olympic gold medalists for Australia Category:Australian people of Dutch descent Category:Australian people of Irish descent Category:Swimmers at the 1976 Summer Olympics Category:Swimmers at the 1980 Summer Olympics Category:Commonwealth Games gold medallists for Australia Category:Sportspeople from Ipswich, Queensland Category:Recipients of the Australian Sports Medal Category:World Aquatics Championships medalists in swimming Category:Medalists at the 1980 Summer Olympics Category:Commonwealth Games silver medallists for Australia Category:Swimmers at the 1974 British Commonwealth Games Category:Olympic gold medalists in swimming Category:Commonwealth Games medallists in swimming ","title":"Mark Tonelli"},{"id":"3631946","text":"Arnold is an unincorporated community on the West Fork River in Lewis County, West Virginia, United States.

Colonel Sir Thomas Hungerford Holdich (13 February 1843 ‚Äì 2 November 1929) was an English geographer and president of the Royal Geographical Society. He is best known as Superintendent of Frontier Surveys in British India and author of numerous books, including The Gates of India, The Countries of the King's Award and Political Frontiers and Boundary Making. Born in Dingley, Northamptonshire, England to the Rev. Thomas Peach Holdich, he was educated at Godolphin Grammar School and the Royal Military Academy, obtaining a commission in the Royal Engineers in 1862. He saw active service in the Bhutan expedition of 1865, the Abyssinian campaign of 1867-68 and the Second Afghan War of 1878‚Äì79. During peacetime, he was largely occupied with the survey of India, and served on the Afghan Boundary Commission of 1884‚Äì86, the Tasmar Boundary Commission of 1894, the Pamir Boundary Commission of 1895 and the Perso-Baluchistan Boundary Commission of 1896. He was also engaged in The Cordillera of the Andes Boundary Case by the governments of Argentina and Chile in 1902 to define the boundary along the Andes Mountains. He was awarded the Founder's Gold Medal of the Royal Geographical Society in 1887 in recognition of his work on the Afghan frontier. On his retirement to half-pay in 1898, he thanked \\"that providence which had been good to me in that during that last year of my Indian career I had been able to put a round finish on the last of our frontier maps\\". He was placed on the Retired list with an Indian pension 13 February 1900. In later years, he wrote and lectured extensively on geographical issues, and served as president of the Royal Geographical Society from 1917‚Äì19. He also served as President of the Geographical Association between 1917‚Äì18. He contributed a number of entries to the eleventh edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. > Boundaries are the inevitable product of advancing civilisation; they are > human inventions not necessarily supported by nature's dispositions, and as > such they are only of solid value so long as they can be made strong enough > and secure enough to prevent their violation and infringement. - Sir Thomas > Hungerford Holdich (1916)Political Frontiers and Boundary Making > (London:Macmillan and Co., 1916 p.2.

At the age of 14 years and 6 months, she became the youngest Australian to win an Olympic gold medal, a record that still stands. Morgan began serious training in early 1956 and won Olympic selection for the relay team as well as the 400-metre freestyle. Morgan's selection in the final quartet raised controversy because of her inexperience in top-level racing and her history of false starts. During the final, she lifted her head out of the water and saw her American opponent ahead of her, prompting her to regain the lead with a late burst in the third leg. Australia went on to win the relay in world record time. In her only individual event, Morgan came sixth in the 400-metre freestyle. In 1957, she won the 110-, 220-, and 440-yard treble at the Australian Championships in the absence of her main rivals, but from that point on her career was plagued by illness and weight problems. She was selected in the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games purely as a relay swimmer, winning gold in the event. At her second Olympic Games, the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, she only competed in the 4 √ó 100 relay heats; her teammates went on to win silver in the final. She retired from competitive swimming following the Rome Olympics. In retirement, she has continued her involvement in swimming and the Olympics by teaching disabled children to swim and participating in Olympic educational programs and torch relays. She is also an ambassador for Australia Day and has appeared on television as part of her work with Christian groups.  Early years  Morgan was born in the north-western New South Wales city of Tamworth, before growing up in Punchbowl, a suburb in South-western Sydney.Howell, p. 135. Morgan was the oldest of four children, with two sisters and a brother. Her father Barrington, a plumber, had success as a swimmer in his childhood, but a lack of facilities in rural Australia curtailed his career. As a result, he vowed that his daughter would become a national champion. Morgan said her father \\"became my driving and inspirational force. I not only fulfilled his ambition, but surpassed it by becoming an Olympic champion!\\" Morgan also cited her meetings with Frederick Lane‚ÄîAustralia's first Olympic gold medallist in swimming‚Äîand the Olympic athletics champion Marjorie Jackson-Nelson as key inspirational moments in her career. Morgan learned to swim at Bankstown at the age of 7. She was initially slow to learn, and her coach used a long pole attached to a rope and belt to maintain her safety. This allowed him to fish her out of the water if she fell into difficulty. Due to her slow learning, Morgan was given twice the number of lessons as the other students. At the age of eight, she won the district championship, and in 1953, aged 11, she won the New South Wales (NSW) Primary School Championships. In February 1956, aged 13, she was taken for serious training. Her father transferred her to the tutelage of Frank Guthrie in Enfield. At the time, Guthrie was regarded as one of the best coaches in the state; his students included Gary Chapman, Kevin O'Halloran and Lorraine Crapp. All three (plus Morgan) would win medals at the 1956 Summer Olympics.Howell, p. 136. Her mother had to drive her to Enfield, as her father was busy with the plumbing business.  National selection  Under Guthrie's coaching, Morgan quickly became one of the fastest junior swimmers in the state, winning the under-14 110-yard and 55-yard freestyle, as well as the 110-yard butterfly at the New South Wales Championships in 1956. She went on to win the junior 110-yard freestyle at the Australian Championships, despite causing two false starts. After the national titles, she represented Marrickville Junior Girls' High School and won the State Combined High School Championship in the 110-yard freestyle. Although her times were among the fastest in the country, Morgan's youth prevented selection for the Olympic training squad. However, the Australian Swimming Union allowed her to join the squad for training in Townsville at her own expense. Her family was unable to meet these costs, but a fundraising campaign by the Bankstown community allowed her to make the trip. Training in the Tobruk Memorial Baths alongside swimmers such as Crapp, Alva Colquhoun, Faith Leech and Dawn Fraser, Morgan's times steadily improved. The team were expected to swim three times a day, totalling more than . However, Morgan was not regarded as a likely selection in the final team. Following the training camp, a series of selection trials were held in Brisbane and Melbourne. In three 100-metre races, Morgan came third, fifth and fourth respectively, with a best time of 1 minute 7.3 seconds. She recorded a best performance of third in a time of 5 minutes 10.0 seconds in the 400-metre freestyle behind Crapp and Fraser. Australia was entitled to three representatives in each individual event, thus allowing Morgan to compete in her first Olympics. Morgan missed out in the 100-metre freestyle as Fraser, Crapp and Leech were selected,Howell, p. 134. but she gained an individual berth in the 400-metre along with Fraser and Crapp. She was one of six swimmers selected for the 4√ó100-metre freestyle relay squad, the first from Australia to compete at Olympic level. Morgan was placed under substantial pressure by media commentary that regarded her as the weak link in the relay team.  1956 Summer Olympics  Arriving in Melbourne for the Olympics, Morgan was not assured of a place in the final relay quartet. Fraser and Crapp were rested in the heats on 4 December while the remaining four swimmers qualified the team. Morgan swam the second leg in 1 minute 5.4 seconds, the fastest of the Australians, securing her position in the final four along with Leech. Australia qualified quickest for the final, winning the second heat by 3.1 seconds. They were 1.8 and 2.3 seconds faster than the South Africans and Americans, respectively, both of which swam in the first heat. Margaret Gibson, Elizabeth Frazer, Faith Leech. The team for the final was Dawn Fraser, Leech, Morgan and Lorraine Crapp. The selection of Leech and Morgan for the 6 December final generated controversy, as they were the two youngest swimmers in the squad and lacked experience at open level competition. Both had competed only once at senior Australian level; Morgan had twice false started at the 1956 Australian Championships, while Leech had been too ill to compete. Australia was the favourite for the relay, having swept the medals in the individual 100-metre event; Fraser, Crapp and Leech finished first, second and third.Howell, p. 131. The favouritism was even more marked because Fraser and Crapp were three seconds faster than everyone else in the world. The Australian team made a poor start in the final after Fraser almost stopped during the first leg, believing that a false start had occurred after mistakenly hearing a second gunshot. She finished her leg in 1 minute 4.0 seconds, almost two seconds slower than her personal best, but enough for a 2.3-second lead over the United States' Sylvia Ruuska. Swimming the second leg, Leech maintained the lead in the first 50 metres but faded in the second half and finished with a split of 1 minute 5.1 seconds; the Australian lead was thus cut to 0.9 s. Morgan dived in for the third leg and was then overhauled and passed by American Nancy Simons. With 25 metres left, Morgan took her head out of the water‚Äîa fundamental error‚Äîand seeing the American a body length in front, responded with a surge to regain a 0.7-second lead heading into the final changeover. Crapp then extended the margin to 2.2 seconds to secure an Australian victory in a world-record time of 4 minutes 17.1 seconds.Howell, p. 132.Andrews, pp. 307‚Äì308. The victory was the first time that Australia had swept the 100-metre freestyle relay and individual events for both men and women. The only other time that this has been achieved was by the Americans in 1920 in Antwerp. The win would be Australia's only triumph in a female swimming relay at the Olympics until the 2004 Games in Athens. The victory made Morgan Australia's youngest-ever gold medallist; this record still stands.Andrews, pp. 358‚Äì359. Morgan's individual event was the 400-metre freestyle. She reduced her personal best by 2.3 seconds in recording a time of 5 minutes 7.8 seconds in the heats, just 0.2 of a second behind Marley Shriver of the United States, who set a new Olympic record. The mark was surpassed in later heats by Fraser and Crapp, but Morgan nevertheless qualified fourth fastest for the final, almost seven seconds faster than the cutoff. The final was held the day after the relay final. Morgan was unable to repeat her heat performance, finishing sixth in a time of 5 minutes 14.3 seconds, far outside her personal best. Had she repeated her heat swim, she would have placed fourth, just 0.7 of a second from the bronze medal. Nevertheless, she noted that \\"I was so happy that I had made the final in an individual event in the Olympic Games, for this was my first appearance in a senior competition\\". Upon her return to Bankstown, Morgan was honoured with a civic reception and presented with a gold watch and life membership of the Bankstown Pool. However, her stay at the Olympic Village had given rise to a new problem. She enjoyed the food so much that she had gained in weight, and now stood at and weighed . This heralded the start of a continual weight problem.Howell, p. 137.  Later career  After the Olympics, Crapp and Fraser took a break from competitive swimming, while Leech retired. This allowed Morgan an opening, and she won both the junior and open sprint titles at the 1957 New South Wales Championships. She followed this by winning three individual titles at the Australian Championships in Canberra: the 110-, 220- and 440-yard freestyle, in times of 1 minute 7.8 seconds; 2 minutes 29.3 seconds; and 5 minutes 21.6 seconds, respectively. Her times were slower than her bests in 1956. She was part of the New South Wales team that won the 4√ó100-yard freestyle and medley relays, anchoring both quartets. In 1958, Crapp and Fraser returned to the pool, while Ilsa Konrads emerged as a leading swimmer. At the Australian Championships, Morgan came third in both the 110-yard and 440-yard freestyle events; Fraser won both and Crapp and Konrads placed second in the 110-yard and 440-yard freestyle respectively. Morgan was selected for the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Cardiff, Wales, but only in the 4√ó110-yard freestyle relay. Along with Fraser, Crapp and Konrads, she broke the world record for the event in March in Sydney with a time of 4 minutes 18.9 seconds. At the Empire Games, Fraser, Crapp, Morgan and Colquhoun lowered the world record to a time of 4 minutes 17.4 seconds to win gold. After the Empire Games, the Australian team returned home via France, Austria, Germany, Netherlands, Italy and Singapore for a series of competitions. Morgan's best performances were at the Dutch and French Championships, where she came third in the 400-metre events. In 1959, she placed third in both the 440-yard and 880-yard freestyle events at the Australian Championships. Her swimming career was then interrupted by bronchitis, which developed into bronchial pneumonia. The illness forced her to take an extended break. Her chest problems persisted when she returned to competition at the 1960 Australian Championships, placing third in the 220-yard and 440-yard freestyle and fifth in the 110-yard freestyle. She gained selection for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome as a member of the 4√ó100-metre freestyle relay squad. She swam the first leg in the heats, posting a time of 1 minute 5.5 seconds, giving Australia a 1.0-second lead. Australia led at every change and went on to win its heat by five seconds, qualifying fastest for the final. However, Morgan posted the slowest leg of the Australian quartet and was dropped when Fraser and Konrads were brought into the team for the final, in which Australia won silver. Under the rules of the time, heat swimmers were not awarded medals if the final quartet placed in the top three positions.Andrews, p. 323. Suffering from periodic chest pain, Morgan retired from competitive swimming in December 1960.  After swimming  Morgan married George Beavis in 1965 and had three daughters, all of whom enjoyed swimming victories at school and district level. After her marriage, she lived in the Outback towns of Griffith and Orange for six years before returning to Sydney. She experimented with coaching, but found the competition unappealing and became a schoolteacher. In 1978, she began teaching handicapped children to swim in her backyard pool, and was given a government grant to continue her work. She then ran a swimming school at Bonnet Bay for 15 years and worked at the Bates Drive Special School, receiving a grant to teach preschool handicapped children swimming. In later life, Morgan successfully fought a life-threatening battle against lupus, and in 2004 she was living in Sutherland Shire in southern Sydney. A committed Christian, Morgan has been a public speaker at functions for Seasons Christian Women's Conference. From January 1996 to mid-1999, she lived in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, along with her husband, who was posted there by his employer. During that time, Morgan worked as a Bible teacher at St Andrew's Presbyterian Church, Kuala Lumpur. She has also appeared on Face to Face, a Christian television talk show that screens on the Ten Network. In 1995, Morgan was inducted into the Hall of Champions at the State Sports Centre and the Path of Champions at the Sydney Olympic Park Aquatic Centre. She has been involved in educational programs aimed at promoting the Olympic movement in schools and helps to raise funds for the Australian Olympic Committee. In 2000, Morgan was awarded the Australian Government's Australian Sports Medal for her contributions to the 2000 Summer Olympics held in Sydney and her achievements as a competitor. She has been awarded the honour of carrying the Olympic torch during its passage through Australia in both 2000 and 2004. Morgan is an Australia Day ambassador, and travels to regional towns promoting the annual celebrations.

She was a student of Marcel Mauss, worked with noted French anthropologist Marcel Griaule (1898-1956) and Jean Rouch, wrote on a large range of ethnographic topics and made pioneering contributions to the study of myths, initiations, techniques (particularly \\"descriptive ethnography\\"), graphic systems, objects, classifications, ritual and social structure. She is most noted for her work among the Dogon and the Bambara of Mali, having lived with them for over twenty years, often in collaboration with Marcel Griaule, with whom she wrote an important book entitled The Pale Fox (1965). The Amazing and Intriguing Dogons by Leon Dixon (June 19, 2010)Dogon Restudied - A Field Evaluation of the Work of Marcel Griaule by Walter E. A. van Beek Paroles Themes Some of the main themes in her work concentrate on the notions of sacred kingship, the position of the first born, relationships between maternal uncles and nephews, division of labor, marriage, and the status of the rainmaker in Dogon society. Because each episode of the rite is enacted only once every sixty years, Dieterlen's documentation of the Sigui cycle Ancestral Initiation, article by Allen F. Roberts, University of California, Los Angeles was thought to allow the Dogon themselves to see and interpret the entire sequence of rites which they had heretofore only observed in part. Research Dieterlen began her ethnographic research in Bandiagara, Mali, in 1941. Perhaps most controversially, Dieterlen was criticized by her peers for her publications with Griaule on Dogon astronomy, which professed an ancient knowledge of the existence of a dwarf white star, Sirius B also called the Dog Star, invisible to the naked eye. This ancient indigenous knowledge (the Nommo) and the supposition that extraterrestrials might have been in contact with the Dogon was popularized by Robert K. G. Temple in his book The Sirius Mystery (1976) and Tom Robbins Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas (1995). Dutch anthropologist W.E.A. van Beek, who spent seven years with the Dogon, seriously critiqued the research methods of Griaule and Dieterlen, suggesting, based on a conceived scenario presented by Brecher and Sagan, that they relied heavily on one primary informant who may have been influenced by the teachings of a Jesuit missionary who may have lived in the region prior to their arrival (Dogon Restudied 1991). He accuses Griaule of misinterpreting and influencing results.Walter E. A. van Beek: \\"Dogon Restudied: A Field Evaluation of the Work of Marcel Griaule.\\" Current Anthropology, 32 (1991): 139-167. In addition, skeptic and space journalist, James Oberg in his investigation of the Dogon mystery, found no substantial evidence that would indicate outside influence, and sees such proposed scenarios as being \\"entirely circumstantial\\".James Oberg, \\"Chapter 6, The Sirius Mystery\\", in UFOs and Outer Space Mysteries, (1982) Donning Press Daughter and colleague of Marcel Griaule, Genevi√®ve Calame-Griaule (see :fr: Genevi√®ve Calame-Griaule), defended her, dismissing van Beek's criticism as misguided speculation and being rooted in an apparent ignorance of esoteric tradition. Genevi√®ve Calame- Griaule: \\"On the Dogon Restudied.\\" Current Anthropology, Vol. 32, No. 5 (Dec., 1991), pp. 575-577 Academic career Dieterlen also served as a Director of Studies at Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes at the Sorbonne in Paris, a founding member of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), and a President of the Committee on Ethnographic Film (founded by Jean Rouch, with whom she worked and made important ethnographic films). An \\"hommage\\" collection published in 1978 (Syst√®mes de signes: Textes r√©unis en hommage √† Germaine Dieterlen) included essays by Meyer Fortes and Claude L√©vi-Strauss. Dieterlen also worked with other noted ethnographic filmmakers like Marcel Griaule. Mary Douglas reviewed the contributions made by Dieterlen to French anthropology in Dogon Culture - Profane and Arcane (1968) and If the Dogon . . . (1975). The Dogon gave Germaine Dieterlene the name of Madame l'√âternelle (The Eternal Lady) in memory of the work she made together with Marcel Griaule.

It was announced in Lusaka, Zambia in October 1971 as a merger of the two principal African nationalist factions in Rhodesia, the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) and the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU). However, it was in fact a breakaway faction of both ZAPU and ZANU, established by members of both groups who had become disaffected due to their rival organisations' incessant internal and external disputes. Its domination by members of the Zezuru, a subgroup of the Shona people, led to accusations that it was merely a tribal grouping and ridicule as the \\"Front for the Liaison of Zezuru Intellectuals\\". The organisation declared its support for national unity in its draft constitution and excoriated the divisions of ZANU and ZAPU, which had undermined their effectiveness in combating the Rhodesian regime. As the constitution said, FROLIZI's first leaders were Skilkom Siwela and Godfrey Savanhu; there were reportedly plans to appoint Robert Mugabe of ZANU as a supposed \\"unity\\" leader, but this did not happen due to the failure of a plot which had been intended to bring it about. FROLIZI's leadership circulated a letter falsely claiming that ZAPU's leader Joshua Nkomo and ZANU's leader Ndabaningi Sithole had agreed to support Mugabe as the leader of FROLIZI, which would bring together both ZANU and ZAPU. However, Sithole learned of the plot and circulated a letter denouncing FROLIZI, and ZAPU's Deputy National Secretary dismissed FROLIZI as \\"a haven of refuge for political rejects\\". Mugabe remained in ZANU and eventually managed to seize control of the organisation in 1975. Siwela and Savanhu were ousted in 1972 by James Chikerema, George Nyandoro and Nathan Shamuyarira. While FROLIZI did not manage to establish a presence in Rhodesia, it sought to ally with African National Council. It had very few members and no significant armed grouping of its own, though armed members were reported to have infiltrated across the Zambian border in the northern Karoi region of Rhodesia and carried out an attack on a white-owned farm in 1972.Africa: The Adelphi Papers, Volume I, p. 20 It obtained significant outside support for a while but collapsed in 1973 after being passed over by the Organisation of African Unity's Liberation Committee in favour of the other two principal Zimbabwean liberation movements. Its members mostly went over to ZANU following FROLIZI's demise.

A tall and lean swimmer known for her elegant technique, Leech started swimming as a child to build strength after a series of stomach disorders in her infancy. She quickly rose to prominence after breaking a string of age group records. In 1955, she became the youngest swimmer to win an Australian title, claiming victory in the 110-yard freestyle at the age of 13. She twice broke the Australian record in the 100-yard freestyle in late 1955, thereby positioning herself as a leading contender for Olympic selection in 1956. Leech's preparation was hindered by illness, which forced her out of the 1956 Australian Championships, but she recovered to gain Olympic selection in both the 100-metre freestyle and the corresponding relay. Leech produced a late surge to take bronze in the individual event and seal an Australian trifecta, before swimming the second leg in the relay to help secure an Australian victory in world record time. Leech retired after the Olympics at the age of 15; she cited anxiety caused by racing as one of the main factors in her decision.  Early years The second child of Johnstone Melmore and Jessie Francis Leech, Leech was born in Bendigo in Australia. She was given the name Faith after her elder sister, who died from leukaemia at the age of two.Howell, p. 133. A delicate child, Leech had an aversion to eating in the first two years of her life, so her mother fed her in small hourly doses. Leech was twice rushed from the family home to a Melbourne hospital. Conventional medicine failed to rectify Leech's dietary issues, so her mother put her on a fast for ten days at the recommendation of a naturopath. Leech was later placed on a diet of fruit, salad and vegetables, with an emphasis on beetroot juice and carrot juice. Leech's health improved, but she remained slight and frail, with a double curvature of the back. In an effort to help her gain muscle control and confidence, her parents sent her to start ballet dancing, before trying swimming, a sport her mother had competed in. Aged six, she was taken to swimming classes while the family holidayed in the Mornington Peninsula. Leech was coached by Gus Froelich, a former European swimming champion and coach of Australian Olympic medallist Judy-Joy Davies. After a difficult start, Leech improved in her second year. At the Victorian Championships, she showed her potential by setting a state record of 17.4 seconds (s) for the 25-yard freestyle in the under-8 division. The following year, she covered 25 yards in 15.7 seconds, three seconds faster than Davies had done at the same age. She progressed steadily, sweeping the state age titles from nine to 13, setting records that were often faster than those by boys of the same age. Living in Bendigo and studying at Camp Hill Primary School, Leech could only travel three times a year to train with Froelich, so she relied heavily on dry land simulations, such as a pulley attached to the kitchen door. When she was 12, she covered 110 yards in 1 minute (min) 7.1 seconds, setting an unofficial world record for her age group.Howell, p. 134. This achievement prompted her parents to rent an apartment in Melbourne, so she could train with Froelich on a regular basis. Leech moved there with her mother, while her father stayed in Bendigo to look after the family's jewellery business. From 1954, Leech attended St. Michael's Girls' Grammar School and trained with Froelich on a daily basis at the City Baths. The regular sessions paid off at the 1955 Victorian Championships; Leech won the open 110- and 220-yard freestyle in times of 1 minute 7.2 seconds and 2 minutes 39.3 seconds, respectively, setting state records in both events. She proceeded to the Australian Championships, winning the 110-yard freestyle in 1 minute 7.6 seconds to become the youngest ever winner of an open title at the age of 13. Leech also won the national junior 110- and 220-yard events. Leech's regimen differed from most swimmers because Froelich was not an advocate of distance training, and designed shorter workouts for his students. She trained once a day, swimming no more than . Froelich did not push her to continue swimming laps when she felt tired, but emphasised an efficient stroke mechanism, which Leech implemented with a long and graceful arm action. Leech stood 180 centimetres (5'11\\"), but weighed only , with broad shoulders, slim hips and large hands and feet. Her long streamlined action prompted observers to call her a \\"flying fish\\". Spinal problems caused by a back misalignment prevented her from using the optimal flip turn preferred by freestyle swimmers. Instead, she was forced to utilise the touch turn, which was slower.  National selection  In August 1955, Leech set an Australian record of 1 minute 5.0 seconds for the 110-yard freestyle, before lowering it to 1 minute 4.8 seconds in October; this prompted newspapers to trumpet her as a prospect for the Melbourne Olympics. She did not get an opportunity to defend her Australian title in 1956 because she was hospitalised with illness. Leech recovered in time to win the national age title in the 100-metre freestyle in a time of 1 minute 4.6 seconds, just 0.1 of a second outside Dawn Fraser's world record. She then posted a time of 1 minute 4.6 seconds to defeat Fraser and Lorraine Crapp at another meeting in the following month. Leech was named in the Olympic squad and the Australian Swimming Union exempted her from travelling to the national training camp in Townsville so she could train with Froelich, who understood her special dietary requirements. She joined the squad for the final race trials in Melbourne in October before the Olympics. Fraser and Crapp were too strong in the 100-metre freestyle, with Leech finishing second and third in the two races. After combining with Fraser, Crapp and Margaret Gibson to break the world record for the 4√ó100-metre freestyle relay, Leech was selected as one of Australia's three entrants in the 100-metre freestyle events and one of six swimmers for the 4√ó100-metre freestyle relay squad for the Olympics. International career The Australian 4√ó100-metre relay team (second heat) at the 1956 Summer Olympics (left to right: Sandra Morgan, Margaret Gibson, Elizabeth Fraser, Leech). Having arrived at the Olympics, Leech made her debut in the 100-metre freestyle, an event in which she, Fraser and Crapp were regarded as the three strongest competitors, although the latter two were considered to be substantially stronger. All three won their heats. Leech won her heat by 1.6 seconds in a time of 1 minute 4.9 seconds. She was third fastest qualifier behind Fraser and Crapp, who were over 1.5 seconds faster. Drawn in Fraser's semifinal, Leech finished second in a time of 1 minute 5.2 seconds, and was the third fastest qualifier for the final behind her compatriots. The semifinals followed a similar pattern to the heats, with Fraser and Crapp more than two seconds ahead of the six remaining qualifiers, who were separated by just 0.8 of a second. This pattern was repeated in the final. Fraser and Crapp were far ahead of the field, finishing in 1 minute 2.0 seconds and 1 minute 2.3 seconds, respectively. Leech overtook the United States' Joan Rosazza in the final 25 metres to take bronze in 1 minute 5.1 seconds. The race for third place had been tight, with just 0.7 of a second separating Leech and the final finisher. The youngest swimmer in the field, Leech had come through to claim the last podium position. Leech said that it was an emotional occasion, having seen the Australian men take a trifecta in the corresponding event on the previous night of racing. As the Australians boasted the three fastest swimmers in the individual 100-metre freestyle event, they were clear favourites for the corresponding relay, especially as Fraser and Crapp were three seconds faster than all of the other swimmers. Leech was not assured of a place in the final quartet. In the heats, Fraser and Crapp were rested and the remaining four swimmers, Sandra Morgan, Elizabeth Fraser, Gibson and Leech qualified the team. Leech swam the second leg in 1 minute 5.9 seconds, the second fastest of the Australians, thereby securing her position in the final along with Sandra Morgan, who recorded a time of 1 minute 5.4 seconds.Howell, p. 131. Australia won the second heat by 3.1 seconds to qualify quickest for the final. They were 1.8 and 2.3 seconds faster than South Africa and the United States, respectively, both of whom swam in the first heat. The selection of Leech and Morgan generated controversy. They were Australia's youngest swimmers and lacked experience at open level competition: Morgan had false started twice at the Australian Championships, and both had competed at national level only once. The winning quartet: Sandra Morgan, Dawn Fraser, Lorraine Crapp and Faith Leech. In the final, Australia made a poor start; Dawn Fraser almost stopped when she heard a second gunshot, believing that a false start had occurred. She finished her leg in 1 minute 4.0 seconds, two seconds slower than the world record she set in the individual 100-metre final, but with a 2.3-second lead over the United States' Sylvia Ruuska.Howell, p. 132. Nevertheless, this meant that Australia had a smaller than expected advantage. Swimming the second leg, Leech maintained the lead in the first 50 metres but faded in the second half and finished with a split of 1 minute 5.1 seconds, with the Australian lead cut to 0.9 of a second. Even with the advantage of a flying start, Leech's leg was 0.4 of a second slower than her fastest time during the individual competition. Morgan was then overhauled and passed by Nancy Simons. With 25 metres left, Morgan took her head out of the water, and seeing the American a body length in front, dug deep to re-establish a lead of 0.7 of a second going into the final changeover.Howell, p. 136. Crapp then extended the lead over the United States to 2.2 seconds to secure gold in a world record time of 4 minutes 17.1 seconds. The Melbourne Olympics was the only time that Australia has made a clean sweep of the 100-metre freestyle and the relay events for both men and women. This feat has only been equalled by the Americans at the 1920 Summer Olympics. The victory was Australia's only victory in a female swimming relay at the Olympics until the 2004 Summer Olympics.  Retirement  After the 1956 Olympics, Leech retired from competitive swimming at the age of 15. She was the first person from Bendigo to win an Olympic medal and was feted upon returning to her hometown. She regarded the experience of living in the Olympic Village as an unusual one; in addition to the large crowds and the pressure of an Olympics, it was the first time that she had been away from the family home. Physicians endorsed her decision to retire, feeling that she became too nervous prior to races. Leech briefly worked in Melbourne as a model, before returning to Bendigo to help run the family jewellery business. She took a leading role in the business after the death of her father in the 1970s, before handing control of the firm to her son. Leech married Mitch Tuohy and had two sons, Adam and Troy, whom she discouraged from entering competitive swimming, fearing the pressure and strain of racing. In retirement, she shunned competitive sport, but maintained her fitness and athleticism.Andrews, p. 249.Howell, p. 135. She taught swimming to disabled children, some of whom represented Australia at the Special Olympics. Leech continued her involvement with the Olympic movement through volunteer work. In July 1999, Leech and Australia's then-oldest man and World War I veteran Jack Lockett were the guests of honour at a countdown celebration to the arrival of the Olympic Torch in Bendigo in July 2000. In 2001, she was diagnosed with a tumour in her neck, which was the size of a 50c coin. The tumour was removed in a seven-hour operation followed by six weeks of radiotherapy treatment. This experience prompted her to become a volunteer for the Cancer Council and help those who were diagnosed with the disease. In February 2003, Leech phoned quadruple Olympic champion Betty Cuthbert to comfort her during her recovery from a brain hemorrhage. In October 2006, Leech combined with 1956 teammate John Devitt to launch \\"50 Years On‚ÄîThe Melbourne Olympics\\", a series of stamps from the Australia Post. Leech is an inductee of the Path of Champions at Sydney Olympic Park Aquatic Centre. She died at her home on 14 September 2013, aged 72.

She is perhaps best known for resolving a dispute at a team meeting during the Rome Olympics. Making her first appearance for Australia at the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Cardiff, Wales, Colquhuon combined with Dawn Fraser, Lorraine Crapp and Sandra Morgan to win the 110-yard freestyle.

It was developed by Microsoft to help deploy Windows Vista and subsequent versions of the Windows operating system family, as well as Windows Fundamentals for Legacy PCs.  Design  Like other disk image formats, a WIM file contains a set of files and associated filesystem metadata. However, unlike sector-based formats (such as ISO or VHD), WIM is file-based: The fundamental unit of information in a WIM is a file. The primary advantages of being file-based is hardware independence and single-instance storage of a file referenced multiple times in the filesystem tree. Since the files are stored inside a single WIM file, the overhead of opening and closing many individual files is reduced. The cost of reading or writing many thousands of individual files on the local disk is negated by hardware and software-based disk caching as well as sequential reading and writing of the data. WIM files can contain multiple disk images, which are referenced either by their numerical index or by their unique name. Due to the use of single-instance storage, the more each successive disk image has in common with previous images added to the WIM file, the less new data will be added. A WIM can also be split (spanned) into multiple parts, which have the extension. WIM images can be made bootable (WIMBoot). Windows boot loader supports booting Windows from within a WIM file. Windows Setup DVD in Windows Vista and later use such WIM files. In this case, BOOT.WIM contains a bootable version of Windows PE from which the installation is performed. Other setup files are held in the INSTALL.WIM. WIM supports three families of LZ77-based compression algorithms in ascending ratio and descending speed: XPRESS, LZX, and LZMS. The former two use Huffman encoding, while the latter uses adaptive Huffman encoding with range coding. There is also support for solid compression. Both solid compression and LZMS are introduced more recently, in WIMGAPI Windows 8 and DISM Windows 8.1.  Tools  = ImageX = ImageX is the command-line tool used to create, edit and deploy Windows disk images in the Windows Imaging Format. Along with the underlying Windows Imaging Interface library (WIMGAPI), It is distributed as part of the free Windows Automated Installation Kit (WAIK/OPK). Starting with Windows Vista, Windows Setup uses the WAIK API to install Windows. The first distributed prototype of ImageX was build 6.0.4007.0 (main.030212-2037). It allowed Microsoft OEM partners to experiment with the imaging technology and was developed in parallel with Longhorn alpha prototypes. It was first introduced in Milestone 4 into the Longhorn project, and used in later builds of Longhorn. Build 6.0.5384.4 added significant advantages over previous versions, like read-only and read/write folder mounting capabilities, splitting to multiple image files (SWM), a WIM filter driver and the latest compression algorithms. It has been used since pre-RC (release candidates) of Windows Vista. = DISM = Deployment Image Service and Management Tool (DISM) is a tool introduced in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 that can perform servicing tasks on a Windows installation image, be it an online image (i.e. the one the user is running) or an offline image within a folder or WIM file. Its features include mounting and unmounting images, querying installed device drivers in an offline image, and adding a device driver to an offline image. It is now possible to repair with DISM any image using either a Windows Installation CD or Windows Update. Before Windows Server 2012 and Windows 8, DISM had incorporated the majority of ImageX functions but not all; ImageX was still needed for image capture. However, DISM deprecated ImageX in Windows 8. = Support in other operating systems = Since April 30, 2012, an open source library for handling the WIM format is available. This library can be used on Unix-like systems as well as on Windows. Thanks to this project, Linux distributions now have their own imagex clone called wimlib-imagex which allows mounting WIM images and managing them (read/write) like any other block-storage provider. As WIM images use somewhat common compression algorithms, they can be accessed by using file archivers like 7-Zip. For other operating systems that might not support this format, it is still possible to convert .wim images to the more commonly used ISO image using the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit on Windows.

Produced by Daiei Film, it is the second entry in the Gamera film series, and stars K≈çjir≈ç Hong≈ç, Ky≈çko Enami, and Y≈´z≈ç Hayakawa, with Teruo Aragaki as Gamera. In the film, Gamera returns to Earth to battle a reptilian monster born out of an opal brought to Japan by greedy entrepreneurs. Due to the success of Gamera, the Giant Monster, studio president Masaichi Nagata pushed a sequel into production. Yunosaburo Saito was commissioned to write a story outline, which featured Gamera battling alien ice giants. Nagata instructed screenwriter Niisan Takahashi to write a \\"lavish\\" blockbuster and treat the monster spectacle seriously. Nagata promoted the project into an A-list production by approving a higher budget and attaching acclaimed talent. However, Yuasa, director of the previous film, was demoted to special effects director for this film. Principal photography for special effects began in January 1966 and ended in April 1966, while photography for drama scenes began in February 1966 and ended in April 1966. Gamera vs. Barugon was theatrically released in Japan on April 17, 1966 on a double-bill with Daimajin and underperformed at the Japanese box office. The film was followed by Gamera vs. Gyaos, released on March 15, 1967. Plot Six months after the events of Gamera, the Giant Monster, a meteorite collides with the Z Plan rocket and frees Gamera, who returns to Earth and attacks Kurobe Dam in Japan. Ichiro, a World War II veteran, sends Kawajiri, Onodera, and his brother Keisuke, to an island in New Guinea to retrieve an opal he once found and hid in a cave. Despite warnings from the local villagers, the trio find and locate the opal, but Kawajiri dies from a fatal scorpion sting. Keisuke is betrayed by Onodera and nearly killed. Keisuke is rescued by the locals and reveals to a native, Karen, of the opal they found. Karen reveals that the opal is not a jewel and convinces Keisuke to take her to Japan to retrieve it. En route back to Japan, Onodera accidentally leaves the opal exposed to an infrared light. The heat incubates the opal - revealed to be an egg - and a lizard, Barugon, hatches. Upon arriving to Kobe Harbor, the ship is suddenly destroyed. Ichiro finds Onodera, who tells him that Keisuke and Kawajiri died in the jungle. Having grown to immense size, Barugon surfaces from the harbor and proceeds to attack. While debating how to recover the opal, which he still believes to be aboard the sunken ship, Onodera inadvertently blurts out that he killed his two companions and then murders both Ichiro and his wife to cover up his crime. Barugon's rainbow ray attracts Gamera and the two battle in Osaka. However, Barugon freezes Gamera in place. Keisuke and Karen find Onodera, subdue him, and leave him tied up in his home. Keisuke and Karen suggest a plan to the defense ministry by using a huge diamond to lure Barugon into a lake to drown. The plan fails due to the diamond's insufficient radiation. Another attempt by irradiating the diamond with additional infrared radiation almost succeeds, until Onodera interferes and steals the gem. However, both he and the diamond are devoured by Barugon. Keisuke discovers that mirrors are not affected by Barugon's rainbow ray, so the military devises a plan to reflect its own rainbow emanation back with a giant mirror. Barugon is wounded, but realizing its mistake, refuses to shoot another rainbow. Gamera thaws out and attacks Barugon once again. After battling, Gamera drowns Barugon in Lake Biwa, then flies away. Keisuke mourns over the events caused by his greed, believing he is now alone. However, Karen holds his hand and tells him he is not alone.

Producer and studio head Masaichi Nagata promoted the film into an A-list production, assigning acclaimed director Shigeo Tanaka and acclaimed composer Chuji Kinoshita to the film. Yuasa, director of the previous Gamera film, was demoted to special effects director for Gamera vs. Barugon, despite the previous film being a financial success. Despite his demotion, Yuasa later stated the he had a father/son relationship with Tanaka. Yuasa recalled that Daiei wanted to target the film to an adult audience, stating, \\"I thought that mixing melodrama and monsters was difficult to do.\\" With the film being produced as an A-list production, Nagata chose Kojiro Hongo for the lead after wanting him to headline a film for some time, despite Hongo's uncertainty. Hongo felt \\"stuck\\" with performing in the film and initially attempted to drop out by faking an illness, which caused production to delay for a month. Upon learning that the production manager and section manager were coming to see him, Hongo placed blood-stained tissues in the trash and pretended to have chills, which convinced the managers and agreed to wait for his recovery, to Hongo's dismay. Hongo did not read the script after receiving it, believing that little acting was involved due to Yuasa telling him where the monsters would be placed. However, Hongo was unaware there were two directors: one for special effects and one for acting scenes. Years later, Hongo admitted to being grateful and proud to have been involved with the Gamera and Daimajin films. A scene that featured Osamu Abe's character slipping on a banana peel was cut to remove the comedic tone of the scene. Principal photography for the drama scenes directed by Tanaka began on February 20, 1966 and wrapped on April 5, 1966. =Writing= Screenwriter Niisan Takahashi was told to write a \\"lavish spectacle\\" and to treat the monster elements seriously. The film was originally developed as Gamera vs. the Ice Giants, which featured humanoid ice monsters bringing forth a new ice age on the world until Gamera returns to challenge them. The story outline was written by Yunosaburo Saito. This version began with volcanic eruptions and flying saucer sightings. The volcanic ash pollutes the atmosphere and ushers in a new ice age. Mankind learns that ice aliens are responsible for the eruptions. The aliens are described as hideous with their skeletons and organs transparent through their icy bodies. The aliens drop nuclear bombs into additional volcanoes to further terraform the planet and enslave humanity. Gamera is freed from the Z-Plan rocket and returns to Earth as a battle breaks between humans and the aliens. Takahashi was inspired by the J√∂tnar from Norse mythology and the snow giants from The Conquest of the Pole, however, the ice creatures were redeveloped into Barugon. However, the ice giant idea was later redeveloped into Daimajin, dropping the ice element in favor of stone. Barugon's name was contracted from \\"Baru\\" (an aboriginal word for \\"crocodile's ancestor\\") and \\"Gon\\", derived from the English word for \\"dragon\\". The original screenplay had ideas and scene that were altered in the final film. The following are the noted differences. Barugon's back horns emitted different colors. The re-cap from the film's opening was added during post-production for audiences who had not seen the previous film. The script opened with Keisuke Hirata flying a Cessna with his instructor over Osaka, only to lose control due to radio interference. The scene then cuts to outer space where the Z-Plan rocket carrying Gamera nearly collides with a meteorite. Mission control manage to evade collision, however, the altered trajectory lures the rocket back to Earth and frees Gamera upon entering the Earth's atmosphere. Gamera's attack on Kurobe Dam intercut with Keisuke on the Cessna. The establishing shot of women practicing koto was not in the script. The dancing female natives were originally topless. The quicksand scene was not featured in the script. The script featured a discussion between Keisuke and Onodera regarding bringing Kawajiri's bones back to Japan, with Onodera insisting there was no time. A scene from the script featured Onodera making his getaway at night by hijacking Dr. Matsushita's jeep. The script had Gamera flying over Onodera's ship in Kobe Bay, triggering the opal to glow. In his haste to see Gamers, Onodera kicks over the infrared lamp towards his coat pocket holding the opal. When Keisuke and Karen arrive in Japan, the dialogue remains the same as in the final film, but the script had Keisuke panicking and Karen unveil the diamond at this stage. Onodera learns about the diamond through a radio report while still tied up, as his mistress was not part of the script. In the original ending, in response to Keisuke saying he has nothing anymore, Karen asks if he has abandoned his dream of owning his own air service. =Special effects= Noriaki Yuasa directed the film's special effects. Yonesaburo Tsukiji, the effects director of the previous film, did not return due to leaving Daiei to form his own company. Yuasa began filming the effects on January 22, 1966, beginning with the Kurobe Dam attack scene. Effects photography wrapped on April 3, 1966, with the Lake Iwa battle. Effects filming lasted 73 days. Barugon's demise was originally intended to be filmed on the last day of production on April 2, 1966, however, the Barugon suit would not sink and delayed production for a full day. Suit creator Ryosaku Takayama (suit creator for the Ultraman series) removed the suit's head from the body, which allowed the prop to sink and complete production. Equis Productions, led by Masao Yagi and his family, created the film's scorpion props and the monster suits based on Akira Inoue's production designs. The Barugon suit was constructed by Takayama and detailed by the Yagi brothers. After returning to Tokyo, Takayama worked in Equis‚Äô workshop to build full scale suits and miniatures of both monsters and a gimmick version of Barugon capable of spraying mist from its tongue. Takayama was assisted by Keisu Murase from Equis. Teruo Aragaki (suit performer for the Ultraman series) was sent to Daiei to perform in the Gamera suit. While no documents have been released revealing the Barugon suit performer, Japanese fantasy expert August Ragone deduced that it may have been Umenosuke Izumi, due to Izumi being Aragaki‚Äôs second and assuming the Gamera role in later films. Effects engineer Hideo Arikawa supervised the operation of wire-operated props, miniatures, pyrotechnics, and the scorpion props. Due to his father's acquaintance with Eiji Tsuburaya, Yuasa was able to pull resources from Tsuburaya Productions for the film's effects. At times, Yuasa was forced to change set ups for effects shots when Tanaka would change his mind at the last minute. Yuasa protested to the studio chief after discovering that some of his effects footage was being cut from the assembly, stating, \\"I'm the director of special effects! Don't change this cut!\\" The shrieking sounds for the cave bats were originally produced for the rat creatures for the unproduced film Nezura. Yuasa noted Barugon's birth scene as the scene he \\"liked best\\". Additional wires were added to Barugon's head, as the motor inside made it heavy and difficult to lift with a single wire. It took Yuasa and his effects crew all night to film the shots with Barugon passing over a building with people projected inside and the freezing of Osaka, an effect that was deemed expensive. For scenes with Gamera breathing fire, Aragaki was not inside and the suit was held by wires. Propane and gasoline were used for the flames. Wire operations were tasked to effects engineer Haruo Sekia, who found the job difficult due to 20 wires being used during the Iwa battle scene and the materials used to make the suits making them heavy when absorbing water. English versions After the film's completion, Daiei commissioned an English dub from Axis International, in anticipation of a wide theatrical release in the United States like the previous film. The international dub by Axis features the voices of Barry Haigh, Warren Rooke, and Ted Thomas. In 1967, American International Television acquired the syndication rights to the film, as well as Gamera vs. Gyaos and Gamera vs. Viras and chose not to use the international dubs produced for all three films. AIP-TV commissioned a new English dub supervised by Salavtore Billiteri and recorded by the English Language Dubbers Association (ELDA) in Rome, Italy. AIP-TV retitled the film as War of the Monsters and removed 12 minutes of footage to fit commercials into a two-hour timeslot and prevent children from growing restless. The export dub by Axis was not widely released until the late 80's, when Sandy Frank Film Syndication released the film, as well as other Gamera titles, on VHS in the United States. Release =Theatrical and television= Gamera vs. Barugon was theatrically released in Japan on 17 April 1966, on a double- bill with Daimajin. The film underperformed at the Japanese box office and was never released theatrically in the United States. While attending screenings, Noriaki Yuasa noticed that children were becoming bored and restless during long scenes without monsters. Yuasa felt that the film lost its core audience and this inspired him to reveal the monsters earlier and consistently in later films. In 1967, the film was acquired by American International Television and released directly to television in early 1968 as War of the Monsters. This broadcast was part of a syndication package of kaiju films acquired and released by AIP-TV, which included Majin, Monster of Terror, Monster from a Prehistoric Planet, and Godzilla vs. The Thing. Gamera vs. Barugon was one of the few films featured twice on Mystery Science Theater 3000, the first time as part of the initial KTMA series (episode 4) and again in Season 3 (episode 4), where the hosts commented on the awkward dialogue and Gamera's lack of screen time. =Critical response= In a contemporary review, \\"Chie.\\" of Variety reviewed the film in Tokyo, noting that the special effects in the film were not up to standards of Toho's Eiji Tsuburaya and that Gamera \\"did not have the winning appeal of the Toho stable 'Godzilla', 'Radon'[known in English dubs as Rodan], etc.\\" Christopher Stewardson from Our Culture awarded the film three stars out of five, praising the monster scenes and human drama, but criticized the pacing and military meetings, stating, \\"Gamera vs. Barugon presents an entertaining story with interesting themes. Some of its characters may be thinly constructed in their motives and morality, but that also allows the film to really embellish just how cruel and villainous they are. The monster sequences are mostly very engaging, and that the film‚Äôs human drama matches their quality is great.\\" James McCormick from Criterion Cast praised the film's miniatures, cinematography, and K≈çji Fujiyama's portrayal of Onodera. Kurt Dahlke from DVDTalk criticized the film's lack of monster battles but praised other elements, stating, \\"there are still plenty of sweet moments (including a giant tongue lashing) and stomped buildings, plus a generally serious tone, that marks this as a high-point in the Gamera franchise.\\" =Home media= In the late 1980s, the export English version by Axis International debuted on VHS in the United States via the Sandy Frank Film Syndication and Celebrity Home Video. In 2003, a public domain, pan and scan version of the AIP-TV English dub was released on DVD by Alpha Video. In July 2010, the Japanese version was released on DVD by Shout! Factory. In April 2014, the Japanese version was released on Blu-ray by Mill Creek Entertainment, packaged with other Gamera titles. In 2020, the Japanese version, the Axis English dub, and AIP-TV English version were included in the Gamera: Complete Collection Blu-ray box set released by Arrow Video, which included all 12 films in the franchise.

Versions of how Hell got its name There are numerous versions of how Hell received its name, but they are generally variations on \\"a ministration exclaimed, 'This is what Hell must look like.'\\" It is also claimed that the name \\"Hell\\" is derived from the fact that if a pebble is thrown out into the formation, it echoes among the limestone peaks and valleys and sounds as if the pebble is falling all the way down to \\"Hell.\\" Regardless of how it first came to be called Hell, the name stuck and the area has become a tourist attraction, featuring a fire-engine red hell-themed post office from which you can send \\"postcards from hell\\", and a gift shop with \\"Satan\\" Ivan Farrington passing out souvenirs while greeting people with phrases like \\"How the hell are you?\\" and \\"Where the hell are you from?\\" Some of the stores in the area feature prominent quotations from the Bible on their sides. This is due to the pious and religious nature of Caymanian society.Culinary Capital of the Caribbean Geology \\"Hell is a unique formation which is characterized by jagged, spongy pinnacles of black-covered limestone. This phytokarst formation is produced when attacking filamentous algae interact with the Ironshore Formation limestone present at this location.\\" \\"Phytokarst is a distinctive landform resulting from a curious type of biologic erosion. Filamentous algae bore their way into limestone to produce black-coated, jagged pinnacles marked by delicate, lacy dissection that lacks any gravitational orientation. Ordinary rainfall-produced karst and littoral karst are characterized by flat-bottomed pans and vertically oriented flutes, thus differing from phytokarst. Algae attack by dissolving calcite preferentially to dolomite.\\" \\"The ironshore karst is a special type, both in terms of its texture and origin. First, texture ‚Äì it is a black, random spongework of pits, jagged ridges and pointed pinnacles. It is developed in a narrow strip just above the tide line on ancient limestone rocks. If you break off a piece, you will see that the black color is present near the surface and it grades to gray inside. Second, origin ‚Äì it is being dissolved largely by algae, bacteria and fungi so it is often called \\"biokarst\\". These tiny (microscopic) organisms bore into the rock and dissolve the calcite crystals. They are most dense within a centimeter or so at the surface, causing the black color. Why this results in the characteristic macro-texture is not fully understood, but you always see the two elements together so they must be linked somehow. It is clear that proximity to the marine environment is key. Maybe the splash, spray and mist from the waves breaking provide just enough moisture to sustain the algae. So, when you travel around the Caribbean, look at the rocky shoreline, if it is limestone, biokarst may be well developed. The most famous occurrence is at a place called Hell on Grand Cayman.\\" References External link * Category:Landforms of the Cayman Islands Category:Grand Cayman ","title":"Hell, Grand Cayman"},{"id":"3632103","text":"The Battle of the Thousand Islands was an engagement fought on 16‚Äì24 August 1760, in the upper St. Lawrence River, among the Thousand Islands, along the present day Canada‚ÄìUnited States border, by British and French forces during the closing phases of the Seven Years' War, as it is called in Canada and Europe, or the French and Indian War as it is referred to in the United States. The engagement took place at Fort L√©vis (about one mile (1.6 km) downstream from the modern Ogdensburg‚ÄìPrescott International Bridge), Pointe au Baril (present-day Maitland, Ontario), and the surrounding waters and islands. The small French garrison at Fort L√©vis held the much larger British army at bay for over a week, managing to sink two British warships and to cripple a third. Their resistance delayed the British advance to Montreal from the west. Background and forces By August 1760, the French were building Fort L√©vis at √éle Royale (present-day Chimney Island New York) in the St. Lawrence River. Captain Pierre Pouchot was assigned its defense. Pouchot had been taken prisoner after the siege of Fort Niagara, but he was later released in a prisoner exchange. Chevalier de L√©vis' original design for the fort called for stone walls, 200 guns and some 2,500 troops. What Pouchot had was a small fort with wooden stockades, five cannon and 200 soldiers. Also under Pouchot's command were the corvettes l'Outaouaise and l'Iroquoise, crewed by 200 sailors and voyageurs. l'Iroquoise, under command of Commodore Ren√© Hypolite P√©pin dit La Force, was armed with ten 12-pound cannon and swivel guns . l'Outaouaise, commanded by Captain Pierre Boucher de LaBroquerie carried ten 12-pounders, one 18-pound gun and swivel guns. After the fall of Quebec in the 1759 Battle of the Plains of Abraham, British Commander-in-Chief General Jeffery Amherst prepared to launch a three-pronged attack to take Montreal. Columns were to advance along the Saint Lawrence River from Quebec to the northeast, up the Richelieu River from Lake Champlain to the south, and from Oswego on Lake Ontario to the west. The latter force, which Amherst led personally, numbered some 10,000 men and 100 siege guns. Soon after his arrival to √éle Royal, Pouchot ordered abandonment of the nearby mission Fort de La Pr√©sentation and the shipyard and stockades at Pointe au Baril to consolidate his resources at the more defendable Fort L√©vis. La Force had run his corvette l'Iroquoise aground at Pointe au Baril on 1 August. Although l'Iroquoise was raised, it was deemed too damaged to be put into action. It was beached again under the guns at Fort L√©vis. Amherst's force set out from Oswego on 10 August. Captain Joshua Loring, who commanded the British snows Onondaga and , had been sent ahead of Amherst's force as an advance guard. Onondaga had been launched at Fort Niagara as Apollo in 1759. Commanded by Loring, it carried four 9-pound guns, fourteen 6-pounders and a crew of 100 seamen and 25 soldiers. Mohawk, commanded by Lieutenant David Phipps, carried sixteen 6-pounders and a crew of 90 seamen and 30 soldiers. Battle On 7 August, French lookouts sighted Onondaga and Mohawk from their outpost at Ile aux Chevreuils, upstream from Fort L√©vis. The French withdrew in a row galley, pursued by Onondaga and Mohawk. The two British vessels got lost in the maze of islands, and did not find their way back to the main channel for several days. Amherst's force arrived at Pointe au Baril on 16 August. Fearing the remaining French ship might attack his transports, Amherst ordered Colonel George Williamson to capture l'Outaouaise the following day. At dawn of 17 August, Williamson set out in a gig, accompanied by five row galleys (one armed with a howitzer, the others each armed with a single 12-pounder). The galleys took shelter fore and aft of l'Outaouaise, where they could not be hit by the ship's broadsides. The British galleys fired grapeshot and round shot at the French ship, crippling l'Outaouaise, which drifted helplessly towards the British battery set up at Pointe au Baril. After three hours of fighting, l'Outaouaise had managed to fire around 72 shots, damaging two of the British galleys. LaBroquerie was forced to surrender l'Outaouaise to Williamson. LaBroquerie was wounded in the fighting. Fifteen members of his crew were killed or wounded. The captured l'Outaouaise was repaired and renamed Williamson, to be put back into service by Captain Patrick Sinclair against her former owners. On 19 August, Amherst commenced the attack on Fort L√©vis. La Force and his crew had been ordered back from the beached l'Iroquoise to the fort to assist with its defense. Williamson was hit 48 times by the five French guns when it joined in with the British batteries firing on Fort L√©vis from surrounding islands. Mohawk and Onondaga finally arrived at the scene in the evening and Amherst called a ceasefire for the night. The attack resumed at dawn on 20 August with Williamson, Mohawk and Onondaga all firing on the fort with a combined 50 guns. As the attack progressed, the French guns hit and sank Williamson and Onondaga. Mohawk ran aground under the French cannon, where it sat helpless as it was pounded until out of action. The British batteries on the surrounding islands continued to fire, switching to \\"hot shot\\", used to start fires within the fort. The siege continued until 24 August when Pouchot ran out of ammunition for his guns and asked for terms. Aftermath The fighting cost the British 26 killed and 47 wounded (likely excluding militia) to the French losses of around 275 of the original 300 defenders killed or wounded. Pouchot was amongst the wounded. The British could hardly believe that such a small garrison had offered such spirited resistance. After the battle, Amherst's force remained at Fort L√©vis for another four days before continuing toward Montreal. The British advance cost Amherst at least 84 more men drowned in the rapids of the St. Lawrence (although Pouchot puts this number at 336). He went on to meet the forces from Quebec and Lake Champlain and completely surrounded Montreal. The three- pronged British forces totaling 17,000 men began to converge on the town, burning villages along the way and prompting mass desertions from the Canadian militia.http://www.cbc.ca/history/EPCONTENTSE1EP4CH10PA3LE.html On 8 September, Montreal was surrendered by New France's governor, the Marquis de Vaudreuil, to avoid further bloodshed. The British renamed Fort L√©vis Fort William Augustus. They raised the three vessels sunk during the battle (Williamson, Onondaga and Mohawk) and put them back into service to patrol the waters between the fort and Fort Niagara.

There are several different designs, but all use levers or pulleys inside or outside the guitar body that are activated by a pull or push of the guitar neck, body, or bridge. The resulting tone sounds much like a pedal steel guitar and contributes a \\"country\\" feeling. Originally designed for the Fender Telecaster, B-Benders are now available to fit many solid body electric guitars, and even acoustic guitars. History The B-Bender was invented in 1968 by musicians Gene Parsons and Clarence White of Nashville West and The Byrds. The device was originally called the Parsons/White Pull-String, later renamed the StringBender, and is now best known as the B-Bender. Early prototypes developed by Parsons (a machinist as well as a drummer) included multiple bending devices for the E, B, G and D strings, but guitarist White decided he preferred a single B string bender in the final design. The B string is bent up a full tone by pulling the guitar neck down. This puts pressure on the strap, which is attached to a spring-loaded lever at the base of the neck. The lever arm passes through the body of the guitar and is connected to the B string behind the bridge (Figure A). White's 1956 Telecaster with the original Pull-String is now owned and regularly played by Marty Stuart, who bought it from White's widow. Another early maker and user of the Pull-String was Bob Warford, a friend and Kentucky Colonels bandmate of White's who also played guitar with Linda Ronstadt and The Everly Brothers. Warford made his own Pull- String in early 1968 based on the Parsons/White design, with their consent, and installed it in his Telecaster. Later that year, Parsons and White licensed the StringBender to Leo Fender at Fender Musical Instruments Corporation. Fender revised the design to simplify mass production and developed a prototype. However, this model never went into production. Parsons and White subsequently licensed their design to Dave Evans, who had heard about the device and had been experimenting with his own models. Evans built and sold a version of the Pull-String from 1969 to 1973. His customers included Albert Lee, John Beland (guitarist for Linda Ronstadt) and Eagles guitarist Bernie Leadon, who played his Evans Pull-String on \\"Peaceful Easy Feeling\\". In 1973 Parsons started making and installing the Pull-String himself, and renamed it the StringBender. He eventually made as many as 2,000 custom installations for guitarists including Ronnie Wood of The Rolling Stones. Harold Matlin of Matlin Guitars built one for Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin. Parsons also supplied several hundred StringBender kits to Japanese guitar manufacturer Tokai Gakki. In 1989, when demand overtook his production capacity, Parsons partnered with Meridian Green to outsource the production of the kits, develop a network of authorized installation shops and write an instruction manual for the installers. Green also approached Fender again, and the Fender Custom Shop began producing a Clarence White signature model custom Telecaster equipped with the Parsons/White StringBender. Around 200 were produced, and based on this success, Fender decided to mass-produce a similar model and call it the B-Bender. Parsons and Green revised the design again, and in 1996 Fender began production of the Nashville B-Bender Telecaster incorporating the Parsons/Green StringBender. Shortly after Clarence White was killed by a drunk driver while loading equipment into his van with his brother Roland after a gig, Richard Bowden, former Linda Ronstadt & Dan Folgelberg guitarist, joined Roger McGuinn's post-Byrds organization and Bowden created his own B-Bender. Being a Gibson player and with String Benders only available for Telecasters, Bowden created a non-defacing palm pedal that attached to the standard Gibson-style stop-bar tail piece. He leased his patent to Gibson, who turned it over to Epiphone for production. Due to manufacturing flaws, Epiphone discontinued production when their patent lease expired after ten years. Bowden now manufactures his device in his own custom shop and has expanded his designs to also fit on Telecasters, G&L; ASAT Tribute Specials, and Stratocasters, as well as many acoustic guitars. Variations Fig. B The Hennessey model bends a string both up and downAnother type of B-Bender is activated by the picking hand, like the Bigsby vibrato tailpiece. Unlike the Parsons/White model, this type does not require any structural modifications to the guitar body and is simply installed with a few screws. Examples are the Bigsby Palm Pedal, the Bowden B Bender (non-defacing to guitar - inventor, Richard Bowden), the Hipshot Palm Lever, and the Duesenberg Guitars Multibender. Each of these can bend multiple strings using different levers. The Hipshot B-Bender, developed by David Borisoff, also mounts to the tailpiece end of the guitar without requiring any modifications. A lever extends behind the guitar and rests against the player's body. The bender is activated by moving the whole guitar against the player's body. The Hipshot is used by Will Ray of the Hellecasters. While this version bends the string up, James Hennessey developed a version that can bend the string either up or down, although mounting it requires modification of the guitar body (Figure B.) Fig. C The Glaser design bends one, two or three strings independentlyThe same type of mechanics can be applied to other strings besides the B, with the G string being the most common. Brad Paisley is a well-known proponent of the \\"G-Bender\\" and uses a model from Charlie McVay. \\"Double Benders\\" can bend both the B and G strings independently. The B string pull operates like the Parsons/White design, by pushing the neck down against the strap. The G string pull uses a push-away motion of the neck and depends on a lanyard attached to the player's belt. A variation developed by Joseph Glaser can bend up to three different strings independently. Like the Double Benders, Glaser's design uses a downward pull of the guitar neck to bend one string and a push-away against a belt lanyard to bend a second string. The third string bend (such as the low E string) uses a backward pull of the neck toward the player's body (see Figure C.) Jimmy Olander of Diamond Rio has Glaser Double-Benders (B & G) in his instruments, with the G string activated by his shoulder strap and the B string by a belt lanyard. Unlike most bender players, Olander uses them more for stylistic enhancement than for a steel guitar sound. Other notable users of Glaser benders include Dan Schafer, Ricky Skaggs and Keith Richards.

Steinbeck was primarily a freestyle swimmer. As a 15-year-old at the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Kingston, Jamaica, Steinbeck won a silver medal in the women's 4√ó110-yard freestyle relay. Swimming the first leg of the four-swimmer relay, she combined with teammates Janice Murphy, Lynette Bell and Marion Smith for a time of 4:11.1, three tenths of a second behind the world-record- setting Canadians, and two tenths ahead of the third-place English team. She also swam in the individual 220-yard backstroke, coming eighth in the event final.Graham Groom, The Complete Book of the Commonwealth Games, Lulu Press, Inc., Raleigh, North Carolina (US), pp. 507 & 530 (2014). At the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, Steinbeck won a silver medal as a member of the second-place Australian women's team in the 4√ó100-metre medley relay. She combined with Lynne Watson, Lyn McClements and Judy Playfair to register a silver medal in the 4√ó100-metre medley relay, trailing the Americans home by 1.7 seconds. However, it was in Steinbeck's freestyle anchor leg that American Susan Pedersen's used her 59.4-second individual split to solidify the Americans' 1.7-second margin of victory. She was also part of the Australian team that came fourth in the women's 4√ó100-metre freestyle relay. Individually, she competed in the semifinals of the 100-metre freestyle, and the preliminary heats of the 200-metre freestyle.

The act was an immediate source of political controversy. The legacy of the Act is that Illinois municipal elections take place in the spring while county, state, and federal elections continue to occur on the federal Election Day. History The Act was adopted by the State of Illinois on April 10, 1872 and went into force on July 1 of the same year. The purpose of the Act was to provide a standard outline and means for villages and cities in the state to incorporate without requiring separate legislation for each application. On April 23, 1875, the city of Chicago voted to operate under the Act, as opposed to operating under the city charter which had previously been in effect. The Act has been revised since then, and is located in Chapter 65 of the Illinois Compiled Statutes. Despite this operation, the Illinois State Constitution was later amended by the addition of Article VII (Adopted September 3, 1970; Entered into force July 1, 1971) which grants home rule powers to Chicago. Among those powers are regulation for the protection of public health, safety, morals, and welfare, to license for regulatory purposes, to tax, and to incur debt. Legal implications for Chicago Thomas Hoyne, irregularly elected Mayor The act moved Mayoral elections to April, whereas they had previously taken place in November. The politically manipulated late April adoption date effectively canceled the 1875 election for Mayor of Chicago. The act also lengthened the Mayoral term from 1 year to 2 years and expanded Mayoral powers. The law was ambiguous on the extension of incumbent mayor, Harvey Doolittle Colvin's, one-year term. In the November 1875 elections, neither the Republicans nor the Democrats ran a candidate for mayor, believing that there was no election. Independent candidate Thomas Hoyne received over 82% of the votes for Mayor of Chicago. Colvin refused to surrender his seat, which led to turmoil until a court ruling declared him Mayor until a special election, thus nullifying Hoyne's election. Chicago continues to have municipal elections in the spring. 1907 ushered in 4-year Mayoral terms and 1935 saw the first 4-year Aldermanic terms.

Opened in 1897 in Lower Manhattan and initially operated as an all-boys school, it maintained that status for nearly 100 years. In 1983 it became co-ed. From its original building on West 13th Street in Manhattan, it moved in 1906 to its second home on 59th Street and Tenth Avenue (now the site of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice). In 1929 the school moved to its present home on Mosholu Parkway in the Bronx. After more than a century of operations, producing a raft of accomplished alumni, DeWitt Clinton High School in the early 21st century has faced serious problems involving student performance and security. DeWitt Clinton High School map from 1916 History Haaren Hall in 2008 Clinton opened in 1897 at 60 West 13th Street at the northern end of Greenwich Village under the name of Boys High School,Jackson, Kenneth T. The Encyclopedia of New York City, The New York Historical Society; Yale University Press; 1995. p.332. although this Boys High School was not related to the one in Brooklyn. This school was renamed for New York governor DeWitt Clinton in 1900. In 1906 it moved to a newly constructed building on Tenth Avenue between 58th Street and 59th Street in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood‚Äîthe same year as the opening of the nearby DeWitt Clinton Park where students \\"farmed\\" plots in what was the first community garden in New York. The school's H-shaped building, designed by Charles B. J. Snyder, was said to be the biggest high school building in the United States at the time. After the school moved to the Bronx, this building became Haaren High School. It is now Haaren Hall on the campus of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Until a high school education became compulsory in the early 1930s, Clinton, like all other public schools in the city, had a Classics Department, where Greek and Latin were taught. Perhaps its most famous teacher was history teacher Dr. Irwin Guernsey, known to generations of students as \\"Doc\\" Guernsey. He came to Clinton in the fall of 1914 and retired in the spring of 1959, due to illness. A cripple with two \\"Irish\\" canes, he taught from the chair and won twice in his lifetime the title of Master Teacher in New York City. He was also head of the Honors Association, Arista. The History wing is named \\"Guernsey Hall\\" in his memory, and one can still see the library cart named \\"Doc's Special\\" on which he sat while students wheeled him to class during the last years of his tenure when he was sick. The school moved to a new building on a campus at 100 West Mosholu Parkway South and East 205th Street in the Bedford Park section of the Bronx in 1929, where it has remained. Paul Avenue, which runs to the side of the school from Mosholu Parkway to Lehman College, is named after a DeWitt Clinton High School principal, Dr. Paul. It was under this principal that the school moved to its current location in the Bronx. In the 1930s its enrollment peaked at 12,000 and it was said to be the largest high school in the world. Enrollment by 1999 was about 4,000.The DeWitt Clinton Way, dewittclintonalumni.com. Retrieved July 30, 2008. It remained the last gender-segregated public school in New York City until 1983. In 1996, Clinton was selected by Redbook magazine as one of the five most improved schools in America. In 1999, US News and World Report designated Clinton as one of 96 outstanding schools in America. In 1999, Geraldine Ambrosio became the first woman to hold the principal's post at the school. The school receives government aid because of the low income status of its students. As of 2006, the school has a large Hispanic population, followed by African-Americans and Asians. Non-Hispanic Whites, primarily Albanians, comprise a tiny minority. Recently, DeWitt Clinton High School has received poor evaluations from the New York City Department of Education. In the latest Progress Report (2010‚Äì11) the school received a grade of F (39.4 out of 100) with the worst marks in school environment and closing the achievement gap.Progress Report 2010-11: DeWitt Clinton High School New York City Department of Education. Accessed May 6, 2013. The Quality Report for the academic year 2011-12 rated the school as \\"underdeveloped,\\" its lowest rating. It particularly faulted the school for failing to design \\"engaging, rigorous and coherent curricula\\" and for failing to ensure that teaching was \\"aligned to the curriculum, engaging, and differentiated to enable all students to produce meaningful work products.\\"Quality Review Report, 2011-2012: DeWitt Clinton High School New York City Department of Education (Review dates: February 13‚Äì15, 2012). Accessed May 6, 2013. In 2013, to address these issues, the city's Department of Education tapped Santiago Taveras, one of its former deputy chancellors, as the school's principal to replace the retiring Ambrosio. In November 2016, after Department of Education investigators found evidence of grade tampering, Taveras was removed as principal. Organization-houses/small learning communities Clinton is split into several small learning communities. They include the Macy Honors Gifted Program (internally often called the Macy House), Health Professions, Veterinary Professions, Public Service, Business Enterprise, Future Educators, Academy House, and Varsity House. The Macy Program, begun in 1985 with funding from the Macy Foundation,Lakhman, Marina. \\"Making it Work; F's to A's in the Bronx\\", The New York Times, March 14, 1999. attracts intelligent, hard-working children and preparing them for exceptionally selective colleges. The Macy program has been expanded to serve 1,200 students. The current Macy coordinator is Ernesta Consolazio. The Macy Honors Gifted Program in the Sciences and Humanities has its own teachers, and a nine-period day compared to the regular New York City eight-period day. The program offers Specialized and Advanced Technology (SMT) courses, Science, Math, English, Law, Government, Philosophy and Great Books. All students in the program are required to have a minimum average of 80 and not to fail any courses. When Macy students are removed from the program, they are placed in Excel, a special Macy-run program just for its kick-outs and drop-outs, before being fully demoted to the lower programs. From at least 1998 to 2002 some students went directly into the Excel program. Advanced Macy students are invited to join the even more selective Einstein Program, which has about 50 students in each grade. This program has even more rigorous academic performance requirements. Einstein students in their junior year are required to take a College Now course for philosophy and government science, in their first and second semester, respectively. These courses allow students to earn college credits. Einstein students are automatically assigned to honors and AP classes as early as freshman year, followed by the mandatory AP United States History and AP English Language for Einstein students who make it to their junior year. Many Macy students are invited to MASTERS, a month-long summer program that offers many hands-on college courses emphasizing mathematics and science. These include Forensic Science, Robotics, Anatomy, Business, Consumer Chemistry and Electricity. Student organizations The school has over 40 academic and interest clubs. The Clinton News, the school's newspaper, is written and managed by its students. However, like many other outstanding Clinton possessions, The Clinton News publishes several multi-page full color papers a year by a grant from the Christian A. Johnson Endeavour Foundation. Another Clinton High School publication is The Magpie. Published yearly, the historic color edition of this magazine came out May 2007. This literary collection received the most attention for its association with the Harlem Renaissance. Sports DeWitt Clinton teams are known as the Governors; there are approximately 35 teams. Some teams which no longer exist, such as fencing and rifle. Teams for the 2007‚Äì2008 school year included: *Baseball: boys' varsity, boys' JV *Basketball: boys' varsity, boys' JV, girls' varsity, girls' JV *Bowling: boys' varsity, girls' varsity *Cricket: co-ed *Cross country: boys' varsity, girls' varsity *Football: boys' varsity, boys' JV *Golf: girls' varsity *Gymnastics: boys' varsity, girls' varsity *Handball: girls' varsity *Indoor track: boys' varsity, girls' varsity *Outdoor track: boys' varsity, girls' varsity *Soccer: boys' varsity, girls' varsity *Softball: girls' varsity, girls' JV *Step: girls' *Swimming: boys' varsity, girls' varsity *Tennis: boys' varsity, girls' varsity *Volleyball: boys' varsity, girls' varsity *Wrestling: boys' varsity The cricket team's formation was encouraged by the large number of South Asians. School facilities DeWitt Clinton High School is located at 100 West Mosholu Parkway South. It dominates the entire block, excluding the ground at the south where the Bronx High School of Science is situated. Facing the main entrance of the building, Paul Avenue runs to the east and Goulden Avenue to the west. The school faces Mosholu Parkway, and has its turf field and track behind it, followed by the softball field, and then the school's baseball and grass football field, Alumni Field. It is after this point that DeWitt Clinton's territory ends, meeting that of Bronx Science. Clinton has a small branch of Montefiore Medical Clinic within it, capable of supplying essential services to the students of the campus. The school is located at Latitude: 40.88111 : Longitude: -73.8875 The ceiling of a hallway had a 1930s mural by Alfred Floegel called \\"Constellations\\", a part of the Federal Art Project. In 2018 the mural was painted over accidentally as part of a roof repair. In the media The institution was featured in A Walk Through The Bronx with David Hartman and historian Barry Lewis. In it, Hartman and Lewis take a peek at the library. The DeWitt Clinton Chorus performed songs in the 2000 production, Finding Forrester. A book has been written about the school: Clintonites made headlines and New York City School history in September 2005, when they walked out. The 1,500 strong walk out was a result of the installation of metal detectors.

He played guitar in the rock band Paul McCartney and Wings from 1978 to 1981. Biography =Early life= Born in Stepney, East London, Juber was raised and went to school in North London. By his own account, he began playing guitar the week that single \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" by The Beatles was released.Lawrence, Robb. (2008). The Early Years of the Les Paul Legacy 1915‚Äì1963. Hal Leonard Corporation. . Beginning on a cheap acoustic guitar, he learned to read music early and the system of music notation. He began to earn money playing the guitar at 13, and began to study classical guitar at the age of 15. =Studio work in London= Enraptured by the sounds on records of the mid- to late 1960s, he set his sights on becoming a session guitarist in London's music studios. While playing with the National Youth Jazz Orchestra, he earned his music degree at London University's Goldsmith's College, where he expanded his horizons by playing the lute. Upon graduation, he immediately began work as a session guitarist, working on his first project with former Beatles producer George Martin on an album for Cleo Laine. Amongst other studio work, in 1977, Juber was booked by London-based orchestral contractor David Katz along with session drummer Peter Boita to go to Paris for a week to record in Barclay Records' studios to make an album with Charles Aznavour. Sung entirely in French, the album, Je n'ai pas vu le temps passer..., went on to become one of Aznavour's biggest selling French language albums of all time. Perhaps most famously, Juber played the James Bond theme for the movie The Spy Who Loved Me. =Wings= Juber gave up a lucrative and successful studio career when invited to join the band Paul McCartney and Wings in 1978. Juber later said that he agreed to join immediately \\"because you don't turn down that kind of job\\". He played on the band's Back to the Egg album (1979), as well as their subsequent UK tour. In 1980, he garnered his first Grammy Award, when Wings' track \\"Rockestra Theme\\" won the award for Best Rock Instrumental. He was miscredited as Lawrence Tuber on the sleeve for Ringo Starr's album, Stop and Smell the Roses. From this period dates his first solo album, Standard Time (only released on vinyl). McCartney and former Wings guitarist Denny Laine played on the track \\"Maisie\\". Juber acknowledges that whilst he was a sideman with Wings, the role included considering himself a member of the band. =Life after Wings= After Wings disbanded in early 1981, Juber moved to the United States. In New York City, he met his future wife, Hope, and soon moved to her native California. He subsequently resumed work as a studio musician and played guitar for numerous television shows, including Happy Days, Family Ties, Home Improvement and 7th Heaven. He composed the music for A Very Brady Christmas (1988), World Gone Wild (1988) and Little Sweetheart (1990). He played guitar on Belinda Carlisle's \\"Mad About You\\", Eric Carmen's \\"Make Me Lose Control\\" and \\"Time of My Life\\" and \\"She's Like The Wind\\" from the Dirty Dancing soundtrack. Juber co-composed the soundtrack of the award-winning video game Diablo III and crafted the score to the Dateline NBC documentary Children of the Harvest. His music is also featured in the Ken Burns TV documentary The Tenth Inning. With his wife, Hope Juber, he has composed the scores to the musical comedies Gilligan's Island: The Musical, A Very Brady Musical and It's The Housewives! In addition to his own recording and performances, Laurence Juber has produced, arranged and played on Al Stewart's albums Between the Wars (1995), Down in the Cellar (2000), A Beach Full of Shells (2005) and Sparks of Ancient Light (2008), and occasionally performs with Stewart. In 2014 he released a \\"photo memoir\\" Guitar With Wings (published by Dalton Watson Fine Books) which featured previously unpublished pictures of his time working with Paul McCartney. =Solo career= In 1990, Juber released his second solo album, Solo Flight. During the next decade he would begin to explore altered tunings, especially \\"DADGAD\\". In 2000, Juber released the solo album LJ plays the Beatles and The Collection and in 2003 the album Guitarist was released to critical acclaim. Juber's credentials as a top-tier fingerstyle guitarist continue to grow. Having been voted \\"Guitarist of the Year\\" by readers of Fingerstyle Guitar magazine, as well as one of the top acoustic players of all time by Acoustic Guitar magazine, Juber is an ambassador for his instrument as well as his own music. He has released many critically acclaimed solo albums, and has earned a second Grammy for Best Pop Instrumental for his solo guitar arrangement of \\"The Pink Panther Theme\\" on the CD Henry Mancini: Pink Guitar. Juber has also released a series of instructional CDs that teach basic music theory and arrangement techniques for guitarists and has three folios of his arrangements of pop songs published by Hal Leonard. =Personal life= Juber is married to former actress Hope Schwartz, whose father Sherwood was producer of Gilligan‚Äôs Island and The Brady Bunch‚Äîshe was a guest multiple times on the latter show. They have two daughters, Nico Juber and songwriter Ilsey Juber.

The languages classified as members of the Ngayarda languages group are (following Bowern & Koch 2004): *Martuthunira *Ngarluma-Kariyarra *Yindjibarndi‚ÄìKurrama *Panyjima *Jurruru *Nyamal *Yinhawangka *Ngarla *Nhuwala *Palyku Dench (1995) says that for Yinhawangka, Nhuwala and Ngarla there is insufficient data to enable them to be confidently classified, and he places them in Ngayarda for convenience. However, Bowern & Koch (2004) include them without proviso. Further, there are grounds for considering Yindjibarndi-Kurrama and Ngarluma-Kariyarra to be dialect pairs, though the indigenous perception is that they are separate languages. Palyku has sometimes been excluded; it is somewhat divergent. The name ngayarda comes from the word for \\"man\\" in many of the languages of the group. They form a branch of the Pama‚ÄìNyungan family. The Ngayarda group is justified on the basis of lexicostatistics as well as the following grammatical features first proposed by O'Grady (1966) as diagnostic of this group: * The better-known members of the group (i.e. Ngarluma and Yindjibarndi) have a productive active/passive voice distinction. * The reflex of Proto Pama-Nyungan *-lu~-ngku is not used as a marker of transitive subject * The Proto Pama-Nyungan suffix *-ku has shifted from the specialised meaning indirect object to the broader meaning object * The Proto Pama-Nyungan verb suffix *-(l)ku has shifted from future (or optative) to present C.G. von Brandenstein devised a classification which divided this group into a Coastal Ngayarda and an Inland Ngayarda. This is no longer considered correct, however Austin (1988) points out that von Brandenstein's errors have been reproduced by Wurm and Hattori in their map of Australian languages, which appears to be based on the same classification.

Series overview  Summary The first season, debuting in Canada at April 18, 1997 on the channel Citytv, consisted of four two-hour TV movies (sometimes screened as eight one-hour episodes), alternatively titled Tales from a Parallel Universe. However, some episode guides do not list the two-hour movies as a season but list the subsequent seasons as the first through third. The second season, debuting in Canada at December 11, 1998 on the channel Space The Imagination Station, consisted of twenty forty-five-minute episodes with an overall story arc concerning an evil scientist called Mantrid who proceeds to convert all matter in the \\"light\\" universe (the Light Zone) into one-armed \\"Mantrid drones\\". Mantrid largely succeeds before he is defeated by the Lexx, but not without causing a Big Crunch that results in sending the Lexx through a singularity to an alternate \\"dark\\" universe (the Dark Zone). The third season, debuting in the UK on February 6, 2000 on the British Sci-Fi Channel, comprises 13 episodes in which the Lexx is trapped in orbit around the warring planets Fire and Water, and the crew encounters an enigmatic and cheerful evil being known as Prince, who may be the Devil. The two planets orbit each other at extremely close distance, and share one atmosphere, allowing the inhabitants to pass freely between them. Fire is the afterlife for all evil souls, the inhabitants of which are continually engaged in attacks on Planet Water, which is the afterlife of all good souls. Fire is filmed between the dunes of Namibia and the Gothic architecture of Berlin. The rulers of Fire are Prince and Duke, who both reincarnate whenever it suits them. Water appears to have no ruler, and contains a small population of hedonists on floating islands. In the fourth and final season of 24 episodes, debuting in the USA on July 13, 2001 on the American Sci-Fi Channel, the Lexx arrives at Earth in the early 21st century, only to find that Prince (now named Isambard Prince, and somehow head of the ATF) and several other old adversaries have arrived there too. Between them, Prince and the Lexx manage to demolish large chunks of the Earth ‚Äì including the city of Ottawa (a Canadian metonymical in-joke) ‚Äì before the climactic final episode, televised on April 26, 2002. Seasons one to three of Lexx were released on VHS and Region 2 DVD in the UK by Contender Limited, although the Season 3 DVDs were initially exclusive to the MVC Entertainment chain of stores and all volumes have since been deleted. Contender failed to obtain the rights to Season 4, which instead went to Momentum Pictures (a subsidiary of Alliance Atlantis), however they haven't released any DVDs. Recently, all four seasons have been released on DVD in multiple regions.

They were named for the Spanish land grant where Captain Richard King originally established the King Ranch. This breed was officially recognized by the United States Department of Agriculture in 1940, becoming the first beef breed formed in the United States. The origin given by King Ranch is that it was formed by mating Brahman bulls with Beef Shorthorn cows, with the final composition being about three-eighths Brahman and five-eighths Shorthorn. In 1918, the King Ranch purchased 52 bulls of three-quarters to seven-eighths Bos indicus breeding to mate with 2500 pure- bred Shorthorn cows on the ranch. At this time, the American Brahman breed as such did not exist, nor were purebred Bos indicus cattle available in the United States.. Referenced February 17, 2008. Monkey was born in 1920, a son of Vinotero, one of the bulls purchased in 1918. This bull became the foundation sire for the breed. With the birth of Monkey and a decision to line-breed came a very uniform and very hearty breed of beef cattle. These cattle are red in color, display a blend of Bos indicus and Bos taurus attributes, and may be polled or horned. Other characteristics include good milking ability, good beef production, excellent mothering ability, ease of calving, high heat tolerance and parasite resistance, and an ability to market or harvest a steer at just about any age. The steers also show good weights for their age, as well as good weight gains whether on pasture or in a feedlot. In 1950, the Santa Gertrudis Breeders International Association was formed at Kingsville, Texas. Santa Gertrudis cattle are known the world over for their ability to adapt to harsh climates. They were exported to Australia around 1951 and have been subjected to inspection and classification since then. The Santa Gertrudis Breeders (Australia) Association was established in 1954 and the Santa Gertrudis Group Breedplan has operated in Australia since 1994. Anna Creek, Australia's largest cattle station, raises Santa Gertrudis. About 11,500 of these cattle are registered in the United States. Breed characteristics The breed is red, occasionally with white markings on the underline, and has a short, smooth, slick coat. Santa Gertrudis cattle show many of the Bos indicus characteristics: the hide is loose and with neck and navel folds; the male has a small Zebu-type hump. Ears are medium to large and individuals are horned or polled. The female is noted for her ease of calving and milking ability. The breed is noted for heat tolerance, as well as tick and bloat resistance. Carcasses from very young cattle develop a large eye muscle of meat with little or no waste fat. Older steers yield well, with minimum fat cover acceptable to premium world markets. Weight for age is a noted attribute of the breed. Quality and uniformity in registered cattle is enforced by a rigid classification system by the breed association.

She won a silver medal at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics and three medals at the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Jamaica. She coached with her first husband Don Talbot in Australia, Canada, and the United States, and then moved to New Zealand, where she worked as a coach and sporting administrator until 2011. From May 2013 until February 2017, she coached the Paralympic Swimming Program at the USC Spartans Swim Club based at University of the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, and she was Australia's National Para Sport Mentor Coach from February 2017 until her death. Early life Janice Murphy was born in Sydney, the eldest of three children. Her two brothers were keen rugby players. She attended Rosebank College. Competitive swimming career Murphy's career overlapped that of fellow Australian swimmer, Dawn Fraser. Murphy won a silver medal in the 4√ó100-metre freestyle relay at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo; she teamed with Fraser, Lyn Bell and Robyn Thorn to finish 3.1 seconds behind the United States. She subsequently switched from Forbes Carlile's swimming team to work with Don Talbot. At the 1966 Commonwealth Games in Kingston, Jamaica, she won two silver medals in the 440-yard individual medley and the freestyle relay, and a bronze medal in the 110-yard freestyle. Coaching career After the Tokyo Olympics, she began a teaching scholarship at the Wollongong Teacher's College (now the University of Wollongong). While studying there she did coaching on the sidelines; her first coaching job was in 1968 at a small swimming club in Port Kembla. After graduation, she took the activity up full- time. She was the Paralympic swimming coach for the Australian team at the 1972 Heidelberg Paralympics, notably working with Pauline English, whom she also coached at the 1976 Toronto Paralympics. She worked as an assistant coach for Talbot, her first husband, in Canada, the United States and Australia. While in Canada, she completed an Honours degree in Physical Education and received a Masters in Coaching Sciences from Lakehead University. She moved to New Zealand with Kevin Cameron, her second husband, and in 1991 she began working as head coach for the North Shore Swimming Club, turning it from a club with little money and no resources to one that attracted New Zealand's elite swimmers. In 2001, Cameron began working as a national coach at the newly built Millennium Institute of Sport and Health (now AUT Millennium) at the Auckland University of Technology, and in 2008 she was appointed as the general manager performance and pathways at Swimming New Zealand. In September 2011 she resigned from this position, nearly three months after the release of the Ineson report initiated by Sport New Zealand, which described the high- performance culture of Swimming New Zealand as \\"negative\\" and \\"dysfunctional\\". In an interview shortly after her resignation, Cameron said that the report was \\"Poorly written, poorly done, rubbish\\", and described parts of the report as \\"speculation, opinion and unsubstantiated stuff put there as facts\\". From 2011 to 2014 she was managing director of Jan Cameron Performance Compass, a performance sports consulting company that she founded. She was the Paralympic swimming coach at the University of the Sunshine Coast in Queensland from April 2014 to February 2017, having been appointed to that role in an interim capacity in May 2013. From February 2017 until her death, she was the Australian National Para Sport Mentor Coach. She also worked as a swimming commentator for Sky TV. She was selected as an Australian Team Coach at the 2014 Para Pan Pacific Swimming Championships and the 2015 IPC Swimming World Championships Team. In 2015, she became the third Australian woman to gain her Platinum Coaching Licence following on from her swimmers' winning ten medals at the 2015 IPC Swimming World Championships in Glasgow, Scotland. She coached the Australian Swim Team at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Paralympics and was the Head Para Mentor Coach at the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games. Personal life She married Don Talbot in 1973. The couple had a son, Scott Talbot- Cameron, who represented New Zealand at the Olympics and is a performance coach for the country's elite swimming squad. Her marriage to Talbot ended in 1989, and she married Kevin Cameron, the director of sport production at Sky Television in New Zealand, in 1990. They had first met in 1961 when Kevin Cameron, then 14, was playing rugby for a New Zealand school team that was touring Australia. He was billeted with the Murphy family as her brother was playing in the opposition team. The two corresponded for six years after their first meeting, and were briefly engaged after Murphy's retirement from the Olympics. On 30 April 2018, Cameron died in Queensland after a short illness at the age of 71.

He frequently worked alongside Maurice Edelston, Bryon Butler, Alan Parry and, latterly, Alan Green and Mike Ingham. Career He was educated at Swansea Grammar School and Queens' College, Cambridge, where he read Modern Languages. He started his teaching career at Kimbolton School and subsequently taught at Bradfield College. His career as a broadcaster began in 1966 after a chance meeting with Maurice Edelston, who lived in nearby Reading. In his early years he commentated on group matches in the 1966 World Cup, held in England, but in 1970, 1974, 1978, 1982 and 1986 he was the main commentator on the World Cup, covering the final. Along with his regular weekly football commentaries, Jones covered almost every major football event from the late 1960s until his death, including the FA Cup Final of 1968, the replay (but not the first match) in 1970 and all finals from 1971 to 1989. He described victories for English clubs in the European Cup finals of 1968, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982 and 1984, and in 1985 he gave an eloquent description of the Heysel Stadium disaster. As a presenter rather than a commentator, he fronted the BBC's coverage of Wimbledon during the 1970s and 1980s, and frequently presented the BBC's Saturday afternoon radio sports coverage (Sports Service until 1970, Sport on Two from then until 1990) from the late 1960s to the late 1980s. He was the BBC's regular commentator on swimming for many years, covering the sport at many Olympic and Commonwealth Games, often with Anita Lonsbrough. He occasionally commentated on cricket, and often covered the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race which turned out to be his last time commentating on a sporting event. As a serious broadcaster with a mellifluous voice and a deep sense of gravitas, he was regularly called upon to describe the opening and closing ceremonies at events such as the Olympic Games and World Cup, and also covered non-sporting events such as the wedding of Prince Charles to Lady Diana Spencer in 1981, and that of Prince Andrew to Sarah Ferguson in 1986. He also lent his talents to coverage of the State Opening of Parliament. Almost unrivalled for his ability to paint word pictures and capture the excitement of a great occasion, Jones was still regarded as a great broadcaster in the late 1980s, despite the rise of younger, brasher commentators who did not share his Standard English accent. He was deeply affected and saddened by the Hillsborough disaster in 1989, which he witnessed from the commentary box, and gave an emotional description of the memorial service for the victims of the disaster, reciting the words of \\"You'll Never Walk Alone\\". He continued to broadcast regularly, but it has been claimed that he never fully recovered emotionally and personally from the experience of witnessing the Hillsborough disaster, and on 31 March 1990 he collapsed on the BBC launch during his commentary on the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race. He was hospitalised at the end of the race, but died some 36 hours later. He was universally mourned as a great broadcaster and, perhaps, the last of a line, for soon after his death sports broadcasting in the UK underwent a revolution with the arrival of Sky TV and of BBC Radio 5 (later Five Live), taking a more informal and, arguably, more populist and less eloquent style. Personal Life Peter Jones was married with two sons; one of them, Stuart Jones, was football correspondent for The Times when Peter Jones died in 1990. Later Stuart Jones became Tennis Correspondent for The Times in 1990s. He was diagnosed with throat cancer, moved to Barbados, and died in 2013. https://www.sportsjournalists.co.uk/other-bodies/football- writers/former-times-football-writer-stuart-jones-has-died/ Opinions \\"Peter was an old school charmer and an inspirational colleague for all aspiring broadcasters such as I was when I joined BBC Radio Sport in 1984. In my opinion, nobody before or since has ever broadcast with greater descriptive brilliance that Peter did on the day of the Hillsborough disaster. He was absolutely exceptional, and is still missed 20 years after his death.\\" - John Rawling.

There are different types of organic products. However organic product is more known for food items like organic grocery, organic vegetables, organic certified food etc. Most appropriately organic products can be explained as any products that is made or cultivated organically should be treated as an organic product. Most of the country has very strict food safety and security guidelines to protect consumers from consuming harmful products. Most of the country has its own standard to define products as organic. USA uses USDA certification - NOP National Organic Program to defined a cultivated products as organic.Indian Organic - NPOP (National Program for Organic Production). According to USDA, in order for a product to be considered organic, organic standards must be met. Operations involving these organic products must be \\"protecting natural resources, conserving biodiversity, and using only approved substances.\\" To be marketed as \\"organic\\" products require certification and must comply with certain guidelines. In the United States the National List of Allowed and Prohibited Substances details synthetic and non-synthetic substances that can be used in the process of producing organic products. This list involves specific substances that can be used to produce organic material involving crops and livestock.  Type of organic products  # Organic food products # Organic clothing products # Organic personal care products  Organic food products  Organic food products are grown under a system of agriculture without the use of harmful chemical fertilizers and pesticides with an environmentally and socially responsible approach. This is a method of farming that works at grass root level preserving the reproductive and regenerative capacity of the soil, good plant nutrition, and sound soil management, produces nutritious food rich in vitality which has resistance to diseases. In this method growing plants take time to grow naturally and always good for health. Most of the country has its own organic products cultivation regulation monitor organic products. USA use USDA certification, India uses India Organic certification NPOP (National Program for Organic Production). There are many benefits involving organic food products. Organic foods contain fewer pesticides. This means that things such as insecticide that is used in most agricultural practices are eliminated. People are concerned with these chemicals that are used to preserve foods are then being consumed by the people who purchase them. Farming without pesticides is also better for the environment. Fewer chemicals are being placed on the ground, entering the soil and water supply. Organic meats can also contain a lot more nutrients. Nutrients like omega-3 fatty acids were up to 50 percent higher in organic meats and milk than in conventionally raised products. One of the main reasons that deter people from organic products is costs. In 2015, on average, organic products were 47 percent more expensive. Organic products can vary a lot in price. According to a study performed by consumerreports.org, organic products compared to non-organic products ranged anywhere from 13 percent cheaper to 303 percent more expensive. The reason why organic products cost so much more on average is the production process. Many factors contribute to this cost. First, the demand for an organic product is larger than the number of organic products available. Without synthetic pesticides, quantities of foods will be smaller. This smaller production of organic food means an increased cost. Also, the amount of labour per unit of food is larger compared to the mass production of non-organic products.  Organic clothing products  Clothing products made with such raw materials which have been produced by using organic methods are referred to as Organic Clothing. Organic cotton T-shirts are T-shirts which are made from organic cotton that has been grown using organic fertilizers and other supplements instead of inorganic insecticides and pesticides. By definition, organic clothing products are such products whose raw material have been produced using organic methods and the product has been produced using eco-friendly method including the machinery and equipment. Popular clothing brands like Patagonia, are labelled as organic by using 100 percent organic cotton for many of its styles. Even big brands like Nike, Adidas, and Levi's are moving towards a more organic brand. These are 3 of 13 clothing companies that have committed to the 2025 Sustainable Cotton Challenge. Brands who participate in this challenge are committed to using 100 percent sustainable cotton by 2025.  Organic personal care products  Unlike food products, the USDA does not regulate the term \\"organic\\" as it applies to personal care products. A personal care product can be deemed organic if it contains agricultural ingredients and can meet the USDA organic production standards. Once certified by the USDA it can fall into one of four categories: \\"100 percent organic\\", \\"organic\\", \\"made with organic ingredients\\", or \\"made with less than 70 percent organic ingredients.\\" A personal care product can only claim they are USDA-certified organic if they meet the qualifications of the USDA. Consumers are concerned with exactly what they put in and on their bodies. Just like people are concerned with putting more organic foods in their bodies, they are also concerned about using more organic personal care products. Personal care products can fall under a wide variety of products such as deodorant, makeup, tampons, lotion, shampoo, etc. Chemicals in these personal care products can be associated with a wide variety of concerns including things like hormone disruption, allergies, and infertility. Companies are hearing the concerns of these chemicals from consumers and trying to diversify. Many big makeup companies such as Avon and Revlon are removing phthalates from their products. Johnson & Johnson removed many chemicals from their products including parabens, formaldehyde, and certain fragrance chemicals. Cosmetic brands such as Laurel and Rose Mira are both 100 percent organic and have a wide array of skin care products. Similar to organic food, organic personal care products also have a higher price tag. While organic personal care products may lack many of the harmful chemicals that consumers like to stay clear of, this cleaner alternative comes with the cost of a higher price.

Some people visit a Buddhist temple instead. Many visit on the first, second, or third day of the year as most are off work on those days. Generally, wishes for the new year are made, new omamori (charms or amulets) are bought, and the old ones are returned to the shrine so they can be burned. There are often long lines at major shrines throughout Japan. Most of the people in Japan are off work from December 29 until January 3 of every year. It is during this time that the house is cleaned, debts are paid, friends and family are visited and gifts are exchanged. It would be customary to spend the early morning of New Year's Day in domestic worship, followed by sake‚Äîoften containing edible gold flakes‚Äîand special celebration food. During the hatsum≈çde, it is common for men to wear a full kimono‚Äîone of the rare chances to see them doing so across a year. The act of worship is generally quite brief and individual and may involve queuing at popular shrines. Some shrines and temples have millions of visitors over the three days.

If your omikuji predicts bad luck you can tie it onto a tree on the shrine grounds, in the hope that its prediction will not come true. The omikuji goes into detail, and tells you how you will do in various areas in your life, such as business and love, for that year.

The museum is housed in a surviving portion of the Pike's Peak Stables, from which westward-bound Pony Express riders set out on their journey. The Pony Express Museum is one of the most historically educational museums in the country in respect to the legendary mail service that ran from April, 3, 1860 to October 26, 1861. Between exhibits, a 7-part diorama, maps, an archeological dig and artifacts, the museum has entertained and educated visitors from all over the world. The museum just celebrated the 150th Sesquicentennial of the Pony Express on April 1‚Äì3, 2010 which drew over 10,000 people. The museum is located at 914 Penn Street, St. Joseph, Missouri. In 2011, the museum produced a live action documentary titled Days of the Pony Express produced by Jim Conlon with Scout Films. The film was given a favorable review by Wild West Magazine. Stables The Pony Express Stables, also known as Pike's Peak Stables, is a historic stable building located at St. Joseph, Missouri. It is a one-story building, originally built as a wood frame structure in 1858. Its exterior walls were rebuilt in brick in 1888, whether keeping the original structure intact and/or reused some of its posts and beams. The building marked the eastern terminus of the Pony Express. It is now the home of the museum. The building, originally Pike's Peak Stable, was built for care of horses of the local freight and stagecoach company. It was bought in 1860 by the Central Overland California and Pike's Peak Express Company to be used for the Pony Express. In the first Pony Express run on April 3, 1860, William (Billie) Richardson left from here to go the Patee House to pick up a waiting mochilla, then headed west. The building was restored in 1950 by the Goetz Foundation and the Pony Express National Memorial museum was then established. The building is in plan. Its front (north) and side walls are coursed brick, two bricks thick. As of 1970, the rear wall is wood frame on a brick foundation, covered by asbestos board. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970.

His parents were William Few, Sr., and Mary Wheeler (James was their second-oldest son). James migrated with his parents and siblings to Orange County, North Carolina circa 1758. Circa 1770, James married Sarah Wood in Orange County, North Carolina. They had twins, William and Sarah, who were born February 9, 1771. James may have been a carpenter, but so far no primary source documents have come to light to prove that he was or that mentions his occupation. James was executed west of Hillsborough, North Carolina on May 17, 1771, after taking part in the Battle of Alamance. He was executed by North Carolina militia troops while they were serving under North Carolina's royal Governor, William Tryon. James was hanged at the militia's camp approximately five miles northeast of the Alamance battlefield (as described by William Tryon in his orders book). His children moved to Georgia with their grandparents after his death; his wife Sarah later remarried a Loyalist officer and moved to Greenwood County, South Carolina. It is unknown what happened to his body after he was executed; either his family members retrieved it (it took about one day to get to the campsite from their home east of Hillsborough at that time; the campsite was directly on the public road from Hillsborough to Salisbury, North Carolina, just after the ford over Great Alamance Creek) or he was unceremoniously buried at the campsite in an unmarked grave nearby by the militia troops that hanged him.

The canyon's creation began around the same time as the Grand Canyon in the U.S. state of Arizona, by a crack in the area's crust and subsequent erosion by the Grijalva River, which still runs through it. Sumidero Canyon has vertical walls which reach as high as , with the river turning up to 90 degrees during the length of the narrow passage. The canyon is surrounded by the Sumidero Canyon National Park, a federally protected natural area of Mexico which extends for over four municipalities of the state of Chiapas. This park is administered by the National Commission of Protected Natural Areas (CONANP). Most of the vegetation in the park is low- to medium-height deciduous rainforest, with small areas of mixed pine-oak forest and grassland. At the north end of the canyon is the Chicoas√©n Dam and its artificial reservoir, one of several on the Grijalva River, which is important for water storage and the generation of hydroelectric power in the region. The canyon and national park is the second most important tourist site in Chiapas, drawing mostly Mexican visitors who see the canyon from boats which embark on the river from Chiapa de Corzo. The park borders Tuxtla Guti√©rrez, the state's largest city, which has caused problems with human encroachment and settlement on park land. More importantly, the urban areas and logging industries upstream from the canyon have caused serious pollution problems, with up to 5000 tons of solid waste extracted from the Grijalva River each year. This waste tends to build up in the canyon because of its narrowness, the convergence of water flows and the presence of the Chicoas√©n Dam. Description =Geology= The Sumidero Canyon was formed by cracks in the earth's crust along with erosion by the Grijalva River, which still flows through it. The process of its formation began about 35 million years ago, making the Sumidero contemporary with the Grand Canyon on the Colorado River. The Grijalva is the main water system in the area, beginning in the Cuchumatanes in neighboring Guatemala. The river then flows through Chiapas, including the 13-km length of the canyon, from south to north, then on to Tabasco before it empties into the Usumacinta River. This river basin is one of the two most important in Chiapas, and one of the most important in Mexico with a total river length of approximately , draining an area of , with an average flow of about forty million cubic meters. In addition to the Grijalva, there are other flows of water in the area in and around the canyon, many of which are seasonal. These consist of streams, some of which form waterfalls on the canyon's sides, and underground movements which have created caves and karst formations. The last important water formation in the area is the manmade reservoir of the Chicoas√©n Dam. The canyon proper is deep and narrow, characterized by vertical walls. As the gap changes direction as much as 90 degrees in places, it separates the Meseta de las Animas mesa in the west from the Meseta de Ixtapa mesa in the east. The width of the canyon varies from . Most of the canyon's walls are between high, reaching at their highest point. These walls expose a long process of disturbance in the Earth's crust with layers of limestone from the Upper Mesozoic, which contain fossils of marine creatures. During the Mesocretac Period, there was an elevation of ocean floor which formed much of the mountains of the area. =Notable features= Seahorse stalactite in a cave on one of the canyon walls The interior of the canyon has thirty rapids, five waterfalls, three beaches, two freshwater springs and a cofferdam three meters wide. The canyon contains endangered and threatened species such as the Central American river turtle and the American crocodile, which can be seen on the riverbanks. The walls of the canyon contain numerous small caves, rock formations and other notable features. The best known of the area's caves is the Cueva de Colores (\\"Cave of Colors\\"). This cave gets its name from the filtration of magnesium, potassium and other minerals which form colors on the walls, especially shades of pink. It contains an image of the Virgin of Guadalupe inside usually surrounded by fresh flowers and burning candles left by visitors. The Cueva de Silencio (\\"Cave of Silence\\") is so named because of a lack of echo or any other kind of resonance in its interior. In another small cave, there is a stalactite called the Caballito de Mar or \\"Seahorse\\" after its shape. Of the various seasonal waterfalls, the best known is the √Årbol de Navidad (\\"Christmas Tree\\"). The ‚Äúbranches‚Äù of the √Årbol are made by deposits from the waterfall which have been covered in moss. During the rainy season, when the waterfall is active, the water and the light change the colors of the ‚Äúbranches‚Äù and make the formation stand out. The park was a candidate in 2009 as one of the Seven New Natural Wonders of the World. =Climate= Despite its biological, ecological and cultural diversity, there have been few studies performed in the park area. For this reason, there is a lack of information about species, habitats and water flow. There is also relatively little information about how human activities affect the park. As the park is located in the Central Valley of Chiapas and borders the Northern Mountains region, altitudes vary from approximately above sea level in the municipality of Chiapa de Corzo to above sea level at the El Roblar lookout point. This geography produces a channel for air flow from northwest to southeast as well as three main climates based on the K√∂eppen system as modified for Mexico. These are hot and dry (where airflow is blocked), semi- hot and humid, and hot and humid. The average rainfall for the park is about 1,000 mm during the rainy season from May to October and 200 mm during the dry season from November to April. Average annual temperature is 26 ¬∞C. The rugged terrain also forms a number of microclimates. =Vegetation= View of canyon from above View of the river valley from the air Most of the park's vegetation, especially around the canyon, is dense tropical rainforest. Most species found in the park are members of the family Fabaceae with 59 species and the family Asteraceae with 25 species, which reflect the abundance of these families statewide. Other important families include the Orchidaceae and Euphorbiaceae, each with 22 species, the family Convolvulaceae with 17 species, and the Cactaceae with 11 species. 122 species are considered valuable as ornamental plants with 46 having medicinal uses and 31 species valuable for logging. These mostly come from the rainforest areas. The rainforest vegetation is mostly deciduous, shedding leaves in the dry season. However, there are perennial rainforests, forests of pine and oak, grasslands (mostly induced) and areas with secondary vegetation. The three main vegetation classifications are low-height rainforest, medium-height rainforest (as per the size of the trees), pine-oak forest and meadows. Medium-height deciduous rainforest is mostly located on either side of the canyon, in the north and east of the part towards San Fernando and in the Ca√±ada Mu√±iz at altitudes of between 150 and 1250 masl. It is mostly found in areas with basalt or granite rock and where there are lime deposits, covering an area of in total. While many plants here loose leaves in the dry season, there are some that retain them year-round. Maximum height of trees varies between 25 and 30 meters. The density of the tree cover in these areas is enough to lower temperatures on the ground in the summer rainy season due to the maximum foliage which occurs at this time. The tree cover is composed of the following species: breadnut (Brosimum alicastrum), guanacaste (Enterolobium cyclocarpum), totoposte (Licania arb√≥rea), jocotillo (Astronium graveolens), cedar (Cedrela odorata), cuaulote blanco (Luehea candida), hormiguillo (Platymiscium dimorphandrum), chicozapote (Manilkara zapota), tempisque (Mastichodendron capiri) and various types of amate fig trees (Ficus spp.). Under the tree cover, there is significant plant diversity, including palms and araceas. Epiphytes (air plants) are abundant as well, along with orchids, Bromeliaceae and cactus. Cactus are primarily found on the vertical walls of the canyon and belong to the Acanthocereus family. In the 1970s, tree area in a good state of conservation amounted to , or 17.72% of the total land area. From 1988 to 1993, this amount was reduced to , or 5.35%. From 1990 to 2000, it is estimated that eight percent of the remaining forests and 38% of the rainforests were damaged. Many of the areas in good condition are broken up by disturbed areas. Most of the damage is due to illegal logging and the clearing of land for pasture or agriculture. Medium-height perennial rainforest (also known as evergreen cloud forest) exists only in small dispersed patches, mostly on the sides of the canyon in contact with the Grijalva River. Many of these patches are less than one hectare in size, as they are located on small areas of flat land at altitudes between 1000 and 2,500 masl. The soils are rich in undecomposed plant matter which holds in moisture. Low-height deciduous rainforest is mostly found around the La Ceiba and La Coyota lookout points in the south and southeast sections of the park, with some in the east towards the La Chacona Ca√±ada. These occupy a territory of in the park. Tree heights extend from four to ten meters with some as high as 15 meters. Non- tree species are not as common and mostly consist of succulent species such as Agave, Opuntia, Stenocereus and Cephalocereus. Other important species include Alvaradoa amorphoides, Bursera simaruba, Ceiba acuminate, Bursera bipinnata, Bursera excels, Cochlospermum vitifolium, Haematoxylon brasiletto, Piscidia piscipula, Swietenia humilis, Acacia collinsii and Pseudobombax ellipticum. Pine-oak forests exist in the northwest of the park in the highest altitudes, covering about . They are part of the same type of forest found in the Soyal√≥ region it is adjacent to. They are found at an altitude of 1,200 masl and above in areas that receive precipitation of about 1500 mm annually. The most common species is the oak Quercus conspersa, often found mixed with the two kinds of rainforest found in the park. Air plants are common here as well as bromeliads, orchids and plants from the Maxillaria, Lycaste, Cattleya and Laelia groups. Grassland is not naturally occurring but rather exists due to human activities such as farming and livestock raising. It is seen on the north and south sides of the canyon and is usually associated with secondary vegetation such as Tecoma stans, Gliricidia sepium, Plumeria rubra and Acacia collinsii, occupying an area of in the park. =Wildlife= American crocodile Throughout the history of the area, especially since it was definitively explored in the 1960s, the area's wildlife diversity has been severely negatively impacted by human encroachment in the form of settlements, agriculture and hunting. However, since the federal park was established in the 1980s, wildlife diversity has increased. In 1986, the federal Secretar√≠a de Agricultura y Recursos Hidr√°ulicos (SARH) reported a total of ninety species of vertebrates divided into four species of fish, one amphibian, 14 reptiles, 26 birds and 40 mammals. A 2005 study indicates 308 species with four species of fish, 15 amphibians, 195 birds, and 53 mammals. Between these two, there have been a number of other studies which also show the growth of the number of wildlife species in the park. Information about fish species is scarce but at least four protected species have been detected. According to a CONANP study in 2007, there are 12 species of reptile here under protection, including the river crocodile (Crocodylus acutus), and one threatened species, the Yucat√°n banded gecko (Coleonyx elegans). Birds are the most common type of animal in the park, with about 195 species documented. Six of these species are threatened and 17 are subject to special protection. One threatened bird species in the park is the great curassow (Crax rubra). Relatively abundant species include Actitus macularia, Dendrocygna autumnalis, Egretta caerulea, Egretta thula, Tachybaptus dominicus and Coragyps atratus, all of which are associated with bodies of water. There have been 53 species of mammals detected recently in the park, of which two are considered threatened, two in danger and two subject to special protection. Endangered and threatened species include the spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi), jaguarundi, ocelot, lowland paca, white-tailed deer, anteater (Tamandua tetradactyla) and buzzard (Sarcoramphus papa). The most abundant species include the bat Artibeus jamaicensis and the rat Peromyscus mexicanus. National park =Establishment of the park= Inside the Cueva de Colores Some of the rainforest around in the park The Sumidero Canyon National Park has its origins in a Chiapas state decree issued in 1972, which made the area around the canyon an ecological reserve to preserve its geology, history and wildlife and to allow for scientific study. For similar reasons, the park was taken over and enlarged to 21,789 hectares by the federal government in 1980. Most private landholders in the area were compensated for their lands, but not all resident persons or businesses were evicted. Since that time, the park has been under the administration of various agencies such as SAHOP, SEDUE and SEMARNAP, with the current managers being the Comisi√≥n Nacional de √Åreas Naturales Protegidas and the Secretar√≠a de Educaci√≥n P√∫blica. In 2004, the park came under the protection of the Ramsar Convention due to the importance of its ecology and water systems. It was also named a Regi√≥n Prioritaria Terrestre and an √Årea de Importancia para la Conservaci√≥n de las Aves by the Comisi√≥n Nacional para el Conocimiento y Uso de la Biodiversidad (CONABIO) in 2000. In 2005 and 2006, this agency enlarged the park again with the expropriation of lands in the municipalities of San Fernando and Tuxtla Guti√©rrez, adding a total of . It remains, however, smaller than most other national parks in Mexico. The center of the park is the Sumidero Canyon and the Grijalva River that runs from south to north through it. The park's borders on this river are marked by the Belisario Dom√≠nguez Bridge, over which the Pan-American Highway runs, in the south and the Chicoas√©n Dam, to the north. The rest of the park's borders extend into the municipalities of Tuxtla Guti√©rrez, Chiapa de Corzo, Osumacinta and San Fernando. This territory is mostly located in the Central Valley region of the state. The park is open 365 days a year. The park is divided into four sections by direction: the northwest includes medium-height, somewhat deciduous rainforest as well as some lowland rainforest and grassland, found in the municipalities of Osumacinta and San Fernando; the western section has similar vegetation, and is located entirely in San Fernando; the eastern section has forests of pine as well as medium-height semi-deciduous rainforest and grasslands, and is found in Chiapa de Corzo; and the southeast has most of the sides of the canyon itself and a navigable section of the Grijalva River, but only remnants of medium-height rainforest and pachycaulous vegetation. The main land access into the park is from Tuxtla Guti√©rrez north through Osumacinta then past the Chicoas√©n Dam. Another access point is from Chiapa de Corzo by boat from the Cahuar√© Docks. As the main attraction of the park is the canyon, several lookout points have been constructed on various parts of the rim. La Ceiba is closest to the city of Tuxtla Guti√©rrez, only away. The Los Chiapas point is near where the canyon's walls rise highest from the river below, where according to legend, a number of Chiapa people preferred to commit suicide by jumping rather than submit to Spanish domination. This lookout also has a restaurant. Conservation issues The most important conservation issue in the park is the contamination of the Grijalva River, which passes through the Sumidero Canyon proper. However, other threats to the park include human encroachment and other human activities. An estimated 1500 to 2000 hectares, or about six percent of the park total, have been encroached upon, mostly by illegal human settlements next to the city of Tuxtla Guti√©rrez since the park was established. It is estimated that about 15,000 people live within the park's borders. Most of these illegal constructions belong to the very poor who have migrated to the city from elsewhere. The demand for living space has created an industry of illegal subdivisions which are then sold without the proper title to victims. Three of the main neighborhoods to develop in this way are the Patria Nueva Alta, Arroyo Blanco, La Esperanza and Las Granjas. The encroachment is a result of the fast population growth of Tuxtla Guti√©rrez and Chiapa de Corzo. The growth of these areas has led to land ownership disputes, loss of wild habitat and deforestation. In 2002, the federal and state government signed an accord to remove illegal human settlements and work to prevent further encroachment. Operations to evict illegal settlers have been carried out such as a 2005 operation which evicted about one hundred people and others that have prevented new settlements from getting established. However, the encroachment of human settlements into the park from the city of Tuxtla Guti√©rrez has been so damaging that a 2007 report states that there is no other alternative than to deregulate this section of the park and work to prevent further incursion. However, the situation has not been helped by the fact that there are disputes over the boundaries of the park as decreed in 1980. Since 2009, there have been further efforts by park management to stop the advancement of these illegal settlements as well. Despite this, a number of areas in the park are well-conserved, mostly due to the very rugged terrain. In addition to the illegal settlements, there are legal settlements and operations which affect the park. There are eight ejidos which border the parks and whose activities directly affect it: San Antonio Zaragoza, Venustiano Carranza, Francisco Sarabia, Gabriel Esquinca, Benito Ju√°rez, Osumacinta, El Palmar, 16 de Septiembre and Nuevo Bochil. Established before the park, there are still five ejidos and three human settlements established within, Libertad Campesina (population 495), Nueva Esperanza (139), La Uni√≥n (329), El Para√≠so (134), Tierra Colorada (199), La Candelaria / Triunfo Agrarista (631). As of 2005, the total population within the park's borders was 1927. Because of human activity, this park is one of the most susceptible to wildfires, and the most damaged by such in Mexico from 2009 to 2011. Many of these were started by human activity in or near the park such as one fire set on a nearby farm in May 2011. In addition to this, there are lime and other extraction operations within the park's borders. They exist legally because they had been there well before the park was established. However, these operations have destroyed about 2,600 hectares. These operations produce noise, smoke, dust and small tremblers from explosions used to extract the minerals. Much of the environment damage come from runoff from mining waste which winds up in the Grijalva River. However the dust and smoke have produced a distinct white coating on surrounding flora. =Pollution problems= Grijalva River near Tuxtla Guti√©rrez Via the Grijalva River, the wastewater of about 552,000 people in seventeen municipalities finds its way through the canyon according to park director Edda Gonz√°lez del Castilla, with most coming from Tuxtla Guti√©rrez, Chiapa de Corzo, Berrioz√°bal and Chicoas√©n . Much of the sewage comes into the Grijalva via the Sabinal River, which carries most of the waste water of the city of Tuxtla Guti√©rrez. In addition, trash and raw sewage makes its way into the river from the various tributary streams. Agricultural waste comes from the farms that line the river and its tributaries. The most obvious pollution is garbage, especially plastic containers, which mostly comes from area homes and businesses tossed onto the ground or in streams, especially from Chiapa de Corzo and Tuxtla Guti√©rrez due to the lack of environmental awareness according to Conanp. The quantity of this trash reaches its height during the rainy season, when runoff and swollen streams can carry more of it into the Grijalva. While bottles and other plastic are what the casual visitor generally notices, other indicators include the overgrowth of water lilies (due to high levels of fecal matter) and dead animals. However, this accounts for only about five percent of the total tonnage of waste that comes into the river each year. Somewhere between 80 and 90% of the waste solids found in the river is branches, wood, rocks, sediment and other debris from legal and illegal logging, which cause deforestation . These mostly come into the river during the rainy season, especially from the Villa Flores and Villa Corzo municipalities. Only a small part of the solid waste is visible on the surface of the water, most is hidden underneath. As the solids flow along the Grijalva, they are constricted by the narrow channel of the canyon and then by the presence of the Chicoas√©n Dam. This is particularly true at a point called ‚ÄúEl Tap√≥n‚Äù (The Plug), where two currents of water meet just before the reservoir back up of water from the Dam. It is estimated that about 5000 tons of trash accumulate each year, and the river is considered to be one of the five most polluted in Mexico. 3700 tons of solids were extracted from the canyon area in 2010 alone. Many fish have died off or have developed abnormally due to contamination by fertilizers, pesticides and other chemicals. This threatens the native American crocodiles as the agrochemicals kill off and poison the fish they need to eat. In May 2011, the F√©d√©ration Internationale de Natation decided cancel its annual swim marathon in the canyon as they claimed that pollution levels in the river posed a risk to swimmers‚Äô health. The Comisi√≥n Nacional del Agua and the government of Chiapas disputed this, presenting their own test results stating that levels were below such levels. There are year-round and seasonal efforts to clean the river within the canyon and the area just upstream from it. Much of the daily effort is undertaken by workers with the Comisi√≥n Nacional de √Åreas Naturales Protegidas (CONANP) and the Secretariat of Tourism in Chiapas, which extract twelve tons of garbage from the Grijalva river each day. Most of the season cleanup coincides with the rainy season, especially in September and October, when rains are heaviest. This seasonal effort has included local police, civil protections agencies, social organization, the army and individual volunteers. Efforts can involve up to 600 people at a time using 32 boats from four of the tourist cooperatives. During the annual campaign to clean the canyon in 2005 more than 60,000 tons of trash was removed. Generally, about forty tons of garbage is collected each day during these campaigns. While the cleanup efforts have improved the situation in the canyon, the garbage reaccumulates especially during the rainy season. Part of the price that tourists pay for boat rides into the canyon pays for cleanup efforts, but the boat operators state that the canyon remains filled with trash. Conanp also states that cleanup efforts are insufficient. Mexico's federal environmental agency, the Secretar√≠a de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (Semarnat) states that it cannot get involved in the situation as it is the municipalities that have the responsibility for disposing of trash appropriately. However, many of these local governments do not have landfills or the separation of recyclables. Tourism Scene at the main docks in Chiapa de Corzo, with tour boats Hut and dock of the Amik√∫u Ecological Park The scenery of the canyon has become a major tourist attraction for the state, with developments for eco tourism and extreme sports. The navigable part of the Grijalva River is mostly used to ferry visitors into the canyon area. The park has six lookout points accessible by land called La Ceiba, La Coyota, El Roblar, Tepehuaje, Los Chiapas and Manos. In the rainy season, tourism is enhanced by the activity of waterfalls such as the √Årbol de Navidad, Cueva del Hombre, Cueva del Silencio, Cueva de Col√≥n, Cueva de Colores and Cueva del Suspiro. A lesser known attraction is the archeological site called the Ruins of Berlin. The most important economic activity in the canyon is ecotourism. Most of the visitors are Mexicans. Weekends are busiest with local and regional visitors to bike, swim, hike, camp and picnic. The canyon is the second most visited site in Chiapas, after Palenque. The park is visited annually by 300,000 people, about 80% of whom are from Mexico and the rest from abroad. During vacation times, the park may be visited by anywhere from 1,000 to 7,000 people per day, who either enter by car to go to the lookout points or by boat from Chiapa de Corzo. Entrance and boating fees can generate about 70,000 pesos per day for clean-up efforts. The number of visitors to the park hit a peak in 2003 with about 196,500. Commercial activity in the park is limited to those which serve tourists, sales of food and Mexican handcrafts and folk art. Tour operators are organized into cooperatives, with food and craft vendors working independently. These merchants must receive an annual permit in order to operate within the park's borders. The most important of these businesses are the boats which ferry people through the canyon along the Grijalva River. Most of these boat tours operate out of Chiapa de Corzo and run along the river to the Chicoas√©n Dam for a distance of about . Chiapa de Corzo has two main docks for this activity. The largest and oldest is called Cahuare, with paved areas and a restaurant; the second smaller one also has restaurants and a swimming area as well. These two docks host six tour cooperatives, with about 120 boats that can hold between ten and forty passengers each. As they take visitors from Chiapa de Corzo or Tuxtla Guti√©rrez through the canyon and to the dam, they provide environmental, historical and cultural information. These are the most organized tourist activities in the park. A spate of accidents involving these boats occurred from late 2009 to early 2010, claiming the lives of six tourists and hurt sixty two others. The accidents occurred on decrepit boats, many of which were operating without permission with underage or unlicensed crew members. There were no ambulance boats and no first aid services on shore. Two of the cooperatives, √Ångel Albino Corzo and Nandiume were suspended and fined for the accidents, taking about sixty boats out of operation. These boating accidents caused significant problems for the tourism industry. For those who choose to see the canyon from the lookout points above, there are restaurants and other food service places as well as camping and picnicking facilities. The other two attractions of the park are general ecotourism and extreme sports. The park has hiking paths and sports fishing is allowed sporadically by permit. There are some locations that rent kayaks and other boats. The Amik√∫u Ecological Park is located within the canyon area, which is accessible by boat from Chiapa de Corzo. The park is divided into three parts; Discover the Canyon, Colors of Chiapas, and Area of Adventure. The first is located in the dock area, with a demonstration of the history of the canyon and a video of its geological formation. There is also a souvenir shop here. The interior of the park contains a 300 meter long zip line. Colors of Chiapas is a small museum which exhibits the traditional dress and native musical instruments of the state's indigenous peoples. The Area of Adventure takes visitors on a tour of the rainforest area, which include a suspension bridge. It also has a herpetarium, an aviary and enclosure for jaguars and one for crocodiles. The park was opened in 2009 at an initial cost of 120 million pesos. Extreme sports include mountain biking, rappelling, spelunking and more. Rappelling allows for access to many of the canyon's small caves which are not accessible any other way. The dam area has recreational fishing with an annual tournament. One major annual event is the Copa Mundo Fino swimming marathon. An Australian base jumper plunged to his death in 2006 after jumping off an 800-meter cliff in the canyon. The accident occurred during a sanctioned event sponsored by an energy drink maker with jumpers from Australia, the U.S., Europe and Mexico. Chicoas√©n Dam Looking south towards the Sumidero Canyon from the reservoir of the Chicoas√©n Dam At the northern end of the Sumidero Canyon is the Chicoas√©n Dam, formally called the Manuel M. Torres Dam, is one of a number of dams which have been built along the Grijalva River for water storage and the generation of hydroelectric power. This dam and its reservoir is considered to be part of the Sumidero Canyon system. The Sumidero Canyon National Park is defined on the north end of the river by this dam and the Belisario Dom√≠nguez Bridge on the south. The dam was constructed between 1974 and 1980. The reservoir covers an average of 2,193 hectares, and the complex employs about 600 workers. The Chicoas√©n Dam produces electricity and manages the flow of the Grijalva river along with the Hondo River and the Mu√±iz, El Jard√≠n and El Cacao streams, which converge to form the Osumacinta River. This reservoir is one of the most important in the country. The hydroelectric station is also one of the most important in the country with thirty generators with installed capacity of 3,928.48 megawatts. This is just over thirty percent of all hydroelectric energy produced in Mexico. History and archaeology of the area The history of the area is connected to the Chiapa people, who occupied the Central Valley area before the arrival of the Spanish. The origin of these people is not known, but theories have them migrating north from Nicaragua or even Paraguay. Their main settlement was in Chiapa de Corzo near the canyon, with a fortified area in the higher areas in the canyon for protection from invasions. The Chiapa fiercely resisted Spanish conquest and were not subdued until the arrival of Diego de Mazariegos in 1528. Their last refuge was in the fortified area, now known as the archeological site of the Ruins of Berlin. Here the last of the Chiapa held out from 1528 to 1535 after the Spanish took over the main city. Legend states that when this last fortification fell, the remaining Chiapa committed collective suicide by jumping into the canyon. Since then, the canyon has served as a boundary marker between the Zoque and Tzotzil peoples. Until the 20th century, the canyon area was relatively unexplored. In 1895, three Frenchmen attempted to explore the canyon but were drowned in the river. An American came in 1932 but also perished. This gave rise to legends about witchcraft in the areas as well as the ferocity of the area's crocodiles. In 1960, an expedition of soldiers from the Mexican army, nicknamed the ‚Äúred handkerchiefs‚Äù succeeded into crossing through the canyon by boat over twenty km. This opened up the canyon to local exploration and exploitation, including rudimentary tourism and the hunting of crocodiles and other native fauna. There has been little archaeological work done in the area. The main site is called the Ruins of Berlin, named after German explorer Heinrich Berlin, who visited the area in 1946 and named the area ‚ÄúSumidero\\". This site is located seven km from the Belisario Dom√≠nguez Bridge in Tuxtla on the edge of the river. It covers an area of 467 by 60 meters, bounded by small mounds surrounding patios. The original description of the site was undertaken in 1923 and 1932 by Becerra, who called it Chiapa Viejo, and stated it was the capital of the Chiapa people. However, Remesal in 1966 determined it was a secondary site. The last major survey was done in 1976 by Alejandro Mart√≠nez, discovering that there are 24 individual sites of which nine are mounds and fifteen are in caves. One of these contains cave paintings which indicate that the area has been occupied since at least the very early Pre Classic period.

The lake, located about 10 miles (15 km) west of Tallahassee, is south of Interstate 10 and bordered by State Road 20 on the east and State Road 267 on the west. The lake was created by the construction of the C. H. Corn Hydroelectric Generating Station, and used for the generation of hydroelectric power. The name Talquin is a contraction of the names of the two cities the lake lies between, Tallahassee and Quincy. Lake Talquin State Forest includes several tracts of land along the lake's shoreline.  History  The Talquin Dam In 1927 the Jackson Bluff Dam was constructed on the Ochlockonee River to produce hydroelectric power. The waters held back by the dam formed Lake Talquin. On August 18, 1962, the lake was the site of a tragedy when 17 children and one adult drowned in the capsizing of a boat while they were on an outing.\\"Seventeen Children Drown While On Church Outing\\", Ocala (FL) Star-Banner, August 19, 1962, p1 In 1971, approximately 20,000 acres (80 km¬≤) of uplands and 10,000 acres (40 km¬≤) of lake bottom were donated by the Florida Power Corporation to the State of Florida to form Lake Talquin State Recreation Area. Much of the shore of the lake is now part of Lake Talquin State Forest. The waters that now cover Lake Talquin‚Äôs floodplain are shallow except along the old channel of the river. The abundance of dead trees and stumps scattered about are reminders of the rich floodplain forest that once covered the area before the lake was formed. Most of the stumps can be found right under the water on the eastern end of the lake causing problems for boaters. The lake is unusual insofar as its easternmost point is only 11 miles from Florida's state capital of Tallahassee, yet its shores remain pristine and recreational use remains sparse even today.  Vegetation  The area has forests of pines and hardwoods including sweetgum and a variety of oaks.  Topography  Rolling hills and deep ravines surround the lake. The water level is usually at the 70-ft contour (70 feet above sea level), but it can vary by as much as 3 feet. The lake's nominal surface area is about 10,000 acres, or about 15 square miles, but because of the shallow gradient in some of the inlets and the seasonal variations in water level, it is not possible to state a more precise figure for the size of the lake. The lake's shoreline measures more than 40 miles, and considerably more if one includes all of the nooks and crannies of the numerous inlets. Most of this shoreline is public land, and is therefore undeveloped. Most of the lake measures approximately 1 mile in width. The total length of the lake is almost 20 miles (depending on where one decides the river ends and the lake begins).  Wildlife  Eastern gray squirrels, fox squirrels, wild turkey, bald eagles, ospreys, alligators and whitetail deer are found in the forests surrounding the lake. Also commonly seen are egrets, blue herons, water turtles of several varieties, and water snakes, including water moccasins. Insect life is abundant, and mosquitoes and chiggers in particular can be troublesome during the summer months.  Recreation  Lake Talquin State Forest encompasses much of the southern and southwestern shores of the lake, with many boat landings and picnic areas, including Rock Bluff Recreation Area in Leon County. There are facilities for private picnics, parties, family reunions, weddings and receptions. The lake is also home to the Florida State University Crew Club, a rowing club. = Fishing = Lake Talquin has largemouth and striped bass, crappie, bream, pickerel (commonly called \\"jack\\"), gar, catfish, and bowfin.

Partial solution of the \\"Squaring the circle\\" task, suggested by Hippocrates. The area of the shaded figure is equal to the area of the triangle ABC. This is not a complete solution of the task (the complete solution is proven to be impossible with compass and straightedge). Hippocrates of Chios (; c. 470 - c. 410 BC) was an ancient Greek mathematician, geometer, and astronomer. He was born on the isle of Chios, where he was originally a merchant. After some misadventures (he was robbed by either pirates or fraudulent customs officials) he went to Athens, possibly for litigation, where he became a leading mathematician. On Chios, Hippocrates may have been a pupil of the mathematician and astronomer Oenopides of Chios. In his mathematical work there probably was some Pythagorean influence too, perhaps via contacts between Chios and the neighboring island of Samos, a center of Pythagorean thinking: Hippocrates has been described as a 'para- Pythagorean', a philosophical 'fellow traveler'. \\"Reduction\\" arguments such as reductio ad absurdum argument (or proof by contradiction) have been traced to him, as has the use of power to denote the square of a line.W. W. Rouse Ball, A Short Account of the History of Mathematics (1888) p. 36.  Mathematics  The major accomplishment of Hippocrates is that he was the first to write a systematically organized geometry textbook, called Elements (Œ£œÑŒøŒπœáŒµ·øñŒ±, Stoicheia), that is, basic theorems, or building blocks of mathematical theory. From then on, mathematicians from all over the ancient world could, at least in principle, build on a common framework of basic concepts, methods, and theorems, which stimulated the scientific progress of mathematics. Only a single, famous fragment of Hippocrates' Elements is existent, embedded in the work of Simplicius. In this fragment the area is calculated of some so-called Hippocratic lunes -- see Lune of Hippocrates. This was part of a research program to achieve the \\"quadrature of the circle\\", that is, to calculate the area of the circle, or, equivalently, to construct a square with the same area as a circle. The strategy, apparently, was to divide a circle into a number of crescent-shaped parts. If it were possible to calculate the area of each of those parts, then the area of the circle as a whole would be known too. Only much later was it proven (by Ferdinand von Lindemann, in 1882) that this approach had no chance of success, because the factor pi (œÄ) is transcendental. The number œÄ is the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle, and also the ratio of the area to the square of the radius. In the century after Hippocrates, at least four other mathematicians wrote their own Elements, steadily improving terminology and logical structure. In this way, Hippocrates' pioneering work laid the foundation for Euclid's Elements (c. 325 BC), which was to remain the standard geometry textbook for many centuries. Hippocrates is believed to have originated the use of letters to refer to the geometric points and figures in a proposition, e.g., \\"triangle ABC\\" for a triangle with vertices at points A, B, and C. Two other contributions by Hippocrates in the field of mathematics are noteworthy. He found a way to tackle the problem of 'duplication of the cube', that is, the problem of how to construct a cube root. Like the quadrature of the circle, this was another of the so-called three great mathematical problems of antiquity. Hippocrates also invented the technique of 'reduction', that is, to transform specific mathematical problems into a more general problem that is easier to solve. The solution to the more general problem then automatically gives a solution to the original problem.  Astronomy  In the field of astronomy, Hippocrates tried to explain the phenomena of comets and the Milky Way. His ideas have not been handed down very clearly, but he probably thought both were optical illusions, the result of refraction of solar light by moisture that was exhaled by, respectively, a putative planet near the Sun, and the stars. The fact that Hippocrates thought that light rays originated in our eyes instead of in the object that is seen, adds to the unfamiliar character of his ideas.

She was the daughter of Fulk V of Anjou and Ermengarde of Maine, and wife of William Clito and Thierry, Count of Flanders. She was the regent of Flanders in 1147-1149. In 1123 Sibylla married William Clito, son of the Norman Robert Curthose and future Count of Flanders. Sibylla brought the County of Maine to this marriage, which was annulled in 1124 on grounds of consanguinity. The annulment was made by Pope Honorius II upon request from Henry I of England, William's uncle; Fulk opposed it and did not consent until Honorius excommunicated him and placed an interdict over Anjou. Sibylla then accompanied her widower father to the crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem, where he married Melisende, the heiress of the kingdom, and became king himself in 1131. In 1139 she married Thierry, Count of Flanders, who had arrived on his first pilgrimage to the Holy Land. She returned to Flanders with her new husband, and during his absence on the Second Crusade the pregnant Sibylla acted as regent of the county. Baldwin IV, Count of Hainaut took the opportunity to attack Flanders, but Sibylla led a counter-attack and pillaged Hainaut. In response Baldwin ravaged Artois. The archbishop of Reims intervened and a truce was signed, but Thierry took vengeance on Baldwin when he returned in 1149. In 1157 she travelled with Thierry on his third pilgrimage, but after arriving in Jerusalem she separated from her husband and refused to return home with him. She became a nun at the Convent of Sts. Mary and Martha in Bethany, where her step-aunt, Ioveta of Bethany, was abbess. Ioveta and Sibylla supported Queen Melisende and held some influence over the church, and supported the election of Amalric of Nesle as Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem over a number of other candidates. Sibylla died in Bethany in 1165.

(2003) The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, , p. 452-3 The Photos signed to CBS Records but moved on to Epic Records after one single. They released a self-titled album (Epic, 1980) and number of singles. These included \\"I'm So Attractive\\" and \\"Barbarellas\\" (concerning the closure of a Birmingham nightclub). The album was successful, reaching number 4 in the UK Albums Chart, and Wu's picture was briefly a regular item in the music press. Initial copies of the vinyl release of the album came with a bonus album, The Blackmail Tapes, the additional tracks also included on the cassette release, and the album was supported by the group performing numerous concerts around the UK. The album was later re-released in CD format, although only a limited number of copies were pressed. The CD was re-released in October 2007 by Cherry Red Records, the label originally due to have signed the band before they were contracted to CBS. The re-release includes some additional tracks including \\"I'm So Attractive\\". They released several singles in the UK including \\"I'm So Attractive\\". which was added to the US album release. \\"I'm So Attractive\\" was not included on the CD that was released in 1999, along with eight additional tracks from The Blackmail Tapes. Their scheduled appearance on BBC Television's Top of the Pops was cancelled due to industrial action. A second album, Crystal Tips and Mighty Mice, was released in promotional form in 1981, but withdrawn before it reached the shops, and reissued by Cherry Red Records in 2008. Wu left the band in 1981, to be replaced by Che, and The Photos split up later that year. Wu went on to release some generally poorly received solo singles during 1982 and 1983 and joined Steve Strange to form the duo Strange Cruise in 1986. The Photos reformed without Wu, although this line-up only released one single, \\"There's Always Work\\", in 1983. Later, when Harrison had left the band, they reformed briefly with Angus Hines playing drums. They were joined by Wu for a one-off gig at London's Marquee Club, before finally disbanding. Steve Eagles became guitarist in Ted Milton's Blurt, and later formed Bang Bang Machine. Oliver Harrison went on to become a filmmaker.

Her parents are Hunter Davies and Margaret Forster, both well-known writers.BBC: Author Margaret Forster dies from cancer aged 77 (accessed 8 February 2016) Hunter Davies wrote regularly about Caitlin and her brother Jake and sister Flora in a weekly Punch magazine column which ran in the 1970s, giving a broad insight into their upbringing. In her youth she was also frequently referred to by Auberon Waugh in his Private Eye diary. Although born in England, Davies has been associated with Botswana since 1990 when she met her husband, the former Botswana MP Ronald Ridge, while studying for a Master's in English at Clark University, USA. Relocating to Botswana and working as a teacher, and then a freelance journalist, she wrote for Botswana's first tabloid newspaper The Voice and then as editor of The Okavango Newspaper. She was twice arrested as a journalist, once for \\"causing fear and alarm\\", and acquitted. In 2000, she received an award from the Media Institute of Southern Africa (MISA) 'in recognition for consistent and outstanding journalistic work.' While living in Botswana she wrote the novel Jamestown Blues and the historical work The Return of El Negro. The victim of a brutal assault and rape, she was active in research concerning domestic violence in Botswana and a founder member of Women Against Rape (WAR) in Maun. She returned to England with her daughter after divorcing her husband and published a memoir about her experiences, called Place of Reeds, described by Hilary Mantel as 'candid and unsentimental'. For several years she wrote education and careers features for The Independent. Davies is the author of six novels; Jamestown Blues (1996), Black Mulberries (2008), Friends Like Us (2009), The Ghost of Lily Painter (2011) a fictionalised account of two Edwardian baby farmers who were hanged at Holloway Prison in 1903, Family Likeness (2013) which draws on the experiences of mixed race UK children born to African American GIs during World War Two, as well as the story of Dido Elizabeth Belle, Britain's 'first black aristocrat'. Daisy Belle: Swimming Champion of the World, based on the life of Agnes Beckwith, was published in 2018. Davies wrote an illustrated non-fiction book on the bathing ponds and lido on Hampstead Heath, Taking the Waters: a swim around Hampstead Heath, and a social history of Camden Lock (2013). Her work has appeared in The Sunday Times, The Telegraph, The Mail on Sunday, Town and Country and Tate Etc.. In 2015 her non-fiction book Downstream: a history and celebration of swimming the River Thames was published. It was described by The Independent as 'a fascinating cultural history'. It resulted in a three-week Thames swimming showcase at the Museum of London. Caitlin is the historical advisor for the hit independent film The Ponds, directed by Patrick McLennan and Samuel Smith, and an ambassador for the Thames Baths Project which will reintroduce swimming to the River Thames in central London. Her latest non-fiction book, Bad Girls (John Murray), is a history of Holloway Prison in north London, once the largest women's prison in Western Europe. The prison closed in July 2016; the site is being redeveloped for housing. Davies was the only journalist granted access to the prison and its archives. Bad Girls is described as 'an absorbing study' by the Sunday Times and a 'ripping good read' by Jeremy Corbyn, MP. Bad Girls was longlisted for the Orwell Prize for Political Writing 2019 https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-prizes/2019-prize/longlists/. Davies is currently working on a new book, Queens of the Underworld: a journey into the lives of female gangsters, to be published by The History Press in October 2021. https://www.thebookseller.com/news/history-press-signs-book- forgotten-female-gangsters-1081411. She has received a grant from The Author's Foundation, administered by the Society of Authors, to research the book. From 2014 to 2017 Davies worked as a Royal Literary Fund Fellow at the University of Westminster, in the faculty of Media, Arts & Design, Harrow Campus. She has been an RLF Fellow at the Victoria & Albert Museum and the Science Museum since February 2019. Bibliography *Jamestown Blues.

Life in Switzerland Ferdinand Brader was born in Kaltbrunn, St. Gallen, Switzerland, the son of Johann Baptist Brader and Anna Maria Steiner. On August 28, 1860 he married Maria Katherina Karolina Glaus of Benken, St. Gallen and their son Carl Ferdinand was born December 20, 1864. Ferdinand Arnold Brader emigrated to Pennsylvania in the United States sometime in the early 1870s.  Life in Pennsylvania and Ohio  His first pencil drawings of farms and homes were made in Pennsylvania and dated 1879. Brader created about 300 pictures in Pennsylvania in the counties of Berks, Lancaster, Montgomery and Lebanon and as far west as the counties of Somerset, Beaver and Allegheny. Two Somerset County drawings recently located provide further details not only on farm life in the area at the time, but also the timeline of Brader's travels westward and eventually into Ohio. The majority of Brader's drawings were done in Ohio. His first Ohio drawings appeared in Tuscarawas and Columbiana Counties in 1884. From drawings that survive it is known that Brader's Ohio pictures were done in 9 different adjoining counties: Portage, Medina, Wayne, Stark, Summit, Carroll, Columbiana, Mahoning and Tuscarawas continuing through 1895. Most of his Ohio images seem to have been done in the counties of Portage and Stark. Both of these counties had county infirmaries or \\"Poor Houses\\" where Brader is known to have stayed. The registry book of the Portage County Infirmary shows that he was there from December 12, 1891 through April 19, 1892 and cite his birth in Switzerland as being in 1833. Recently discovered record books from Stark County indicate that Brader passed the winters of 1892 through 1895 at the Stark County Infirmary, which was later called the County Home. Later Years Brader's life was abruptly changed by news from Switzerland. In November 1895 he was living at the Stark County Infirmary (Canton, Ohio) when he was notified of the death of his brother, Alois, in 1888. It took authorities almost eight years to find Brader and tell him of the inheritance left to him by his brother who had remained in Kaltbrunn. Upon receiving the news, Ferdinand Brader soon left the County Infirmary and made plans to return to his homeland. According to newspaper records, Brader returned to Switzerland in early February 1896.  The Drawings of Ferdinand Brader  While best known for his hundreds of carefully rendered farmstead pictures, he is also known to have recorded scenes of both the Portage and Stark County Infirmaries, at least one church, railroad stations, a brewery and several rural industries, such as grist mills, potteries, mines and quarries. Brader typically inscribed his works with the name of the property owner or resident, the date, and, in many cases, its number in the chronology of his completed works. The numbers on his pictures can usually be found with his signature in the lower right or lower left hand corner of his drawings. The highest number recorded among his surviving Ohio drawings suggest he completed as many as 980 works. Drawing number 980 \\"Homestead of Mr. and Mrs. John Kleiver, Plain Tp. Stark Co. Ohio 1895\\" is in the collection of The William McKinley Library & Museum in Canton, Ohio. At least 217 drawings have been cataloged, 59 from Pennsylvania and 158 from Ohio. The Canton Museum of Art's current count listed by township can be seen here. Most of his drawings are quite large, some measuring as large as 39\\" by 53\\". The vast majority of these were done using only graphite pencil. However, by 1892 Brader had started to use colored pencils as well. \\"Residence of Joseph and Anna Gindelsperger, Baughman Tp., Wayne Co., Ohio 1888\\" from the Darwin D. Bearley Collection Exhibitions There have been two exhibitions of Brader's works. In October 1986, an exhibition was held in Reading, Pennsylvania at the Historical Society of Berks County entitled, \\"Brader in Berks, 1880-1883\\" displaying 16 of Brader's drawings and in which an exhibition catalog was provided. In 1991 the Massillon Museum, in Massillon, Ohio, collaborated with Brader collector and researcher, Darwin D. Bearley of Akron, to organize an exhibition of Ohio drawings, entitled \\"F.A. Brader, The Ohio Drawings\\". It ran from January 20, 1991 through March 3, 1991 but no catalog was produced. From December 4, 2014 ‚Äì March 15, 2015 the Canton Museum of Art hosted, \\"The Legacy of Ferdinand A. Brader\\" 19th Century Drawings of the Ohio and Pennsylvania Landscape an exhibition. The William McKinley Presidential Library and Museum collaborated by simultaneously exhibiting more drawings in its Keller Gallery. Additional drawings were shown at the Little Art Gallery in North Canton, Ohio. A monograph, \\"The Legacy of Ferdinand A. Brader\\" was published in conjunction with the exhibitions providing in-depth details from the extensive research on this fascinating artist. The exhibitions and publication trace and document the artistic path of Ferdinand Brader as he traveled through the countryside, adding significant depth to our understanding of American family heritage. The exhibitions were retrospectives of Brader's work in America and included examples from Pennsylvania and Ohio.

Born in Hull, England, he was son of the Hull City footballer Joe Edelston. At the age of 18, he played in the football tournament in the 1936 Berlin Olympics for Great Britain.  Playing career  Edelston played league football with Fulham and Brentford (following his father, Joe Edelston, then a coach, to both clubs), non-league football with Wimbledon and Corinthian and in April 1939 he joined Reading (where his father was manager) and played for them successfully as an inside forward until 1952. At international level, he represented Great Britain at the 1936 Summer Olympics, scored seven goals in eight games for England Amateurs and won five wartime caps for England. He finished his playing career at Northampton Town in 1953.  Broadcasting career  Around the late 1950s he went into broadcasting and was a regular BBC radio commentator by 1960. During the 1960s he also commentated for BBC television and Southern Television. Although most of his commentaries were on football, he also covered tennis, especially Wimbledon. He was a summariser on England's 1966 FIFA World Cup victory as well as the FA Cup Final in 1967 and 1968. He commentated on the event from 1969 to 1975. He reached his peak around the late 1960s and early 1970s, when he was broadcasting almost every week, covering European finals and England matches, as well as a number of league title deciders (Arsenal's victory at Tottenham Hotspur in 1971, and Wolves' defeat of Leeds which handed the title to Derby County in 1972). He also co-wrote the books Masters of Soccer and Wickets, Tries and Goals. By the mid-1970s, his career was somewhat in decline as the emergence of Alan Parry was denying him the chance to commentate on matches such as England vs Scotland in 1975, and the controversial European Cup final in which Bayern Munich beat Leeds United four days later. However, he continued to cover tennis during the summer of 1975 and was still broadcasting regularly when he died suddenly from a heart attack in Tilehurst on 30 January 1976, aged 57.  Legacy  A library at the Reading Blue Coat School is named after him,http://ourportal.rbcs.org.uk/Docs/General%20School%20Information/School%20Library%20information%20for%20Parents/LibParentsGuide.pdf as is an award that Reading present to the outstanding schoolboy in their Academy.

Mara resigned under duress on May 29, 2000, and handed power over to Commodore Frank Bainimarama. In what politicians have called a \\"coup within a coup,\\" Ratu Mara was whisked away on a warship on May 28, where he was allegedly approached by a group of present and former military and police officers who ordered him to suspend the Constitution. When he refused, (\\"If the Constitution goes, I go,\\" he defiantly declared) the group, including Bainimarama, former Prime Minister and 1987 Coup Leader Sitiveni Rabuka, former military commander Ratu Epeli Ganilau (a son-in-law of Mara's), and former Police Commissioner Isikia Savua, are said to have forced Mara's resignation. He was subsequently taken to his home island in the Lau Islands. Mahendra Chaudhry, the deposed Prime Minister, has publicly supported Mara's version of events, and has further alleged that Mara was blackmailed with a threat to kill his daughter, Adi Koila Mara Nailatikau, who was one of the hostages. Another of Mara's daughters, Adi Ateca Ganilau, however, has said that her father involuntarily chose to resign rather than give in to the demands of the military that he abrogate the constitution, and that he was later offered reinstatement but refused it because he was upset that the constitution had been overturned. Commodore Bainimarama has defended his role in the incident saying Ratu Mara was \\"an old fool\\" and his removal was \\"necessary\\" at the time. Chaudhry, for his part, has claimed that Ilisoni Ligairi, Speight's security chief, told him that Savua and former Prime Minister Rabuka were involved in the planning of the coup. \\"Ligairi can't lie as he was very much involved and is now awaiting trial at Nukulau Island,\\" Chaudhry said. The military regime that took over appointed the current President, Ratu Josefa Iloilo. After the coup had been quashed, the High Court ruled on 15 October 2000 that Mara's replacement was unconstitutional and ordered his reinstatement, but Mara decided to spare the country further constitutional trauma by resigning officially, with his resignation retroactive to May 29, 2000. Police declared in 2003 that they were facing \\"many challenges\\" in their investigation, finding many officers uncooperative. Then on 30 April 2004, Police spokesman Mesake Koroi, said that a lot of \\"hearsay and rumours\\" were going around that would not stand up in court. Many witnesses were refusing to talk. \\"Unfortunately we are hitting a brick wall in our investigations at the moment,\\" Koroi said. Commissioner Hughes revealed on 5 January 2006 that this investigation was legally complex and was being hampered by the lack of cooperation of various witnesses.

A two-level masonite platform with guides served as the medium for a supply of marbles that rolled down an inclined plane moving plastic cams as they went. The plastic cams played the part of flip-flops in an electronic computer - as a marble passed one of the cams, it would flip the cam around - in one position, the cam would allow the marble to pass in one direction, in the other position, it would cause the marble to drop through a hole and roll to the bottom of the ramp. The Digi-Comp II platform measures . The Digi-Comp II was not programmable, unlike the Digi-Comp I, an earlier offering in the E.S.R. product line that used an assortment of plastic slides, tubes, and bent metal wires to solve simple logic problems.  Computational power  Computer scientist Scott Aaronson analyzed the computational power of the Digi-Comp II. There are several ways to mathematically model the device's computational capabilities. A natural abstraction is a directed acyclic graph in which each internal vertex has an out-degree of 2, representing a toggle cam that routes balls to one of two other vertices. A fixed number of balls are placed at a designated source vertex, and the decision problem is to determine whether any balls ever reach a designated sink vertex. Aaronson showed that this decision problem, given as inputs a description of the DAG and the number of balls to run (encoded in unary), is complete under log-space reduction for CC, the class of problems log-space reducible to the stable marriage problem. He also showed that the variant of the problem in which the number of balls is encoded in binary, allowing the machine to run for an exponentially longer time, is still in P.  Reproductions  A slightly downscaled reproduction of the Digi-Comp II, made from plywood, is available from Evil Mad Scientist since 2011. This reproduction uses steel pachinko balls, and measures . In 2011, Evil Mad Scientist also created a giant variant measuring around in size that uses billiard balls.

In structure terms, it is divided into two sections: the Doctrine of Right, dealing with rights, and the Doctrine of Virtue, dealing with virtues. Kant's development of his ethical theories in the work include an evolution of the \\"categorical imperative\\" concept and an exploration of the consequences of treating humanity as rational beings in the context of duties.  Summary  The work is divided into two main parts, the Rechtslehre and the Tugendlehre. Mary J. Gregor's translation (1991) explains these German terms as, respectively, the Doctrine of Right, which deals with the rights that people have or can acquire, and the Doctrine of Virtue, which deals with the virtues they ought to acquire. Rechtslehre has also been translated as the Science of Right (Hastie) or the Metaphysical Elements of Justice (Ladd). It is grounded in republican interpretation of origins of political community as civil society and establishment of positive law. Published separately in 1797, the Doctrine of Right is one of the last examples of classical republicanism in political philosophy.Manfred Riedel, Between Tradition and Revolution: The Hegelian Transformation of Political Philosophy, Cambridge 1984. The Doctrine of Right contains the most mature of Kant's statements on the peace project and a system of law to ensure individual rights. The Doctrine of Virtue develops further Kant's ethical theory, which Kant first laid out in the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals (1785). Kant particularly emphasizes treating humanity as an end in itself; in fact Kant's retake of the second formulation of the categorical imperative (e.g. Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals) makes it possible to deduce duties. The duties are analytically treated by Kant, who distinguishes duties towards ourselves from duties towards others. The duties are classified as perfect duties and imperfect duties. Kant thinks imperfect duties allow a latitudo, i.e., the possibility of choosing maxims. The perfect duties instead do not allow any latitudo and determine exactly the maxims of actions. Thus, Kant distinguishes \\"Virtue\\" and \\"Right\\": the \\"Doctrine of Right\\" contains rights as perfect duties towards others only. Influence In the English-speaking world, The Metaphysics of Morals (1797) is not as well known as Kant's earlier works, the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals (1785) and the Critique of Practical Reason (1788), but it has experienced a renaissance through the pioneering work of Gregor.See in particular her 1963 book, Laws of Freedom.

Prior to adopting the Hebraic name in 1955, his name was Viktor Fischl, Dagan, being related to the Hebrew word dag (fish), an approximate translation of Fischl as a diminutive of \\"fish\\". Life After graduating from the Charles University in Prague, he entered the diplomatic service. In 1939 he emigrated to the United Kingdom to escape the Nazis, where he became an associate to Jan Masaryk. After the end of the war, he returned home, but on the 1948 coup d'√©tat emigrated to Israel, thereafter changing his name to the one he held through the end of his life. In Israel he continued his diplomatic career becoming plenipotentiary; he was the first Israeli ambassador in Vienna in 1956, the ambassador in Norway (and while based in Oslo, he was Ambassador to Iceland and Poland. At the same time he continued writing in Czech. Most of his prose was first published in Israel, some in England or in the US. In 1990 he visited his homeland for the first time since his fleeing for refuge. After a long break, publication resumed in his home country, and his works received broader recognition. He was awarded the honorary doctorate from the Charles University. Although he was able to be employed as a diplomat and produce output as an author at the same time, from 1977 onward he devoted his time solely to writing. In his lifelong literary career, he started out as a poet, then later became known as a writer of collections of short stories and novels.

They perform four-part harmony, particularly in the barbershop style. Officially, they are the Hilltop, Minnesota chapter of the Barbershop Harmony Society (BHS), and are very active in competition. The chorus has won 11 medals (top 5) in BHS International Chorus competitions, including consecutive second-place silver medals in 2011 and 2012. The Great Northern Union, 2005. History The Hilltop chapter was first organized in 1985 by a dozen men in the Twin Cities area who were interested in founding a chorus based upon singing excellence and service to the community.http://gnusings.com/history They won their first Land O' Lakes District (LOL) Chorus Contest in fall 1986 and made the trip to their first BHS International Chorus Contest, held in Hartford, Connecticut, in July 1987, where they placed eighth. Their infectious energy and clean sound made them the surprise of the contest. The chorus again won their district competition in fall 1987 and traveled to their second international contest in San Antonio, Texas in 1988, where they placed seventh. The chorus wasn't as successful in its third international contest and sank back to eighth place in Kansas City, Missouri behind a stronger field. The 1990 contest in San Francisco yielded the chorus's first medal, a fifth place bronze. This cemented the reputation of the GNU among the top choruses in the Society and set the foundation for much future success. The 1991 contest in Louisville continued the upward climb, with the chorus placing third. thumb750pxThe Great Northern Union, District Contest 1986 Row 1 - Jim Halvorson, John Moksnes, Larry Halvorson, Al Hoppe, Scott Hagen, Roger Williams, John Korby, Roger Stanfield, Dave Roesler, Dave Nyberg Row 2 - Bill Wigg, Jim Higgins, Larry Castriotta, John Theurer, Steve Haagenson, Mark Jurgenson, John Mostrom, Bob Klecker, Rolf Kragseth, Phil Wilson Row 3 - Roger Meyer, Kirk Lindberg, Dean Haagenson, Jeff Hanel, Tom Mau, Ed Ricklick, Jerry Torrison, Vaughn Kettleson, Ron Lundquist, Jim Emery Row 4 - Jeff Sjoberg, Mike Miller, Gary Cooper, Jim Weins, Rod Johnson, Ron Nelson, Clyde Eisenbeis, Paul Fagerberg, ??, Pete Bliss, Dave Slack In 1992, the chorus reached 100 members and took a brand new Broadway-themed package and a brand new conductor, Concordia College, Moorhead graduate Dean Haagenson, to International in New Orleans, bringing home yet another medal, placing fourth. Haagenson led the chorus to Calgary, Alberta in 1993 and brought the gentlemen another fourth place medal. 1994 marked the first time since 1989 that the chorus did not win a medal, dropping to 61 members and placing eighth behind a much improved field of competitors. After conductor Dean Haagenson's decision to retire from conducting, Roger Williams returned to the chorus and attempted to bring the group back together spiritually and musically. With half the members they had at their peak, the chorus decided not to try to win back older members but focus on improving what they had and performing a fun new package. In 1995 they went to Miami with a parody package making fun of lawyers and once again wowed the crowd, winning another medal and placing fifth. They slightly modified the package for 1996 and went to Salt Lake City, barely missing the medals and placing sixth. The next few years they hung just out of the reach of the medals, placing seventh in 1997 in Indianapolis, eighth in 1998 in Atlanta, and seventh in 1999 in Anaheim before returning to the top 5 (placing fourth) in 2000 in Kansas City, achieving their highest score and growing to 80 singers. The next two years they placed sixth. In 2002, Williams announced his final retirement. The Great Northern Union in 2001 Fall 2002 saw the debut of the chorus's new director, Peter Benson, who moved from North Dakota to take the job. The chorus did not win its district contest for the first time in chapter history, but still won a wild card invitation to Montreal in 2003, where they placed ninth. The following year they again received a wild card to Louisville and rose to seventh. Fall 2004 brought GNU back to the winner's circle in the LOL District, winning the right to compete in Salt Lake City, where they won yet another medal, placing fifth with their second highest score in the chorus's history. In July 2006, the chorus traveled to Indianapolis for their 20th consecutive appearance at the international contest (a Society record). GNU placed eighth in that competition, but continued to hold their ground as one of the top 10 barbershop choruses in the world. Finally breaking their streak of international contest performances, the chorus opted to sit out of the competition in 2007 in Denver and 2008 in Nashville to focus on concerts in the community, a Midwest tour, and recruiting more members. In July 2009, they returned to the international stage in Anaheim and earning a third-place bronze medal, their highest yet ranking, edging out perennial medalist Sound of the Rockies from Denver by a narrow margin. Anaheim also brought GNU its highest average score yet achieved, a 92.1%. After sitting out in 2010, GNU returned to the international stage in Kansas City and won a second-place silver medal with its \\"One of Those Songs\\" package, missing out on a gold medal by five points out of 3,000 possible.http://barbershop.org/images/INTL20110706_CF.OSS1.pdf That photo finish prompted a return to international the following year in Portland, where GNU earned a second-consecutive silver medal after posting the chorus's highest average score ever, a 95.0%, with a revamped \\"One of Those Songs\\" package. After sitting out in 2013, the chorus earned a third-place medal in Las Vegas with its \\"Winter Wonderland\\" package. Following the 2014 campaign, Director Peter Benson announced his resignation and the chorus hired Douglas Carnes in July 2015, with Scott Kvigne leading the chorus in the interim. Outreach In keeping with the Barbershop Harmony Society's goal to \\"Keep The Whole World Singing,\\" Great Northern Union is active in reaching out to young singers in various ways. Since 2004, GNU has played host to a collaborative festival concert with area collegiate men's choruses.http://gnusings.com/events/2014-collegiate-choral-festival The event has frequently featured performances by the involved men's choruses and recent BHS International Collegiate Quartet champions, master classes on the barbershop style taught by GNU, and a mass chorus of all those involved for a finale. Great Northern Union also plays host to an annual Real Men Sing event that gives younger men in grades 7-12 the opportunity to sing. Participants at the all-day event form two youth choruses and give a concert at the end of the day, singing alongside GNU in the finale. GNU has been the featured performer at other Real Men Sing events in the Midwest as well. Since 2011, GNU has organized a summer youth men's chorus called 30 Below, which features men under 30 years old joined by GNU's younger members. The 30 Below chorus performs at the annual summer \\"Barbershop In The Park\\" event in St. Paul. GNU is an active member and participant in the month-long Northern Voice Festival, a collaborative effort of several Twin Cities-area singing ensembles that similarly aim to promote vocal music. GNU was named one of four \\"must-see\\" ensembles at the inaugural Festival Day.http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/music/299204151.html In recent years, GNU has been invited to perform at a number of professional educator association events in the region, including American Choral Directors Association (ACDA) conferences and the Minnesota Music Educators Associations conference.

He was born in Taunton, Somerset and educated at Taunton School. After working for a number of regional newspapers, he joined the News Chronicle shortly before its closure in 1960, soon moving to The Daily Telegraph. Around this time, he also started reporting football matches for the BBC, and in 1968 became a radio commentator and the Corporation's football correspondent. He was well known for his crisp, eloquent, precise style, with a distinctive West Country undertone to his voice. Although he often did not actually commentate on the very big occasions, frequently taking a side role as summariser (in earlier years) or presenter or reporter (in later years), he commentated on a number of World Cup finals, as well as the famous quarter-final between England and Argentina in 1986. He frequently worked alongside Maurice Edelston, Peter Jones, Alan Parry and, latterly, Alan Green and Mike Ingham. He wrote or co-wrote a number of football books and also wrote for the Daily Telegraph on cricket. In 1991, he retired as the BBC's football correspondent to concentrate on his writing career. He also gave up commentary around this time. On his death in 2001, he was widely mourned as a representative of a bygone era of sports broadcasting, arguably less brash and more eloquent than the present.

He has commentated for all four main broadcasters of football in the UK ‚Äì the BBC, BT Sport, ITV and Sky TV, as well as for both BBC and commercial radio. Biography Starting his career at BBC Radio Merseyside, he joined the BBC in London in 1973, and immediately started regular football commentaries. Within a short time he was covering England matches, and by 1975 he was covering the European Cup final. After the death of Maurice Edelston he started working alongside Peter Jones covering the FA Cup Final in 1976. By the mid-1970s he was also BBC radio's athletics commentator, covering the 1976, 1980 and 1984 Summer Olympics. From 1981 he largely relinquished his radio football commentary to commentate for Match of the Day on BBC television. In 1985, he left the BBC to join ITV, initially as an athletics commentator after the commercial channel won the rights to cover British athletics. However, by the late 1980s, Parry had also become a key football commentator for the network, and in 1990, Parry was Brian Moore's number two at the World Cup ‚Äì this was a role he would retain until he left the network. As well as covering national football and athletics, Parry was also heavily involved on a regional level, being Central's lead commentator for a number of years. Between 1992 and 1996, the ITV regions held the rights to live coverage of the Football League, and Parry commentated on a live match almost every Sunday for the Central region. After covering Euro 96 for ITV, Parry left to join Sky TV by which time ITV's athletics portfolio had dwindled almost to nothing (he continued covering what little athletics ITV had left until 1997). Parry has also covered athletics for Sky, but his main role has been as a football commentator. For five years he was the Monday Night Football commentator, before working on the pay-per-view games on PremPlus for four years. In more recent times, Parry has been one of Sky's 'Big Five' commentators ‚Äì including Martin Tyler, Ian Darke, Bill Leslie and Rob Hawthorne (now 'Big Four' since Darke left Sky) ‚Äì who commentate across a wide portfolio of matches in the Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup, Champions League, Europa League and Football League. Parry has commentated on seven League Cup Finals for Sky. Parry is also the commentator for Wales' live international matches on Sky. Between 1998 and 2002 he also worked as a football commentator for talkSPORT and a presenter during the World Cup hosting a phone-in. In the 2002‚Äì03 season he presented Saturday afternoon football coverage on Capital Gold. The 2006‚Äì07 season was another busy one for Parry. As well as his core commitment of 1 live match from every weekend of the Premier League, (plus several live matches for overseas viewers for TWI), Parry covered several live matches from the UEFA Champions League, the Football League Championship and the League Cup. His season's highlights were the League Cup Final which he commentated on for the seventh time and the two- legged Champions League semi-final between Manchester United and AC Milan. During the summer he commentated on the Copa Am√©rica for Sky, including the final. He, by his own admission, is a supporter of Liverpool which for a period of several years meant that he did not cover any of their matches for Sky. However, during this period he continued to regularly commentate on Liverpool matches on the TWI International feed for overseas Premiership viewers. His \\"ban\\" on Liverpool games for Sky seems to have been lifted, with his live commentary of Aston Villa vs. Liverpool on 29 December 2009. Parry has also been involved with Wycombe Wanderers for over ten years now including a spell as a director. Parry then became commentator of the revived Gladiators on Sky One replacing John Sachs. When not working for Sky Sports, Parry has been heard commentating Premier League matches for Premier League Productions, a venture of IMG Sports Media who produce, package and broadcast the live production of games for the Premier League for its international broadcast partners. The same productions are also shown domestically for highlights packages on Sky Sports' \\"Football First\\" programme.

Route description State Road 11 begins at US 17 near Lake Molly in northern DeLand as a one-way street until it reaches Glenwood Road which is also part of SR 11 east of US 17. The road takes a slight curve to the right where it passes a former segment known as Old Perkins Highway, then curves back north. It briefly becomes a two-lane divided highway as it intersects with CR 15A, where southbound access to that route contains a long south-to-west turning ramp, and a short east-to-south turning ramp. Throughout much of its existence, SR 11 serves as the western border for the Tomoka Wildlife Management Area Union- Camp Tract. This includes three other former sections of the road, the first of which is used by Lake Dias Park and diagonally across from the north end of that, a private driveway that was once part another segment of Old Perkins Highway. The north end of that segment of Old Perkins Highway is encountered later on. Telephone poles along the road veer to the right along yet another former section of the road just south of the point where it intersects with State Road 40 in DeLeon Springs. The road takes one last curve to the northeast and becomes Moody Boulevard as it enters Bunnell. It passes by the Old Bunnell State Bank Building near the crossing of the Florida East Coast Railway main line before it finally terminates at US 1 and State Road 100. Here, Moody Boulevard continues onto SR 100 which is the southern terminus of the US 1/SR 100 overlap.

In addition to its main campus and the Orchard Center in Aurora, Illinois, AU offers programs online, at its George Williams College campus in Williams Bay, Wisconsin, and at the Woodstock Center in downtown Woodstock, Illinois. Approximately 5,500 students are enrolled in bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degree programs at Aurora University. History Aurora University was founded as Mendota Seminary in Mendota, Illinois, in 1893. At that time, the school was focused on education and training rooted in the Advent Christian Church. Within a few years of its founding, the seminary changed its name to Mendota College, and broadened its programs into a traditional liberal arts curriculum. In 1911, residents of the nearby town of Aurora raised funds to construct a new college, led by funding from businessman Charles Eckhart, who founded the predecessor company to the Auburn Automobile Company. Recognizing mutual benefits, administrators of Mendota College moved their operations to Aurora and the school became known as Aurora College. In 1971, Aurora College separated from the Advent Christian Church, and in 1985, changed its name to Aurora University to better reflect the breadth of its academic programs. In 1992, the school entered into an affiliation agreement with George Williams College, in Williams Bay, Wisconsin, which was followed by a full merger in 2000. George Williams College (named for YMCA founder George Williams) had been instituted in 1886 by YMCA leaders to create a summer school where young men and women would gather for learning, fellowship and reflection. With the merger, the one-time summer school, camp and conference center now serves both undergraduates and graduate students in a variety of degree programs. Over the past decade, the historic George Williams College campus has been transformed through renovations to new structures including the creation of the Winston Paul Educational Center, Oak and Hickory lodges, the Beasley Campus Center and the Ferro Pavilion, where the annual Music by the Lake outdoor concert series takes place during the summer months. Aurora University added a third location in 2009 with the opening of the Woodstock Center, which offers part-time MBA, Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) and graduate programs in education. The center is located in Woodstock, Illinois, approximately 50 miles north of the university's main campus. Today, Aurora University, the GWC campus, and the Woodstock Center are operated by the Board of Trustees of Aurora University and presided over by a chief executive officer. Each site has a team of senior administrators who report to the president. =Presidents= * J. Oscar Campbell - 1893 * A.W. Sibley - 1894 * C.V. Clum - 1895‚Äì1898 * M.L.

As indicated by the title, the album is based loosely around the George Orwell fable Animal Farm. Album details Ribbons and Sugar is notably different from the group's debut album, Why We Fight, which according to guitarist Bobby Darling is due to their unusual time signatures and a lack of choruses led to critical acclaim, however, it also led to various feuds with multiple record labels. \\"Cut the Strings\\" and later \\"The Dragon of Pendor\\" (featured on In the Land of Lost Monsters) dealt specifically with the integrity issues they faced when told to write choruses for their songs. During the recording sessions of Ribbons and Sugar, the band consisted of Nic Newsham on vocals, Bobby Darling and Ryan Van Wieringen on both guitar and backup vocals, Kirk Huffman on bass, and Rudy Gajadhar on drums. The line up changed, however, before the recording of In the Land of Lost Monsters (for LLR Records) when Van Wieringen left the band to pursue a college education. Album title meaning In the beginning of the novel (Animal Farm), a horse named Mollie who lives on the animal farm chews lumps of sugar and wears red ribbons in her white mane. Excerpt from Animal Farm: > \\"Will there still be sugar after the Rebellion?\\" > \\"No,\\" said Snowball firmly. \\"We have no means of making sugar on this farm. > Besides, you do not need sugar. You will have all the oats and hay you > want.\\" > \\"And shall I still be allowed to wear ribbons in my mane?\\" asked Mollie. > \\"Comrade,\\" said Snowball, \\"those ribbons that you are so devoted to are the > badge of slavery. Can you not understand that liberty is worth more than > ribbons?\\" After the animals take over the farm, these two things are forbidden for animals to wear or eat, as they are determined to be things for humans and not for animals. Before long, Mollie runs away to another farm where she can eat sugar and wear ribbons in her mane. Near the end of the fable, the pigs who are the rulers and leaders of the Animal Farm begin to act more and more like humans, and even begin eating sugar and wearing ribbons.

The son of poet Louis Dudek, he was made a Dawson Scholar of that university (an honorary title) and directs the mobile robotics laboratory there. He was awarded a James McGill chair in 2008. He has written over 250 refereed articles on computer vision and robotics , and is co-author (with Michael Jenkin) of the book Computational Principles of Mobile Robotics which is used to teach robotics at a number of universities [1]. Research His research deals with sensing for robots and has included theoretical work on the complexity of robot localization [1] and the development of underwater and amphibious robots. He has worked on the use of topological maps and the complexity of topological mapping, an abstract idealized form of robotics problem. He has also looked at robot position estimation using photographic data, and the automated detection of interesting images. With his colleagues he produced the first formal proof of the complexity of global robot localization in a metric environment (i.e. how hard it is, in the worst possible case, for a robot to determine its position if it totally lost) [2]. Dudek has a wide range of research interests many of which have the common theme of robotics. He works with students in the Mobile Robotics Lab (MRL) at McGill on many problems involving aspects of artificial perception, robot navigation, sample theory (e.g. applications of the secretary problem to robotics and recommender systems. Education Dudek attended St. George's School of Montreal and subsequently obtained his B.Sc. in Physics and Computer Science at Queen's University and his M.Sc. and Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Toronto. Activities Gregory's research interests often overlap with his personal life and allow him to travel to many interesting places. He and other students in the MRL lab take trips to run experiments on Aqua, an amphibious robot. Greg visited Mexico in 2009. Greg has also visited many other countries. References 1\\\\. Dudek, G.

Early and family life James Huntington was born on 23 July 1854 in Roxbury, Massachusetts, the younger son of Frederick Dan and Hannah Huntington. While he was a child his father, a Unitarian minister, converted to the Episcopal Church, and in quick succession was ordained deacon and priest, and then consecrated Bishop of Central New York. After completing studies at St. John's Academy, Manlius, New York, where he was head boy in 1873, James went to Harvard, as had his father. After graduation, Huntington studied for the ministry at St. Andrew's Divinity School in Syracuse.\\"Huntington, James Otis Sargent\\", The Episcopal Church Ministry Huntington, Huntington was ordained priest by his father on 30 May 1880. In 1880 James ministered to a working class congregation at Calvary Mission, Syracuse. The following year he went to Holy Cross Mission on Manhattan's Lower East Side. Soon after his ordination, Huntington attended a retreat at St. Clement's Church in Philadelphia and began to feel called to the monastic life. Rather than join the Society of St. John the Evangelist which had established a foundation in Boston ten years before, Huntington decided to found an American congregation, the Order of the Holy Cross with two companions, Robert Dod and James Cameron. They continued working in the poorest sections of the Lower East Side. The grueling hours and daily regimen of community life took its toll, and his companions left. On Nov. 25, 1884, at the Chapel of the Sisters of St. John the Baptist, New York City, Huntington made his profession as a monk. Huntington also became involved in the labor union and Georgist land-tax movements. He was later a founder of the Church Association for the Advancement of the Interests of Labor, and was an early member of the Knights of Labor. The Order of the Holy Cross chose Huntington as Superior for several non-consecutive terms. However, he concentrated his time and energy on parish and missionary work. Under his leadership, the order moved to rural Westminster, Maryland, in the 1890s, and in 1902 to West Park, New York.\\"James Otis Sargent Huntington, Priest and Monk, 1935\\", Standing Commission on Liturgy and Music of the Episcopal Church The cornerstone for the order's monastery, which now serves as its guest house, was laid in 1902, and the building was finished in 1904. Designed by Gothic-Revival Architect Henry Vaughan, it was the first building built for an Anglican religious order since the reign of Henry VIII. Huntington also founded or helped to found St. Faith's Home for Wayward Girls in Tarrytown, New York, St. Andrew's School at Sewanee, Kent School in Kent, Connecticut (in 1906 by Frederick H. Sill), and a Mission in Liberia, Africa. Death and legacy Huntington died on 28 June 1935 and is buried in the Monastery Church of St Augustine in West Park. The order he founded remains active; several of the schools the order founded also continue teaching children. The Episcopal Church commemorates Huntington annually on the anniversary of his entry into monastic life, 25 November 1884. References Sources *Biography and Lectionary Readings for James O.S.

The mall is one of the busiest in the National Capital Region as it attracts almost 8 million visitors per yearAccording to Bayshore Shopping Centre website figures. from across the city and the surrounding region. It is the second largest shopping mall in the National Capital Region. Construction and renovations =First phase (1973-1987)= * When the mall originally opened in 1973, it consisted of two floors. Its anchors consisted of Steinberg, Miracle Mart, The Bay and Eaton's. In the 1980s, the mall underwent an extensive renovation, including the addition of a third storey,Advertisement in the Ottawa Citizen, June 5, 1986, page A20, https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qNEyAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=oO8FAAAAIBAJ&pg;=5282,1758655&dq;=bayshore+shopping+centre+renovation&hl;=en upgraded passenger lift, and an escalator going directly from the ground floor to the top level. The colour scheme was also changed to a green and tan marble design. The original wrought-iron and wood railings were replaced by glass panels. The new design featured large peaked glass panels as the ceiling. Another level was added to the exterior parkade as well. =Second phase (1987-2012)= * Following the 2003 closure of Les Ailes de la Mode, the resulting vacant space on the south side of the first and second levels was reconstructed into two new areas. In the first level, the former corridor was closed and a new corridor and mall entrance created to its east. Stores in the new area include GNC, EB Games, The Body Shop, Shoppers Blvd (which later closed), Scentiments, Carol Baker Visage, Freyja Collections and MotoPhoto. A small eating area was also added, including a few new snack shops: Booster Juice, La Cremi√®re and Cinnabon. Savory's Fine Foods store opened on June 15, 2006 (replacing the defunct Market Fresh store) and the new Pet World opened across from the grocery store on July 13. Savory's Fine Foods closed on August 19, 2007, marking the second exit by a specialty food retailer in the same location. Home Sense took over the vacant space in Fall 2009. * On the second level, a new corridor includes stores such as Mexx, Cleo, Timothy's World Coffee, Place Bonbon, Winners and Swarovski. The two new sections of the mall are connected by an elevator and some escalators. Washrooms were added near the Gap replacing the older and smaller ones that were located near the main entrance of the level (by the Bayshore Dental Clinic). * A new passenger elevator opposite to the existing one, that leads to the food court area of the third floor. It was also built to transport a greater number of customers from first to third or vice versa. * The new Build-A-Bear Workshop opened its doors on June 15, 2006 at the old Cotton Ginny location. Cotton Ginny moved east to beside Northern Reflections, and just across from the new Aritzia store. A new store, Esprit occupied the remaining space starting in October. Also in 2006, Northern Reflections then moved to the location occupied by McIntosh & Watts. La Senza Express also opened during the fall replacing the former Campus Crew store. * During the summer of 2006, the mall underwent an extensive renovation to its parking deck to replace the structure that existed since the mall's opening. =Third phase (2012‚Äìpresent)= Santa Claus' blue throne is located at the centre of the mall, next to Pink. Target at Bayshore never opened, and was rebuilt as Walmart instead. Construction started in 2012 for a further expansion of the mall, adding 300,000 sq ft of retail space. Widespread renovations of the existing portions of the mall and the relocation of the food court have occurred. The former Zellers space is being converted to multiple retail outlets with an H&M; on the first floor (opened in October 2013). Victoria's Secret opened in Bayshore on October 23, 2013 along with its sister store Pink. This marked the premiere of both brands in the Ottawa region. Over 500 attended the store launch, some who lined up the night before. Forever 21 opened its doors on September 27, 2014. A Target store was built as a new anchor for the mall, but on January 15, 2015, Target Canada filed for bankruptcy and announced the closure of all of its stores, including the unopened Bayshore Shopping Centre location. On May 8, 2015, Walmart Canada announced its intent to acquire the locations of 13 Target Canada stores, including the Bayshore Shopping Centre location. Its new Supercentre store opened on the 3rd level of the mall on January 28, 2016 after relocation from its Lincoln Fields location. Major criminal incidents * October 14, 1983: David Utman, a Nepean policeman, was shot to death at the mall by a convict. Peter Michael Collins was handed a life sentence in 1984 for first-degree murder, with the possibility of parole after 25 years. Collins apparently said \\"Your time is up\\" before shooting the officer. * September 1, 1984: Cst. Ralph Erfle and Cst. Robin Easey were shot after interrupting an attempted robbery involving a Brinks truck delivery to the mall's Toronto-Dominion Bank branch. Of the five criminals involved, four were captured and sentenced, the other was shot and killed at the scene. Easey was paralyzed after the incident.. Published via Ottawa Police Service website. * January 1999: Octavio Eva Gonzalez was murdered in a stabbing at the mall after he finished work there. Benny Jauvin was convicted of manslaughter and was given a net sentence of six years, a jail term some observers considered too lenient. A policeman was shot in the back and is now paralyzed. Transportation * The mall is located near the interchanges of provincial highways 417 and 416 in the Nepean sector of Ottawa, via the Richmond Road exits (exit 130 on Highway 417 and exit 75C on northbound Highway 416). * Bayshore Shopping Centre is served by numerous routes at Bayshore Transitway Station, located just west of the mall.

The Delaware and Raritan Canal and its associated tow path are situated along the eastern shore of the lake. Noted businessman and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie donated money for the construction of the lake, which was donated to Princeton University. In 1990, the Lake Carnegie Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The lake, which is privately owned, is used by the university's rowing team, and is home to the US Olympic rowing team.See also Cooper River (New Jersey)#Sports. It is, however, available for public use for activities such as ice skating, fishing, and picnicking. Fish species include largemouth bass, carp, pickerel, crappie, channel catfish and occasionally a few rainbow and brown trout that make their way into Carnegie Lake from Stony Brook. Years of pollution have led to a dangerous decrease in the lake's safety levels. Efforts to improve the water quality of Carnegie Lake are ongoing. An aerial view of this lake appears in the opening title sequence of the drama series House M.D. History Andrew Carnegie (left) and Princeton University officials at Lake Carnegie's dedication ceremony on December 5, 1906. Prior to the construction of the lake, Princeton's varsity crew rowed on the narrow Delaware and Raritan Canal, sharing the busy waterway with commercial shipping. The team had discussed their desire to construct a lake in Princeton, but no plans were ever developed. In 1902, one of the team's former members (Howard Russell Butler, class of 1876) was asked to paint a portrait of noted philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. While sitting for Butler, Carnegie discussed the many lochs he had built in his native Scotland. Butler relayed the plans he and his teammates had discussed previously to Carnegie, who took an immediate interest in the project. He asked Butler to investigate the potential cost and feasibility of constructing such a lake in Princeton. After working with a New York engineering company, Butler informed Carnegie that the estimated construction costs would be US$118,000. Carnegie visited the university campus to view the construction site, and soon after authorized Butler to begin construction. In 1903, a group of Princeton alumni began purchasing farmland that occupied areas of the projected basin. They, in turn, sold this land to Carnegie. This was done in order to avoid arousing the suspicions of local residents, and to allow Carnegie to purchase the land for the lowest possible price. By 1905, the needed land was purchased and the work of clearing the area and constructing the bridges and dam began. Carnegie attended the official opening ceremony on December 5, 1906, arriving by train with dozens of friends. He was met by a group including university president Woodrow Wilson. Carnegie and Wilson led an academic procession into Alexander Hall, where Carnegie was greeted enthusiastically by attending students (who had been given the day off). At one point, a group of students began to sing: : Carnegie returned to Princeton the following spring to attend the lake's first regatta. Wilson attempted to secure a second donation from Carnegie, who answered, \\"I have already given you a lake.\\" Wilson's reported reply was, \\"We needed bread and you gave us cake.\\" Environmental problems Due to its initially shallow depth, flooding and siltation (carried by Stony Brook) became problems for the area surrounding Carnegie Lake. Another problem was the rapid deposit of sewage carried by the Millstone River from nearby towns, where expansion of treatment facilities had not kept pace with rapid population growth. The lake has been dredged three times since its opening‚Äîfirst in 1927, in the late 1930s, and most recently in 1971. The 1971 dredging gave the lake a uniform depth of nine feet at a distance of 35 feet from the shoreline. In its 2002 report on water quality, the United States Environmental Protection Agency rated Lake Carnegie as \\"impaired.\\"Data accessible by searching http://www.epa.gov/waters/305b/index.html This status indicates that the lake cannot support one or more of its designated uses. The sources of this nonpoint source pollution are varied‚Äîlitter, chemicals (fertilizers and pesticides), automotive waste (oil and gas), and goose droppings have all contributed to the decline in water quality. Unsafe levels of mercury in the lake have led to an advisory on fish consumption. A number of local volunteer groups have undertaken efforts to improve the quality of water in Lake Carnegie and surrounding waterways. These efforts include litter removal, water sample testing, and educational programs.

Playing career He grew up in Calgary, Alberta, Isbister played junior hockey with the Calgary Canucks of the Alberta Junior Hockey League, recording 49 points in 35 games in 1992‚Äì93. The following season, he began his career in the Western Hockey League with the Portland Winter Hawks. After a 16-goal, 36-point season in 1994‚Äì95, he was drafted in the third round, 67th overall, by the Winnipeg Jets in the 1995 NHL Entry Draft. Upon being drafted, he returned to the Winter Hawks and recorded 89 points, as well as a team-high 45 goals. In his final year with the Winter Hawks, Isbister recorded 33 points in 24 games and was named to the WHL West Second All-Star Team. That season, he also competed for the Team Canada at the 1997 World Junior Championships and made his professional debut with the Springfield Falcons of the AHL, appearing in 7 games. Isbister played his first NHL game on October 1, 1997 for the Phoenix Coyotes (formerly the Winnipeg Jets) against the Chicago Blackhawks. His first NHL point was an assist, in a 3‚Äì2 Phoenix win over the Colorado Avalanche on October 11. He scored his first NHL goal ten days later on October 21, in a 4‚Äì3 loss to the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. Isbister finished his rookie season with 17 points in 66 games. After his second season with the Coyotes, Isbister was traded to the New York Islanders on March 20, 1999, with a third round draft choice (Brian Collins) in 1999 for Robert Reichel, a third round draft choice (Jason Jaspers) in 1999 and a fourth round draft choice (previously acquired from Ottawa; Phoenix selected Preston Mizzi) in 1999. In his first season with the Islanders, 1999‚Äì2000, Isbister recorded a career- high 22 goals, 20 assists, and 42 points in 64 games. He continued at that pace in New York until March 11, 2003, as he was traded to the Edmonton Oilers with Raffi Torres for Janne Niinimaa and a second round draft choice (previously acquired from Washington; New York selected Evgeni Tunik) in 2003. In Isbister's first season with the Oilers, in 2003‚Äì04, his points total dipped to 18. After spending the locked out 2004‚Äì05 season playing for HC TWK Innsbruck of the Austrian Hockey League, Isbister was traded from Edmonton to the Boston Bruins on August 1, 2005, in exchange for a fourth round draft choice (later traded back to Boston - later traded to San Jose - San Jose selected James DeLory) in 2006. Isbister recorded 23 points as NHL play resumed in 2005‚Äì06, his only season with Boston. The following summer, he was picked up by the Carolina Hurricanes as a free agent on August 30, 2006, but was traded to the New York Rangers a month into the season in exchange for Jakub Petruzalek and a conditional fifth-round draft choice in 2008. With New York, Isbister spent the majority of the 2006‚Äì07 season with the Hartford Wolf Pack, the Rangers' AHL affiliate. Following his only season with the Rangers organization, Isbister signed a one-year, $525,000 contract with the Vancouver Canucks. Isbister only played 55 games with Vancouver due to injuries and staff decisions. In 2008, he was not re-signed and was picked up by the Ottawa Senators, signing a two-way, one-year contract on September 4, 2008. At the end of training camp, Isbister was assigned to Ottawa's AHL affiliate, the Binghamton Senators. However, he instead went overseas to play for EV Zug of the Swiss Nationalliga A and on 27 September 2009 retired as an active player and went into coaching. International play Isbister first played internationally with Team Canada at the 1997 World Junior Championships. He scored 7 points in 7 games, tied for seventh in tournament scoring, as Canada captured their fifth straight gold medal. Isbister scored the final goal of the 2‚Äì0 victory over the United States in the gold medal game. Three years later, Isbister made his senior international debut, competing in the 2000 World Championships. He scored 7 points in 9 games for Team Canada, but they were defeated in the semi-finals by the Czech Republic, then lost the bronze medal game to Finland. Isbister competed for Canada for the second consecutive year in the 2001 World Championships and scored 5 goals in 7 games. Canada was once again held from a medal as they were eliminated in the quarter-finals by the United States. Coaching career On September 27, 2009, the University of Calgary's head hockey coach, Mark Howell, announced that Isbister would be an assistant coach along with former NHL'er Cory Cross. He coached for one season with the Dinos.

However, the law now has a newly inserted article that limits its arbitrary application. \\"In the construction and application of this Act, it shall be limited at a minimum of construction and application for attaining the aforementioned purpose, and shall not be permitted to construe extensively this Act, or to restrict unreasonably the fundamental human rights of citizens guaranteed by the Constitution.\\" In 2004, legislators of the then- majority Uri Party made a gesture to annul the law, but failed in the face owing to Grand National Party opposition. Some poll results in 2004-2005 from the media cartel informally dubbed Chojoongdong show that more than half of the Korean people are against the abolition of the act and, so, the dispute continues.The Chosun Ilbo article - National Security Act: Amendments rather than Abrogation - 57% (in Korean)The Dong-A Ilbo article (in Korean) The South Korean constitution guarantees freedom of speech, press, petition and assembly for its nationals. However, behaviors or speeches in favor of the North Korean regime or communism can be punished by the National Security Law, though in recent years prosecutions under this law have been rare. Purpose The \\"anti-government organizations\\" law aims to suppress have the character of \\"a domestic or foreign organization or group which uses fraudulently the title of the government or aims at a rebellion against the State, and which is provided with a command and leadership system.\\" In other words, the law made communism illegal. To that end, all of the following were made illegal: recognition of North Korea as a political entity; organizations advocating the overthrow of the government; the printing, distributing, and ownership of \\"anti-government\\" material; and any failure to report such violations by others. The law was created by the First Republic government of Syngman Rhee, and was modeled on Japanese policing law from the colonial era. It has been reformed and strengthened over the past few decades, with the Anti-communism Law being merged with it during the 1980s.Î∞òÍ≥µÎ≤ï, Korea Ministry of Government Legislation Accessed 7 Oct, 2014. According to certain analysts, the National Security Act can be viewed as a product of the Cold War and the national division of Korea. After World War II, Korean politics was polarized between left and right by the Cold War, forcing Koreans to adopt the ideology of being left or right. This created ‚Äúone nation-two states‚Äù on the Korean peninsula. The resulting tension culminated in the Korean War between 1950 and 1953.[Cho, 2997], Tension Between the National Security Law and Constitutionalism in South Korea: Security For What. BU Int'l LJ, 15, p.125.. This law has been acknowledged by some politicians, scholars, and activists as a symbol of the anti-communism of South Korea's dictatorial First Republic and a potential restriction on freedom of speech since the law not only regulates activities that directly threaten the safety of the State but also punishes those who praise or incite an anti-state group. Indeed, according to a report written by Amnesty International, the most widely used clause of the National Security Act is: Administration The South Korean High Court has a ruling history since 1978 that has classified 1,220 books and print material as \\"Enemy's Expressions\\" by force of precedence. Two state-established research institutes decide what books and print materials meet the criteria of \\"Enemy's Expressions\\": the Democratic Ideology Institute, established in 1997 under the direct orders of the Chief Prosecutor, and the Public Safety Affairs Institute of the Korea National Police University. In 2012, a South Korean man, Park Jung-geun, was indicted and charged under the National Security Law for reposting altered North Korean propaganda on social media. The man, who described his use of the material as intended to lampoon the North Korean regime, received a ten-month suspended prison sentence. Military During the Lee Myung-bak government, some South Korean military officers were arrested for suspected pro-North Korean or pro-Marxist‚ÄìLeninist activities.  Controversies  Some scholars and international organizations also have negative view towards the law. Some argue that National Security Act has been justifying the violation on human rights under the name of defense against the perceived threat of North Korea and that it functions as an obstacle for peaceful reunification with North Korea. Amnesty International reported that 90 people were charged under the law in 2011, increasing by 95.6% between 2008 and 2011. It described the National Security Act as a tool to \\" harass and arbitrarily prosecute individuals and civil society organizations who are peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of expression, opinion and association.\\" and to \\" remove people who are perceived to threaten established political views, to prevent people from taking part in discussions surrounding relations with North Korea.\\" In 1998, Mr. Ha Young-Joon (ÌïòÏòÅÏ§Ä), a graduate student at Hanyang University formerly active with the International Socialists movement, was tried and sentenced to 8 months in prison for having summarized and made available online Chris Harman and Alex Callinicos's main writings on South Korea's national BBS network, in violation of NSA Article 7 Clauses 1 and 5. In 2002, Mr. Lee, a new recruit in the South Korean army, was sentenced to two years in prison for having said, \\"I think Korean separation is not North Korean but American fault\\" to fellow soldiers. The Military Prosecutor's Office could not charge him for his criticism, but it searched Mr. Lee's civilian house and found various books and charged him in violation of the NSA under Article 7, Clauses 1 and 5. In 2012, Ro Su-hui was arrested after he returned from an unauthorized visit to North Korea. The arrest was described by NK News as \\"a clear but unnecessary propaganda victory\\" for North Korea. Other well-known uses of the National Security act include the 1999 banning of the students' union Hanchongryun and the 2003 spy case against Song Du-yul, a Korean living in Germany. The severest penalty that could be given according to NSL is the death penalty. The best-known example of death penalty is in People's Revolutionary Party Incident. *On June 12, 2011, the South Korean government officially apologized to the family members of South Korean citizen, Kim Bok-jae who was wrongfully accused of being a spy for North Korea under the NSA. *On August 15, 2011, the South Korean government officially apologized to a 54-year-old South Korean citizen, Ku Myeong-u (Íµ¨Î™ÖÏö∞) who was wrongfully accused of being a spy for North Korea by working in a Chongryon- affiliated company in Japan. *On September 23, 2011, the Seoul High Court officially apologized to Zainichi Koreans Kim Jeong-sa (ÍπÄÏ†ïÏÇ¨) and Yoo Seong-sam (Ïú†ÏÑ±ÏÇº) who were wrongfully accused as spies during the Zainichi Korean Spy Incident. *On October 10, 2011, the Changweon Regional Court formally posthumously apologized to the now-deceased Lee Sang-cheol (Ïù¥ÏÉÅÏ≤†) who was a South Korean fisherman who was kidnapped by North Koreans for one year but was wrongfully accused as a spy by the regional prosecutors. *On November 10, 2011, the Supreme Court made a decision that the South Korean government should compensate the 33 individuals who were involved in the Osonghoe Incident (Ïò§ÏÜ°Ìöå ÏÇ¨Í±¥) in 1982. *On December 25, 2011, the Gwangju High Court issued an apology to two South Korean fishermen (one deceased) with the last names of Kim and Lee who were wrongfully accused for being North Korean spies during the fourth and the fifth republic. *On May 22, 2012, the Supreme Court of South Korea issued an apology to the deceased Byeon Du-gab (Î≥ÄÎëêÍ∞ë) who was wrongfully arrested for an alleged spying for a North Korean spy in 1970. Criticism The Journalists Association of Korea made an official statement in 2007 that the National Security Act reduced the status of South Korea to \\"a third world country\\" due to its infringement of human rights. Rhyu Si-min of the People's Participation Party was interviewed by the Pyeonghwa Bangsong radio and criticized the existence of the NSA as \\"a 60 year old political tool\\" of public oppression. Louisa Lim of the American NPR also criticized the increased use of the NSA under the Lee Myung-bak government. One of the 33 victims of the Osonghoe Incident, Chae Gyu-gu, said that \\"the National Security Act must disappear\\" in order to prevent innocent South Korean citizens from being falsely accused.

During the Achaemenid period, it comprised present-day Azarbaijan, Iranian Kurdistan and western Tabaristan. As a satrapy under Achaemenid rule, it would eventually encompass a wider region, stretching to southern Dagestan in the north.Bruno Jacobs, \\"ACHAEMENID RULE IN Caucasus\\" in Encyclop√¶dia Iranica.

History =Under the Medes= Horseman in \\"Median dress\\". Achaemenid art, 6th-4th century BC. British Museum. In 678 BC, Deioces united the Median tribes of Media and made the first Iranian empire. His grandson Cyaxares managed to unite all Iranian tribes of Ancient Iran and made his empire a major power. When Cyaxares died he was succeeded by his son, Astyages, who was the last king of the Median Empire. =Under the Achaemenids= The Ganj Nameh (lit.: Treasure epistle) in Ecbatana. The inscriptions are by Darius I and his son Xerxes I Medians are wearing rounded hats and boots) In 553 BC, Cyrus the Great, King of Persia, rebelled against his grandfather, the Median King, Astyages son of Cyaxares; he finally won a decisive victory in 550 BC resulting in Astyages' capture by his own dissatisfied nobles, who promptly turned him over to the triumphant Cyrus. After Cyrus's victory against Astyages, the Medes were subjected to their close kin, the Persians.Herodotus, The Histories, p. 93. In the new empire they retained a prominent position; in honor and war, they stood next to the Persians; their court ceremony was adopted by the new sovereigns, who in the summer months resided in Ecbatana; and many noble Medes were employed as officials, satraps and generals. At the beginning the Greek historians referred to the Achaemenid Empire as a Median Empire. After the assassination of the usurper Smerdis, a Mede Fravartish (Phraortes), claiming to be a scion of Cyaxares, tried to restore the Mede kingdom, but was defeated by the Persian generals and executed in Ecbatana (Darius I in the Behistun inscription). Another rebellion, in 409 BC, against Darius IIXenophon, Hellen. 2, 19 was of short duration. But the IranianRudiger Schmitt, \\"Cadusii\\" in Encyclopedia Iranica tribes to the north, especially the Cadusii, were always troublesome; many abortive expeditions of the later kings against them are mentioned. Under Persian rule, the country was divided into two satrapies: the south, with Ecbatana and Rhagae (Rey near modern Tehran), Media proper, or Greater Media, as it is often called, formed in Darius I the Great's organization the eleventh satrapy,Herodotus iii. 92 together with the Paricanians and Orthocorybantians; the north, the district of Matiane, together with the mountainous districts of the Zagros and Assyria proper (east of the Tigris) was united with the Alarodians and Saspirians in eastern Armenia, and formed the eighteenth satrapy.Herod. iii. 94; cf. v. 49, 52, VII. 72 Caucasian Albania (roughly comprising modern-day Azerbaijan and southern Dagestan) was rapidly incorporated by the Achaemenid Persians and were under the command of the satrapy of MediaChaumont, M.

Excerpt: \\"Achaemenid rule in the Caucasus region was established, at the latest, in the course of the Scythian campaign of Darius I in 513-12 BCE. The Persian domination of the cis-Caucasian area (the northern side of the range) was brief, and archeological findings indicate that the Great Caucasus formed the northern border of the empire during most, if not all, of the Achaemenid period after Darius\\" in the later period. When the Persian empire decayed and the Cadusii and other mountainous tribes made themselves independent, eastern Armenia became a special satrapy, while Assyria seems to have been united with Media; therefore Xenophon in the Anabasis always designates Assyria by the name of \\"Media\\". =Under the Seleucids= Following Alexander's invasion of the satrapy of Media in the summer of 330 BC, he appointed as satrap a former general of Darius III the Great named Atropates (Atrupat) in 328 BC, according to Arrian. In the partition of his empire, southern Media was given to the Macedonian Peithon; but the north, far off and of little importance to the generals squabbling over Alexander's inheritance, was left to Atropates. While southern Media, with Ecbatana, passed to the rule of Antigonus, and afterwards (about 310 BC) to Seleucus I, Atropates maintained himself in his own satrapy and succeeded in founding an independent kingdom. Thus the partition of the country, that Persia had introduced, became lasting; the north was named Atropatene (in Pliny, Atrapatene; in Ptolemy, Tropatene), after the founder of the dynasty, a name still said to be preserved in the modern form 'Azerbaijan'. The capital of Atropatene was Gazaca in the central plain, and the castle Phraaspa, discovered on the Araz river by archaeologists in April 2005. Atropatene is that country of western Asia which was least of all other countries influenced by Hellenism; there exists not even a single coin of its rulers. Southern Media remained a province of the Seleucid Empire for a century and a half, and Hellenism was introduced everywhere. Media was surrounded everywhere by Greek towns, in pursuance of Alexander's plan to protect it from neighboring barbarians, according to Polybius.Polybius, x. 27 Only Ecbatana retained its old character. But Rhagae became the Greek town Europus; and with it StraboStrabo, xi. 524 names Laodicea, Apamea Heraclea or Achais. Most of them were founded by Seleucus I and his son Antiochus I. =Under the Arsacids= In 221 BC, the satrap Molon tried to make himself independent (there exist bronze coins with his name and the royal title), together with his brother Alexander, satrap of Persis, but they were defeated and killed by Antiochus the Great. In the same way, the Mede satrap Timarchus took the diadem and conquered Babylonia; on his coins he calls himself the great king Timarchus; but again the legitimate king, Demetrius I, succeeded in subduing the rebellion, and Timarchus was slain. But with Demetrius I, the dissolution of the Seleucid Empire began, brought about chiefly by the intrigues of the Romans, and shortly afterwards, in about 150, the Parthian king Mithradates I conquered Media.Justin xli. 6 Antiochus VII Sidetes briefly reasserted Seleucid control over the region in 130 BC, but his defeat and death at the Battle of Ecbatana marked the final loss of Seleucid influence in Media. From this time Media remained subject to the Arsacids or Parthians, who changed the name of Rhagae, or Europus, into Arsacia,Strabo xi. 524 and divided the country into five small provinces.Isidorus Charac. From the Parthians, it passed in 226 to the Sassanids, together with Atropatene. Language and literature The Medes spoke Median, a Northwestern Iranian language.

It started on 3 January 1948, and has always been broadcast from 5.00 to 6.00 p.m. on Saturday evenings during the football season, although commentaries on evening matches kicking off shortly after 5pm on Saturdays had often curtailed it in recent years. However, it regained its full hour for the start of the 2010-11 football season, after the Saturday evening Premier League radio rights moved to TalkSport. Originally produced by Angus Mackay, it went out on the BBC Light Programme, where it stayed until 25 April 1964. On 22 August 1964 it became part of Sports Service and moved to Network Three (which later became BBC Radio 3) where it initially started at the earlier time of 4.42 pm. On 4 April 1970, however, it moved back to what had by then become BBC Radio 2, where it stayed until 25 August 1990 (throughout this time it was part of Sport on 2). From 1 September 1990 to 26 March 1994 it was on the original BBC Radio 5, and since 2 April 1994 it has been heard on BBC Radio 5 Live (on both of these networks it has been part of Sport on 5 which was renamed 5 Live Sport in 2006).

Bolivia's miners are commonly regarded as the country's most class-conscious workers. The FSTMB has played an important role in Bolivia's recent history. The union emerged in the wake of a violent clash between government troops and striking tin miners in Oruro and Potos√≠ in 1942. The FSTMB was founded on June 11, 1944 at a congress held in Huanuni, Oruro. The Huanuni Congress included delegates from 25 local unions, the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNR), and the Revolutionary Workers' Party (POR, a Trotskyist group). The newly formed union had a membership of 60,000 miners. Juan Lech√≠n, the leader of the miners' movement and POR member, was chosen as the union's Executive Secretary. Divisions emerged in the union's leadership over how to relate to the new government of Major Gualberto Villarroel. MNR members wanted the FSTMB to support Major Villarroel, but the Lech√≠n and the other members of the POR wanted the union to remain independent of the government. The MNR's position was defeated in 1946 when the FSTMB adopted the \\"Pulacayo Thesis,\\" which called for a workers' revolution and other radical goals. In 1947, POR members formed a caucus in the union, the Bloque Parlamentario Minero, to represent their interests. The FSTMB faced renewed government suppression following a series of strikes in 1949, forcing Lech√≠n and other union leaders into exile. New elections were held in 1951 that gave the MNR a plurality, leading the military to nullify the elections. The FSTMB and POR formed militias of workers that fought on the side of the MNR. These militias fought government forces and stormed army bases. These struggles culminated in the \\"Bolivian National Revolution\\" in April 1952, which placed the MNR in control of the government. Following the revolution, the FSTMB became the main component of the Bolivian Workers' Center (COB), a new umbrella organization for all labor unions. Most of the large-scale tin mines were nationalized and placed under the control of a new government agency, the Corporaci√≥n Minera de Bolivia (COMIBOL). COMIBOL was managed jointly by the government and the FSTMB. From 1964 to 1982, a series of military dictators ruled Bolivia. The FSTMB and the COB often faced harsh government repression, most notably under the regimes of Colonel Hugo Banzer (1971‚Äì78) and General Luis Garc√≠a Meza (1980‚Äì81). Many of the union's leaders were jailed or forced into exile during these years. The FSTMB became a leading force in Bolivian politics once again with the restoration of democracy in 1982. Retired mine workers affiliated with the Cochabamba chapter of the Mining Pensioners' Association march in Cochabamba's Plaza 14 de Septiembre. In 1985 the world tin market crashed. The MNR-led government of V√≠ctor Paz Estenssoro conceded to an economic restructuring plan set forward by the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. As part of the plan, the government closed or privatized most of the state-controlled tin mines. Between 1985 and 1987, the workforce of the state mining company fell from 30,000 to just 7,000. This devastated the membership of the FSTMB. Many retired mining workers remained active in political life, including as members of the Mining Pensioners' Association (Asociaci√≥n de Rentistas Mineras). FSTMB demonstration, June 2005.Despite its setbacks, the FSTMB remained active in the labor movement and politics. The union was at the forefront of the movement against water privatization in 2000, and has campaigned for nationalization of Bolivia's natural gas reserves. The FSTMB was also involved in the protests that brought the resignations of President Gonzalo S√°nchez de Lozada in 2003 and President Carlos Mesa in June 2005. They have also pressured the government to re-nationalize the country's mines. The current Executive Secretary of the FSTMB is Miguel Zubieta Miranda, who previously led the union's local in Huanuni.

Vindicator served the Union Navy primarily as a ram on the Mississippi River and its tributaries as part of the Union effort to control the Mississippi River and, essentially, divide the Confederate States of America in half. Vindicator was also equipped by the Navy as a gunboat with a number of powerful guns installed on board.  Acquired by the Union in Indiana in 1863  Vindicator‚Äîoriginally acquired by the Federal Government in 1863 at New Albany, Indiana, for use by the Union Army during the American Civil War‚Äîwas transferred to the Union Navy in 1864; and commissioned on 24 May, Lt. Comdr. Thomas O. Selfridge in command.  Civil War operations  = Reworked as a ram gunboat = Shortly after her transfer from the Army, Vindicator was reworked at Mound City, Illinois, for use as a ram in the Mississippi Squadron. She was assigned Command to the 5th District of the squadron on 4 July and deployed off Natchez, Mississippi, later that month. While off Natchez, Vindicator and her squadron performed patrol and reconnaissance duties, and the mere presence and vigilance of the formidable Union gunboats there were credited with preventing a planned Confederate crossing of the river on 22 August. USS Vindicator photographed on the Western Rivers in 1864‚Äì65, tied up to the shore. Note glossy paint on her hull, possibly an indication that the photograph may have been taken when Vindicator was first commissioned. = Yazoo River expedition = Vindicator was transferred to the 6th District of the Mississippi River for duty in early November. During an expedition up the Yazoo River, Vindicator and the stern- wheeler Prairie Bird transported and covered Union cavalry forces in an attack on Confederate communications in western Mississippi on the 27th. The Federals destroyed the railroad bridge over the Big Black River and tore up tracks for a distance of 30 miles around. Major General Napoleon J. T. Dana praised the performance of the two gunboats, saying: > The assistance of the vessels of the Sixth Division Mississippi Squadron > rendered the expedition a complete success. = Pursuit of CSS William H. Webb = Vindicator remained in the 6th District for the duration of the war and conducted a spirited, though unsuccessful, pursuit of the ram William H. Webb off the mouth of the Red River in Mississippi on 23 and 24 April 1865. During the chase, Acting Master D. P. Slattery of Vindicator stoked his boilers to near bursting point, commenting that > Such was the spirit animating every officer, man, and boy that all seemed to > vie with each other in the rapid and intelligent execution of each order. Vindicator was withdrawn from service soon thereafter and laid up at Mound City, Illinois, where she was partially dismantled in July.  Post-war decommissioning and subsequent career  She was sold at public auction at Mound City to W. L. Hambleton on 29 November; redocumented New Orleans on 27 February 1866; and dropped from documentation in 1869.

The theoretical monoisotopic mass of a molecule is computed by taking the sum of the accurate masses of the primary isotope of each atom in the molecule. For small molecules made up of low atomic number elements the monoisotopic mass is observable as an isotopically pure peak in a mass spectrum. This differs from the nominal molecular mass, which is the sum of the mass number of the primary isotope of each atom in the molecule and is an integer. It also is different from the molar mass, which is a type of average mass. For some atoms like carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur the Mmi of these elements is exactly the same as the mass of its natural isotope, which is the lightest one. However, this does not hold true for all atoms. Iron's most common isotope has a mass number of 56, while the stable isotopes of iron vary in mass number from 54 to 58. Monoisotopic mass is typically expressed in daltons (Da), also called unified atomic mass units (u). Nominal mass vs monoisotopic mass Orbitrap Mass Analyzers Nominal mass is a term used in high level mass spectrometric discussions, it can be calculated using the mass number of the most abundant isotope of each atom, without regard for the mass defect. For example, when calculating the nominal mass of a molecule of nitrogen (N2) and ethylene (C2H4) it comes out as. N2 (2*14)= 28 Da C2H4 (2*12)+(4*1)= 28 Da What this means, is when using mass spectrometer with insufficient source of power \\"low resolution\\" like a quadrupole mass analyser or a quadrupolar ion trap, these two molecules won‚Äôt be able to be distinguished after ionization, this will be shown by the cross lapping of the m/z peaks. If a high-resolution instrument like an orbitrap or an ion cyclotron resonance is used, these two molecules can be distinguished. When calculating the monoisotopic masses, using the mass of the primary isotope of the elements including the mass defect: N2 (2*14.003)= 28.006 Da C2H4 (2*12.000)+(4*1.008)= 28.032 Da where it will be clear that two different molecules are going through the mass spectrometer. Note that the masses used are neither the integer mass numbers nor the terrestrially averaged standard atomic weights as found in a periodic table. The monoisotopic mass is very useful when analyzing small organic compounds since compounds with similar weights will not be differentiated if the nominal mass is used. For example, when comparing tyrosine which has a molecular structure of C9H11NO3 with a monoisotopic mass of 182.081 Da and methionine sulphone C5H11NO4S which clearly are 2 different compounds but methionine sulphone has a 182.048 Da. Isotopic abundance If a piece of iron was put into a mass spectrometer to be analyzed, the mass spectra of iron (Fe) would result in multiple mass spectral peaks due to the existence of the iron isotopes, , , , . The mass spectrum of Fe represents that the monoisotopic mass is not always the most abundant isotopic peak in a spectrum despite it containing the most abundant isotope for each atom. This is because as the number of atoms in a molecule increases, the probability that the molecule contains at least one heavy isotope atom also increases. If there are 100 carbon atoms in a molecule, and each carbon has a probability of approximately 1% of being a heavy isotope , the whole molecule is highly likely to contain at least one heavy isotope atom of carbon-13 and the most abundant isotopic composition will no longer be the same as the monoisotopic peak. The monoisotopic peak is sometimes not observable for two primary reasons. First, the monoisotopic peak may not be resolved from the other isotopic peaks. In this case, only the average molecular mass may be observed. In some cases, even when the isotopic peaks are resolved, such as with a high-resolution mass spectrometer, the monoisotopic peak may be below the noise level and higher isotopes may dominate completely.  Monoisotopic mass in spectrometry  The monoisotopic mass is not used frequently in fields outside of mass spectrometry because other fields cannot distinguish molecules of different isotopic composition. For this reason, mostly the average molecular mass or even more commonly the molar mass is used. For most purposes such as weighing out bulk chemicals only the molar mass is relevant since what one is weighing is a statistical distribution of varying isotopic compositions. This concept is most helpful in mass spectrometry because individual molecules (or atoms, as in ICP-MS) are measured, and not their statistical average as a whole. Since mass spectrometry is often used for quantifying trace-level compounds, maximizing the sensitivity of the analysis is usually desired. By choosing to look for the most abundant isotopic version of a molecule, the analysis is likely to be most sensitive, which enables even smaller amounts of the target compounds to be quantified. Therefore, the concept is very useful to analysts looking for trace-level residues of organic molecules, such as pesticide residue in foods and agricultural products. Isotopic masses can play an important role in physics but physics less often deals with molecules. Molecules differing by an isotope are sometimes distinguished from one another in molecular spectroscopy or related fields; however, it is usually a single isotope change on a larger molecule that can be observed rather than the isotopic composition of an entire molecule. The isotopic substitution changes the vibrational frequencies of various bonds in the molecule, which can have observable effects on the chemical reactivity via the kinetic isotope effect, and even by extension the biological activity in some cases.

An international co-production between France, Switzerland and Germany, it is an intimate portrayal of the everyday lives of Carthusian monks of the Grande Chartreuse, a monastery high in the French Alps (Chartreuse Mountains). Production The idea for the film was proposed to the monks in 1984, but the Carthusians said they wanted time to think about it. They responded to Gr√∂ning 16 years later to say they were willing to permit him to shoot the movie if he was still interested. Gr√∂ning then came alone to live at the monastery, where no visitors were ordinarily allowed, for a total of six months in 2002 and 2003. He filmed and recorded on his own, using no artificial light. Gr√∂ning then spent two and a half years editing the film. The final cut contains neither spoken commentary nor added sound effects.

Condo hotels are typically high-rise buildings developed and operated as luxury hotels, usually in major cities and resorts.Michael Corkery Condo Hotels: The Latest Twist In Buying a Vacation Residence The Wall Street Journal Online February 28, 2006 These hotels have condominium units which allow someone to own a full-service vacation home. When they are not using this home, they can leverage the marketing and management done by the hotel chain to rent and manage the condo unit as it would any other hotel room. Legal conflicts The U.S. Government is very strict about the type of advertising that can be done vis-a-vis condo hotel projects. Some condo projects have advertised themselves as real estate investments, but since the value of these condos as a real estate investment is not entirely clear the U.S. Government currently disallows use of this reference when advertising condo hotels. Condo hotels have been criticized in California for allowing developers to skirt laws designed to protect public access to beaches. Because such a facility has hotel rooms, it can be classified as a public accommodation, even though the majority of the units are privately held, and the facility does little to accommodate the public. In the Philippines condominium hotels carry a condominium real estate deed. This allows foreigners to acquire up to 30% of the condotel units, unlike most other real estate. This has made this particular development popular in the country. Location While not intended as a complete list, the most popular locations in the U.S. for condo hotels include: Aspen, Chicago, Miami, Fort Lauderdale, the Las Vegas Valley, New York City, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and Orlando, Florida. Condo hotels are also found at ski resorts and international destinations, such as Jaco, Costa Rica. Investors spent an estimated $250 million on condo hotels in 2006, with much of that spending concentrated on resort areas.  Costs  Note that analyzing the economics of a condo hotel unit is extremely difficult because of the challenge of getting accurate information about the potential income stream. Developers uniformly do not provide important data or estimates for room rates or occupancy levels for fear of coming under U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations on investments, as opposed to real estate regulations. Financial considerations The primary factors that contribute to the financial outcome in ownership are rental revenue, appreciation or depreciation, lending and tax deductions. Rental revenue is shared with the management company, and owners typically pay no upfront fees for management, which includes the marketing and reservation of the units. Typical monthly fees for units in the rental pool include FF&E; (Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment) reserve and resort fee(s). Although the revenue splits between owner and management company do vary from project to project, most hover around 50 percent. Most condo hotels, and especially branded hotels like Westin or Ritz-Carlton, are strategically located in resort economies or popular urban destinations, which allow for high nightly rates and consistent year-round occupancy. Rental income from hotel guests is at the mercy of travel patterns and may decline. Many condo hotels, especially the branded condo hotels, have seen double-digit growth, and have out-performed traditional condos or single family homes in the same resort market. Condo hotels units are fee simple deeded real estate, and can be bought and sold like other forms of real estate. Because of the lack of resale data available for many of the emerging markets where pre-construction condo hotels can be found, experts heed caution when considering a condo hotel purchase for investment purposes alone. Just like traditional real estate, appreciation is never guaranteed. This very scenario most recently occurred in Las Vegas. Several of the more notable condo hotels have sold for less in the resale market than during pre-construction. Financing is generally costlier than for a primary residence. Mortgage rates may be a full point higher, and in the past this was especially true because financial institutions were unfamiliar with the condo hotel concept. Pre-construction purchases require a significant down payment, and buyers will not see financial return or be able to use their unit until the hotel is completed and ready for operation. Furthermore, owners may have to purchase extra insurance to protect against liability claims and some types of damage or loss. Additional tax benefits may be obtained through condo hotel ownership. If the condo hotel is used for non- primary residence or residential rental, owners may be able to accelerate the depreciation on their condo hotel unit from 39 years, down to 27.5, 15, 7, and even 5 years. Condo hotel tax laws determine this, and affect individuals on a case-by-case basis, as each potential buyer's tax situation is different. Homeowners' association fees and services As with most condominiums, owners of condo-hotel units are required to pay homeowners' association fees, commonly referred to as HOAs. The fee and services can vary a great deal. Factors causing a fluctuation are the hotel's star rating and operation level, and its physical location. A property located on the ocean, for example, can experience coastal weather on a regular basis, which in turn can increase the need for more regular maintenance to the exterior of the building. Along those same lines, a property located in a ski resort must weather powerful winter storms and must also deal with snow removal services. Exceptions aside, many of the fees and services found in HOAs are fixed and fluctuate very little from project to project. Services such as these usually include general unit utilities, common area utilities, individual room and building reserves, grounds maintenance, exercise area use fees, security, pest control, mechanical repair costs, safety alarm systems, parking area maintenance, pool area maintenance, and owner management and administrative services. Items related to hotel guest impact are generally not included in the HOA fees; these include housekeeping, and costs related to hotel staffing and operation.

He presents BBC Radio 4's Broadcasting House programme each Sunday morning. He is also an occasional presenter of Radio 4's PM programme. O'Connell is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. Education Paddy O'Connell was educated at Gresham's School and the University of Aberdeen. Career He began his broadcasting career in 1989 on the BBC's local radio trainee scheme, leading to five years spent as a BBC local radio reporter in Devon, Essex and Cleveland. He then joined BBC Radio Five Live at its launch in 1994, before moving to the US to present BBC World Service's The World programme. O'Connell has also presented and reported for a range of other radio stations across the world, including in Australia and Canada. In 1997, O'Connell became BBC News' North America Business Correspondent and Wall Street anchor, based in New York City. He appeared regularly on BBC World, BBC News 24 and BBC One news bulletins reporting on and presenting business news. He was the main US-based anchor for the BBC's World Business Report programme, on BBC World and BBC News 24, on which he became well known for his laidback but incisive style, and deadpan delivery. O'Connell was in New York City at the time of the September 11, 2001 attacks, and was due to attend a meeting inside the World Trade Center on that day. He reported from the scene of the attacks just hours later, interviewing survivors in the aftermath, and anchored the BBC's coverage from the scene that evening. He stayed in New York for a further two years, but left the US, and the BBC, in 2003. He then did a variety of freelance work, including a wide range of work for the BBC. He fronted a wide range of news and entertainment shows on the corporation's youth-orientated digital channel BBC Three. He presented Celebdaq, a show based around a celebrity stock exchange, allowing O'Connell to mix his vast business knowledge with his interest in showbusiness. He also worked on Liquid News (replacing the late Christopher Price as its main presenter), presented the one-off Flashmob ‚Äì The Opera and was a main anchor on the offbeat current affairs show BBC Three News. O'Connell was one of the main presenters on the daily BBC Two business news programme Working Lunch and anchored the show every Friday and occasionally at other times, presenting alongside Adam Shaw or Nik Wood. He joined the programme in 2003 and produced a number of special reports alongside his presentation duties. He left the programme on 26 September 2008, ahead of a relaunch with new presenters. He also appeared regularly on BBC Breakfast, presenting the programme's business news segments from the London Stock Exchange, filling in for regular business reporter Declan Curry. He presented the weekday evening TV quiz show Battle of the Brains on BBC Two, before being replaced by Nicky Campbell. Alongside these BBC commitments, O'Connell was also a regular presenter on London's LBC 97.3 radio station. Current TV and radio work O'Connell currently works on a wide range of BBC radio and TV programmes. He presents the weekly BBC Radio 4 irreverent Sunday morning news review strand, Broadcasting House. He joined the programme full-time in 2006, having previously covered for its former presenter Fi Glover while she was on maternity leave. On a March 2013 episode of \\"Broadcasting House\\", O'Connell became so emotionally moved by journalist Emilie Blach√®re's poem, \\"A Love Letter from Emilie Blach√®re to R√©mi Ochlik\\" that he had difficulty continuing the show and Radio 4's programme fell silent for around 12 seconds. Blach√®re read her poem as a remembrance on the first anniversary of her partner's death. Photojournalist R√©mi Ochlik died with veteran war correspondent Marie Colvin during the Syrian Civil War in 2012. The printed version of Blach√®re's poem also mentions fallen photojournalist Lucas Dolega, the first journalist to die during the Arab Spring revolutions in Tunisia. He's also an occasional presenter of PM on BBC Radio 4, standing in for regular host Evan Davis, and often stands in for Jeremy Vine on his BBC Radio 2 lunchtime news and current affairs programme. He also previously worked as a regular reporter on BBC One's evening current affairs programme The One Show, and has occasionally presented South East Today. As well as news programmes, O'Connell continues to dabble in both light and prime-time entertainment programmes. From 2004, he commentated on the Eurovision Song Contest semi-finals on BBC Three. He also presented various behind-the-scenes segments at the main final of the contest, shown on BBC Three. In 2010, O'Connell took part in a Eurovision edition of PopMaster on BBC Radio 2's Ken Bruce Show, losing to John Kennedy O'Connor. He was again a contestant on 17 May 2013, winning the contest against Ken Bruce, with John Kennedy O'Connor as question master.

The Nintendo DS version also features games based on the film, but they are fundamentally different from the console title. The games were delayed from their original release date (set to coincide with the theatrical release of the film) due to design complications and issues with polish on the console game. The handheld games were delayed in order to preserve a simultaneous release with non-handheld SKUs. The games were ultimately released on November 22, 2006 in the United States and November 30 in Australia, to coincide with the DVD release of Superman Returns. Gameplay The game has an 80 sq. mile free-roaming map, and the character is able to fly into the stratosphere generated in the game though not into the depths of the ocean surrounding the fictional city. Superman's complete array of superpowers are at the player's disposal, and the player is required to 'master' Superman's powers, because Superman might cause harm to the city if his powers are used incorrectly. If the player wishes to use heat vision, they must use the right power level, for too much power can lead to civilian casualties and destruction. Although, at the beginning of the game you will start off using the most basic forms of Superman's powers and you will be required to upgrade them in order to achieve greater strength, speed, distance and damage. As for the flying in-game, the player will be able to fly at different speeds, the maximum being 800 mph, which is faster than the speed of sound. The faster Superman travels, the more the screen will blur. As stated above, each power will have different levels of energy. In the main game, Superman is invincible: no matter what happens to Superman in the game, he cannot be killed. The one exception is during the second part of the tutorial mission which is three boss fights in a row without a checkpoint on War World, here Superman does take damage to the point of mission failure. But Metropolis isn't as fortunate, there is a damage meter - if too much damage is done to the city during a mission (in other words, if the damage meter is fully depleted) then the game ends. Superman has a stamina meter that depletes as more power is used. Player can fly Superman into the atmosphere and absorb sunlight to replenish the stamina meter faster, as performed by Superman many times in comic books. In the game, the player is challenged to be creative with Superman's powers. To stop a burning building, for example, Superman could use his freeze breath and risk not being able to save all of the civilian casualties in time, or alternatively, he could pick up a fire truck and station it at a more convenient level (i.e. on top of a building adjacent to the burning one) for a faster extinguishing effect. Amongst the various unlockables, there are alternate costumes (a 'Pod Suit' and 'Golden Age Suit' are featured in addition to the suit from the film). These costumes will be accessed from the 'Fortress of Solitude' (the menu screen). A 'Bizarro' mode is also featured where the player must destroy as much as they are told to in a limited time. There is also an unlockable 'Bizzaro rampage' mode that will allow the player to cause havoc as Bizzaro for an unlimited amount of time. This mode is accessible by using a cheat code found on the Superman Returns DVD. Superman's famed x-ray vision is used automatically when Superman picks- up an object. The object is made transparent to the player so it will not obstruct the player's point of view during gameplay. Plot The story begins with Metropolis suffering a devastating meteor shower. Superman uses his full array of powers, including his strength, freeze breath, and heat vision to destroy the deadly rocks before they can strike the city. Following this incident, astronomers announce that they have discovered the remains of the dead planet Krypton. Superman flies to the distant galaxy in the space rocket that his father sent him to Earth in to investigate the ruins of his homeworld and to see if there is anything left. He finds only gigantic, asteroid-sized chunks of kryptonite, pieces of the planet that were irradiated by the supernova that destroyed the great civilization. Superman turns his ship around and heads back to Earth, but along the way he is intercepted by Mongul and forced to compete in gladiatorial combat in Warworld. Mongul first puts him against an elite team of warriors known as the Plahtune, but the Man of Steel easily beats them. Next, he confronts Overkhast, an alien who can fire energy from his hands and who can also transform into a gigantic energy-based creature that can emit shock waves of power. After Superman overcomes him, Mongul himself steps into the arena to battle Superman. Though he is powerful and possesses great strength, Mongul is still no match for the Last Son of Krypton. At the conclusion of their fight, Superman picks up Mongul and prepares to deliver what would most certainly be a killing strike. Mongul taunts him, \\"Go on, Superman. You know you want to.\\" Superman then throws Mongul to the floor and states that the fight is over. Superman then finds his ship and sets off for Earth, but Mongul vows that he will find him. Superman's return to Metropolis is greeted with ecstatic applause by most, but Lois Lane seems somewhat hesitant to put her faith in him again. Soon after his return however, Metallo attacks the city with an army of robotic beings. Superman is forced to fight both the supervillain and his minions. The lesser opponents are of little consequence to the Kryptonian, but Metallo is another matter. Superman and Metallo go hand-to-hand where Metallo transforms into a towering monstrosity that Superman cannot directly touch because his kryptonite-laced body will cause the Man of Steel to temporarily lose his stamina. Superman compensates for this by throwing vehicles at the villain. Realizing that he is about to be defeated, Metallo fires a large missile to level the city, but Superman intercepts the projectile and hurls it into the stratosphere. Superman shows Metallo no mercy, gathering all of his powers and charging the villain, tearing through his body and ripping out his power source. Unknown to Superman during his absence, Lex Luthor broke into the Fortress of Solitude and stole his data crystals. Lex Luthor experiments with the crystals by adding a small particle to water, and the resulting citywide power failure releases numerous villains and genetic creatures including Bizarro. Bizarro begins a rampage throughout Metropolis, destroying buildings and attacking citizens. Though Bizarro is of equal might, Superman is a much more experienced warrior. In the end, Superman defeats Bizarro, but does not kill him because he knows that the poor creature is incapable of understanding his actions. Then Superman faces off against Riot and his clones in the Hyper Sector of Metropolis. Superman defeats Riot with a combination of his fists and freeze breath. No sooner has he defeated Riot then an old enemy returns for a rematch. Mongul and his minions have followed Superman to Earth. Superman battles the Plahtune and Overkhast, and after beating them confronts Mongul once again. The fight is fierce, but as before the Man of Steel emerges victorious. Mongul admits that he is defeated and flees Earth. There is no time to celebrate this victory, because Lex Luthor has put his diabolical scheme of creating a new world with the Kryptonian crystals into effect. Luthor plants the main crystal and an entire new landmass begins to form off the coast of Metropolis, which causes several tornadoes to form and tear through the city. Superman deflects the tornadoes and extinguishes the fires that have erupted throughout the city, then flies out over the water to investigate. He finds Lex Luthor's boat sinking, the evil mastermind having abandoned it after planting the crystal. Lois had sneaked onto the ship and is trapped as it is sinking, and Superman rescues her and takes her unconscious form to the coast guard. He then discovers the gigantic new island forming as a result of the crystal. Superman lands on the island, and discovers too late that he has fallen into a trap. The island is laced with kryptonite. Lex Luthor assaults and taunts the Man of Steel and then kicks his powerless form into the ocean far below. But Lois arrives with the coast guard and rescues Superman, who flies into outer space to bask in the rays of the sun before burrowing his way under the ocean floor and lifting the landmass directly out of the water and throwing it into space. Superman flies back to Metropolis to take care of the few remaining villains who earlier escaped him, and the game ends. Reception Superman Returns: The Videogame was not received very well by many critics. GameRankings gave it a score of 31.92% for the DS version, 45.70% for the PS2 version, 54.18% for the Xbox version, and 53.25% for the Xbox 360 version; while Metacritic gave it a score of 33 out of 100 for the DS version, 46 out of 100 for the PS2 version, and 51 out of 100 for both the Xbox and Xbox 360 versions. IGN criticized the game's lack of a concluding villain saying that \\"The final boss in Superman Returns: The Videogame is a tornado. Not Lex Luthor. Not General Zod; not that Nuclear Man -- not even Richard Pryor. A tornado!\\" Official PlayStation 2 Magazine UK gave the game a 5/10, saying \\"They've got the man bit down but in no way is this super.\\" Official Xbox Magazine gave the Xbox version of this game the award of \\"Best Graphics... if They Were on [the original PlayStation]\\" in the 2006 Game of The Year Awards. X-Play gave the Xbox 360 version a 1/5 for poor control, boring and bland enemies, and for featuring a tornado as the final boss. The A.V. Club gave it a D and stated that \\"A making-of documentary on how such a precious franchise was so flagrantly mishandled would be far more entertaining than anything the game has to offer.\\" References External links * Official homepage * * Superman Returns on the EA website * Category:2006 video games Category:Cancelled PlayStation 3 games Category:Nintendo DS games Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:Superman arcade and video games Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Xbox games Category:Video games based on films Category:Video games based on adaptations Category:Video games based on works by Michael Dougherty Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Open world video games Category:Superhero video games Category:Action video games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games using Havok Category:Electronic Arts games Category:Superman (1978 film series) ","title":"Superman Returns (video game)"},{"id":"3633077","text":"Patrick Donald Leahy (born June 9, 1979 in Brighton, Massachusetts) is a former professional ice hockey right wing who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Boston Bruins and the Nashville Predators before spending the rest of career abroad with EHC Black Wings Linz of the Austrian Hockey League.

At the , it had a population of 112. The village, 180 km south of Sydney, is bordered by two beaches, Chinaman's Beach to the north and Seaman's Beach (sometimes referred to as \\"Sailors Beach\\") to the south, with Hyams Beach being in the centre. A seaside resort, its beach is known for having turquoise/aqua-coloured waters and fine, squeaky, brilliantly white sand that's composed of pure quartz. The village is a 3-hour drive from Sydney and can be accessed via Princes Motorway from the Sydney CBD or Hume Motorway from Greater Western Sydney. Geography Map of the neighbouring Jervis Bay Territory showing Hyams Beach The beaches face east, out across Jervis Bay and Point Perpendicular to the Pacific Ocean. The village is bordered by Jervis Bay National Park to the north and Booderee National Park and Botanic Gardens to the south which gives Hyams Beach a 'natural bush' feel with an abundance of native plants, animals and birdlife. Other nearby attractions include Jervis Bay Marine Park and surrounding trails and forests. There is a myth that the beach has the whitest sands in Australia.Gazing onto the world's whitest sand, SMH, 31 December 2005. The misconception started at the town's main store, which had a billboard stating the seaside village had \\"the whitest sand\\". Eventually, the idea became widespread and was promoted by tourism organizations. In fact Australia's whitest beaches are Lucky Bay and Hellfire Bay near Esperance, Western Australia, and Tallebudgera Creek Beach in Queensland. =Wildlife= Bird species present in Hyams Beach include: *White-faced Heron *White-bellied sea eagle *Sooty oystercatcher *Masked lapwing *Little pied cormorant *Australasian gannet *Little black cormorant *Little penguin *Crested tern Tourism A view of its renowned white sands. Most accommodation in the village ranges from basic cottages to architecturally designed luxury beachfront houses, with some featuring bed and breakfast. There is one caf√© store in the village. The seaside village also features bush and coastal walks which provide panoramic views of the bay, the surrounding National Park and the ocean, which is ideal for fishing, swimming, snorkelling, diving and also whale watching, making it an ideal tourist spot. The encompassing bushland is home to many native animals and dozens of bird species. Tourism and infrastructure financed has assisted in transforming Hyams Beach to one of the popular areas within the NSW tourism industry. Due to tourists visiting the area frequently and in masses, a freeway reaching the whole 190 km to Sydney was finished in 2017, costing at $580 million. A NSW tourist movement has featured the beach's radiantly white sand on the rearside of Sydney buses. The seaside village has also appeared in TV ads, thanks to its publicity by Lonely Planet and also has a large social media presence. Environmental issues The village's success is known to backfire with its population of 112 quickly spiring to 4000 people in a few summer evenings, with the streets becoming engulfed with traffic and tourists littering on the beach. Because of this, local residents have been pressing council to resolve the safety issues. There is only one road in and out, so when the village is overrun by cars, access for emergency vehicles and evacuation in case of bush fire becomes impossible. Now the council is closing the village once the 450 street parking spaces are at effective capacity. The local bush care group is working hard to revegetate the dunes which have been badly damaged by tourists who have been pushing into the dunes for shade or to find an illegal camping spot. Demographics Hyams Beach lies southwest of the bay. In the 2016 Australian census, Hyams Beach appeared to be wealthy for a beach resort with 20% of its inhabitants earning more than $3000 a week, 90% owning their home and with 93% of the houses having three or four bedrooms. *80.4% of 112 people living in Hyams Beach were born in Australia. The other responses for country of birth were England 8.8%, South Africa 3.9% and New Zealand 2.9%. *The most common ancestries were English 31.7%, Scottish 19.0%, Irish 18.3%, Australian 16.2% and German 5.6%. *The most common responses for religion were No Religion, so described 30.1%, Anglican 25.2%, Catholic 20.4%, Jehovah's Witnesses 5.8% and Secular Beliefs 5.8%. *96.1% of people only spoke English at home. The only other response for language spoken at home was Afrikaans 3.9%. *70.5% were married and 7.4% were either divorced or separated. *Of occupied private dwellings, 100.0% were separate houses.

Virgil, however, instead of Pharos, mentions the island of Carpathos, between Crete and Rhodes.Virgil, Georgics 4.387Homer, Iliad 2.676 This Greek island is the closest to Pharos geographically. Etymology 'Proteus' may be based on one of the titles of Egyptian king, pÍú£-rwtj, signifying the \\"high doors\\" (cf. Sublime Porte) of the temple.Anne Burton, Diodorus Siculus, Book 1: A Commentary. BRILL, 1973, page 183. Proteus also seems to have been associated with Thrace, and legends portray him as coming from Thrace to Egypt, or as going from Egypt to Thrace.Proteus, Theoi Project There's also some sort of association of Proteus with the island of Lemnos, close to Thrace.  Mythology  =Alternate story of Helen= Herodotus invoked Proteus in his telling of the story of Helen of Troy. In Book II of The History, the story is told of how Proteus rose to the throne of Egypt out of Memphis, succeeding Pheron as king. He was later succeeded by Rhampsinitus (Ramesses III, as he was known by the Egyptians). When Paris stole Helen from Sparta, winds blew him off his intended course and he found himself in Egypt. Upon their arrival, Paris and his servants discovered a temple, in which the slaves realized it would be profitable for them to take refuge. Thus, they deserted Paris, informing the authorities of his numerous wrongdoings. Word of Paris' crimes reached Proteus, who then requested Paris be brought forth for inquiry. Proteus asked Paris for the details of his journey, ultimately concluding that despite his anger and Paris' terrible actions, he cannot kill a man who is a stranger from another land. Instead of death as Paris' punishment, Proteus took Helen from Paris and seized the treasure stolen from Menelaus, intending to return both Helen and the treasure to Menelaus, to whom they were rightfully due. Proteus then urged Paris to leave Egypt. Herodotus also makes references to Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, claiming Homer must have been aware of this version of events despite using the more common story. =Tragedy by Euripides= Another take on this story is presented in the tragedy Helen by Euripides. In Euripides' version, Hera had Helen taken to Egypt by Hermes, and she created a phantom replacement of Helen which Paris takes to Troy. The play takes place when Menelaus arrives at Egypt after the war. Here Proteus had safeguarded Helen throughout the Trojan War, but is dead before the play begins. It opens with Helen visiting his tomb. According to Euripides, Proteus was married to the Nereid Psamathe, had a son Theoclymenos, and a daughter Theonoe who was a gifted seer. Theoclymenos became the new king of Egypt after Proteus and had intentions of marrying Helen. =Proteus in The Odyssey= In the tale which Menelaus recites to Telemachus son of Odysseus, Menelaus mentions being stranded on the island called Pharos. It is here after 20 days that he is approached by the goddess Eidothea daughter of Proteus. In this meeting she asks why Menelaus willingly stays on the island to which he replies\\" Whichever of the divinities you are let me tell you that I am not here of my own free will, i seem to have angered a god but which one I do not know, tell me now since gods are all knowing to whom I have displeased \\". Eidothea explains that it was Proteus who keeps him ashore. She hatched a plan which could vouch Menelaus escape from the island which included the ambush of Proteus the first minister of Poseidon.

The band was formed in 2001, and went on to release two EPs and two full-length albums. History  In 1994, Ash Santilla and Gavin Campbell met at high school in their hometown of Benalla, Victoria, and became good friends sharing their passion for rock music. Their first band was called Naybious, named after Gavin's sister Lauren's one-eyed doll. Lead vocalist Santilla and lead guitarist Campbell met multi-instrumentalist Louis Macklin at a school camp, and he became the band's keyboardist and percussionist. Progress of the band stalled for some time, until 2001 when Santilla and Campbell found each other again in Melbourne and began writing again. Soon, drummer Ben Dexter joined after coming to know the group through his brother, and bass guitarist Bryan Dochstader joined the group after noticing the group unloading gear in a supermarket car-park and asking them, \\"Do you guys need a bass player?\\" The band couldn't decide on a name for several months until Dexter rang Santilla and asked him, \\"What's the model of your car?\\" \\"HR,\\" Santilla replied. \\"What year?\\" \\"'67.\\" \\"67 Special?\\" \\"Yeah.\\" 67 Special signed with Festival Mushroom Records in 2003 and released the \\"Hey There Bomb\\" EP, \\"Boys and Girls\\" EP and their debut album \\"The World Can Wait\\".

She is seen as the slayer of the tyrannical demon Mahishasura. She is also the sixth form amongst Navadurga or the nine forms of Hindu goddess Durga (Parvati), worshipped during the Navratri celebrations. She may be depicted with four, ten, or eighteen hands. This is the second name given for Goddess Adi Parashakti in Amarakosha, the Sanskrit lexicon (Goddess Parvati names- Uma Katyayani Gauri Kali Haimavati Ishwari). Goddess Katyayani was worshipped by Sita, Radha and Rukmini for a good husband. In Shaktism she is associated with the fierce forms of Shakti or Durga, a Warrior goddess, which also includes Bhadrakali and Chandika,Religious beliefs and practices of North India during the early medieval period, by Vibhuti Bhushan Mishra. Published by BRILL, 1973. . Page 22. and traditionally she is associated with the colour red, as with Goddess Parvati, the primordial form of Shakti, a fact also mentioned in Patanjali's Mahabhashya on PƒÅ·πáini, written in 2nd century BCE.Devƒ´-mƒÅhƒÅtmya: the crystallization of the goddess tradition, by Thomas B. Coburn. Published by Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1988. . Page 240. She is first mentioned in the Taittiriya Aranyaka part of the Yajurveda. Skanda Purana mentions her being created out of the spontaneous anger of Gods, which eventually led to slaying the demon, Mahishasura, mounted on the lion. This occasion is celebrated during the annual Durga Puja festival in most parts of India.CHAPTER VII. UMƒÄ. Hindu Mythology, Vedic and Puranic, by W.J. Wilkins. 1900. page 306 Her exploits are described in the Devi-Bhagavata Purana and Devi Mahatmyam, part of the Markandeya Purana attributed to sage Markandeya Rishi, who wrote it in Sanskrit ca. 400-500 CE. Over a period of time, her presence was also felt in Buddhist and Jain texts and several Tantric text, especially the Kalika- Purana(10th century), which mentions Uddiyana or Odradesa (Odisha), as the seat of Goddess Katyayani and Lord Jagannath .Uddiyana Pitha Iconography of the Buddhist Sculpture of Orissa: Text, by Thomas E. Donaldson, Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts. Abhinav Publications, 2001. . Page 9. In Hindu traditions like Yoga and Tantra, she is ascribed to the sixth Ajna Chakra or the Third eye chakra and her blessings are invoked by concentrating on this point. Origin Story Born out of anger of Gods, Katyayani killed demon, Mahishasura According to the Vamana Purana she was created from the combined energies of the gods when their anger at the demon Mahishasura manifested itself in the form of energy rays. The rays crystallized in the hermitage of KƒÅtyƒÅyana Rishi, who gave it proper form therefore she is also called Katyayani or \\"daughter of Katyayana\\". Elsewhere in texts like Kalika Purana, it is mentioned that it was Rishi Kaytyayana who first worshipped her, hence she came to known as Katyayani. In either case, she is a demonstration or apparition of the Durga and is worshipped on the sixth day of Navratri festival.Forms of Durga Devi Mahatmya in Sanskrit, the central text of Shaktism, dated 11 CE The Vamana Purana mentions the legend of her creation in great detail: \\"When the gods had sought Vishnu in their distress, he and at his command Shiva, Brahma and the other gods, emitted such flames from their eyes and countenances that a mountain of effulgence was formed, from which became manifest Katyayini, refulgent as a thousand suns, having three eyes, black hair and eighteen arms. Shiva gave her his trident, Vishnu a Sudarshan Chakra or discus, Varuna a shankha, a conch-shell, Agni a dart, Vayu a bow, Surya a quiver full of arrows, Indra a thunderbolt, Kuvera a mace, Brahma a rosary and water-pot, Kala a shield and sword, Visvakarma a battle-axe and other weapons. Thus armed and adored by the gods, Katyayani proceeded to the Mysore hills. There, the asuras saw her and captivated by her beauty they so described her to Mahishasura, their king, that he was anxious to obtain her. On asking for her hand, she told him she must be won in fight. He took on the form of Mahisha, the bull and fought; at length Durga dismounted from her lion, and sprang upon the back of Mahisha, who was in the form of a bull and with her tender feet smote him on the head with such a terrible force that he fell to the ground senseless. Then she cut off his head with her sword and henceforth was called Mahishasuramardini, the Slayer of Mahishasura., The legend also finds mention in Varaha Purana and the classical text of Shaktism, the Devi-Bhagavata PuranaThe triumph of the goddess: the canonical models and theological visions of the Devƒ´-BhƒÅgavata PurƒÅ·πáa, by Cheever Mackenzie Brown. SUNY Press, 1990. . Page 97. Other Legends Raktabeej, an aide of Kolhasur, possessed a power (Siddhi) whereby every drop of his blood spilled on earth would give rise to a demon. Due to this power, Bhairava was finding it impossible to kill Raktabeej. Katyayani swallowed all of Raktabeej's blood without letting it fall on earth. She created an Amrut Kunda (tank of nectar) to rejuvenate Bhairava's soldiers, thus playing a crucial role in the war. Her temple to the South of Kolhapur commemorates this.Shree Katyayani devi Bakor, Mahisagar, GujaratShree Karveer Mahatmya, Author ‚Äì Dajiba Joshirao, Publisher ‚Äì Minal Prakashan, Edition/Year of Publication ‚Äì 2012 The second among the 'Shaktipeeths' is Tulja Bhavani (Parvati) of Tuljapur.

The founder of the Maratha kingdom, Shivaji Maharaj always visited the temple to seek her blessings. It is believed that the Goddess DurgaBhavani(Katyayani) gave him a sword - 'the Bhawani sword' - for success in his expeditions. The history of the temple has been mentioned in the Skanda Purana. According to Tantras, she revealed through the North face, which is one six Faces of Shiva.

Worship The Bhagavata Purana in 10th Canto, 22nd Chapter, describes the legend of Katyayani Vrata, where young marriageable daughters (gopis) of the cowherd men of Gokula in Braja, worshipped Goddess Katyayani and took a vrata, or vow, during the entire month of Margashirsha, the first month of the winter season, to get Lord Krishna as their husband. During the month, they ate only unspiced khichri and after bathing in the Yamuna at sunrise made an earthen deity of the goddess on the riverbank and worshipped the idol with aromatic substances like sandalwood pulp, lamps, fruits, betel nuts, newly grown leaves, fragrant garlands and incense. This precedes the episode where Krishna takes away their clothes while they are bathing in the Yamuna River.Sri Katyayani Vrata Story Bhagavata Purana 10th Canto 22nd Chapter.Ancient Indian tradition & mythology: Puranas in translation, by Jagdish Lal Shastri, Arnold Kunst, G.

She is worshiped as the Adi shakti swaroop who if you make vow of fasting, would give you the husband you have wished and prayed for. The fasting, called KƒÅtyƒÅyanƒ´-vrata is made for a whole month, offering such things as sandal, flowers, incense, etc.: \\"During the month of MƒÅrga≈õƒ´r·π£a, every day early in the morning the young daughters of the cowherds(gopis) would take one another's hands and singing of Krishna's transcendental qualities, go to the Yamuna(Jamuna) to bathe. Desiring to obtain Krishna as their husband, they would then worship the goddess KƒÅtyƒÅyanƒ´ with incense, flowers and other items\\". Each day they rose at dawn. Calling out to others by name, they all held hands and loudly sang glories of Krishna while going to KƒÅlindƒ´(personified Jamuna) to take their bath. The Adolescent Virgin Goddess in the southern tip of India, Devi Kanya Kumari is said to be the avatar of Devi Katyayani Or Devi Parvati. She is the goddess of penance and Sanyas. During the Pongal(Thai Pongal), a harvest festival, which coincides with the Makara Sankranthi and is celebrated in Tamil Nadu, young girls prayed for rain and prosperity and throughout the month, they avoided milk and milk products. Women used to bath early in the morning and worshiped the idol of Goddess Katyayani, carved out of wet sand. The penance ended on the first day of the month of Thai(January‚ÄìFebruary) in Tamil calendar.

The books are based on stories told to the cousins by their grandfather. They concern a hideously ugly witch known as Nurse Matilda who has been highly recommended to Mr. and Mrs. Brown as a nursemaid by several agencies. Nurse Matilda arrives at the household of the Brown family and becomes a nanny to the innumerable Brown children. The Brown children are \\"exceedingly naughty\\" and frighten off many governesses in wonderfully mischievous ways -- until Nurse Matilda comes. She teaches the children to behave, and deals with the fearsome and pernickety Great Aunt Adelaide Stitch. In the end the children become good and decent, and Nurse Matilda leaves to attend another family of naughty children. In the sequels, the children revert to their wicked ways, and the distressed Mr. and Mrs. Brown have no other choice but to send for Nurse Matilda again. In the second book, the children are sent to live with their domineering Great Aunt Adelaide in her London manor. In the third and final book, they are whisked away to the hospital following a prank that has gone wrong. Books # Nurse Matilda (1964) # Nurse Matilda Goes to Town (1967) # Nurse Matilda Goes to Hospital (1974) Film adaptations The books were later adapted for the films Nanny McPhee (2005) and Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang (2010). In the first motion picture there are only seven children, and Nurse Matilda is renamed Nanny McPhee - her first name is not mentioned. The most significant departure from the books, however, is the absence of Mrs. Brown. In Brand's stories, Mrs. Brown is alive and well, whereas in the first film she is dead, having fallen ill after the birth of the youngest child, Agatha. Mr. Brown is forced to marry the foul Selma Quickly, a garishly clothed, thrice-widowed gold-digger, whose character did not appear in the books. The sequel Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang (2010) is loosely based on the trilogy of Nurse Matilda books. The film does not closely follow the plot of the trilogy, but several individual scenes are derived from the three books. Emma Thompson started to write the script, based on Brand's books, in the spring of 2007. Although a third film was originally planned, as Emma Thompson stated previously in an interview on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross, the box office returns from the second film were determined to be too low to proceed with the third film.

Process  Performing a source transformation consists of using Ohm's law to take an existing voltage source in series with a resistance, and replacing it with a current source in parallel with the same resistance, or vice versa. The transformed sources are considered identical and can be substituted for one another in a circuit.Nilsson, James W., & Riedel, Susan A. (2002). Introductory Circuits for Electrical and Computer Engineering. New Jersey: Prentice Hall.. Source transformations are not limited to resistive circuits. They can be performed on a circuit involving capacitors and inductors as well, by expressing circuit elements as impedances and sources in the frequency domain. In general, the concept of source transformation is an application of Th√©venin's theorem to a current source, or Norton's theorem to a voltage source. However, this means that source transformation is bound by the same conditions as Thevenin's theorem and Norton's theorem; namely that the load behaves linearly, and does not contain dependent voltage or current sources. Source transformations are used to exploit the equivalence of a real current source and a real voltage source, such as a battery. Application of Th√©venin's theorem and Norton's theorem gives the quantities associated with the equivalence. Specifically, given a real current source, which is an ideal current source I in parallel with an impedance Z, applying a source transformation gives an equivalent real voltage source, which is an ideal voltage source in series with the impedance. The impedance Z retains its value and the new voltage source V has value equal to the ideal current source's value times the impedance, according to Ohm's Law V=I*Z. In the same way, an ideal voltage source in series with an impedance can be transformed into an ideal current source in parallel with the same impedance, where the new ideal current source has value I = V/Z .  Example calculation  Source transformations are easy to compute using Ohm's law. If there is a voltage source in series with an impedance, it is possible to find the value of the equivalent current source in parallel with the impedance by dividing the value of the voltage source by the value of the impedance. The converse also holds: if a current source in parallel with an impedance is present, multiplying the value of the current source with the value of the impedance provides the equivalent voltage source in series with the impedance. A visual example of a source transformation can be seen in Figure 1. :: V = I\\\\cdot Z, \\\\qquad I = \\\\cfrac VZ Figure 1. An example of a DC source transformation. Notice that the impedance Z is the same in both configurations.  A brief proof of the theorem  The transformation can be derived from the uniqueness theorem. In the present context, it implies that a black box with two terminals must have a unique well-defined relation between its voltage and current. It is readily to verify that the above transformation indeed gives the same V-I curve, and therefore the transformation is valid.

The books  Elmer was first published by Dobson Books in 1968, and re-issued with re-drawn illustrations in a slightly shortened version by Andersen Press in 1989. It was inspired by the mascot of the Bordeaux zoo (which closed in 1974) in France. The books are published in the United Kingdom by Andersen Press and were published in the United States by Harper Collins originally, Andersen press USA now publishes in America. Thirty-nine book titles have been created since 1989, and the series has sold over eight million copies in fifty languages around the world. Satoshi Kitamura carried out the Japanese translation. = Themes = Elmer is an elephant with rainbow and white squares arranged as a patchwork. He has a cheerful and optimistic personality, and he loves practical jokes. The stories are suitable for early exploration of the themes and issues relating to the concept of diversity. One day, Elmer decides that he wants to look like all the other elephants, and paints himself grey in order to 'blend in'. Once painted, they - and the other jungle creatures - no longer recognise him. He returns to the herd and the other elephants stand quietly until Elmer can't take the quiet anymore and he lifts his trunk and then, at the top of his voice, shouting \\"Booo!\\", which unknowingly surprises the other elephants. The other elephants immediately realise that the grey elephant must be Elmer and applaud him for his best joke ever. When it begins to rain, the grey paint that Elmer has covered himself with starts to disappear, and Elmer's \\"true colours\\" are revealed, much to the delight of his friends, who preferred his multicoloured and fun loving personality. Following their happy reunion, the elephants reassure Elmer that they love him because of his differences, and not in spite of them, and they celebrate by painting themselves in multi-coloured paint (and Elmer paints himself gray), in recognition of Elmer's unique appearance and personality.  Merchandise  Elmer the Patchwork Elephant also features in a wide range of merchandising. His first story is also featured and animated in Anytime Tales, a storytelling animated programme narrating five of David McKee and Tony Ross' stories. The story of Elmer was originally narrated by British voice actor Johnny Morris, who died on 6 May 1999, aged 82. Sophie Aldred also read his first story which was also animated by Mike Hibbert in an episode of Words and Pictures from 1993, featuring the letter E.  Musical Stage  A musical stage version created by Jonathan Rockefeller was adapted by Suzanne Maynard Miller with songs by Allison Leyton-Brown. After an initial engagement in Toronto (December 2017), Elmer the Patchwork Elephant show embarked upon a tour of the UK January 2019.  Titles  * 1. Elmer (1989; originally published in 1968) * 2.

As of 2012, there are 4.6 million official members and 5.4 million associate members in JA., http://www.zenchu-ja.or.jp/profile/x While ‚ÄúJA‚Äù refers to co-ops that operate in respective municipalities, the ‚ÄúJA group‚Äù includes administrative bodies that supervise regional co-ops across several prefectures, run wholesale business in food products and production inputs across municipal and prefectural borders (Zen-Noh), manage credit unions (Norinchukin Bank), offer insurance (JA Kyosai), and a national headquarters that controls the entire group and manages government relations (JA Zenchu). ‚ÄúJA‚Äù and ‚ÄúJA group‚Äù are often used interchangeably (as will be hereafter).  Origin as a regulatory organization  The origin of the Japan Agricultural Cooperatives system can be traced back to the Nogyokai, a government-controlled association of farmers and landowners, which worked under government orders to collect, store, and redistribute agricultural products in respective regions during the Second World War. Nogyokai was transformed into the JA in the wake of Japan's surrender and amidst severe food shortage to prevent rice from being sold on the black market at high prices (rice could not be bought and sold freely at the time). While JA takes the form of a voluntary grassroots farmers‚Äô organization, it is distinct from other co-ops in the rest of the world in that JA was founded by the government as a regulatory tool, covers all farmers in the entire country, and performs almost all economic aspects of the Japanese agricultural industry.  Change into a powerful farm lobby  Although JA was founded by the government, it soon proved difficult to control as the entity grew into a powerful farm lobby. Before 1995, the price of rice was determined by the government under the staple food control system. Demand for staple foods like rice is inelastic, which means that, at least in the short term, higher prices translate into increased net sales and thus higher commissions for JA as the sole wholesaler of agricultural products. Rice prices were set on the basis of production costs incurred by farmers, so as the sole wholesaler of input supplies like fertilizer, pesticides, and machinery, JA inflated the prices of these supplies, the margin of which would eventually reflect in higher rice retail prices. JA's business model was hinged upon its monopoly or quasi- monopoly in both ends of the supply chain (agricultural inputs such as fertilizer, pesticides, machinery, and end-products such as rice, wheat, and barley) and its political clout over Japan's Diet members to influence the set food prices.  Vulnerabilities and countermeasures  There are several vulnerabilities to JA's business model. First, the very existence of the agricultural cooperative is based on a law called the Agricultural Cooperative Association Law, which can be rewritten or repealed by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF). While this law justifies various privileges that JA enjoys including exemption from Japan's antitrust law, it does remain outside of JA's direct control. Secondly, highly priced rice produced by Japanese farmers will easily lose market share should cheaper rice be imported from overseas. JA's business is dependent on high import tariffs on foreign rice controlled by the government. The current import tariff on foreign rice is 778%. The third vulnerability is the decline in Japan's farming population. Agricultural production declined from 11.7 trillion yen in 1984 to 8.2 trillion in 2011, and the number of farming households plummeted from over 6 million representing 14.5 million people in 1960 to 2.5 million households in 2010 representing a working force nearly one sixth the size 50 years ago., http://www.nippon.com/en/currents/d00082/ To maintain the founding act and the trade barriers intact, JA makes full use of its political leverage over Diet members, especially members of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) who are from electorates with a large farming population. JA has a government affairs arm (JA Zenchu) as well as a political committee (Noseiren), and the latter especially has historically contributed to organizing farmer votes in support of LDP candidates. As a political party that has kept its majority in the Lower House for almost entirely since its formation in 1955, LDP has long protected JA by keeping MAFF and other government agencies in check. The fact that Japan's farming population is in decline poses the greatest threat to JA's continued dominance in the agricultural market and the group's very existence. With less demand for agricultural inputs, JA's wholesale business incurs more operating cost relative to sales. In fact, JA's wholesale business has shown negative net profit in recent years. The loss is covered by surplus from JA's financial services and asset management, supported by increased funding from its newly created ‚Äúassociate‚Äù membership that allows non-farmers to receive its credit and insurance services. JA has paid effort in nurturing new generations in the farming industry to raise productivity, but has proved unsuccessful. This is because the organization has simultaneously supported unproductive farmers who only work part-time in small-sized farmlands rather than promoting corporate farming and merger of farmland to reduce cost and raise productivity. Today (as of 2005), 62% of Japanese ‚Äúfarmers‚Äù work part- time and rely primarily on non-farming jobs. 16% rely primarily on farming but are still part-time, and only 23% are full-time farmers. The overwhelming majority of those full-time farmers are people who retired from their second job and returned to their farmlands. In aggregate, only 9.5% of the total farming population is full-time male farmers less than 65 years of age., http://www.tokyofoundation.org/en/articles/2008/the-agricultural-cooperatives- and-farming-reform-in-japan-1 JA's rationale to perpetuate this structure is political. A group of 100 unproductive farmers translates into more votes in Diet elections and thus serves JA's interests better than a group of 10 productive farmers.  Reform  Recently, there have been signs of change. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's regulatory reform committee made an official proposal in November 2014 to undertake several reforms including removing power from JA Zenchu to audit and supervise local JA co-ops and convert Zen- Noh into a joint stock corporation., http://diamond.jp/articles/-/63410 In July 2015, Akira Banzai, former president of Zenchu, was replaced by pro- reform Choe Okuno after an election that was widely believed to favor Toru Nakaya, a conservative who had support from many high-ranked JA officials., http://diamond.jp/articles/-/74829 In October 2015, Japan concluded its TPP negotiations with 11 other member countries and made an important move towards reducing trade barriers to foreign agricultural products.

Retrieved 28 August 2012. History Originally hunter-gatherers, the Chimariko are possibly the earliest residents of their region. They had good relations with the Wintu people and were enemies of the Hupa, a Southern Athabaskan people. Non-native fur trappers first entered the Chimariko's territory in 1820, followed by miners and settlers in the 1850s. The Chimariko were profoundly affected by the destructive environmental practices of gold seekers during the California Gold Rush, starting in 1848. One of the major issues involved the disruption of the salmon population that was the main food source of the Chimariko. In the 1860s, conflict between the Chimariko and white miners led to the near extinction of their population. The surviving Chimariko fled to live with the Hupa and Shasta[Chimariko] Language Chimariko people spoke the Chimariko language, a Northern Hokan language. The language is currently extinct. The language probably became extinct sometime in the 1930s. It is extensively documented in unpublished fieldnotes which John Peabody Harrington obtained from the last speaker, Sally Noble, in the 1920s. Population Estimates for the pre-contact populations of most native groups in California have varied substantially. Alfred L. Kroeber proposed that the 1770 population of the Chimariko, together with the New River, Konomihu, and Okwanuchu groups of the Shasta, had been about 1,000. Specifically for the Chimariko, he estimated an 1849 population of 250. Shirley Silver (1978:205) put the aboriginal population at \\"only a few hundred\\".Silver, Shirley. 1978. \\"Chimariko\\". In California, edited by Robert F. Heizer, pp. 205-210. Handbook of North American Indians, William C. Sturtevant, general editor, vol. 8. Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C. p. 205 Other estimates are that there were 250 Chimariko people in the 18th and early 19th centuries, moving down to 200 in 1852, 20 in 1880, and none by 1900. There may have been descendants of the Chimariko recently discovering their identity, since some Chimariko fled with the Hupa and Shasta. In the 2010 census, 60 people claimed Chimariko ancestry, 19 of them full-blooded.

Hume, CEO of Basic American Foods of San Francisco, and including Southern California car dealer Holmes Tuttle and others) to support President Reagan's national defense and economic initiatives. CFA called itself \\"President Reagan's Lobby\\" and was led first by drugstore magnate Lewis E. Lehrman and later by Gerald P. Carmen, who had served as administrator of the General Services Administration (GSA) and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations mission in Geneva, Switzerland. CFA was organized as an IRS 501 (C) (3) and (4) non-profit. Among the early employees was Jack Abramoff, who was later terminated for cause.Washington Post, July 27, 1985, \\"Staff Shakeup at Conservative Group\\" by Sidney Blumnethal. History Citizens for America staged an unprecedented meeting of anti-Communist rebel leaders calling themselves \\"Armed Movements Fighting Against Soviet Expansionism\\", formed by Nicaraguan, Laotian, Angolan and Afghan (Mujahideen) rebels in June 1985 in Jamba, Angola, the UNITA headquarters of Angolan rebel Jonas Savimbi. The guerrilla leaders were presented with a copy of the United States Declaration of Independence, and a letter from President Reagan supporting CFA was read, although the Reagan administration refused to officially support all of the guerrilla groups. Marc Holtzman (who later ran for governor of Colorado) served as CFA's first executive director. Under Holtzman's tenure, CFA focused on promoting the Reagan economic and national security agenda, including the strategic defense initiative. Holtzman resigned in early 1985 and was replaced by Abramoff, who had been director of College Republicans. Lehrman fired Abramoff after only nine months due to his mismanagement of the organization's $3 million budget and his hiring of friends. Abramoff was replaced by CFA's legal counsel Frank Trotta, who served as interim Executive Director until Bill Wilson, formerly of Right to Work, came on as executive director. Wilson served for a year, after which attorney and writer Jack R. Stevens became the executive director. Stevens served for two years and was the organization's executive director in its final days under President Reagan. Trotta, Wilson and Stevens (who had earlier served as CFA's western regional director) were credited with restoring CFA's finances and reputation after Abramoff's brief but damaging tenure. CFA supported its grass-roots lobbying campaigns by hosting two fundraisers annually. The \\"Founder's Circle\\" required a contribution of $25,000 per year and included donors like Joseph and Holly Coors, Holmes Tuttle and Jack Hume. President Reagan hosted CFA donors and staff regularly at the White House. At one such session in 1987, he recognized CFA National Director Gerald P. Carmen and Executive Director Jack Stevens for their efforts in orchestrating the organization's successful campaign to secure $100 million in congressional aid to the Nicaraguan Contras. CFA staff met in the White House with Reagan Administration officials on a weekly basis to coordinate field activities. Stevens hired Liam Weston, who later became Mayor Pro Tem of El Segundo, California and now a columnist for the Sacramento Union [1], as CFA's eastern regional director in 1987. Weston later served as a Republican staff member in the 104th U.S. Congress. He left Congress and moved to Central America to administer the U.S. aid to the Nicaraguan Resistance 1989‚Äì1991. In 1991‚Äì1993, he was posted to Africa, where he managed an aid program for the Angolan UNITA rebels. President Reagan mentioned CFA 11 times in \\"The Reagan Diaries\\",See \\"The Reagan Diaries\\" by Ronald Reagan, Harper Perennial, 2009. Pages 203, 254, 294, 357, 383, 438, 441, 450, 526, 601, 636. including an entry in his final days in office that CFA is one of the few groups with which would consider staying involved upon leaving office. President Reagan credited CFA's extensive field operations, and cited field leaders Weston; Gordon Bloyer;(now an Internet blogger and video commentator); Kelly Cardwell of Alabama; Cecil Martin ‚ÄúBud‚Äù Starr, III (now a Kern County, California prosecutor); Robert Miltenberg (now a Los Angeles advertising executive); former California legislator Doug Carter (now deceased); and San Francisco activist Dorothy Vuksich (now deceased) with having helped secure congressional support for Afghan rebel aid, Contra aid, and tax reduction and simplification, among other issues. CFA organized volunteer committees and chairmen in each congressional district to conduct grass-roots campaigns in support of Reagan's strategic and economic agenda. The organization was able to unite all segments of the conservative movement, though it took no position on social issues. Awards Stevens and Weston, in coordination with Reagan's OMB Director Jim Miller and former CFA communications director David Carmen (now CEO of the Washington, D.C. public affairs firm, The Carmen Group), created the first annual \\"Pork Barrel\\" spending awards, a dubious distinction for members of Congress CFA considered to be profligate spenders. CFA published ‚ÄúThe Pork Book‚Äù in 1987..

He also served as Vice President of Bolivia between 1960 and 1964.Vicepresidency of Bolivia Lech√≠n was born to a Lebanese immigrant father and a Bolivian mother in Corocoro, a city in the Department of La Paz. He worked in the Catavi and Siglo XX tin mines, both of which were owned by the mining tycoon Sim√≥n Iturri Pati√±o. While working as a machinist in the mines, he was made aware of the desperate conditions of the vast majority of the highland workers. In the 1940s he became involved in the nascent labor movement and joined the Revolutionary Workers' Party (POR), a Trotskyist political party. In 1944, Lech√≠n led a congress of miners in Huanuni, Oruro, that led to the formation of the FSTMB. Lech√≠n was elected the union's Executive Secretary. At this point, he became affiliated with the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNR), though he maintained good relations with the Trotskyist POR. Following the 1952 Bolivian National Revolution, Lech√≠n was chosen as Minister of Mines and Petroleum. He also led the founding congress of the Central Obrera Boliviana (COB), an umbrella federation of labor unions, and was elected its Executive Secretary. Since he had played a vital role in the Revolution, and had advocated the permanent extension of weapons to the workers' militias to guarantee regime stability against the possibility of an oligarchic/military backlash, he became extremely popular with the poorer sectors of society. Indeed, he was the most charismatic and popular MNR leader other than Paz Estenssoro. In addition, he was of far more radical political persuasion (Marxist-inspired) than the rest of the government leadership. This inevitably led to growing intra-party tensions and disagreements over labor issues and personal ambitions. In frank disagreement with what he saw as the increasingly conservative policies of president Hern√°n Siles Zuazo, by the late 1950s Lech√≠n had begun to form a left-wing opposition within the ruling party. To reduce these tensions and prevent fragmentation, V√≠ctor Paz Estenssoro was persuaded to return from retirement and lead the MNR in the 1960 presidential elections. The conciliatory Paz chose Lech√≠n as his vice-presidential candidate, apparently with a promise that he (Lech√≠n) would be the presidential candidate in 1964. This was not to be, for Lech√≠n's intransigence on political issues eventually forced Paz into not only reneging on his promise but also into expelling vice-president Lech√≠n from the MNR (1964 MNR convention). At that point, the labor leader left the party to form the Revolutionary Party of the National Left (PRIN). Rather surprisingly, Juan Lech√≠n‚Äîthe firebrand of the left‚Äîsupported the 1964 military coup that toppled the MNR from power. Soon thereafter, however, he was forced into exile. He returned in 1971 and was elected as head of the Popular Assembly, a revolutionary congress endorsed by the reform-minded general General Juan Jos√© Torres. Once more Lech√≠n's role was polarizing, as he attempted to create a parallel (union and Assembly-based, quite reminiscent of soviets) alternative to the established order. After the Torres's overthrow later that year, Lech√≠n was exiled once again and did not return until the democratic opening of 1978. By then the years had caught up with him and he had lost much luster and electoral appeal on a nationwide basis. He remained extremely popular with the miners, however, and once more he was elected to lead them and to chair the powerful Bolivian Workers' Union (COB). In 1980 he was the PRIN candidate for President and fared rather poorly at the polls, but in any case another military coup (this time led by Luis Garcia Meza) forced him into exile yet again. When democracy was restored in 1982, Lech√≠n and the other leaders of the FSTMB and COB returned to the political arena. In his restored position as top labor leader in the country, he strongly criticized the economic policies of president Hern√°n Siles Zuazo (1982‚Äì85), coming close to toppling his beleaguered regime with crippling strikes and other non-cooperation measures. Lech√≠n also vigorously opposed the neoliberal administration of V√≠ctor Paz Estenssoro, who served his fourth term from 1985 to 1989. The closure of most of the country's tin mines by Paz Estenssoro (due to declining production and the collapse of world prices) led to considerable in-fighting in the unions. In 1987, Lech√≠n‚Äînow aged 73‚Äîretired from the leadership of the FSTMB and was voted out as head of the COB. He was replaced in the FSTMB by Filem√≥n Escobar and by Genaro Flores in the COB. A controversial but undeniably important historical figure, reviled by many and followed almost blindly by others, Juan Lech√≠n Oquendo died in August 2001, at the age of 87. A major criticism used against him is that he tended to de-stabilize precisely those regimes that were friendliest to the interests of the working class (Paz Estenssoro, Torres, Siles Zuazo between 1982 and 1985), while being quite deferential to the most hardline right-wing governments (Barrientos, Banzer, Garcia Mesa), at least until he could get safely out of the country.

These methods of cooking ensure the pudding remains moist and does not dry out or form a crust unlike the sweet but crusted persimmon bread. The pudding is often served with ice cream, cr√®me anglaise, whipped cream, apple sauce, or hard sauce, which is sometimes called brandy sauce.

More simply, meiotic drive is when one copy of a gene is passed on to offspring more than the expected 50% of the time. According to Buckler et al., \\"Meiotic drive is the subversion of meiosis so that particular genes are preferentially transmitted to the progeny. Meiotic drive generally causes the preferential segregation of small regions of the genome\\". Meiotic drive in plants The first report of meiotic drive came from Marcus Rhoades who in 1942 observed a violation of mendelian segregation ratios for the R locus - a gene controlling the production of the purple pigment anthocyanin in maize kernels - in a maize line carrying abnormal chromosome 10. This violation of mendelian segregation was later shown to be the result of an array of Kindr genes at present on the end of chromosome 10 which induce neocentromere activity in maize knobs, causing copies of maize chromosomes carrying knobs to preferentially reach the egg cell during female meiosis. Meiotic drive in animals The unequal inheritance of gametes has been observed since the 1950s, in contrast to Gregor Mendel's First and Second Laws (the law of segregation and the law of independent assortment), which dictate that there is a random chance of each allele being passed on to offspring. Examples of selfish drive genes in animals have primarily been found in rodents and flies. These drive systems could play important roles in the process of speciation. For instance, the proposal that hybrid sterility (Haldane's rule) may arise from the divergent evolution of sex chromosome drivers and their suppressors. =Meiotic drive in mice= Early observations of mouse t-haplotypes by Mary Lyon described numerous genetic loci on chromosome 17 that suppress X-chromosome sex ratio distortion. If a driver is left unchecked, this may lead to population extinction as the population would fix for the driver (e.g. a selfish X chromosome), removing the Y chromosome (and therefore males) from the population. The idea that meiotic drivers and their suppressors may govern speciation is supported by observations that mouse Y chromosomes lacking certain genetic loci produce female-biased offspring, implying these loci encode suppressors of drive. Moreover, matings of certain mouse strains used in research results in unequal offspring ratios. One gene responsible for sex ratio distortion in mice is r2d2 (r2d2 ‚Äì responder to meiotic drive 2), which predicts which strains of mice can successfully breed without offspring sex ratio distortion. =Meiotic drive in flies= A stalk-eyed fly Selfish chromosomes of stalk-eyed flies have had ecological consequences. Driving X chromosomes lead to reductions in male fecundity and mating success, leading to frequency dependent selection maintaining both the driving alleles and wild-type alleles. Multiple species of fruit fly are known to have driving X chromosomes, of which the best-characterized are found in Drosophila simulans. Three independent driving X chromosomes are known in D. simulans, called Paris, Durham, and Winters. In Paris, the driving gene encodes a DNA modelling protein (\\"heterochromatin protein 1 D2\\" or HP1D2), where the allele of the driving copy fails to prepare the male Y chromosome for meiosis. In Winters, the gene responsible (\\"Distorter on the X\\" or Dox) has been identified, though the mechanism by which it acts is still unknown. The strong selective pressure imposed by these driving X chromosomes has given rise to suppressors of drive, of which the genes are somewhat known for Winters, Durham, and Paris. These suppressors encode hairpin RNAs which match the sequence of driver genes (such as Dox), leading host RNA interference pathways to degrade Dox sequence. Autosomal suppressors of drive are known in Drosophila mediopunctata, Drosophila paramelanica, Drosophila quinaria, and Drosophila testacea, emphasizing the importance of these drive systems in natural populations.

His First Mate was Edward Low. Turn to Piracy George Lowther's pirate flag. Not much is known about him before becoming the 2nd Mate on the slave ship, Gambia Castle, which was under the command of Captain Charles Russell; however Lowther was more popular with the crew, as Russell seemed to care more about his shipment of slaves than for his men. Russell distrusted Lowther, and when he attempted to have him flogged many crew members took Lowther‚Äôs side and defended him, causing a schism among the crew. Also on board, after retreating from their fort, was a Captain Massey, along with a company of soldiers under his command. One night, while Captain Russell was offboard, Massey and Lowther decided to set sail without him. Massey intended to return to England, but Lowther, the crew, and Massey's own soldiers disagreed. Lowther was made captain and he renamed the Gambia Castle, Delivery. They attacked many ships but when Massey wanted to pillage a village on shore, he lost the vote as the risk was deemed too great. Lowther was able to obtain a smaller ship, named the Happy Delivery, and parted ways with Massey and his men. George Lowther, Death of Lowther, from the Pirates of the Spanish Main series (N19) for Allen & Ginter Cigarettes MET DP835021 Lowther left for the Carolinas where he developed the tactic of ramming his ship into another, while his men boarded and looted it. Around 1721 he left for the Grand Caymans where he ran into the Greyhound captained by Benjamin Edwards. Lowther gave a cannon shot for a signal. Greyhound responded with a broadside, (simultaneous discharge of all cannons on a side of a ship.) The pirates boarded the Greyhound, possibly killed the entire crew and burnt the ship. Lowther had many ships under his command by now, granting the 6-gun brigantine Rebecca to his lieutenant Edward Low, who left to begin is own pirate career and with whom Lowther and Francis Spriggs would briefly rejoin in late 1723. Some content available on Google Books: . When Lowther sailed his fleet to Guatemala they were attacked by natives and he was forced to leave some ships and men behind. His crew and supplies were all transferred to the Revenge. Death In 1722 he sailed to a secluded island called Blanquilla. However, before landing he was spotted by Walter Moore, commander of HMS Eagle. Lowther was able to escape to the island by slipping out his cabin window, along with a dozen crewmen; only four made it to shore. After an extensive search Lowther's body was found. He had shot himself in the head rather than be taken prisoner. The Post-Boy newspaper dated 2 May 1724 suggests that Lowther did not die in 1723. The newspaper reports: \\"The last Letters from S. Christopher bring Advice, that on the 20th of February, the Eagle Sloop, h ted out from that Island, had brought in thither the Pyrate Sloop she had taken from Lowther, with twenty of the Men that were on board, (Lowther himself and many of the Crew having made their Escape) and it was believed that twelve or thirteen of them would be convicted of Pyracy, and that the others would be clear‚Äôd, as being forced into the said Pyrates Service.\\" The same information is in Newcastle Courant newspaper dated 1 February 1724: \\"We have the good News from St. Christophers, that Captain Moor of the Eagle Sloop, discovering a Pyrate Sloop of 10 Guns, and 40 Men, commanded by Lowther, careening at the Island of Blanco, boarded, and took her, with 24 of her Men, but Lowther, and 10 more, jump'd over board, and escap'd, however 4 of them were afterwards taken by a Spanish Cannoe, and 'tis hoped Lowther and the Rest would be also taken.\\" References External links *Flemming, Gregory.

It is owned by Steel City Media and airs a country radio format. The station's studios and offices are located on Pennsylvania Avenue at Westport Center in Midtown Kansas City. The transmitter site is on the East Side of Kansas City, off Stark Avenue and 23rd Street South.Radio-Locator.com/KBEQ-FM KBEQ has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 99,000 watts (100,000 with beam tilt).FCC.gov/KBEQ History =Early Years as KBEY= In November 1960, the station signed on the air as KBEY. Like many early FM stations, KBEY served as a counterpart to AM 1480 KBEA in nearby Mission, Kansas (now KCZZ). It was only powered at 17,500 watts, a fraction of its current output. KBEY played big band and easy listening music, running a no-announcer broadcast automation system. In 1970, KBEY was acquired by Intermedia, Inc., a division of Interstate Securities Corp. The division was managed by Mark Wodlinger, former manager of KMBC TV, where he convinced Lenny Dawson to do TV sports. In 1972, Intermedia decided to divest itself from the radio business and keep only its main asset, KQTV in St. Joseph. Bob Ingram bought KBEA AM, while KBEY FM was purchased by Mark and Connie Wodlinger.Broadcasting Yearbook 1974 page B-122 KBEY switched to \\"underground\\" rock in August 1970, playing cuts from albums including blues, folk and rock, with some classical music and jazz. Another FM station, KUDL's sister FM KCJC, had recently ended its underground format, so KBEY decided to fill the void. One of KCJC's longtime DJs, \\"Little Willie,\\" was part of the first KBEY air staff. KBEY's progressive rock format began with 20 hours of music played on the old automation system, and four hours live each evening with Bill Scott, until an air staff could be assembled. Unfortunately, in Scott's previous job, he was a DJ using the name \\"Robert W. Walker\\" (\\"El Walkero\\") on KUDL AM and he had a non-compete clause in his previous contract. He assumed this restriction was for the character while KUDL asserted it was for him, personally. Within a few weeks, KUDL sued and he was forced to leave the job on KBEY. KBEY became an ABC FM Network affiliate to fulfill most of its news obligation, but devoted minimum time to news and talk, focusing on new, unique, and classic music. In 1971, KBEY devoted the midnight to 6 a.m. time slot to jazz, hosted by Bobby Kline, which developed a sizable following over the next couple of years. The progressive format was more successful than is often assumed. There was networking among similar stations, like KSHE St. Louis, and KSAN San Francisco, sharing programming content. The \\"format\\" evolved over three years, and consistently claimed 8 to 12 percent of the KC audience, a respectable share in a market with around thirty stations. Eventually, though, progressive radio found itself fading at the same moment that San Diego's \\"Super Q\\" format was sweeping the country. Mark Wodlinger knew it would hit Kansas City soon, and whatever station adopted the format would likely be number one in the ratings for at least a couple years. He arranged the deal, made the announcement, and began a two month KBEY-KBEQ transition process to bring in the new format with its new air staff, with the progressive album rock jazz experiment ending in August, like it started. =Top 40 KBEQ= On August 15, 1973, with the growing popularity of FM radio, KBEY ended the progressive rock format and switched to their long-running Top 40/CHR format, as \\"Super-Q, Q-104.\\" It was modeled after San Diego Top 40 station KCBQ, a format that was sweeping the country at the time. 104.3's call sign changed to KBEQ with the slogan \\"Super-Q Plays Favorites.\\" Q-104 gradually chipped away at Kansas City's powerhouse Top 40 station, AM 810 WHB. Public service announcements were called \\"Q Tips.\\" A \\"Super-Q\\" phone-in contest had become popular in San Diego, tying up the city's telephone network (a dangerous problem the station publicized wildly). It was replicated on a smaller scale in Kansas City. The large number of listeners hurriedly dialing the station's number for the contest would create many wrong numbers. That prompted Southwestern Bell in Kansas City to respond in the same way as other cities, by creating a new phone exchange just for radio, TV and other entities that might suddenly get large numbers of calls. The three-number exchange was unique, so there would be few or no wrong numbers. KBEQ jammed the lines with its \\"Treasure Hunt\\" contest. So Southwestern Bell assigned KBEQ Kansas City's first 576-7xxx number. It was 816-576-7104, but the 576-7xxx system worked in the 913 area code too, covering both Missouri and Kansas-based stations in the Kansas City metro area. Previously, the only way many FM radio station owners could make a profit was to lease ten percent of the signal out for a subsidiary communications authority (SCA) channel. Muzak was a huge customer, using FM stations to broadcast \\"elevator music\\" to banks, restaurants and stores. Mark Wodlinger recognized the value of this service, and brought AgReports to Kansas City, using the 103.3 subcarrier of KPRS by contract. Up to 80 miles away, a grain elevator would hoist an antenna to the roof and pick up a constant stream of up-to-the minute commodity prices. At first, reports came by voice on a McMartin SCA table radio, with formatted note pads included to jot prices on. Soon, the stream went digital and the output was a TV screen full of scrolling prices. Then, Wodlinger brought in a medical radio network, free to doctors, with ad-supported medical talk radio all day, broadcast on KBEQ's own SCA channel. =Change in ownership= After about five years, the Wodlingers sold KBEQ. They later bought an FM station in Leavenworth, Kansas at 98.9, moving the transmitter to Basehor and raising the power so it would cover the Kansas City radio market. (This would later become active rock station KQRC.) Mariner Communications bought KBEQ in 1977.Broadcasting Yearbook 1980 page B-132 Q-104's studios were in Kansas City, Kansas, at 55th and Metropolitan, then at River Quay, then at PennTower (31st and Broadway in Kansas City, Missouri) and eventually at Country Club Plaza. Some of the DJs were Pat McKay, Mike O'Brien (one of the original Q staff, on the air on Day One), Steve Garrett, Rockin' Johnny Rowlands, Bobby Ocean, Young Bobby Day, Chuck Nasty (known as Charmin' Chuck Harmon), Johnny Dare, Doug Billings, Randy Miller, and Dancin' Danny Wright. Many came from other cities for the job and stayed in the market. Former KBEY DJs Bobby Kline and Art Hadley (Arthur Lee) eventually joined the airstaff. WHB eventually ended its Top 40 format, turning to oldies in 1985, while KBKC/KCPW, which were both located on 94.9 FM, would also flip to oldies itself in 1989. By the end of the decade, KBEQ was Kansas City's only Top 40 station. In the 1980s, KBEQ's power had increased to 50,000 watts. By the 1990s, it was increased again, to its current 100,000 watts. In October 1987, Noble Broadcasting acquired KBEQ- FM.Broadcasting Yearbook 1990 page B-182 =Country music= By the early 1990s, however, country music's popularity increased in Kansas City and throughout the nation, while the Top 40 format was in a state of decline. In addition, rimshot station KXXR flipped to a Top 40/CHR format in 1990, pulling younger listeners away from KBEQ. In the Fall 1992 ratings for the market, KBEQ would sink to 12th place (6+). On February 1, 1993, KBEQ began running a promotion called \\"20 years in 20 days\\", playing music that was popular in their Top 40 heyday. At 5 p.m. on February 19, after playing \\"End of the Road\\" by Boyz II Men, KBEQ abruptly flipped the format to country as \\"Young Country 104.\\" The first song on KBEQ was \\"Young Country\\" by Hank Williams, Jr..http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1993/RR-1993-02-26.pdf\\"Country music has another convert; Rock station KBEQ changes formats, hires Randy Miller as DJ.\\", The Kansas City Star, February 24, 1993. This left Kansas City without a full city-grade Top 40 station until the following year, when future-sister station KMXV flipped from adult contemporary music to Top 40. In March 1995, EZ Communications, the same company that owned competitor KFKF, bought the station.https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-YB/1996/1996-BC-YB.pdf By July 1996, KBEQ rebranded as \\"Young Country Q 104\\" as a nod to the station's previous Top 40 legacy. In April 1997, KBEQ was acquired by American Radio Systems.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1998 page D-256Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2000 page D-260\\"Radio stations to be acquired\\", The Kansas City Star, July 19, 1997. Westinghouse/CBS bought American Radio Systems' stations (including KBEQ) on September 19, 1997. In June 1998, CBS split off the radio division under the revived Infinity Broadcasting name, which would be renamed CBS Radio in December 2005. In 2001, KBEQ dropped the \\"Young Country\\" portion of its branding and began simply using the moniker \\"Q 104.\\" The station also changed its logo to mirror its former Top 40 logo. =Wilks and Steel City ownership= KBEQ was sold off by CBS to Wilks Broadcasting in November 2006 as part of a nationwide reduction of radio stations by CBS. On June 12, 2014, Wilks announced that they would be selling its Kansas City cluster, including KBEQ, to Pittsburgh-based Steel City Media.\\"Steel City Media Acquires Wilks' Kansas City\\" from Radio Insight (June 12, 2014) The sale was approved on September 26, 2014, and was consummated on September 30. Steel City owns two Kansas City country stations: the younger-appealing KBEQ and the more mainstream KFKF. They compete against Entercom's WDAF-FM. KBEQ's studios were a fixture in the Plaza area until November 2007, when the station moved to Westport Center to join their other sister stations in one building.

Biography  Born in 1971 in Taipei, Taiwan, to Malaysian parents, Tash Aw returned to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, at the age of two, and grew up there.About Tash Aw He had a multilingual upbringing, speaking Malay, Mandarin, Cantonese and English during his youth. He eventually relocated to England to study law at Jesus College, Cambridge and at the University of Warwick before moving to London to write. After graduating, he worked at a number of jobs, including as a lawyer for four years while writing his debut novel, which he completed during the creative writing course at the University of East Anglia. Tash Aw talks about Map of the Invisible World on Bookbits radio. His first novel, The Harmony Silk Factory, was published in 2005. After Malaysian journalists reported that he had been paid more than ¬£500,000 for the novel, The Star and The New Straits Times called him the \\"RM3.5 million man\\", and local interest in his book deal continues today, even though the novelist himself has consistently denied the size of this advance, preferring to talk about the novel, which was longlisted for the 2005 Man Booker Prize and won the 2005 Whitbread Book Awards First Novel Award as well as the 2005 Commonwealth Writers Prize for Best First Novel (Asia Pacific region). It also made it to the long-list of the world's prestigious 2007 International Impac Dublin Award and the Guardian First Book Prize. It has thus far been translated into twenty languages. Aw cites his literary influences as James Baldwin, Toni Morrison, Marguerite Duras, William Faulkner and Albert Camus. His second novel, titled Map of the Invisible World, was published in May 2009. Time magazine called it \\"a complex, gripping drama of private relationships,\\" and praised \\"Aw's matchless descriptive prose\\", \\"immense intelligence and empathy.\\" His 2013 novel Five Star Billionaire was longlisted for the 2013 Man Booker Prize. In 2016, he published The Face: Strangers on a Pier, a memoir on immigration through the experience of his Chinese-Malaysian family, which was a finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize. His novel, We, The Survivors, was published in 2019.  Miscellaneous  Based on royalties as well as prizes, Aw is the most successful Malaysian writer of recent years. Following the announcement of the Booker longlist, the Whitbread Award and his Commonwealth Writers' Prize award, he became a celebrity in Malaysia and Singapore, and is now one of the most respected literary figures in Southeast Asia. He was a juror for the 2014 O. Henry Award, identifying Mark Haddon's \\"The Gun\\" as his favourite story of the year's selection. As of 2017, he is among the writers- in-residence at Nanyang Technological University. In January 2018, his alma mater, the University of Warwick, awarded him an honorary Doctor of Letters degree.

The L5 was a single-unit locomotive instead of the twin-unit DD1. The wheel arrangement in Whyte notation was 2-4-4-2, or 1-B-B-1 in the AAR scheme. Twenty five were built in 4 distinct subclasses. The lead unit of the class was equipped for AC operation with an overhead pantograph (later two), while the other 24 were third rail DC units to work on the existing PRR third rail electrification in the New York area. The class was built with an eye towards future long distance electrification with the idea of a single class that could be used interchangeably between the present and future AC electrified zones and the DC electrified zone in New York City. The PRR also used the L5 order to try out electrical equipment manufacturers other than Westinghouse, which had provided the propulsion equipment for both the DD1 and FF1 classes. The original classes were to be simply L5 for the AC units and L5a for the DC units, but as the additional equipment suppliers were brought on the scheme changed to include the intended function (passenger), the current used and finally the electrical supplier. Westinghouse supplied the majority of the units with 1 L5Paw class and 12 L5pdw class. General Electric and Brown Boveri each supplied 6 classed L5pdg and L5pdb respectively. The L5 was not as successful as the DD1 as the side rod electric locomotive concept proved to be unsuited to the demands of long distance electrification. Even in the existing short haul service the L5's long rigid wheelbase and poor weight distribution caused it to be withdrawn significantly before the older DD1s.

It lies north-east from the centre of Wakefield and less than north-west of Normanton. The village is shown at the 2011 Census as being in the Normanton ward of Wakefield City Council. The M62 runs close to the village to the north-east, and the Aire and Calder Navigation to the north-west. Economy Many people in the village previously worked in the local coal mines. The largest mine in the village, The West Riding Colliery, was owned by Pope and Pearsons. It was here that the first British coaldust experiments took place during 1908 and 1909, conducted by W. E. Garforth, manager of the colliery and president of the Mining Association of Great Britain. In the early 20th century Garforth's improvement to worker safety helped to develop underground safety and rescue procedures that are today common worldwide. Today people are either employed in neighbouring towns and cities, or on the Wakefield Europort's 'Tuscany Park' industrial estate which has been developed over recent decades. Altofts' brickworks, Normanton Brick Co Ltd, moved to its present Greenfield Road site from Wakefield Road in the late 1990s. It ran under Thomas Kirk's great grandsons until it stopped production in 2011. Community facilities The village has four pubs, The Poplar, Miners Arms, The Horse and Jockey and the Robin Hood. The Horse and Jockey is the oldest pub in the village. The Robin Hood serves at least 4 cask ales and is Wakefield Campaign for Real Ales Autumn Pub of the Season 2015. A microbrewery at the back of the Robin Hood called Tarn51 Brewing Co produces beers to serve in the pub and to the local pubs. There are two Working Men's Clubs one of which has been converted into a community centre called The Brig. The Brig is owned by the registered charity called Altofts Community & Sports Foundation Ltd. The Brig is home to many community groups including Normanton Lions, Altofts Juniors FC, Altofts Cycling Club, Readers group and Storytime. The Altofts Book Swap is also based at The Brig. The Brig hosts an annual summer gala to promote local talent and community groups. The Brig community hub In the village there is also a post office, a butchers and a small number of shops and farms. Landmarks Lower Altofts is an area at the lower end of the village. It had the longest unbroken row of three-storey terraced houses in Europe, Silkstone Row, until 1978 when it was demolished. There are now just two shorter rows of terraced houses in Lower Altofts on Pope Street. Education Altofts schools are Lee Brigg Infants School, Martin Frobisher Infants School, and Altofts Junior school which celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2008. Religious sites Altofts Methodist Church The Church of St Mary Magdalene There are three churches. Altofts Methodist Church, opened in 1990, was built when the three Methodist congregations from Lower Altofts, Lock Lane and Upper Altofts amalgamated. The church is located on Church Road. The Church of St Mary Magdalene is the Anglican parish church for the village, and is Anglo-Catholic in tradition. The Hebron is an independent church, also located on Church Road. Sport Altofts Community Sports Club and playing fields provide for cricket, football and bowls. The Cricket Club plays at Lock Lane and is in the Bradford Cricket League. Altofts AFC, which was founded in the 1890s, plays in the West Yorkshire Association Football League.

Loads cause stresses, deformations, and displacements in structures. Assessment of their effects is carried out by the methods of structural analysis. Excess load or overloading may cause structural failure, and hence such possibility should be either considered in the design or strictly controlled. Mechanical structures, such as aircraft, satellites, rockets, space stations, ships, and submarines, have their own particular structural loads and actions. Engineers often evaluate structural loads based upon published regulations, contracts, or specifications. Accepted technical standards are used for acceptance testing and inspection. Types Dead loads are static forces that are relatively constant for an extended time. They can be in tension or compression. The term can refer to a laboratory test method or to the normal usage of a material or structure. Live loads are usually variable or moving loads. These can have a significant dynamic element and may involve considerations such as impact, momentum, vibration, slosh dynamics of fluids, etc. An impact load is one whose time of application on a material is less than one-third of the natural period of vibration of that material. Cyclic loads on a structure can lead to fatigue damage, cumulative damage, or failure. These loads can be repeated loadings on a structure or can be due to vibration. Loads on architectural and civil engineering structures Structural loads are an important consideration in the design of buildings. Building codes require that structures be designed and built to safely resist all actions that they are likely to face during their service life, while remaining fit for use. Minimum loads or actions are specified in these building codes for types of structures, geographic locations, usage and building materials. Structural loads are split into categories by their originating cause. In terms of the actual load on a structure, there is no difference between dead or live loading, but the split occurs for use in safety calculations or ease of analysis on complex models. To meet the requirement that design strength be higher than maximum loads, building codes prescribe that, for structural design, loads are increased by load factors. These load factors are, roughly, a ratio of the theoretical design strength to the maximum load expected in service. They are developed to help achieve the desired level of reliability of a structure based on probabilistic studies that take into account the load's originating cause, recurrence, distribution, and static or dynamic nature. = = Dead load Imposed load (live load) Live snow load The dead load includes loads that are relatively constant over time, including the weight of the structure itself, and immovable fixtures such as walls, plasterboard or carpet. The roof is also a dead load. Dead loads are also known as permanent or static loads. Building materials are not dead loads until constructed in permanent position.2006 International Building Code Section 1602.1.EN 1990 Euro code ‚Äì Basis of structural design section 4.1.1EN 1991-1-1 Euro code 1: Actions on Structures ‚Äì Part 1-1: General actions ‚Äì densities, self-weight, imposed loads for buildings section 3.2 IS875(part 1)-1987 give unit weight of building materials, parts, components. =Live load= Live loads, or imposed loads, are temporary, of short duration, or a moving load. These dynamic loads may involve considerations such as impact, momentum, vibration, slosh dynamics of fluids and material fatigue. Live loads, sometimes also referred to as probabilistic loads, include all the forces that are variable within the object's normal operation cycle not including construction or environmental loads. Roof and floor live loads are produced during maintenance by workers, equipment and materials, and during the life of the structure by movable objects, such as planters and people. Bridge live loads are produced by vehicles traveling over the deck of the bridge. =Environmental loads= Environmental Loads are structural loads caused by natural forces such as wind, rain, snow, earthquake or extreme temperatures. *Wind loads *Snow, rain and ice loads *Seismic loads *Hydrostatic loads *Temperature changes leading to thermal expansion cause thermal loads *Ponding loads *Frost heaving *Lateral pressure of soil, groundwater or bulk materials *Loads from fluids or floods *Permafrost melting *Dust loads =Other loads= Engineers must also be aware of other actions that may affect a structure, such as: *Foundation settlement or displacement *Fire *Corrosion *Explosion *Creep or shrinkage *Impact from vehicles or machinery vibration *Construction loads =Load combinations= A load combination results when more than one load type acts on the structure. Building codes usually specify a variety of load combinations together with load factors (weightings) for each load type in order to ensure the safety of the structure under different maximum expected loading scenarios. For example, in designing a staircase, a dead load factor may be 1.2 times the weight of the structure, and a live load factor may be 1.6 times the maximum expected live load. These two \\"factored loads\\" are combined (added) to determine the \\"required strength\\" of the staircase. The reason for the disparity between factors for dead load and live load, and thus the reason the loads are initially categorized as dead or live is because while it is not unreasonable to expect a large number of people ascending the staircase at once, it is less likely that the structure will experience much change in its permanent load.  Aircraft structural loads  For aircraft, loading is divided into two major categories: limit loads and ultimate loads.Bruce K. Donaldson, Analysis of Aircraft Structures: An Introduction (Cambridge; New York: Cambridge University Press, 2008), p. 126 Limit loads are the maximum loads a component or structure may carry safely. Ultimate loads are the limit loads times a factor of 1.5 or the point beyond which the component or structure will fail. Gust loads are determined statistically and are provided by an agency such as the Federal Aviation Administration. Crash loads are loosely bounded by the ability of structures to survive the deceleration of a major ground impact.Experimental Mechanics: Advances in Design, Testing and Analysis, Volume 1, ed. I. M. Allison (Rotterdam, Netherlands: A.A. Balkema Publishers, 1998), p. 379 Other loads that may be critical are pressure loads (for pressurized, high-altitude aircraft) and ground loads. Loads on the ground can be from adverse braking or maneuvering during taxiing. Aircraft are constantly subjected to cyclic loading. These cyclic loads can cause metal fatigue.Bruce K.

He is credited with saving Saint Basil's Cathedral from destruction in the early 1930s, founding and managing the Kolomenskoye and Andrei Rublev museums, and developing modern restoration technologies. Biography =Education and early career= Petr Baranovsky was born in a peasant family in Shuyskoye, in the Vyazemsky Uyezd of the Smolensk Governorate of the Russian Empire, and completed a construction engineer's degree in Moscow in 1912, earning the medal of Russian Archeological Society for restoration of Boldino Trinity Monastery in his native Smolensk region. After a brief work on industrial and railway projects, with the outbreak of World War I, he was drafted into military engineers' corps. In 1918, he completed a second degree, in art studies, and joined the faculty of Moscow State University. In 1921, Baranovsky settled for the first of his ten expeditions to the Russian North. In the course of his life he surveyed and recorded hundreds of architectural landmarks ranging from White Sea to Ukraine and Azerbaijan. In late 1920s, in the middle of anti-religious campaigns, he restored Saint Basil's Cathedral in Red Square, clearing the medieval landmark from alterations of later centuries. =Kolomenskoye= In 1924, Baranovsky persuaded the authorities to declare Kolomenskoye park a museum area, and became its first manager. From 1927 to 1934, he acquired and preserved wooden architecture from the Russian countryside, notably the House of Peter I which he brought from Arkhangelsk, the fortress tower of Sumskoy Ostrog on the White Sea, the Honey-Mead Brewery from , and others. Baranovsky personally surveyed, recorded and restored the local architecture of Kolomenskoye. In one case, he carefully demolished 19th-century alterations to the Church of Saint George in order to open access to the 16th century belltower. Today, the tower and refectory still stand separately. =Boldino museum and persecution= This section is based on materials of 2002 Baranovsky exhibition at the Moscow Museum of Architecture, collected by Maria Rogozina and Ulyana Chornovil The only way to defend religious buildings in Soviet Russia was to convert them into museums. In 1923, Baranovsky succeeded in declaring Boldinsky Monastery a branch of Dorogobuzh Museum. He and two local museum managers collected relics from other temples that were looted by Bolsheviks, and preserved the collection of Yelnya museum that was closed in 1926. Baranovsky realized the uncertainty of his museum, and hired photographer Mikhail Pogodin, grandson of Mikhail Pogodin, to document Boldino and its exhibits (1928‚Äì1929). Baranovsky-Pogodin archives present a particular branch of Orthodox art of Upper Dnieper, the boundary between Orthodox and Catholic worlds. In November 1929, authorities shut down the museum; its treasures are presumed lost, as is most of Pogodin's photography. In January 1930, they arrested Semyon Buzanov, the museum manager, who died in prison. Nikolai Savin, manager of Dorogobuzh museum, chose to flee his hometown; Pogodin lost his job as a \\"social alien\\". Baranovsky himself received a formal reprimand in 1931 but was arrested later, in 1934, accused of Anti-Soviet propaganda, and sentenced to an exile in Mariinsk, where he earned a \\"Siberian Camp Udarnik\\" badge. = Monastery in Moscow.= References * Russian biography: –ë—ã—á–∫–æ–≤, –Æ.–ê., \\"–ñ–∏—Ç–∏–µ –ü–µ—Ç—Ä–∞ –ë–∞—Ä–∞–Ω–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ\\", –ú., –°–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–∞—è –†–æ—Å—Å–∏—è, 1991 * Russian collection of selected works: –ü–µ—Ç—Ä –ë–∞—Ä–∞–Ω–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π, \\"–¢—Ä—É–¥—ã, –≤–æ—Å–ø–æ–º–∏–Ω–∞–Ω–∏—è —Å–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤\\", –°–æ—Å—Ç. –Æ. –ê. –ë—ã—á–∫–æ–≤, –û.–ü. –ë–∞—Ä–∞–Ω–æ–≤—Å–∫–∞—è, –í.–ê. –î–µ—Å—è—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤, –ê.–ú. –ü–æ–Ω–æ–º–∞—Ä–µ–≤, –ú., 1996 * Moscow Museum of Architecture: 2002 Baranovsky exhibition, official site * Kolomenskoye museum architecture,official site * Kolomenskoye museum architecture, best unofficial site * Andrei Rublev museum Category:1892 births Category:1984 deaths Category:People from Vyazemsky District, Smolensk Oblast Category:People from Vyazemsky Uyezd Category:Russian architects Category:Soviet architects ","title":"Pyotr Baranovsky"},{"id":"3633327","title":"List of Latin place names in Italy and Malta"},{"id":"3633330","text":"Displacement field may refer to: *Displacement field (mechanics) *Electric displacement field ","title":"Displacement field"},{"id":"3633344","text":"KRCD is a commercial FM radio station licensed to Inglewood, California, and broadcasting to Greater Los Angeles on 103.9 MHz.

KRCV and KRCD simulcast a Latin ballad radio format branded as \\"Recuerdo\\" or in English, \\"Memory.\\" The music focuses on the Californian soft regional, pop and ballad hits of the late 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s and up to 2011. The stations are owned by Univision Communications. The stations have studios located on Centre Drive (near I-405) in Westchester area of West Los Angeles. KRCD's transmitter is at a site in the Kenneth Hahn State Recreation Area in Baldwin Hills (mountain range).Radio-Locator.com/KRCD KRCV's transmitter is off Via Blanca in San Dimas near California State Route 57 (The Orange Freeway).Radio-Locator.com/KRCV History of 103.9 =KTYM-FM= On 14 February 1958, the station signed on as KTYM-FM.Broadcasting Yearbook 1972 page B-21 In its early days, 103.9 mostly simulcast co-owned AM 1460 KTYM. The stations were owned by Al J. Williams. Because KTYM was then a daytimer, required to be off the air at night, programming continued in the evening on KTYM-FM. In 1961, KTYM-FM began targeting Los Angeles' African-American community at night with R&B; and soul music. The first black Operations Manager on Los Angeles FM radio was Charles (Chuck) Johnson and Lonnie Cook was the first African-American program director on an FM station. KTYM-FM carried the AM station's programming by day. Then from sunset to midnight, the station aired black programming. Johnson had been a popular disc jockey at KPRS Kansas City and Cook was also from Kansas City. The format included R&B;, Doo Wop, and Blues. Floyd Ray, the owner of the first black Los Angeles record distributor and former big band leader, hosted one of the shows. Ron Johnson was the lone white DJ. At midnight, just before sign-off, the station played \\"Sugarloaf at Twilight\\" by Ahmad Jamal, who doubled as a station engineer. Many future celebrities made their debuts on the station including a police officer who would soon be the Mayor of Los Angeles, Tom Bradley. LaMonte McLemore was a member of The Intervals (the Doo Wop group that represented the station at promotional functions) and was the station photographer. He was the photographer of the center page models in Jet magazine and later was one of The 5th Dimension. KTYM-FM was noted for its independent approach to programming, and many times refused to air the designated \\"A\\" side of a record. It even played tunes like \\"Your Old Lady\\" by The Isley Brothers which had been banned from airplay in 1961. Cook featured the Doo Wop \\"B\\" side \\"Write to Me\\". AM 1230 KGFJ's Larry McCormick (brother to lead singer Charles from Bloodstone) heard the station making noise and getting attention with \\"Your Old Lady\\" and added it to his playlist and to his televised dance show. When Atlantic Records got calls for the 45 rpm record, the record label put it back on the market, earning a new hit song. =KAGB-FM and KACE= In 1973, Avant Garde Broadcasting acquired KTYM-FM and changed the call letters to KAGB-FM. For the next three and a half decades, 103.9 FM, which became KACE in 1976, played urban contemporary music. It became one of the premier stations for African American listeners in the Los Angeles area. In 1977, after Avant Gard√© was put into receivership, All Pro Broadcasting, owned by former Green Bay Packers defensive end Willie Davis and his wife Ann, acquired the newly renamed KACE. Some of the air personalities included Steve Woods, Lawrence Tanter, Pam Wells, Lisa Lipps, Ken Taylor, Hamilton Cloud, E.Z. Wiggins, Karla with a K, Mark Gunne, Antoinette Russell, Tommy T. (Thomas Turner) with Mike Mann, and Rico Reedie, along with news and public affairs personalities that included Ron Dungee, Sam Putineye, Mark Whitelocke, Isidra Person-Lynnie and Kevin A. Ross. For a three-year period, between 1988‚Äì90, the station featured nightclub-formatted music mix shows for every six days a week, with Southern California club DJ Elvin Bridges. In addition to being an on-air personality, Bridges created and produced his own weekday music mix show that aired during the afternoon rush hour he coined \\"Bumper To Bumper - In The Mix with Elvin Bridges\\", plus a weekly three-hour Saturday night party music mix show. \\"Let's Talk\\", \\"Speak Out\\", \\"Sunday Morning Live\\" and \\"The People's Connection\\" were popular community affairs talk shows. Production director Mark Drummond was also assistant program director during the Cox ownership years, and later worked on the production staffs at AM 640 KFI. KACE experimented with a hip- hop format in 1993 as \\"The People's Station, The New V103.9.\\" Because KACE was powered at only 3,000 watts, it added an Inland Empire simulcast, KAEV, which also broadcast at 103.9 The Variety (now KHTI). But the hip hop music was scaled back in October of that same year. Davis' company, responding to the political and social backlash against hip hop, announced an prohibition of the words \\"bitch,\\" \\"ho,\\" and \\"nigger\\" on air, and shifted to a \\"Positive Urban\\" format. However, this lowered ratings significantly. Davis flipped KACE to urban oldies and ended the simulcast with KAEV, switching it to modern rock as KCXX. (Another local station, 105.9, Power 106 KPWR, also banned the words, but did not change its rhythmic contemporary format.) In 1994, KACE was sold to Cox Radio for $11.3 millon.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1995 page B-41 Cox was then also the owner of 640 KFI and 103.5 KOST-FM. History of 98.3 On 18 November 1957, KDRC went on the air.Broadcasting Yearbook 1972 page B-31 It was owned by Pacific South Broadcasting with J. Kent Blanch√© and J. David Worthy as the principals. The studios were at 1415 West Garvey Avenue. In 1962, KDRC became KBOB, airing an easy listening format. By 1965, KBOB became co-owned with Daytimer KGRB (900 AM) in West Covina. Owner Robert Burdette ran a daytime simulcast based on a Big Bands format, featuring a somewhat small- market sound, for over twenty years. KBOB continued the format daily until midnight; Burdette also leased the FM KBOB to the University of LaVerne, for a while in the early 1980s. ULV ran the same Big Band format (but not simulcast) during daylight hours, using students and other volunteers as DJs. After Burdette's death, it became a dance music station. In 1993, it switched to Spanish contemporary music as KMQA, La Maquina. The station was powered at only 2,300 watts, targeting the San Gabriel Valley. The station was sold to San Gabriel Valley Radio Communications Corporation Ltd. for $3.2 million.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1995 page B-61 San Gabriel Valley Radio Communications Corporation switched 98.3 to a unique rock en espa√±ol format, becoming KRTO \\"Valle 98.3.\\" Shortly after Cox Radio bought KACE, it added KRTO to give KACE's programming better coverage in the eastern suburbs of Los Angeles. Cox paid $19 million for the 98.3 signal.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1999 page D-67 Simulcast In 1997, the two stations began simulcasting KACE's Urban AC format on two frequencies. In 1999, the stations added the nationally syndicated Tom Joyner Morning Show but ratings remained low. In 2000, Cox decided to leave the Los Angeles radio market. It traded 103.5 KOST and 640 KFI to a radio company known as AMFM (now part of iHeartMedia, Inc.) in exchange for several stations in Atlanta where Cox is headquartered. KACE/KRTO were sold to Hispanic Broadcasting Company (now part of Univision Communications through its Univision Radio subsidiary). The price tag for 103.9 in Inglewood and 98.3 in West Covina was $75 million.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2002-2003 page D-47 Once the sale was finalised, the stations flipped to an Spanish classic hits format, branded as \\"Recuerdo\\" or in English, \\"Memory.\\" KACE switched its call sign to KRCD while KRTO became KRCV. In recent years, the station has dropped most 60's and 70's music and is focused on the 80's to 2010. Both stations became affiliates of the Uforia Audio Network in 2019.

Born in Budapest into a musical family of Jewish heritage, Fischer initially studied piano, violin, cello and composition in Budapest. His older brother, √Åd√°m Fischer, became a conductor in his own right. He moved later to Vienna to study conducting with Hans Swarowsky at the University of Music and Performing Arts, where he also studied cello and early music, studying and working as assistant to Nikolaus Harnoncourt. He also studied with Franco Ferrara at the Accademia Musicale Chigiana in Siena. In 1976, Fischer won the Rupert Foundation conducting competition in London. He began thereafter to guest-conduct British orchestras such as the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, the BBC Symphony and the London Symphony Orchestra, with whom he conducted a world tour in 1982. His US conducting debut was with the Los Angeles Philharmonic in 1983. Budapest Festival Orchestra Fischer returned to Hungary in 1983 to found the Budapest Festival Orchestra (BFO), which initially was intended for a limited number of concerts a year on a part-time basis. The BFO became a permanent institution in 1992, with a schedule of about 30 weeks of performing a year. With the BFO, he has incorporated unorthodox ideas into practice, including allowing individual symphony musicians to contribute to concert programming, as in the \\"cocoa-concerts\\" for young children. Other series include the Titok-koncert (\\"bag of surprise\\") concert series where the programme is not announced, \\"one forint concerts\\" where he talks to the audience, open-air concerts in Budapest attracting tens of thousands of people, as well as concert opera performances. Fischer has founded several festivals, including a summer festival in Budapest on baroque music and the Budapest Mahlerfest which is also a forum for commissioning and presenting new music works. In addition, there is an annual competition from within the orchestra for soloist opportunities in concert. Fischer and the BFO have recorded commercially for Philips Classics and Channel Classics Records. Iv√°n Fischer accolades for teachers. In the second part he conducts Johannes Brahms: Hungarian Dances no. 17 during the libre T√©rt√°nc event, 2018 Other symphonic work and opera In the US, Fischer held the position of Principal Guest Conductor of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra for seven years.

Its aim was to make the orchestra's concerts into significant events in Hungary's musical life, and to give Budapest a new symphony orchestra of international standing. History Between 1992 and 2000, extending its work to a full season, the ensemble operated under the aegis of the Budapest Municipality and the new BFO Foundation, formed by fifteen Hungarian and multinational corporations and banks. From the 2000/2001 season onwards the orchestra was operated by the BFO Foundation, which the Budapest City Council regularly supports under a contract renewable every five years. In 2003 the Ministry of Cultural Heritage declared the orchestra a national institution supported by the state. The Festival Orchestra is now part of Budapest's music life and a frequent guest at venues including: Salzburg (Summer Festival), Vienna (Musikverein, Konzerthaus), Lucerne (Festival), Montreux, Z√ºrich (Tonhalle), New York (Carnegie Hall, Avery Fisher Hall), Chicago, Los Angeles (Hollywood Bowl), San Francisco, Montreal, Tokyo (Suntory Hall), Hong Kong, Paris (Th√©√¢tre des Champs-Elys√©es), Berlin, Munich, Frankfurt (Alte Oper), London (BBC Proms Festival, Barbican Centre, Royal Festival Hall), Florence (Maggio Musicale), Rome (Accademia di Santa Cecilia), Amsterdam (Concertgebouw), Madrid, Athens, Copenhagen, Prague (Prague Spring International Music Festival), Brussels (Flamish Festival) and Buenos Aires (Teatro Col√≥n). After having recorded on Hungaroton, Quintana, Teldec, Decca Records, Ponty and Berlin Classics, the orchestra signed an exclusive recording contract with Philips Classics in 1996. Its recording of Bart√≥k's The Miraculous Mandarin received the Gramophone Award, while Diapason d'Or and Le Monde de la musique chose it as their recording of the year. Recordings of Liszt's Faust Symphony and Bart√≥k's Concerto for Orchestra were chosen among the year's five best orchestral discs by Gramophone. In 2003 the BFO signed a cooperation agreement with Channel Classics Records. Musicians who have performed with the orchestra include: Sir Georg Solti (who was the orchestra's honorary guest conductor until his death), Yehudi Menuhin, Kurt Sanderling, Eliahu Inbal, Charles Dutoit, Gidon Kremer, S√°ndor V√©gh, Andr√°s Schiff, Heinz Holliger, Agnes Baltsa, Ida Haendel, Martha Argerich, Hildegard Behrens, Yuri Bashmet, Rudolf Barshai, Kiri te Kanawa, Radu Lupu, Thomas Zehetmair, Vadim Repin, Helen Donath, Richard Goode. Among the orchestra's more important projects, its opera productions have been widely acclaimed: The Magic Flute (Budapest), Cos√¨ fan tutte (Athens), Idomeneo (Budapest/Athens), Orfeo ed Euridice (Budapest/Brussels), Il turco in Italia (Paris), the cycle of works marking the 50th anniversary of Bart√≥k's death (Budapest/Brussels/Cologne/Paris/New York), the cycle of Mahler symphonies over several years (Budapest/Lisbon/Frankfurt/Vienna), the series of performances for the centenary of Brahms' death, a Bart√≥k-Stravinsky cycle (Edinburgh/London/San Francisco/New York) and a Liszt-Wagner cycle in January 2004 (Budapest/Bruselles/London). In 2005 the orchestra launched its annual Budapest Mahlerfest. The orchestra has performed many world and Hungarian premieres (Ustvolskaia, E√∂tv√∂s, Kurt√°g, Sch√∂nberg, Holliger, Tihanyi, Dor√°ti, Copland, Adams). The orchestra regularly commissions new works (Jeney, S√°ry, Lendvay, Vajda, M√°rtha, Melis, Vidovszky, Tihanyi, Orb√°n, L√°ng, Gy√∂ngy√∂si). The orchestra has developed regular chamber music and chamber orchestra series alongside its major orchestral concerts. The Sunday afternoon chamber music events, the \\"Cocoa Concerts\\" for young children, the Haydn-Mozart series, where soloists of the concertos are members of the orchestra and the \\"Open Dress Rehearsals\\" with Iv√°n Fischer's introductions to the works being performed have all quickly become favourites of the Budapest music audience. In November 2008, the Gramophone magazine selected the BFO into the world's 20 best orchestras as No. 9. Ever since its foundation, the BFO's Music Director has been Iv√°n Fischer.

It is a phospholipid that resides on the plasma membrane. Discovery In 1988, Lewis C. Cantley published a paper describing the discovery of a novel type of phosphoinositide kinase with the unprecedented ability to phosphorylate the 3' position of the inositol ring resulting in the formation of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P). Working independently, Alexis Traynor-Kaplan and coworkers published a paper demonstrating that a novel lipid, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate (PIP3) occurs naturally in human neutrophils with levels that increased rapidly following physiologic stimulation with chemotactic peptide. Subsequent studies demonstrated that in vivo the enzyme originally identified by Cantley's group prefers PtdIns(4,5)P2 as a substrate, producing the product PIP3.  Function  PIP3 functions to activate downstream signaling components, the most notable one being the protein kinase AKT, which activates downstream anabolic signaling pathways required for cell growth and survival. PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is dephosphorylated by the phosphatase PTEN on the 3 position, generating PI(4,5)P2, and by SHIPs (SH2-containing inositol phosphatase) on the 5' position of the inositol ring, producing PI(3,4)P2. The PH domain in a number of proteins binds to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Such proteins include Akt/PKB, PDK1, Btk1, and ARNO. The generation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 at the plasma membrane upon the activation of class I PI 3-kinases causes these proteins to translocate to the plasma membrane and affects their activity accordingly. In many types of eukaryotic cells, the production of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and recruitment of PH domain proteins to the membrane results in localized actin polymerization, leading to cellular protrusions that are important for cell migration, division, and phagocytosis. The PH domain allows binding between PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs). This enhances the binding of the GRK to the plasma membrane.

He was married to Eliza Zilg in 1885 and they had two children. Career After a move to Stromsburg, Polk County, Nebraska, in 1881, Shallenberger became a clerk, a banker and a rancher. He moved to Alma, Harlan County, Nebraska in 1887 and founded the Bank of Alma. He was first elected to the 57th United States Congress but failed to be reelected in 1902. According to Southwest Virginia folklore, in 1902 Shallenberger, Alma Journal editor H. S. Wetherald, and carriage dealer Frank Griggsby, were startled by the apparition of a Woman in Black. His first attempt at the Governorship came in 1906, running under a Fusion label of the state Democratic and Populist parties, where he lost to Republican George L. Sheldon. He was then elected governor in 1908, defeating Sheldon in a narrowly won rematch. Shallenberger served from 1909 to 1911, his tenure included the adoption of the State Guarantee of Deposits Law and the \\"Oregon Plan\\", a direct primary bill regarding the election of United States Senators. He lost an attempt at a second term in 1910, losing in the Democratic primary to James Charles Dahlman. Unsuccessful in running for Senate from Nebraska in 1912, Shallenberger was elected a congressman to the 64th and 65th congresses (1915‚Äì1919), but was unsuccessful in being reelected to the 66th in 1918. He was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1920, and was elected to the 68th, 69th, and 70th congresses from 1923 to 1929.

Barnsdall, February 28, 1917 As a young woman Barnsdall toured Europe with her father, developing an interest in feminism and radical causes. By 1913 she was producing experimental theater in Chicago. She's mentioned in Emma Goldman's autobiography Living My Life as a close friend who wrote out a $5000 check to ease Goldman's deportation to Russia.Emma Goldman, Living My Life In February 1917, her father died, leaving her half of the assets of the Barnsdall Oil Company. By some accounts she received $3 million. On August 19, 1917, she became an unmarried mother by design, a scandalous choice for the time. Her daughter was born in Seattle, took her mother's surname, and was known as \\"Sugartop\\".Brendan Gill, Many Masks Also in 1917 she produced a season of Los Angeles Little Theater, engaging a young Norman Bel Geddes as set designer.Norman Bel Geddes, Miracle in the Evening She hired Frank Lloyd Wright to design a home for her and a vaguely defined \\"progressive theatrical community\\". This commission ultimately became the landmark Hollyhock House. Barnsdall bought the local Olive Hill property in 1919. Construction began in 1919 continuing until she fired Wright in 1921. Almost immediately, she began plans to give it away. Extensive correspondence between Barnsdall and Wright in these years shows a close, sympathetic relationship. Finally, though, she grew very unhappy with the house's impracticalities and staggering cost overruns. Another longstanding feature of Olive Hill was Barnsdall's news-billboards meant to educate Angeleans about the Thomas Mooney case, the candidacy of Upton Sinclair for Governor of California, and her other causes. She was a guiding force and important financial contributor for the Hollywood Bowl, and a patron of architects Richard Neutra, Rudolph Schindler, and photographer Edmund Teske among others. Through the 1930s and 1940s, she continued to live on Olive Hill. She died in 1946. References Alice T.

It is primarily known as Pensacola Street throughout its path, due to its generally westward course toward the Florida city of Pensacola, although an eastbound section is known as St. Augustine Road, heading toward St. Augustine. Route description Turning onto westbound West Jefferson Street from S Monroe St/US 27, the route cuts southwest around the Florida State Capitol. Route 366 then transfers to W Pensacola St, heading one-way westbound. It passes by the Donald L. Tucker Center and the southern edge of Florida State University's main campus. This segment is dominated by fraternity and sorority houses, campus ministries, and several other houses and apartments. Along the same stretch, W St. Augustine Rd serves as the one-way eastbound carrier of Route 366, two blocks to the south of Pensacola St. The land use is nearly identical to that of Pensacola St, and after being routed slightly to the southeast onto W Madison St, 366 passes the south side of the Tucker Center and the main offices of the Seminoles' basketball program. After passing several blocks of parking lots and government buildings, SR 366 dead ends at SR 61/S Monroe St. To the west, Pensacola Street's path is cut off by Florida State's Doak Campbell Stadium, so SR 366 bypasses the stadium to the south via Stadium Dr, crossing W Gaines St/Lake Bradford Rd/SR 371 before turning to the north and again becoming Pensacola Street after a left hand turn on the west side of the stadium. Restaurants and other businesses dominate this stretch of Pensacola Street, as well as apartment complexes and other housing. Further to the west, there are several municipal services, including the Leon County School Board and a fire department training center, as well as a homeless shelter. SR 366 forms the southern boundary of Tallahassee Community College's main campus. It then passes over a line of CSX Transportation's railroad before meeting its western terminus at SR 20.

It carries the sense of a combination of physical gestures and \\"gist\\" or attitude. It is a means by which \\"an attitude or single aspect of an attitude\\" is revealed, insofar as it is \\"expressible in words or actions.\\"Willett (1964, 42). Gestus, as the embodiment of an attitude, carries at least two distinct meanings in Brecht's theatre: first, the uncovering or revealing of the motivations and transactions that underpin a dramatic exchange between the characters; and second, the \\"epic\\" narration of that character by the actor (whether explicitly or implicitly). In the first sense, that of anatomizing the character, a Gestus reveals a specific aspect of a character: rather than his metaphysical, subconscious or other psychological dimensions, a Gestus makes visible a character's social relations and the causality of his behaviour, as interpreted from an historical materialist perspective. \\"Every emotion\\" when treated under the rubric of Gestus, Elizabeth Wright comments, \\"manifests itself as a set of social relations.\\"Wright (1989, 27). \\"For it is what happens between people\\", Brecht says, \\"that provides them with all the material that they can discuss, criticize, alter.\\"Brecht (1949, 200). In the second sense, the actor's attitude as embodied in acting as an act of epic narration (the 'showing' that is 'shown' in the 'showing', in Brecht's turn of phrase), Brecht refers to the \\"political\\" basis from which an actor interprets his role and its place within the storytelling scheme of the production as a whole. \\"[T]he choice of viewpoint is also a major element of the actor's art, and it has to be decided outside the theatre\\" Brecht writes in his \\"A Short Organum.\\"Brecht (1949, 196). In this sense of the clarification and embodiment of a particular interpretative perspective, Gestus is related to Brecht's other important practical tool, the Fabel. A Gestus is not a clich√© or \\"rubber stamp\\"; the actor develops a character's Gestus through a process of exploration of concrete physical behaviour and according to a principle of selective realism. The post-Brechtian German theatre practitioner Heiner M√ºller (who ran Brecht's Berliner Ensemble for a short while) argues that \\"[r]eflecting the actions through the figures, mentally as well as emotionally, also has the character of citation. The citation geste (Gestus) must not diminish the intensity and spontaneity of reactions. Identification in the details with estrangement of the whole.\\"M√ºller (1978, 177).

It formed part of New Zealand's national rail network for over a century: construction began in 1864, Kingston was reached in 1878, and it closed in 1979. For much of its life, it was considered a secondary main line rather than a branch line, and in its earlier years, it was sometimes known as the \\"Great Northern Railway\\". Today, the southern portion now forms a part of the Wairio Branch and the northernmost 14 kilometres was used by the Kingston Flyer. Construction The Kingston Branch was built to be a main line north from Invercargill to improve communications through the Southland region, and to provide a link to the Central Otago gold fields. The provincial government of Southland was not very wealthy, and for this reason, a proposal claiming that the railway would be cheaper if built with wooden rails was accepted. A 12-kilometre line between Invercargill and Makarewa was opened on 18 October 1864, and the unsuitability of the wooden tracks became obvious quickly. Unlike most railway lines in New Zealand, this route was built to the international standard gauge of , and in June 1866 the decision was made to convert to iron rails. This conversion was performed at the same time as the line was extended to Winton and it opened on 22 February 1871. This proved to be the farthest extent of the gauge in Southland, and further lines were built to the nationally accepted narrow gauge of . The first portion of the Kingston Branch built to the new gauge was from Winton to Caroline, which opened on 20 October 1875, two months before the rest of the line to Invercargill was converted to the new gauge, on 20 December. The locomotives and rolling stock were now surplus and sold to the government of New South Wales in Australia, but the ship on which they were carried was wrecked in Westland and thus the trains never made it to Australia. Beyond Caroline, construction was swift. The railway opened to Lumsden on 7 February 1876 and then Lowther on 15 January 1877, Athol on 20 January 1878, and finally Kingston on 10 July 1878, some 140 kilometres from Invercargill. In February 1879, a steamboat connection on Lake Wakatipu was established, from Kingston to Queenstown. Stations The following stations were on the Kingston Branch (in brackets is the distance from Invercargill): *Grasmere (3 km) *Waikiwi (4 km) *Lorneville (7 km) *Linds Bridge (10 km) *Makarewa (12 km) *Ryal Bush (15 km) *Wilson's Crossing (18 km) *Lochiel (23 km) *Thomsons (26 km) *Gap Road (29 km) *Winton (30 km) *Lady Barkly (35 km) *Limehills (37 km) *Ords (39 km) *Centre Bush (41 km) *Pukearuhe (45 km) *Kauana (46 km) *Benmore (51 km) *Dipton (58 km) *Caroline (66 km) *Josephville (72 km) *Lumsden (79 km) *Lowther (89 km) *Five Rivers (93 km) *Eyre Creek (98 km) *Parawa (105 km) *Athol (110 km) *Nokomai (118 km) *Garston (120 km) *Fairlight (126 km) *Kingston (140 km) =Junctions= Three stations on the Kingston Branch were junctions with other lines: Makarewa: *Tuatapere (Orawia) Branch (along which was the junction with the Wairio Branch) Winton: *Hedgehope (Browns) Branch Lumsden: *Waimea Plains Railway to the Main South Line in Gore *Mossburn Branch Operation In the early days of the line, trains operated six days a week, with a return service to Kingston and another in the afternoon as far as Lumsden. When the Waimea Plains Railway opened, it was privately owned and competed with the Kingston Branch, and this, along with the effects of the Long Depression, meant services were reduced to operating on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays only for three years. In 1883, the daily trains were back, and when the Waimea Plains Railway was purchased and incorporated into the national network, services were further re-organised. Besides the daily \\"mixed\\" services that carried both passengers and freight, five passenger expresses a week ran from Kingston: two used the whole line to Invercargill, while three left it in Lumsden to travel through the Waimea Plains. These passenger services were the first \\"Kingston Flyer\\". When reviews of all of New Zealand's branch railways were conducted in 1930 and 1952, the Kingston route was considered a mainline and therefore not assessed. After a railcar service was briefly considered in the 1930s, regular passenger services were cancelled, though seasonal excursions and holiday trains ran for another two decades. The last one ran in Easter 1957, and passenger trains were a very rare sight on the Kingston line in the 1960s. Not long before the seasonal excursions ended, so did another service: the Friday mixed train between Invercargill and Lumsden ceased running in November 1956. The line then settled into a pattern of daily freight trains from Lumsden to Invercargill and return, augmented by a twice-weekly service onwards to Kingston. Traffic on the section from Lumsden to Kingston was in serious decline by 1970, but a revival in traffic came when New Zealand Railways made a surprise announcement that it would be operating a heritage train from Lumsden to Kingston re-using the \\"Kingston Flyer\\" name. Two AB class locomotives were employed to operate the train, which commenced on 21 December 1971, two months after regular steam workings had ceased. Two return trips were run a day from December to April and they proved to be wildly popular, carrying over 30,000 passengers per season. Freight was carried on the first train to Kingston and last to Lumsden. Sadly, the line between Lumsden and Garston was damaged by flooding in February 1979 and the last Kingston Flyer from Garston ran not long afterwards, on 17 April. The last goods train to Kingston, hauled by DJ 1228, ran on 22 November.Southland Times, 23 Nov. 1979 Official closure of the line between Lumsden and Garston came on 26 November 1979. For the next three years the Kingston Flyer ran elsewhere but in 1982 it came back to Kingston. There were initially plans to operate it all the way to Garston, but these were later changed to Fairlight and the six kilometres between Garston and Fairlight was closed. The 14 kilometres between Fairlight and Kingston is still open for the Kingston Flyer. There are proposals to relay track back to Garston as the rail corridor is still designated for rail use.Lakes District Council/draft plan - Kingston South of Lumsden, the Kingston Branch was busy with trains heading to the Mossburn Branch with materials for various development schemes, the most prominent being the Manapouri hydro scheme. Once this traffic ceased the line became very quiet, with just two trains a week in its last year of existence. On 13 December 1982, the line from Makarewa to Lumsden closed, the same day as the Mossburn Branch. The 12-kilometre section from Invercargill to Makarewa remains open, incorporated into the Wairio Branch. The branch today The two ends of what was once considered to be a mainline remain open, while the large middle section's relics have disappeared with time and the impacts of development. For example, the triangular platform at Makarewa that once served Kingston and the Wairio Branch, as well as the large Freezing Works, disappeared sometime between 1995 and 1998. The last rails in the yard lifted when the freezing works were demolished. From here to Winton the formation has been completely obliterated due to intensive dairy farming. From Winton to Centre Bush, little remains except for the formation and the occasional minor bridge; the first goods shed still standing is located at the site of the old Centre Bush yard. Well-preserved remnants can be found in Lumsden, including the water tower, a little trestle bridge, and the station building that is now used as a tourist centre. From just north of Lumsden to Fairlight the Around the Mountains Cycle Trail mostly follows the old railway line. In Lowther, the loading bank remains, and not too far away some rails are embedded in the old level crossing site on Ellis Road. Another level crossing is intact in Athol, and one of the farthest north relics of the line is found just outside Garston, the old combined road/rail bridge. Just south of Garston the old goods shed can be seen against the bottom of a hill, where it was moved to after the line's closure. At the old Fairlight bridge crossing the line becomes live as the southern terminal of the Kingston Flyer Ltd's vintage railway. The old line is reasonably easy to follow on Google Earth Satellite view.

Formed in 1996, the band released three EPs and one full-length album from 1996-2003. After going through several lineup changes (mainly several drummers and bassists), the band eventually split up in 2003. After a seven-year break, four of the five founding members reformed the band in 2010. History Skycamefalling formed in 1996 and self-released a four-song demo cassette entitled A Penny For Your Confessions. The demo went on to sell over a thousand copies and the band was contacted by Belgian record label Good Life Recordings, whom the band had sent a demo tape addressed to the owner Edward Verhaeghe. Early influences include Converge, Cave In, Glassjaw, and Pantera. The band entered Brass Giraffe studios in New York City in May 1998 to begin recording their label debut EP. Recording ended in June that year, and To Forever Embrace The Sun was released in 1998. After the release, the band quickly began establishing a fanbase in both the United States as well as Europe and Tzompanakis formed his own record label, One Day Savior Recordings. By the year 2000, their relationship with Good Life had soured and Skycamefalling signed with New Jersey-based record label Ferret Music. 10.21, the band's only full-length album, was released in November 2000 through Ferret and was well received by both fans and critics. Touring relentlessly for nearly two years as well as a brief stint on Warped Tour, Skycamefalling decided to go their separate ways, citing a lack of interest being the main reason. The band played two final Long Island shows at the Local Seven (one under the name Embrace The Sun in which the band played To Forever Embrace The Sun from start to finish) as well as their last show at Hellfest in the summer of 2003. Their final self-titled EP, released posthumously in 2003, left their fans with two final songs (\\"Thera\\" and \\"The Elephant Graveyard\\"). These tracks were early, rough recordings for songs that were to be on 10.21 but since the band was breaking up, they gave Ferret Music the rights to release the songs because of left-over debt that the band had yet to fulfill. In 2003 guitarist Cameron Keym formed The Sleeping along with bassist Sal Mignano and drummer Joe Zizzo. Christopher Tzompanakis, Matt Woisin, and Rob Holohan formed Farewell Tide which disbanded shortly after formation. Christopher Tzompanakis went on to briefly front Spectators before reforming Farewell Tide in mid-2009 with Brian Parker, Skycamefalling's original drummer. In 2011 Christopher Tzompanakis joined the Long Island band Divider. =Reunion= Four of the bands founding members, with the exception of John Clerkin, reunited the band in early 2010. The first reunion show was supposed to take place at the Long Island Fest 2010. However, just before the show, the guitarist injured his hand and the band was forced to postpone the reunion show. Skycamefalling and Long Island Fest issued an apology to fans and stated intentions to play the show later in 2010. The band did however reform, with the lineup mentioned above, at Long Island Fest 2011 and went on to perform at Webster Hall in July 2011 with Harvest & Burnt By The Sun. They later announced a tenth anniversary weekend of their album 10.21 with Long Island's Incendiary in October 2011. The band played 10.21 in its entirely on 10/21/2011 along with shows in both Poughkeepsie, NY & Warren, NJ.

Typically, a user ascends or descends the campus board using only their hands. Campus boards can take a variety of different forms and may incorporate a variety of materials. As one example, a campus board may comprise horizontal thin slats or rails of wood attached to an inclined board in a ladderlike configuration. However, some implementations may utilize bolt on climbing holds or sections of pipe. A campus board is generally set at overhanging angle of inclination that is between vertical and 20 degrees. One consideration for selecting the angle of inclination is the avoidance of any interference that may result between the user's legs and the campus board or wall. The campus board was invented by Wolfgang G√ºllich in 1988 while he was training for a new route, Action Directe, which requires extreme dynamic finger strength. The first campus board was hung at a university in a gym called The Campus Centre. Hence the term \\"campus\\" has been applied to the name of the training board, training method, and style of climbing, or \\"campusing\\" in which only the user's hands and arms are used. In French and in Italian, the campus board is referred to as pan G√ºllich. There are a variety of training approaches that may be used with a campus board, but all of them are centered around the concept of Plyometrics training. As one example, a user may alternate the use of specific fingers to increase finger strength when ascending or descending the board. As another example, upper-body strength may be increased by utilizing large lunges between specific rails or holds of the campus board (Power throws). Reactive training may be used to increase muscle recruitment rates by dynamically moving between the campus board rails simultaneously with one or both hands. Training on a campus board may result in better performance due to the improvement of motor training, increased finger strength on a variety of grips, and greater power and lock-off strength of the arms. The campus board has been a topic of controversy especially for newer climbers, as it risks causing injuries to the climber due to improper technique or fatigue. As such, the campus board is usually never recommended to climbers who are new to climbing.

Magnitizdat was the main method by which the songs of Russian bards such as Bulat Okudzhava, Vladimir Vysotsky and Alexander Galich or punk bands like Grazhdanskaya Oborona made their way around the Soviet Union and abroad.

The band had gone through numerous line-up changes over the years, but singer Ryan Kepke and Joe Nixon (drums) performed on every release, while Jeremiah Brown (bass) played on all except their final album, Far From Nowhere. This was their first release without Tooth and Nail Records. Far From Nowhere was released on SideOneDummy Records in the summer of 2003. The band was particularly successful in the Christian punk scene in the late 1990s and early 2000s and toured alongside their peers, both secular and Christian (most notably bands such as Face to Face and MxPx, respectively). They also played certain legs of the Vans Warped Tour in 2003.  2004-2008  Since touring in 2003 and early 2004 in support of Far From Nowhere, Slick Shoes was very inactive (even their website was taken down), and on October 7, 2006 the band issued a statement through their MySpace page saying that they had begun a side project called Sigmund, and that Slick Shoes was on an \\"indefinite hiatus\\". Then, 15 months later on January 3, 2008, the band announced through MySpace that they had reunited:Slick Shoes Reunion blog post at MySpace \\"Hey Everyone, Good news. Slick Shoes is back together with original members Ryan Kepke, Jackson Mould, Joe Nixon, and Jeremiah Brown. We also added guitarist Jordan Mould . Although we will not be touring extensively we will be playing shows and hope to record a new record in the near future. Don't forget to tell your friends.\\"  Post-2017  Their first show back together took place at Schooner's in Lancaster, CA in December, 2007, with their last show at the Key Club in Hollywood, CA on April 10, 2008. The band has been inactive since early 2008, but in October 2011, the band created an official Facebook page. On December 11, 2011, the band announced a comeback show on March 17, 2012 at Chain Reaction in Anaheim, California. On February 17‚Äì18, Slick shoes did a two night stand in Dallas Texas at the legendary Tree's Venue. As of early 2017 Slick Shoes is back in action with original \\"Rusty\\" line up (as well as Jonah from the Far from Nowhere Era). They are playing select shows through the year and are currently writing and rehearsing new material. On August 18, 2018, Slick Shoes headlined a show at the House of Blues Anaheim Parish Room. They announced that the show was being recorded for their first live album. October 24, 2019, Slick Shoes Announced they were rejoining Tooth and Nail Records with \\"Broadcasting Live\\" and a new album, \\"Rotation & Frequency\\", released in September 2020. Style and influences Slick Shoes has been described as punk rock, pop punk, and skate punk. Slick Shoes has been compared to MxPx, Blink-182 and Green Day. The band's influences include Germs, Descendents, Lagwagon, Angelic Upstarts and Circle Jerks.

It is a type of projecting oriel window enclosed with carved wood latticework located on the upper floors of a building, sometimes enhanced with stained glass. It was traditionally used to catch and passively cool the wind; jars and basins of water were placed in it to cause evaporative cooling. It has been used since the Middle Ages and up to the 20th century. It is most commonly used on the street side of the building; however, it may also be used internally on the sahn (courtyard) side. The term \\"\\" is sometimes used of similar lattices elsewhere, for instance in a takhtabush. There is a difference between Mashrabiya and Rawshan as recorded in many studies. This research extends Hasan Fathy‚Äôs (1986) principle of vernacular architecture by focusing on the Rawshan through an investigation of two criteria: aesthetics and energy efficiency. The paper discusses the views of both the Saudi public and key decision-makers on reviving vernacular architecture in the context of Saudi Arabia‚Äôs rapidly developing economy, characterized by relatively high rates of energy consumption and CO2 emissions. This research explores (a) the interaction in domestic buildings of Saudi occupants with their windows, and how these are perceived as an interface with the external environment; (b) awareness and knowledge of the use of shading elements (such as Rawshans) to reduce the use of artificial lighting while maintaining indoor privacy; (c) Saudi awareness of, and familiarity with, the Rawshan as a vernacular element and a secular architectural tradition; and (d) Saudi views on the revival of traditional architectural elements with a focus on the Rawshan. An online survey (n = 812) was conducted across Saudi Arabia complemented by interviews with expert decision-makers (n = 23) to (a) assess criteria such as privacy, aesthetics, daylight, ventilation, and energy consumption in Saudi residences and (b) investigate the level of acceptance of an optimized retrofitted Rawshan design. Etymology The term mashrabiya is derived from the triliteral root ≈†-R-B, which generally denotes drinking or absorbing. There are two theories for its name: : The more common theory is that the term was derived from the Arabic word, sharaba (meaning to drink) because the space was used for a small wooden shelf where the drinking water pots were stored. The shelf was enclosed by wood and located at the window in order to keep the water cool. Later on, this shelf evolved until it became part of the room with a full enclosure and retained the name despite the radical change in use.doi:10.3390/buildings10090151 : The less common theory is that the name was originally mashrafiya, derived from the verb shrafa, meaning to overlook or to observe. During the centuries, the name slowly changed because of sound change and the influence of other languages. In some parts of the Arab world, a mashrabiya may be known as a tarima, r≈´shƒÅn or a shanasheel.Saeed, M., A Portal in Space, University of Texas Press, 2016, p. 23 History Mashrabiya of left A residential street in historic Cairo lined with houses fronted by mashrabiya balconies (19th-century photograph) The date of their origin is unknown; however, the earliest evidence of the mashrabiya in its current form dates back to the 12th century in Baghdad, during the Abbasid period.Abdullah, R.A.J. andc Abadi, E., Merchants, Mamluks, and Murder: The Political Economy of Trade in Eighteenth-Century Basra, SUNY Press, 2001, p. 23 The mashrabiyas that remain in Middle Eastern cities were mostly built during the late 19th century and early-to-mid-20th century, but some mashrabiyas are three to four hundred years old. An extant example of an ancient residence incorporating mashrabiya is the Bayt al-Razzaz, a two-storey mansion dating to the Mamluk period in Cairo.Williams, C., Islamic Monuments in Cairo: The Practical Guide, American University in Cairo Press, 2008, p. 89 In Iraq during the 1920s and 1930s, the designs of the latticework were influenced by the Art Nouveau and Art Deco movements of the time. Mashrabiyas, along with other distinct features of historic Islamic architecture, were being demolished as part of a modernisation program across the Arab world from the first decades of the 20th-century.Pieri, C., \\"Baghdad 1921-1958.

Al-Nashra, vol. 8, no 1-2, pp.69-93, 2006 In Baghdad, members of the arts community feared that vernacular architecture would be lost permanently and took steps to preserve them.Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq, University of California Press, 1991, p. 95 The architect, Rifat Chadirji and his father, Kamil, photographed structures and monuments across Iraq and the Saudi region, and published a book of photographs.Chadirji, R., The Photographs of Kamil Chadirji: Social Life in the Middle East, 1920-1940, London, I.B. Tauris, 1995 The artist and educator, Lorna Selim, sketched these buildings with their decorative mashrabiya, and took her students at Baghdad's Institute of Architecture into Baghdad's alleyways and riverfronts to sketch vernacular structures in order to appreciate their importance.Selim, L., in correspondence with website by author of Memories of Eden, Online: Such initiatives have contributed to a renewed interest in traditional practices as a means of building sustainable residences in harsh climatic conditions.Edwards, B., Sibley, M., Land, P. and Hakmi, M. (eds), Courtyard Housing: Past, Present and Future, Taylor & Francis, 2006, p. 242 Construction Latticework at Bayt Al-Suhaymi house in Cairo, Egypt Traditionally, houses are built of adobe, brick or stone or a combination. Wooden houses are not popular and hardly ever found. Building heights in urban setting range from two to five floors (although Yemeni houses can reach up to seven floors) with the mashrabiyas on the second level and above. The roofs are usually built using wooden or steel beams with the areas between filled with brick in a semi vault style. These beams were extended over the street, enlarging the footprint of the upper floor. The upper floor is then enclosed with latticework and roofed with wood. The projection is cantilevered and does not bear the weight of traditional building materials. There are different types of mashrabiyas, and the latticework designs differ from region to region. Most mashrabiyas are closed where the latticework is lined with stained glass and part of the mashrabiya is designed to be opened like a window, often sliding windows to save space; in this case the area contained is part of the upper floor rooms hence enlarging the floor plan. Some mashrabiyas are open and not lined with glass; the mashrabiya functions as a balcony and the space enclosed is independent of the upper floor rooms and accessed through those rooms with windows opening towards it. Sometimes the woodwork is reduced making the mashrabiya resemble a regular roofed balcony; this type of mashrabiya is mostly used if the house is facing an open landscape such as a river, a cliff below or simply a farm, rather than other houses.Abdel-Gawad, A., Veiling Architecture: Decoration of Domestic Buildings in Upper Egypt 1672-1950, American University in Cairo Press, 2012, pp 6-10 Early morning in 1967 on the Strait Street in Valletta showing its many \\"gallariji\\". Occurrences Mashrabiyas were mostly used in houses and palaces although sometimes in public buildings such as hospitals, inns, schools and government buildings. They tend to be associated with houses of the urban elite classes. They are found mostly in the Mashriq ‚Äì i.e. the eastern part of the Arab world, but some types of similar windows are also found in the Maghreb (the western part of the Arab world). They are very prevalent in Iraq, Iran, the Levant, Hejaz and Egypt. In Basra, where they are very prevalent, they are known as shanasheel (or shanashil) to the extent that Basra is often called \\"the city of Shanashil.\\" Some 400 traditional buildings are still standing in Basra.Jameel, K., \\"In 'city of shanasheel', Iraqi heritage crumbles from budgetary neglect,\\" 'Ruwah, 27 March 2018 Online: In Malta, mashrabiyas are quite common, especially in dense urban areas (see main article at muxrabija). They are usually made from wood and include glass windows, but there are also variations made from stone or aluminium. They could possibly originate from around the tenth century during the Arab occupation of the islands. The modern word for it in the Maltese language is \\"gallarija\\", which is of Italic origin.http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2008-04-09/news/mysteries-of- the-maltese-gallarija-1-206018/ Recognised as being the predecessors of the iconic closed balcony, or \\"gallarija\\", in 2016 Maltese authorities scheduled a total of 36 ancient mashrabiyas as Grade 2 protected properties. Utilisation Cairo streetscape showing residential buildings with mashrabiya from Around the world with Philip Phillips, \\"the singing pilgrim\\" 1887 =Social= One of the major purposes of the mashrabiya is privacy, an essential aspect of Arab and Muslim culture. From the mashrabiya window, occupants can obtain a good view of the street without being seen. The mashrabiya was an integral part of Arab lifestyle. Typically, people did not sleep in any assigned room, rather they would take their mattresses and move to areas that offered the greatest comfort according to the seasons: to the mashrabiya (or shanashil) in winter, to the courtyard in spring or to vaulted basements in summer.Viorst, M., Sandcastles: The Arabs in Search of the Modern World, Syracuse University Press, 1995, p. 8; Tabbaa, Y. and Mervin, S., Najaf, the Gate of Wisdom, UNESCO, 2014, p. 69 =Environment= This qulla might be placed in a mashrabiya for passive cooling The wooden screen with openable windows gives shade and protection from the hot summer sun, while allowing the cool air from the street to flow through. The designs of the latticework usually have smaller openings in the bottom part and larger openings in the higher parts, hence causing the draft to be fast above the head and slow in lower parts. This provides a significant amount of air moving in the room without causing it to be uncomfortable. The air-conditioning properties of the window is typically enhanced by placing jars of water in the area, allowing air to be cooled by evaporative cooling as it passes over the jars.Vakilinezhad, R., Mofidi, M and Mehdizadeh, S., \\"Shanashil: A sustainable element to balance light, view, and thermal comfort,\\" International Journal of Environmental Sustainability, vol. 8, 2013 The projection of the mashrabiya achieves several purposes: it allows air from three sides to enter, even if the wind outside is blowing parallel to the house fa√ßade; it serves the street, and in turn the neighborhood, as a row of projected mashrabiyas provides shelter for those in the streets from rain or sun. The shade in normally narrow streets will cool the air in the street and increase the pressure as opposed to the air in the sahn, which is open to the sun making it more likely that air would flow towards the sahn through the rooms of the house; the mashrabiya also provides protection and shade for the ground floor windows that are flat and usually unprotected.Almusaed, A., Biophilic and Bioclimatic Architecture: Analytical Therapy for the Next Generation of Passive Sustainable Architecture, Springer Science & Business Media, 2010, pp 241-42 =Architecture= A mashrabiya of Cairo in the 1800s from the inside, as a setting for an imaginary scene One of the major architectural benefits is correcting the footprint shape of the land. Due to winding and irregular streets, plots of land are also commonly irregular in shape, while the house designs are regular squares and rectangles. This would result in irregular shapes of some rooms and create dead corners. The projection allows the shapes of the rooms on the upper floors to be corrected, and thus the entire plot of land to be utilised. It also increases the usable space without increasing the plot size. On the street side, in addition to their ornamental advantage, mashrabiyas served to provide enclosure to the street and a stronger human scale.

The former station, constructed in 1958-1962, was located just east of Lakeshore Road and Cawthra Road. The four stacks of the station were known as the Four Sisters; the eight boilers of the generating plant all 'twinned' their emissions into common stacks. (Similar technology had been used in several of the four funnel liners that historically plied the North Atlantic.) The station was a landmark for years and was shut down in April, 2005, after 43 years of service. The four stacks, which could be seen from as far away as Burlington to the west and downtown Toronto to the east, were demolished on June 12, 2006. The rest of the building was demolished on June 28, 2007.  History  During the first half of the 20th century, most electricity produced in Ontario came from hydroelectric stations. But by the early 1950s, most large hydroelectric sites were already under development and new power sources were required to meet the province‚Äôs growing appetite for electricity. On the north shore of Lake Ontario, in what is now the City of Mississauga, 52 hectares of land were earmarked for a new thermal-electric plant that would help meet Ontario‚Äôs power demands and even provide system reserves. \\"The Lakeview Project\\" was underway by June, 1958, and quickly became a station of superlatives: its eight boilers were the largest ever installed in Canada; the 300,000 kilowatt generators the largest ever purchased by a Canadian utility; and its power transformers were the largest ever built in Canada. On June 20, 1962, Ontario Premier John Robarts and Ontario Hydro chairman W. Ross Strike pushed the button to start up the first 300,000 kilowatt unit. Lakeview was the second thermal plant designed by Ontario Hydro. The Hearn Generating Station in Toronto opened several years before and served as a test bed for Lakeview. As the design and construction of progressed, the station would include two different types of boilers and three unique turbine designs. It is possible that Ontario Hydro had a dispute with equipment suppliers in the early 1960s which caused the unusual equipment choices. The switch from Parsons as a turbine supplier to AEI was unusual since the AEI turbine generators on units 3-6 were (50 cycle) machines. They would require heavy weights attached to overcome turbine vibration at the higher (60 cycle) speeds in Canada. These were the only AEI turbines installed at Ontario Hydro. Units 5 & 6 operated until the station closed (40 years) The station would reach 2400 MW by 1968, surpassed only by the Nanticoke Generating Station (4096 MW) near Port Dover, in the late 1970s. During the late 1960s and 1970s, the station operated to full capacity as an eight-unit baseload plant, meeting about 17% of Ontario‚Äôs electricity needs. In the early 1980s, Lakeview worked at full capacity after problems at Pickering in August 1983 resulted in a brief power shortage. In the early 1990s the station was partially overhauled. A surplus of capacity led to the mothballing of four units. The station continued to play an important role as a four-unit peaking plant, providing an adequate and reliable electricity supply when consumer demands were highest in the morning and around the dinner hour ‚Äì and in the summer and winter. This role was especially critical on hot days when air conditioning use drove up electricity demand. Following provincial government policy to phase out Ontario Power Generation‚Äôs six coal-fired generating stations by the end of 2007, Lakeview Generating Station ceased operations on Saturday, April 30, 2005 after 43 years. Lakeview and its employees made a highly significant contribution to the energy needs of the province, and particularly to the Greater Toronto Area (GTA).  Boilers  Inside the Lakeview coal-fired power plant. Units 1 & 2 had Babcock & Wilcox front-fired boilers and Parson turbines with a tandem cross compound arrangement (there were two 150 MW turbines - high/intermediate pressure and intermediate/low pressure) Each unit had two generators - one 3600 RPM, the other 1800 RPM. Units 3 & 4 (1964‚Äì65) had boilers built by Combustion Engineering, with double tangentially fired furnaces. The tandem compound turbines were supplied by AEI (UK) Units 5 & 6 (1965‚Äì66) had Babcock & Wilcox front-fired boilers and AEI tandem compound turbines. Units 7 & 8 (1968) had Babcock & Wilcox front-fired boilers and Parsons tandem compound turbines. At a cost of $274 million, Lakeview Generating Station had become the largest thermal-electric plant in the world when it was completed in 1968.  Environmental improvements  Environmental improvements at Lakeview in recent years included recycling fly ash and safeguarding water quality. The station‚Äôs achievement of International Organisation for Standardisation ISO 14001 certification continued to demonstrate Lakeview‚Äôs commitment to environmental management through responsible operation at the highest standards.  Emissions control  *1972: Research to remove SO2 from flue gases continues. *1981: Coal-cleaning project completes first of four years of testing. *1984: Launch of acid gas control program and commitment to cutting emissions in half by 1990. *1986: \\"War on acid gas emissions\\" continues as Lakeview tests limestone-injection scrubbing technology to further reduce emissions, and uses more low-sulphur coal. *1987: The prospect of a major equipment overhaul looms, along with new environmental restrictions. Ontario Hydro begins three-year study aimed at obtaining approval for acid gas control equipment at coal-fired generating stations. *1989: Hydro announces a major Lakeview rehabilitation between 1990 and 1994, including the addition of acid gas control equipment on all eight units. *1991: Revised plan for Lakeview includes complete rehabilitation for Units 5 and 6, and a reduced rehabilitation for Units 1 and 2; decision on remaining four units deferred. *1992: High-efficiency precipitators are installed on all four operating units, which combined with flue gas conditioning technology to capture more than 99% of particulates in the flue gases. *1999: Lakeview receives ISO 14001 accreditation and announces new initiative to further reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. *2001: Lakeview completes installation of new, low nitrogen oxide burners on all operating units, cutting nitrogen oxides emissions by 50% from the 1999 level. Lakeview Generating Station Demolition  Timeline  *June 1, 1958: Construction begins on 52 hectares of land purchased from Toronto Township *July 24, 1959: Ontario Hydro announces the addition of a third and fourth 300,000 kilowatt generating unit to Lakeview by 1964 *1961: Unit 1 produces first electricity on October 30 *1962‚Äì1965: Units 2 ‚Äì 4 in service *1965‚Äì1969: Units 5 ‚Äì 8 in service *On the waterfront of Lake Ontario, \\"The Four Sisters\\" ‚Äì Lakeview‚Äôs four 146 meter (sometimes quoted as 150 meters) concrete stacks ‚Äì became a familiar navigational beacon for boats, ships and airplanes. *Lakeview ran at its highest capacity as a baseload plant from the late 1960s to the early 1980s and met about 17% of the province‚Äôs energy needs. During this time, Lakeview played an important role in providing an around-the-clock, reliable supply of electricity to Ontario‚Äôs energy customers. *1980s: In the 1980s, as nuclear units came on line at Pickering and Bruce, Lakeview‚Äôs role in the electricity marketplace changed. It transitioned to a peaking plant, due to its higher costs operating only when electricity demands were highest, or other generating units were not available. In 1986, the station began to use lower-sulphur coal to reduce emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. *1990‚Äì1993: $1.1 billion was invested in rehabilitation to increase efficiency and reliability, and the addition of acid gas control equipment to all eight units. By 1992, only four units had been overhauled when repairs were halted due to the changing future outlook and to a decline in the consumer use of energy, due to economic recession. *1993‚Äì2000: In January, 1993, reduced load forecasts resulted in the decommissioning of Units 3, 4, 7 and 8. In 1994, the plant returned to service as a four-unit peak-demand generating station, but with a much improved environmental performance. Lakeview continued to provide customers with a safe, reliable source of power when demand was highest, and became a key asset in times of uncertainty in the electricity marketplace. The station‚Äôs location in the GTA made its output invaluable to some of Ontario‚Äôs largest municipal utilities and industries ‚Äìespecially when nuclear and other generation was not available. *1998‚Äì2002: In December, 1998, Ontario Hydro announced a joint venture to pursue the development of a 550 MW natural gas- fired combined cycle power plant at Lakeview. The venture was dissolved in May, 2000. In March, 2001, the provincial government announced that Lakeview would be required to stop burning coal by April, 2005. *2003‚Äì2005: In October, 2003, the provincial government confirmed that Lakeview would close on April 30, 2005, with plans for the remainder of OPG‚Äôs coal-fuelled plants removed from service by the end of 2007; this plan never met its deadline and only the Lakeview plant was demolished before 2008. *June 12, 2006: \\"The Four Sisters\\" were successfully imploded by Murray Demolition LP, in order of east to west, falling to the east with a stack toppling every 4 seconds. Over a thousand spectators came to a nearby park to observe the demolition. Helicopters filled the sky, each taking footage of the event. *June 28, 2007: The rest of the building was demolished at 11:04am EST.

She has had roles in several television movies and feature films. In cartoons, her best-known roles include the voices of Sailor Mars in the original English Canadian dub of Sailor Moon, and Alex in Totally Spies!. She is also the voice of Laugh-a-Lot Bear in Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot and as a plush toy. She also voiced Farmer Shire in Corn & Peg Biography Griffin grew up in Scarborough, Ontario. Her mother was a teacher, and her father was an air traffic controller. When she was 8, she played the role of The Artful Dodger in her school play, which garnered notice from her mother, who was the school director, of her talent. Looking back at that period, Griffin said that she was more inspired by watching movies than theatre, especially concerning strong women, and cited her mom as a huge influence. Griffin got her break into acting when she was 15 when she participated in a play at the Ryerson Theatre and was noticed by an agent. She was booked for local commercials and television spots in Canada as well as television movie specials. After graduating high school, she switched agents and continued with her acting gigs. When she was attending Ryerson University, she was offered a role in the television film \\"Up to Now\\" but it caused a conflict where she had to choose between acting or studying. Griffin's first major role in an animated series was Sailor Mars in Sailor Moon, which at the time she had not realized was going to be popular. She was recommended to audition by Rino Romano, who voiced Tuxedo Mask. She described the role with Serena as best friends who sometimes fight, but not really the bully persona that was shown. She would record about two to three episodes a week, and it was not difficult on her voice. She likes that Mars is \\"fiercely loyal, strong, loves martial arts, sings... and the fact that she can summon fire and destroy evil, lol, Rei and I are very similar in character.\\" In the animated TV series Braceface, Griffin voices Nina, a mean eighth-grader girl who gives the title character her moniker. In the Moon Chase interview, Griffin said \\"I don‚Äôt think I have one single thing in common with Nina, so it was fun playing that role. I guess in the end, I like playing badass kind of characters.\\" In voicing Alex in Totally Spies!, Griffin used a higher vocal register than usual. She was worried about nodules developing, and being recast when the series returned for season 6 following a hiatus, but was happy when she could return. She found the part to be really fun, easy to play, and liked that Alex was so lovely to animals. She notes that about the only thing Alex and Raye (Sailor Mars) have in common is their ability to kick some ass. She also voiced the character Ruby in Max & Ruby and Mary of the Geniuses and Miles of the Vegans in Total Drama Presents: The Ridonculous Race. In live-action acting, she starred alongside Rob Lowe as his love interest in Too Late to Say Goodbye. She also worked with Nicole Kidman and Glenn Close. Music career Some of Griffin's influences in her music style include: Sarah McLachlan, Madonna, The Tragically Hip, as well as alternative music bands Hole, Foo Fighters, No Doubt, and Radiohead. She enjoys singing but realized she wasn't going to get a record deal by just that. She learned guitar and began writing songs. Following one of the commercial voice-over jobs where she sang a jingle, she played some acoustic songs and her friend suggested she get her songs produced in an album. She was introduced to Michael Kulas of the band James. Kulas was able to produce many of her acoustic songs so that they became more of a pop/rock album. The album title Kiss Me Chaos was based on the Kiss Me, Kate musical, as she describes herself as being pretty strong and like \\"Kate the Shrew\\". It released in streaming service in February 2020. Personal life Griffin is married to musician Michael Kulas. They have two children. Griffin enjoys martial arts films, playing guitar, and playing/watching hockey. She has a younger sister named Becky.

A member of the Republican Party, he served as the 16th governor of Nebraska and as a justice of the Nebraska Supreme Court. Personal life Aldrich was born in Pierpont in Ashtabula County, Ohio. He married Sylvia Estelle Stroman on June 4, 1889, and they had five children. He was a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church, a Freemason and a Knight Templar. He died in office on March 10, 1924. Education After he graduated from the prep school at Hillsdale College in Michigan, Aldrich entered the Ohio State University as a freshman in 1884. While at Ohio State he became a champion orator, served as an editor of The Lantern, and in 1886 became the captain of an abortive first attempt at forming an Ohio State University football team. He graduated from Ohio State in 1888 with an A.B.

In 1910, with support from Populist Democrat William Jennings Bryan, and over opposition of the trusts, Aldrich was elected governor of Nebraska. During his tenure as governor, a co-operative association act was sanctioned; a board of control for state institutions was established; a sanitary health bill was authorized; and a road program was initiated. He held the position until 1913. Aldrich was elected as a justice of the Nebraska Supreme Court in 1918, and remained in that position until his death.

The name is misleading, as no western larch (a large coniferous tree) can be found there. It received that name when early lumbermen sold the noble fir wood as larch. The peak can be reached between May and November on paved Larch Mountain Road, east of Corbett, Oregon, although the road is closed during the winter and spring months. Geography Larch Mountain is located in Multnomah County, Oregon approximately east of Portland, above the Columbia River Gorge. Although it has an elevation of , its prominence above the surrounding terrain is only . The summit of the mountain is accessible by Larch Mountain Road between May and November, which branches off from the Historic Columbia River Highway east of Corbett. Due to the risk of driving on the mountain's upper slopes in winter weather, the road closes during the winter months at milepost 10. History In 1879, Amos James Moore was the first known person to advocate for the logging and settling of Larch Mountain. Attractive due to its proximity to Portland and the Columbia River, it contained what were considered some of the highest- quality cedar, hemlock, and fir trees in the United States. In 1886, the Bridal Veil Lumbering Company started logging and constructed a lumber mill, followed a year later by the Latourrel Falls Wagon Road and Lumber Company. The operation rapidly expanded with the construction of a wooden plank road extending from Larch Mountain to the railroad line near the river, allowing for the large-scale logging of the mountain. The Bridal Veil Lumbering company became known for the high quality of its timber. In 1902, a fire swept through one of the mills, completely destroying it as well as the town. Both were soon rebuilt in new locations. This event is often heralded as the start of the decline of the large-scale Victorian logging practices, which were replaced by more modern techniques. Only a few remnants of the former system exist today. Logging continued in the new forms on the mountain for several more decades. In 1928, the United States Forest Service began reforesting the slopes of Larch Mountain, so that more lumber could be produced. A fire in 1936 marked the end of the timber business on the mountain. Causing around $100,000 of damage, it severely damaged the lumber mill, which was not rebuilt due to the depletion of the timber supply on the mountain. Geology Larch Mountain is the remnant of an ancient shield volcano, with broad slopes covering tens of square kilometers. It is currently the tallest peak in the Boring Lava Field, a volcanic field active during the Plio-Pleistocene time frame. Active between 1.8 and 1.4 million years ago, the volcano is composed mainly of basalts, although the summit at Sherrard Point is composed mainly of iron-rich andesite. Larch Mountain's basalt is tough to distinguish from the surrounding Columbia River Basalt, although the Columbia River Basalt is slightly lighter in color and less brittle. Sherrard Point is the eroded remains of the original volcanic plug. Sherrard Point was exposed during the last glacial period, when the majority of the mountain's peak was destroyed by glaciers. The glaciers carved a large cirque into the mountain, forming a large lake. Over time, the lake was filled with sediment, and today the area is now a large meadow. Biology Larch Mountain contains some of the largest old- growth forest stands left in the Columbia River Gorge area, characterized by the presence of many nurse logs. Dominant tree species include pacific silver fir, grand fir, Douglas fir, and western hemlock. Recreation The Larch Mountain area contains multiple popular hiking trails. The Larch Mountain Trail #441 begins near the Columbia River at the Multnomah Falls Lodge and roughly follows Multnomah Creek, passing several waterfalls including the well-known Multnomah Falls, Weisendanger Falls, and Ecola Falls. The trail ends at the Larch Mountain parking lot, at a picnic area. The Sherrard Point Trail #443 leads from this area to Sherrard Point at the pinnacle. Sherrard Point offers an outstanding view of the nearby Cascade Range volcanoes Mount Hood, Mount Adams, Mount Jefferson, Mount Rainier, and Mount St. Helens. Elevation plaques are provided, showing the elevation of said volcanoes. A loop around Larch Mountain itself is formed by the Larch Mountain Trail, the Multnomah Creek Way Trail #444, and the Oneonta Trail #424. Gallery File:Larch Mountain.JPGView from the summit.

Its capital is Taldykorgan city, which has a population of 175,200. Population of the region: 2,059,200 peoples. Geography Almaty Region surrounds the city of Almaty. The region borders Kyrgyzstan and Xinjiang in the People's Republic of China. The region also touches three other regions of Kazakhstan: Jambyl Region to the west, Karaganda Region to the northwest, and East Kazakhstan Region to the north. Almaty Region has an area of 224,000 square kilometres. Much of the northwestern border of the region runs along Lake Balkhash, whose main affluent, the Ili River, is the most significant river of the region. In the region's northeast, it shares the four lakes of the Alakol Depression (Lakes Alakol, Sasykkol, Koshkarkol, and Zhalanashkol) with East Kazakhstan Region. Other lakes within the region include Bartogay Lake and Kapshagay lakes, Lake Issyk, Kaindy and Kolsai lakes. The Trans-Ili Alatau branch of the Tian Shan Mountains extends from China and Kyrgyzstan into Almaty Region, along its southern border with Kyrgyzstan. Farther to the northeast, the Dzungarian Alatau runs along the region's border with China. The Charyn Canyon is one of the region's famous scenic spots. https://zhetysu.gov.kz/ru/o-regione/ History Alma-Ata Region, the predecessor of today's Almaty Region, was created from the historical region of Zhetysu on March 10, 1932. Its capital was Alma-Ata (Almaty). Several times during the Soviet period, the north- eastern part of the region, centered on Taldykorgan, was separated from Alma- Ata Region, forming a separate Taldy-Kurgan Region, only to be merged into Alma-Ata Region again several years later. In April 2001 the administrative center of Almaty Region was moved from Almaty to Taldykorgan. Thus Taldykorgan has become a regional capital again - this time without splitting the region. Almaty region was formed on March 10, 1932 with a center in the city of Almaty. The region included 18 districts. At the end of 1939, part of the districts was transferred to the Dzhambul and Semipalatinsk regions, 23 districts remained in the Alma-Ata region, including the newly formed 7. In March 1944, Taldy-Kurgan Region was allocated from its structure, to which 11 districts were transferred.

Tourism The East Kazakhstan Region and neighboring Almaty Region share Lake Alakol, a major domestic tourist site. In 2013, UNESCO established the Alakol Biosphere Reserve, stating that the lake and its surroundings are an important part of the Central Asian Flyway. Birds native to the lake include the Dalmatian Pelican, the Eurasian Spoonbill, the Greater Flamingo, and the Ferruginous Duck. The lake's color changes during the day, from azure-blue in the morning to purple at sunset. On sunny days the lake has a notably bright color, and on cloudy days the water is dark grey. The improvement of infrastructure near the lake, as well as its alleged medicinal properties, have led to increased tourism in recent years. The Altai Alps ski resort, in the town of approximately 24 kilometres east of Oskemen, serves as a popular skiing destination. The and the Katon-Karagay National Park are both located in the Katonkaragay District in the northeastern part of the region. Sport The region sent a bandy team to the Spartakiade 2009 and finished third.

Life Zawodny fought in the Polish Army during World War II, initially during the Invasion of Poland, then with the underground Home Army resistance movement. He took part as a second lieutenant in the 1944 Warsaw uprising during the September campaign, first a soldier of the ZWZ (ZwiƒÖzek Walki Zbrojnej), then the AK (Armia Krajowa). In the Warsaw Uprising he was a platoon commander of a battalion AK \\"Lukasiriski\\", and later replaced the commander of the companies \\"Cost\\" in the group the \\"Pine\\" at the Old Town. In the street fighting against Waffen-SS troops, he was twice wounded: once in the hand by submachine gun fire at point-blank range, and once to his face and ear by schrapnel after he recovered, and threw back, a live German grenade that was tossed into the bunker he and his men were sheltering in. After the uprising, he was captured and became a prisoner of war in Oflag VII-A Murnau under a different name, \\"Turczyk\\", as he was wanted by the Gestapo beginning in April 1944. After liberation from Murnau, he joined the Second Polish Army Corps in Italy, where he commanded a battalion of heavy armored cars in the 12th Podolian Uhlan Regiment. After the war (1945‚Äì48), he continued his military service with Polish Second Corps. When the Soviet Union took control of the country, creating the People's Republic of Poland, he decided to stay abroad and emigrated to the United States, ultimately residing in Washington state until his death in 2012. He studied at the University of Iowa and earned his PhD in 1955 at Stanford University. He went on to teach at Princeton University, University of Pennsylvania, St Antony's College (Oxford University), Claremont Graduate University and Pomona College.

Other cities in Turkistan Region include Sayram, Kentau, Arys, Shardara, Zhetisay, Saryagash, and Lenger. This region and Atyrau Region are Kazakhstan's two smallest regions; both are about 117,300 square kilometers in area. Turkistan Region borders the neighboring country of Uzbekistan (and is very near the Uzbekistan capital Tashkent), as well as three other Kazakhstan regions: Karaganda Region (to the north), Kyzylorda Region (to the west), and Jambyl Region (to the east). The Syr Darya passes through the region, on its way to the Aral Sea. Also, an oil pipeline runs from Turkmenabat, Turkmenistan to Omsk, Russia (where it connects with a larger, Siberian pipeline) through South Kazakhstan. Oil, lead and zinc are refined in Shymkent. The Region was originally formed in the Kazakh SSR within the Soviet Union by the name South Kazakhstan Oblast. In 1962, it was renamed Chimkent Oblast, but this only lasted until 1992, when it was changed back to the old name. In 2018, it was changed to Turkistan Oblast, which is the current name. The administrative center of the region was Shymkent until 19 June 2018, when it was taken out of the region and subordinated directly to the central government. The administrative center was moved to Turkistan, and the region renamed Turkistan Region. Demographics Turkistan Region is the most densely populated of Kazakhstan's many regions. This derives from the oblast's gentler climate, better irrigation infrastructure, and proximity to historical population centers (such as Uzbekistan's Tashkent and the Silk Road cities of Samarkand and Bukhara). It is also the fastest growing of Kazakhstan's regions, due to two main factors. One is the birthrate among traditional Kazakh and Uzbek families, where families of five to eight children are commonplace. The other is the exodus of cheap migrant labor from northern Uzbekistan. These migrant workers sometimes become full-fledged immigrants, and if they are ethnic Kazakhs this process is easily green-lighted through local governments for an (unacknowledged and under-the-table) fee. As such, Turkistan Region is the only region with a demographic breakdown where ethnic Russians are not in the first or second most populous categories. Census results are old and made using Soviet methods that served propaganda over accuracy, but they still point to Kazakhs being the most populous, closely followed by Uzbeks, with Russians bringing in a distant third. As of 2020, Turkistan Region has a population of 2,016,037. Ethnic groups (2020): *Kazakh: 75.98% *Uzbek: 17.11% *Tajik: 1.87% *Russian: 1.73% *Azerbaijani: 0.93% *Others: 2.38% Note, the ethnicity figures exclude the City of Shymkent, which in 2018 became administratively separate from the region. Languages Main languages are Kazakh, Russian (including as means of international dialogue) and Uzbek. History Historically speaking, South Kazakhstan Region is home to Kazakhstan's oldest and greatest marvels. Two thousand years ago it was part of the northern border of the Persian Empire. It owes its long history of habitation to a mixing of Persian culture and science with the native Turkic/Mongol tribal clans. South Kazakhstan Region was part of the Satrap of Sogdiana. Some places of historical interest include the cities of Turkistan, Otrar and Sayram. Sayram was the birthplace of Ahmed Yasavi (1103‚Äì66), a great Sufic scholar and author that lived and worked throughout Central Asia. He is entombed in a mausoleum complex that stands in present-day Turkistan, and which has been named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. It was commissioned by Amir Temur (Tamerlane) to increase his standing among the area. The mausoleum was built by Persian masters, though it was left unfinished with the death of Tamerlane. The original scaffolding that would have been used to apply the colored-tile still protrudes from the front entrance. Administrative divisions As of 2019, the region was administratively divided into eleven districts and the cities of Arys, Kentau, and Turkistan. # Baydibek District, with the administrative center in the selo of Shayan; # Kazygurt District, the selo of Kazygurt; # Zhetysai District, with the town Zhetysai #Maktaaral District, the town of Myrzakent; # Ordabasy District, the selo of Temirlan; # Otyrar District, the selo of Shauldir; # Saryagash District, the town of Saryagash; # Sayram District, the selo of Aksukent; # Shardara District, the town of Shardara; # Sozak District, the selo of Sholakkorgan; # Tole Bi District, the town of Lenger; # Tulkibas District, the selo of Turar Ryskulov.

The Chu River valley is one of Kazakhstan's important areas of irrigated agriculture. The core of the rail transportation network in the region is based on the east-west Turksib rail line, which runs through Taraz and Chu toward Almaty, and the north-south Transkazakhstan line, which runs north from Chu toward Nur-Sultan. CIS Highway M 39 (which in this area forms part of European route E40) comes from Tashkent, Uzbekistan over Shymkent (capital of neighbouring province South Kazakhstan) and runs further over Taraz to Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan; then it comes to Jambyl Province again through Korday border crossing and continues east toward Almaty.

Located off the main Ieper-Menin Road on Canadalaan (Canada Lane). The Canadian Hill 62 Memorial is 100 metres further down the road from the cemetery. Sanctuary Wood itself was named by British troops in November 1914 when it was used to shelter troops. Fighting took place in it in September 1915 and it was fought over by Canadian and German soldiers during the Battle of Mount Sorrel in early June 1916. Three small Commonwealth cemeteries were established in it between May and August 1915 but were largely obliterated during the Battle of Mount Sorrel. When the war finished, traces of one of them were found, containing 137 graves, and became the core of the present Sanctuary Wood Cemetery. It was greatly expanded between 1927 and 1932 with graves being moved in from surrounding areas, with a few being moved from as far away as Nieuport. The majority of these graves were from the battles around Ypres in 1914 and the Allied offensive in late 1917. One of the 637 identified graves belongs to Lieutenant Gilbert Talbot of the Rifle Brigade (Plot 1, Row G), in whose memory Talbot House at Poperinghe was established in December 1915 by two army chaplains, Talbot's brother Neville Talbot and Philip 'Tubby' Clayton. Just outside the cemetery is a Celtic cross, with an engraved sword on top, a memorial to Second Lieutenant Thomas Keith Hedley Rae. He was killed on 20 July 1915 at Hooge, and the memorial was built there in 1921, but transferred to its present location in the 1960s.

They entered this venture after buying the Meheen & Collins brewery. The brewery is located in what was once a grain mill at 206 N. Benton St. in Kennewick, Washington. This building serves as a brewery, and as a brewpub. The menu offers sandwiches and various fare as well as the brewery's creations. The brewpub recently installed a beer engine, which allows the beer to be pulled from the cask, rather than pushed by carbon dioxide gas. The brewpub is believed to be the only Tri-City brewpub that uses such a device. Recently, Ice Harbor Brewing had opened its second pub, which is located at the Port of Kennewick's commercial building at 350 Clover Island Dr. on Clover Island in Kennewick. The pub opened in late October 2007, and features much of the same brews and fare at the Railroad Avenue brewpub, but without the homebrewing inventory. The Brewery The brewery (located at 206 N. Benton St., #C in Kennewick) uses a 10-barrel (bbl) system and uses a single-stage infusion mash system. The brewery is capable of producing an annual yield of 1300 bbls, both for sale outside the brewery and in the brewpub. In addition to being a brewery and a brewpub, Ice Harbor also sells homebrewing equipment and supplies. They also provide monthly classes for beginning homebrewers as well as the meeting place for the local homebrew club the Mid-Columbia Zymurgy Association. The Beers Ice Harbor Brewing provides a wide variety of handcrafted ales and lagers, all of which have names that reflect the local area. =Columbia K√∂lsch= This K√∂lsch beer is brewed in the style of the beers of Cologne, Germany. Light in color, dry and refreshing. This is one of the company's best sellers. =The Tangerine exBEERience= A hefewiezen beer with added tangerines. =India Pale Ale= A classic ale style, with double the hop rate. =Runaway Red Ale= A red ale, generously hopped with local hops. =Sternwheeler Stout= Closely modeled after the classic Irish stout. A nitrogen-charged version of this stout is often made available arount St. Patrick's Day. =Barley Wine-style beer= A high-gravity ale, hopped heavily to counter the malt sweetness. Available mostly in the winter months. =Cask-conditioned Hop Warrior= This beer, one of the few offered at the brewpub which is cask-conditioned (their Pale Ale is another), is dry-hopped with Amarillo hops, and is only offered sporadically.

Astray was notable for his disfigured body: during his time in the army, he lost both his left arm and right eye and was shot several times in the chest and legs.http://www.abc.es/historia-militar/20140507/abci-millan-astray- entrevista-guerra-201405051356.html  Early life  Born in A Coru√±a, Galicia, his father was Jos√© Mill√°n Astray, a lawyer, poet, librettist of the Zarzuela genre, and chief jailer of Madrid. His mother was Pilar Terreros Segade, an illustrator and comedic author and his sister, Pilar Mill√°n Astray was to be a noted writer. Though pressed to study law, Mill√°n-Astray aspired to a military career. On August 30, 1894, he entered the Academia de Infanter√≠a de Toledo (\\"Infantry Academy of Toledo\\"). He graduated as a second lieutenant at the age of sixteen, and later served in the army in Madrid. On September 1, 1896, he enrolled in the Escuela Superior de Guerra (\\"Superior Military School\\"). On March 2, 1906, he married Elvira Guti√©rrez de la Torre, daughter of General Guti√©rrez C√°mara. Only after the wedding did she reveal her intention to remain chaste. From this point on, the couple would maintain (in Mill√°n-Astray's own words) a \\"fraternal relationship\\". It appears, nevertheless, that Elvira was a very devoted, if not subservient, wife.  Career  Upon graduation, he joined the General staff of the Spanish Army. Soon after, the Philippine Revolution broke out, and he left his position to serve there as a volunteer second lieutenant. He would earn numerous decorations for his valor (Cruz de Mar√≠a Cristina, Cruz Roja al M√©rito Militar, and Cruz Primera Clase al M√©rito Militar) and became something of a war hero for his defence at the age of 18 of the city of San Rafael, in which he fought off a rebel force of two thousand with only thirty men. He subsequently served in the Rif War. On October 26, 1924, while stationed in Spanish Morocco, he was wounded in the left arm during an ambush resulting in it needing to be amputated. He continued leading his men and a month later, he lost his right eye when it was hit by a bullet. http://spartacus- educational.com/SPastray.htm This earned him the sobriquet Glorioso mutilado (\\"Glorious amputee\\"). He habitually wore an eyepatch and a white glove on his right hand when appearing in public. Interested in forming a corps of foreign volunteers after the fashion of the French Foreign Legion, he traveled to Algeria to study its workings. With the support of then Major Francisco Franco, he created the Spanish Legion, and, with the rank of lieutenant colonel, served as its first commander. He would popularize the mottos ¬°Viva la Muerte! (\\"Long live death!\\") and ¬°A m√≠ la Legi√≥n! (\\"To me the legion!\\"). Mill√°n-Astray gave the legion a powerful ideology intended to evoke Spain's Imperial and Christian traditions. For instance, the legion adopted a regimental unit called the tercio in memory of the famed Spanish infantry formations that had terrorized their opponents on the battlefields of Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries. Mill√°n-Astray also revived the Spaniard's ancient feud with the Moors and portrayed his men first as crusaders on an extended Reconquista against the Islamic civilization; and later as the saviours of Spain warding off the twin evils of Communism and democratic liberalism. Favored by King Alfonso XIII and rewarded for his heroic leadership of the Legion in the aftermath of the Spanish military defeat at Annual, in 1924, he was promoted to full colonel. In 1927, he was promoted to brigadier general. In 1932, the Republican government of Aza√±a placed him on the retirement list along with other generals regarded as hostile to the Republic. During the Spanish Civil War he sided with the Nationalists. He served as director of the Office of Radio, Press, and Propaganda (1936-1937) on the Nationalist side and later (1937) was named head of the Corps of Wounded Veterans. It is said that he administered the press office like a military barracks, forcing journalists to fall in line in response to his whistle, and subjecting them to the same brutal harangues he had given as commander of the Legion.  Confrontation with Unamuno  Mill√°n-Astray is perhaps best remembered for a heated response to Miguel de Unamuno, the writer and philosopher, on October 12, 1936. The celebration of the 12th of October had brought together a politically diverse crowd at the University of Salamanca, including Enrique Pla y Deniel, the Archbishop of Salamanca, and Carmen Polo Mart√≠nez-Vald√©s, the wife of Franco, and Mill√°n-Astray himself. According to the British historian Hugh Thomas in his magnum opus The Spanish Civil War (1961), the affair began with an impassioned speech by the Falangist writer Jos√© Mar√≠a Pem√°n. After this, Professor Francisco Maldonado decried Catalonia and the Basque Country as \\"cancers on the body of the nation,\\" adding that \\"Fascism, the healer of Spain, will know how to exterminate them, cutting into the live flesh, like a determined surgeon free from false sentimentalism.\\" From somewhere in the auditorium, someone cried out the motto \\"¬°Viva la Muerte!\\". As was his habit, Mill√°n-Astray responded with \\"¬°Espa√±a!\\"; the crowd replied with \\"¬°Una!\\". He repeated \\"¬°Espa√±a!\\"; the crowd then replied \\"¬°Grande!\\". A third time, Mill√°n-Astray shouted \\"¬°Espa√±a!\\"; the crowd responded \\"¬°Libre!\\". This was a common Falangist cheer. Later, a group of uniformed Falangists entered, saluting the portrait of Franco that hung on the wall. Unamuno, who was presiding over the meeting, rose up slowly and addressed the crowd: \\"You are waiting for my words. You know me well, and know I cannot remain silent for long. Sometimes, to remain silent is to lie, since silence can be interpreted as assent. I want to comment on the so-called speech of Professor Maldonado, who is with us here. I will ignore the personal offence to the Basques and Catalans. I myself, as you know, was born in Bilbao. The Bishop,\\" Unamuno gestured to the Archbishop of Salamanca, \\"Whether you like it or not, is Catalan, born in Barcelona. But now I have heard this insensible and necrophilous oath, \\"¬°Viva la Muerte!\\", and I, having spent my life writing paradoxes that have provoked the ire of those who do not understand what I have written, and being an expert in this matter, find this ridiculous paradox repellent. General Mill√°n-Astray is an invalid. There is no need for us to say this with whispered tones. He is an invalid of war. So was Cervantes. But unfortunately, Spain today has too many invalids. And, if God does not help us, soon it will have very many more. It torments me to think that General Mill√°n-Astray might dictate the norms of the psychology of the masses. It should be expected from a mutilated who lacks the spiritual greatness of Cervantes to find horrible solace in seeing how the number of mutilated ones multiplies around him.\\" Unamuno went on to praise the executed Filipino dissident Jose Rizal, infuriating Millan-Astray who had actually fought against the rebels in the Spanish-ruled Philippines. Mill√°n-Astray reportedly responded: \\"¬°Muera la inteligencia! ¬°Viva la Muerte!\\" (\\"Death to intelligence! Long live death!\\"), provoking applause from the Falangists (although some versions suggest he actually said: \\"Death to traitor intellectuality\\" but in the commotion in the auditorium this was not perceived). Pem√°n, in an effort to calm the crowd, exclaimed: \\"¬°No! ¬°Viva la inteligencia! ¬°Mueran los malos intelectuales!\\" (\\"No! Long live intelligence! Death to the bad intellectuals!\\"). Unamuno continued: \\"This is the temple of intelligence, and I am its high priest. You are profaning its sacred domain. You will win, because you have enough brute force. But you will not convince. In order to convince it is necessary to persuade, and to persuade you will need something that you lack: reason and right in the struggle. I see it is useless to ask you to think of Spain. I have spoken.\\" Mill√°n-Astray, controlling himself, shouted \\"Take the lady's arm!\\" Unamuno took Carmen Polo by the arm and left in her protection. Unamuno's quote \\"Vencer√©is, pero no convencer√©is\\" (\\"You will win, but you will not convince\\") was, paradoxically, the slogan of the Salamanca municipality protesting the devolution from the General Archive of the Spanish Civil War to the Catalan Government of Catalan documentation seized during the war by the nationalist forces. Unamuno's heirs publicly decried this use. Unamuno left the hall escorting the wife of Franco, Carmen Polo de Franco, who had been present. In 2018, the details of Unamuno's speech were disputed by the historian Severiano Delgado, who suggested that the account in a 1941 article by Luis Gabriel Portillo (who was not present at Salamanca) in the British magazine Horizon may not have been an accurate representation of events.  Later life  In 1941, during a game of bridge, he fell in love with Rita Gasset, daughter of former public works minister Rafael Gasset, and cousin of philosopher Jos√© Ortega y Gasset. As a result, Mill√°n-Astray separated from his wife Elvira. Franco, seeking to avoid a scandal, relocated Mill√°n-Astray to Lisbon. Here, Rita gave birth to Mill√°n- Astray's only child, a daughter named Peregrina, on January 23, 1942. After the affair, Mill√°n-Astray was largely forgotten by the Spanish public. He eventually returned to Madrid, where he died of heart failure on January 1, 1954.  Reputation  Known for his flamboyant personality and his penchant for bold, chauvinist and self-aggrandizing antics, Mill√°n-Astray was by all accounts prone to actions and general demeanor, both in and out of the battlefield, frequently described as reckless, impulsive and disturbingly ruthless, even by the hardened standards of most Africanist officials;The \\"happy\\" twentiesAnalysis of Mill√°n Astray's personality there is no conclusive analysis concerning the causes of these actions, which could be prompted by environmental conditioning, antisocial personality disorder, his alleged drug (mainly cocaine see the description by Domingo Batet) abuse or undiagnosed and untreated medical conditions, or perhaps by a combination thereof. Nowadays, his legacy is primarily divided between partisan, unabashed apology and the regard for his figure as a grotesque paragon of the horrors of the Spanish Civil War and the first years of Francoist Spain.

The city has a population of 157,400 (1999 Census). It historically developed around the Syr Darya River and the site of a Kokand fortress. Population: History A settlement existed under Seljuk, the founder of the Seljuk dynasty. The modern city had its beginnings in 1817Valikhanof et al, The Russians in Central Asia, 1865, page 315, says \\" according to Kirgiz accounts, about the year 1817.\\" Kirgiz meant Kazakh at that time. as the site of a Kokand fortress known as Ak-Mechet, or white mosque.Pospelov, p. 24 The later-famous Yaqub Beg was once the fort's commander, but he was apparently not in command during the final battle. In 1853, during the Russian conquest of Turkestan, the fort was taken by Russian troops under General Vasily Perovsky. The Russians established a new fort and called it Fort-Perovsky (), after the general. The town of Perovsk () in Russian Turkestan later developed around the fort. In 1925, the city was renamed Kzyl-Orda () and was designated as the capital of the Kazak ASSR. The name literally means a red city, from the Turkic \\"–∫–∑—ã–ª\\" (red; used here in the common Soviet ideological connotation) and the Turkic Mongolian \\"–æ—Ä–¥–∞\\" (city). In 1929 the capital was relocated to the southeastern region and Alma-Ata. \\"Kyzylorda\\", the Kazakh-based romanized spelling, has been used since the late 20th century after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and Kazakhstan's independence in 1991. Since independence, many of the outhouses were erected in several apartment buildings used as dormitories during Soviet rule due to lack of sewage systems for indoor plumbing.

He is one of only a few people to have performed the stunt twice. He has also performed other illegal stunts.Steve Trotter Online:Chronicles of a Thrillseeker, retrieved June 16, 2011.How Stuff Works web site, retrieved December 3, 2006. 1985 - Successful journey over Niagara Falls Trotter always sought to make a floating death-defying journey over Niagara Falls. He planned for several months and decided upon the month of August to perform his stunt. Upon arriving in Niagara, he pinpointed the next day, August 16, 1985, as the day for the roll. In the morning, upon readying himself to get in the water with the barrel, he was stopped when police showed up, foiling his first attempt. He was escorted by Canadian authorities with his barrel back to the US border and released. On August 18, 1985, Trotter began his attempt from a location just upstream from the Horseshoe Falls. He survived the plunge uninjured. He became the youngest person to ever survive the stunt (age 22) and the first American in 25 years to go over the falls in a barrel.Niagara Falls Daredevils: a history He used two pickle barrels placed end-to-end. The exterior was reinforced with layers of fiberglass, balsa wood for flotation, and covered with truck tire inner tubes for shock absorption. Trotter was strapped into an automotive racing harness, and equipped with flashlights, lifejacket, two-way radio, and oxygen tanks. The ends of the barrel were sealed with submarine-style twist caps. At 8:30AM, Trotter's 11-man crew launched his barrel into the Niagara River rapids, a quarter-mile from the brink of the Canadian Horseshoe Falls. Trotter went over the Falls and survived with minor scrapes. Trotter said the stunt was \\"like the best roller- coaster ride you had as a 10-year-old.\\" He was fined $500 by the Niagara Parks Police for \\"illegally stunting in a park.\\" Trotter appeared on Good Morning America and The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. Trotter's photo was published in Time magazine, he made the front-page of USA Today, and numerous other publications worldwide. He was selected by Mademoiselle as \\"One of the 10 Sexiest Men in the World.\\" 1995 - Second successful journey over Niagara Falls He performed the stunt again on June 18, 1995, becoming the second person to survive the stunt twice. He was accompanied by Lori Martin. The barrel, which had a 90-minute air supply for its two occupants, was made from two heater tanks welded together. Trotter received a compression fracture in his back as a result of the stunt. He also received a jail sentence of two weeks and was fined $14,700 by the Niagara Parks Commission. Other stunts Trotter also achieved notoriety in November 1985, when he set the world record for the longest \\"Tarzan swing\\" off the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. Trotter attached a cable to the center-span of the bridge, then moved to a point away, and jumped off the bridge. Trotter, sitting on a small wooden disk attached to the end of the cable, in effect became the weight on a pendulum, travelling at 70 mph. Trotter was jailed and charged with trespassing. Trotter's attempted repeat of the stunt in 1997 at the Sunshine Skyway Bridge ended in disaster.Newspaper Archives  tampabay.com - St. Petersburg Times Trotter and four other people jumped, attached to the same cable. The plan had not been tested previously, and the cable snapped during the effort, causing Trotter and the others to plunge at least into the bay. Trotter and Jeff Sargent escaped major injury, but Lori Martin broke a vertebra in her neck and stopped breathing after the accident, forcing the others to administer cardiopulmonary resuscitation to keep her alive in the water. Glenn Rohm also broke a vertebra and had his head held in a metal halo drilled into his skull.

They serve as the main antagonists of the fourth arc, called Dream in the manga, Sailor Moon SuperS in its first anime adaptation, and in second anime adaptation's films, Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Eternal: The Movie -Part 1&2-. They are first introduced in chapter #34 \\"Dream 1 ‚Äì Eclipse Dream\\", originally published in Japan on September 6, 1995. In the original English dubbed anime, they are called the \\"Dark Moon Circus\\". The Dead Moon Circus is led by the twisted Zirconia, in command by the absence of the dark Queen Nehelenia who is trapped within a mirror. Zirconia is searching for the legendary Golden Crystal, which will allow Nehelenia to break free of her entrapment and take over the Earth. They are the only group of villains with two subordinate groups: the Amazon Trio and the Amazoness Quartet. Key figures =Zirconia= appears as an old woman with lavender skin. Secondary to Queen Nehelenia, she controls the Amazoness Quartet and the Amazon Trio. Her name is derived from the mineral Zirconium dioxide, which is often called Zirconia. Her connection to Nehelenia varies from version to version. In the English-language adaptation, Zirconia's gender was changed from female to male. In the Materials Collection, Naoko Takeuchi mentions intentional insect-like elements in her design, possibly a reference to insect genus Nehalennia. Zirconia communicates with Nehelenia and delivers her orders to the Amazoness Quartet. When Sailor Saturn and Sailor Chibi Moon begin to break through Zirconia's influence on the Quartet, Zirconia captures all of them, imprisoning the Quartet inside four magic balls and Saturn and Chibi Moon within two shards of broken mirror. She sends the objects through the mirror to Nehelenia. When the Sailor Guardians confront her, she rises into the sky and grows in size, but the Sailor Guardians use Sailor Planet Power Meditation to defeat her. Zirconia escapes into Nehelenia's mirror, but when Sailor Moon follows, she only finds Nehelenia. Following Nehelenia's apparent defeat in the mirror's world, Zirconia reappears in the mirror and claims that the Queen of the Dead Moon will not die yet and that the Dead Moon will triumph yet before disappearing, reviving Nehelenia in the process. In the anime, Zirconia is an entity created by Nelehenia from her own being and serves as the queen's representative in directing their followers on missions to find Pegasus in the beautiful dreams of people in Tokyo. While the Amazon Trio feared her, Zirconia has trouble keeping the Amazoness Quartet in line. When the Quartet begins to develop sympathy for the Sailor Guardians and destroy their balls, Zirconia escapes to Nehelenia's mirror, disappearing as her services for the freed queen are no longer needed. Zirconia is voiced by Hisako Ky≈çda and Naomi Watanabe in the Crystal film, Sailor Moon Eternal. In the Cloverway English adaptation she is voiced by Robert Bockstael and her gender is changed to male. In the Viz Media English adaptation, she is voiced by Janis Carrol. =Queen Nehelenia= , leader of the Dead Moon Circus, is named after the ancient goddess Nehalennia. Nehelenia is like the dark mirror image of Queen Serenity; the self-styled Queen of the dark center of the Moon that existed since the Silver Millennium. She made herself known at the celebration of Princess Serenity's birth. Swirling with dark energy, she confronted the Queen who used the Moon Wand to seal Nehelenia inside a dark mirror forever. In retaliation, Nehelenia cast a curse that the Moon Kingdom would fall and the princess would never inherit the throne. The Sailor Guardians thought this might have been what ultimately brought about the end of the Silver Millennium. Thousands of years later, a solar eclipse allowed her to breach the seal and make her way to Earth, where she found Sailor Chibi Moon's four future guardians, the Sailor Quartet, sleeping in the forest. She awakened them prematurely and brainwashed them into becoming her minions, the Amazoness Quartet, to aid her in her goals. She set out to take over the planet from within, by way of corrupting the land of Elysion with her dark powers, capturing its High Priest, Helios, and then by sending the Amazoness Quartet to defeat the Sailor Guardians and retrieve the Silver Crystal from Sailor Moon. Once the Sailor Guardians managed to defeat all of the minions, they eventually found out the Golden Crystal, an item that could save Elysion and the planet, was inside Tuxedo Mask's body, and went to confront Nehelenia in Elysion, where she attempted to take the Silver Crystal one last time. But the power of it combined with Tuxedo Mask's newly awakened Golden Crystal prevented this yet again. When defeated by Eternal Sailor Moon using the joined powers of all the Sailor Team, Nehelenia shrivelled into a wizened old woman, and, after being sealed inside her mirror once more, was vanished completely. It is revealed towards the end of the series that Nehelenia is just an incarnation of Chaos, the ultimate antagonist of the series. In the anime, Nelehenia was revealed to have been a queen of her own kingdom and adored by her people. Due to her childhood of having no real friends or loved ones, Nehelenia learned to love herself which led to her vanity which played into her madness when she asked an enchanted mirror to show her future and saw herself as an old hag. As a result, Nelehenia became obsessed with the notion of keeping herself young and beautiful so she consumed the dreams of her subjects, who became Lemures, and founded the Dead Moon Circus. Nelehenia sought the Golden Crystal possessed by Helios, who escaped her in the form of Pegasus, only to be later sealed by Queen Serenity within her mirror. To rectify her condition, during the events of the SuperS series, Nelehenia creates Zirconia to lead the Dead Moon Circus to hunt down Pegasus. Eventually learning of Helios's close friendship with Chibiusa, Nehelenia realizes that she is the holder of the Golden Dream Mirror that Pegasus is inhabiting. Once obtaining the Golden Crystal, Nelehenia breaks from her mirror and attempts to use its power when the Amazones Quartet steal it to give it to the Sailor Guardians who, along with the people of Earth, break Nehelenia's spell, revealing her true aged form. Nehelenia re-enters her imprisonment within the mirror to restore her youthful appearance. In Sailor Stars, Nelehenia serves as the main antagonist of the first quarter when she is freed from the mirror by Sailor Galaxia and encouraged to annihilate the Sailor Guardians and to exact her revenge through the shards of her Black Mirror. Among the victims is Mamoru, rendered emotionally dead. After dragging Mamoru into her nightmare dimension, Nelehenia captures all the Sailor Guardians before revealing her tragic past to a powerless Usagi. However, Nehelenia is ultimately redeemed by the Sailor Guardians' forgiveness, and reborn as a small child. Signs point to her having learned her lesson, as she is seen making an effort to become close to her subjects as true friends. In the original Japanese series, Nehelenia is voiced by Yoshiko Sakakibara while her purified reincarnated child version is voiced by Wakana Yamazaki. In Sailor Moon Eternal, she is voiced by Nanao. In the Cloverway English adaptation, her voice is supplied by Kate Trotter. In the Viz Media English adaptation, she is voiced by Laura Post. In the musicals, Nehelenia is portrayed by Kaori Ishikawa. Amazon Trio The are a subset of the Dead Moon Circus, and follow the threatening commands of Zirconia. The members of the trio are created from animals from the circus by the Amazoness Quartet to destroy the Sailor Guardians. They each respectively target a relevant Guardian to kill; the only exception to this is Sailor Venus, who is targeted by Xenotime and Zeolite. While commenting on their looks, series creator Naoko Takeuchi says all three members of the trio show some ambiguity. They do not summon lemures themselves, but are treated as lemures. In the anime, members of the trio summon lemures. The Amazon Trio's job is to look into the dream mirrors of mortals, searching for the legendary and powerful Pegasus. The Trio choose their victims by seducing various women and men, whether they be young or old, and attacking them while they are vulnerable. Rather than being killed by the Sailor Guardians like in the manga, the Amazon Trio share a different fate in the anime. After their many failures, Zirconia reveals to them their true natures (those of animals), and while she sends them to steal Usagi's dream mirror, she instructs PallaPalla to send a clown-like Lemures called Mr. Magic Pierrot to finish them. After Usagi's mirror is restored and Mr. Magic Pierrot is defeated, Pegasus grants the Amazon Trio dream mirrors, knowing that the trio have suffered greatly and have truly changed for the better. They cannot, however, retain their current forms as humans and are taken away by Pegasus to the Crystal Forest. As he places them within the forest, he promises that one day they will be reborn as the humans they wish to be, with their beautiful dreams intact. In the musical Shin Densetsu Kourin, Sailor Galaxia recruits them as her minions. However, in the second stage of the musical, they change their minds and join Sailor Moon instead; since the Sailor Starlights do not appear in this musical, the task of protecting her after the deaths of the Sailor Guardians is taken by the Amazon Trio. =Tiger's Eye= was a tiger turned into a human by Zirconia. He takes the form of a tall, long haired blond man. He wears tight tiger-striped pants and a white top, and attacks with a whip. Tiger's Eye, in animal form, first assisted PallaPalla and VesVes in causing havoc in the Juban district. After becoming human, he and PallaPalla attempted to pollute Sailor Mars with negative thoughts in order to take her energy while she was investigating a mysterious hall of mirrors. He is killed by her just after she powers up into her 'Super' form. He is destroyed in the blast from her new attack, Mars Flame Sniper.Act 36. In the anime, his targets of seduction are particularly younger women, as he uses his charming abilities to lure them into his traps until the right time to look into their dream mirrors in search of Pegasus. Tiger's Eye is killed when he and Fisheye give up their power to rebuild Usagi's destroyed Dream Mirror. However, Pegasus revives him, and he is sent to Elysion with the others. In the first anime adaptation, his voice actor is Ryotaro Okiayu, while Satoshi Hino voices him in Crystal film, Sailor Moon Eternal. In the Cloverway English adaptation, he is voiced by Jason Barr. In the Viz Media English adaptation, he is voiced by John Eric Bentley. In the stage musicals, he is played by Ryuji Kasahara. =Hawk's Eye= was a hawk that was turned into a human by Zirconia. He takes the form of a tall young man with bright, wild pink hair. He wears a bra-like toga and tights in his battle attire. Creator Naoko Takeuchi characterized Hawk's Eye as a sort of grown-up Zoisite, with the dream of someday being a \\"bar madam\\" in either Las Vegas or Ginza. Hawk's Eye deceives Sailor Jupiter pretending to be a female owner of a herb store. He is killed later, just after she powers up into her 'Super' form. He is destroyed in the blast from her new attack, Jupiter Oak Evolution.Act 37. In the anime, he often gets into fights with Tiger's Eye, though their relationship is rather love-hate, and their arguments are usually playful. His attacks are fire-based, and uses a torch as his primary weapon. His targets reflect his romantic preferences, in this case older women (to contrast with Tiger's Eye's preference for younger girls). He first appears in episode 128 of the anime but his first offensive move is made in episode 130, his victim being Usagi's mother, Ikuko Tsukino. Hawk's Eye is killed by the lemures Mr. Magic Pierrot, who is sent by PallaPalla to eliminate the trio. However, Pegasus revives him, and he is sent to Elysion with the others. He is voiced by Toshio Furukawa in the first anime adaptation, while Toshiyuki Toyonaga voices him in Crystal film, Sailor Moon Eternal. In the Cloverway English adaptation, he is voiced by Benji Plener. In the Viz Media English adaptation, he is voiced by Michael Yurchak. He is played by Hikari Ono in the stage musicals. =Fisheye= was a fish that was turned into a human by Zirconia. He takes the form of a slender, effeminate man with long, pale blue and green hair. In some disguises, he is styled with some hairdos such as a ponytail. In the Materials Collection, creator Naoko Takeuchi describes him as the Circus's \\"ball-balancing girl (??)\\", who one day dreams of becoming the \\"best ball- balancing girl (!) in the world\\"; emphasis is hers. She also compares his temperament to that of the exciteable Mimete. This has led some fans to believe that Fisheye was a girl in the manga, or originally intended to be one. Fisheye has a very small part in the manga, in which he is sold to Ami Mizuno in fish form. He gives her nightmares about her father abandoning her, luring her into a trap. She powers up and defeats Fisheye with Mercury Aqua Rhapsody, and he is killed soon after by Sailor Moon and Sailor Chibi Moon.Act 35. In the anime, like Tiger's Eye and Hawk's Eye, he targets his ideal romantic interests, which are young males. His magical attacks are water- based, but his primary choice of attack is knife-throwing (which, to his frustration, he is not very good at). Crossdressing is the basis of many of his disguises, as he is usually able to pass himself off as a woman to attract his targets, who are generally heterosexual males (he portrayed his gender honestly to the one gay target he had).Episode 140 Undisguised, he speaks Japanese with exclusively masculine pronouns, such as boku when referring to himself. Fisheye is the first of the three to wonder if what they are doing is right, and his wavering loyalty lands him in hot water when he is nearly killed by Zirconia. Fisheye was killed when he and Tiger's Eye gave up their power to rebuild Usagi's destroyed Dream Mirror. However, Pegasus revives him, and he is sent to Elysion with the others, given the promise of rebirth as real humans.. Fisheye was changed to a woman in Cloverway's English dub of the anime, which is not unprecedented within this adapted series: Zoisite and Zirconia also had their genders changed. Full list of changes made for English dub However, the female Fisheye's voice seemed to waver between effeminacy and boyishness, and the TV version of the dub slightly edited a fairly noticeable scene in which Fisheye is seen without a shirt-- the chest was placed off- camera. Full list of changes made for English dub In the uncut DVD, the many references to Fisheye as female are retained, but the scenes showing \\"her\\" as a shirtless man are still shown. Fisheye merely claims that \\"she's\\" not like other women. He is voiced by Akira Ishida in the first anime adaptation, while Shouta Aoi voices him in Crystal film, Sailor Moon Eternal. In the Cloverway English adaptation, Fisheye's voice is supplied by Deborah Drakeford. In the Viz Media English adaptation, he is voiced by Erik Scott Kimerer. In the stage musicals, Fisheye is portrayed by female actresses Tae Kimura and Midori Ichige. Amazoness Quartet The This group-name is sometimes rendered as Amazoness Quartetto by English-speaking fans, but the romanization of their name can be seen on Japanese merchandise. The Amazoness is a result of being girls from the amazon jungle not the Amazon warrior women consists of CereCere, PallaPalla, JunJun, and VesVes. Their attacks are derived from circus skills, with each having a specific talent. In the manga, they also created and commanded the Amazon Trio to attack the Sailor Guardians, whereas in the anime the Trio came before the Quartet and served Zirconia. In the Cloverway English adaptation, they are called the Amazon Quartet. The Sailor Quartet. Left to right: Sailor Vesta, Sailor Pallas, Sailor Ceres, Sailor Juno. They are actually the Sailor Quartet--commonly referred to in English- speaking fandom as the Asteroid Guardians, because they are named after the first four major asteroids to be discovered. The four asteroids hold particular importance because they were originally considered planets in history before more were discovered. They had been placed in a deep sleep somewhere within the Amazon Jungle, awaiting the time when they could become the future protectors of Sailor Chibi Moon, analogous to Princess Serenity's four Inner Guardians and to Prince Endymion's four Four Kings of Heaven. However, Queen Nehelenia woke them prematurely and forced them to work for her. At her defeat, they are returned to their true forms by Usagi (in the form of Neo-Queen Serenity) and to their long sleep. During the fifth story arc, they accompany Sailor Chibi Moon from the future to help in the fight against Shadow Galactica. The Sailor Quartet's uniforms are a cross between those worn by the Sailor Team in their first forms and their final forms, with the Quartet's own image colors. They are shown using two attacks as a group: Pink Lady's Freezing Kiss (all four of them plus Sailor Chibi Moon) and Amazoness! Jungle Arrow (used by the four Quartet members). In the anime, the Quartet's history of being Sailor Guardians is never shown to viewer and the story is followed after they are captured by Queen Nehelenia and is already a part of her Dead Moon Circus. They begin working for Queen Nehelenia after she appears inside a magical mirror after hearing the Amazoness Quartet playing in a forest, and then offered to keep the Amazoness Quartet from ever growing old in return. Nehelenia changed their dreams into the physical form of Amazon Stones, instructing them to use these to remove the \\"dream mirrors\\" of humans. The Quartet also use the Amazon Stones for other attacks. They are dedicated to this task, but still generally spend more time playing than working. The Quartet appears in several of the stage musicals, with a substantially different background. Here they are homonculi created by Professor Tomoe, and are known as the Sammael Quartet. They are portrayed as young children around Chibiusa's apparent age, instead of their normal ages. They are created from Chibiusa's starseed, and are linked to her, having the power to transform into Sailor Guardians as a result. =CereCere= is the pink haired, and most mature acting member of the Quartet. She is a trapeze artist for the Circus and is known as the Flower Magician. She is the leader of the Quartet. CereCere has light skin and wears pink, but has a yellow ball. She is very feminine and tries to be mature compared to the others in the Quartet. Her Sailor Guardian counterpart is Sailor Venus. Her hair is decorated in bows and a flower. Takeuchi has stated that CereCere is sexy and talks in a very aristocratic tone. She is the eldest sister, which corresponds to the order of discovery of the asteroid she is named after - 1 Ceres, which is also classified as a dwarf planet; she is also named after the Roman goddess Ceres. Later in the manga it is revealed that she is actually Sailor Ceres, one of the four protectors of Chibiusa. In the manga, she is the only member of the Quartet not to use any attacks or spells. In the anime, CereCere tends to be arrogant and haughty, and chases after people that will highlight her perceived beauty for her, such as when she chased after an artist and asked him to repaint her. She also appears extravagant and outrageous while disguised and not in her circus uniform. However, there are moments when she breaks the mature mask and plays for fun. The other Amazonesses see her as lazy, and take every opportunity to call her such. CereCere summons only plant-based lemures, a possible nod to her Roman namesake Ceres, a goddess of vegetation and plants. In the anime series, her voice actress is Yuri Amano, and Reina Ueda voices her in Crystal film, Sailor Moon Eternal. In the Cloverway English adaptation, her name is changed to \\"Selesele\\" and she is voiced by Megan McChesney. In the Viz Media English adaptation, she is voiced by Cassandra Morris. In the musicals she is played by Shiori Eguchi and Risa Honma, the latter of whom later went on to play Sailor Mars. =PallaPalla= is the blue-haired, childlike member of the Quartet. She uses ball-based attacks. She is called the Magician of Balancing Balls. Her Sailor Guardian counterpart is Sailor Mercury, and her color is blue. Takeuchi listed her as being a bimbo, crybaby and childish. She is the second eldest sister, which corresponds to the number of her asteroid, Pallas. She was also named after the Greek goddess Pallas Athena. In the manga, it's revealed that she is actually Sailor Pallas, one of the four protectors of Chibiusa.In the English adaptation of the manga, her name is misspelled as both Palis and Palus. In the anime, she speaks in third person and is equally childish as she is in the manga. Nevertheless, she shows some signs of cleverness, such as pointing out that the arrangement of the curtains is wrong in one episode (when no one else saw it), setting up a popular dentist office in another, and using a doll to manipulate the Guardian in yet another. The other Amazonesses think she is very dangerous; in one episode she rips the head off her own doll as a cure for its toothache. She often summons ball-like lemures or uses dolls as part of her attacks, and likes to attack groups of people rather than one at a time. All of the Lemures she summons have two faces, a good one and an evil one, reflecting her own dual nature. She is voiced by Machiko Toyoshima in the first anime, and by Sumire Morohoshi in Crystal film, Sailor Moon Eternal. In the Cloverway English adaptation, her name is changed to \\"Parapara\\" and her voice is supplied by Jen Gould. In the Viz Media English adaptation, she is voiced by Xanthe Huynh. In the musicals she is played by Kurumi Nishijima and Seira Saeki. =JunJun= is the green-haired tomboy of the Quartet. She is athletic and somewhat impulsive. JunJun is referred to as the Magician of Acrobatic Feats. Her Sailor Guardian counterpart is Sailor Jupiter, and her color is green. She is described by Takeuchi as a vulgar \\"Yankee\\"--Japanese slang for a delinquent or rebellious youthAs defined in this dictionary entry .--and uses very informal male speech. She is also said to have dark skin and is the third sister, which corresponds to the number of her asteroid. She was supposed to ride a motorcycle. In the manga it is revealed that she is really Sailor Juno, named for the asteroid Juno and the Roman goddess Juno. In the anime, she often speaks with a hard edge. She tends to dress in biker outfits outside of her circus uniform even though she is never shown to ride a motorbike. She likes to let her targets attain their dreams before she takes their dream mirrors which may be an oddball reference to the mothering aspect of the goddess Juno. She always summons male lemures; the only one of the Quartet to do so. She is voiced by Kumiko Watanabe, and by Yuuko Hara in Crystal film, Sailor Moon Eternal. In the Cloverway English adaptation, Junjun is only member of the Quartet to retain her original name and her voice actor was Brandi Ward. In the Viz Media English adaptation, she is voiced by Erika Ishii. In the musicals she is played by Hitomi Tomashino and Niki Ajima. =VesVes= is the red-haired aggressive member of the Quartet. She is loud, brash, and somewhat violent. VesVes is known as the Magician of Beasts. Her Sailor Guardian counterpart is Sailor Mars, and her color is red. She carries a whip and her hair is tied up in a high ponytail which makes her distinguished from the other members of the Quartet. She is listed as being a \\"Queen\\" and having a darker skin color than JunJun. She is the youngest of the Amazoness Quartet. In the manga it is revealed that she is really Sailor Vesta named after the asteroid Vesta and the Roman goddess Vesta. In Act 39/45 (\\"Dream 6\\"), she uses \\"Steel Ball\\" to send knives at the Sailor Guardians. In the anime, VesVes can appear to lack a sense of reality, rushing into things without realizing what she is doing. She is not as picky about her targets as the other three. She tends to command lemures that are animal-themed. VesVes has the most appearances in the anime out of the four. Junko Hagimori provides her voice in the first anime series, and Rie Takahashi in Crystal film, Sailor Moon Eternal. In the Cloverway English adaptation, her name is changed to \\"Besubesu\\" and she is voiced by Karyn Dwyer. In the Viz Media English adaptation, she is voiced by Erica Lindbeck. In the musicals, she is played by Miho Suzuki. Servants =Zircon= is Zirconia's companion and tool, a flaming eyeball with wings. In the beginning, it simply floats around her staff, but later can fly anywhere, and Zirconia uses it to gather images of those with beautiful dreams. She also uses it as a weapon, or to spy on her underlings. When Zircon is hit hard, any images it has gathered but not yet presented become distorted. It can also be used as a weapon with which to remove a human's Dream Mirror, similar to the Amazon Stones of the Quartet. =Xenotime and Zeolite= and are knife-throwing twins who only appear in the manga. After the failures of the Amazon Trio, they volunteer their services to the Amazoness Quartet. Xenotime, disguised as a talent scout, invites Minako to a fake idol audition set up by the twins and the Quartet in which the participants must undertake a 'survival audition' in a jungle setting. The participants, encouraged by the folk of the Dead Moon, become aggressive and fall prey to the Lemures but Sailors Mercury, Mars and Jupiter intervene before the same can happen to Minako, who has not received a power-up. Xenotime and Zeolite attack all four by throwing knives at them and commanding Lemures. When Minako attains her Super form, she destroys both twins with Venus Love And Beauty Shock. Lemures In the manga, the are spirits of the dead conjured by the Amazoness Quartet. The Amazon Trio are Lemures themselves, created from circus animals by the Quartet to destroy the Sailor Guardians. In the anime, both the Amazon Trio and Amazoness Quartet summon Lemures from their own shadows to assist them in various battles with the Sailor Guardians (mostly using them to fight their battles entirely for them) when on the quest to target people's Dream Mirrors in order to find the Golden Dream Mirror that contains beautiful dreams enough for Pegasus to hide in it. The anime presents them as what remains of Queen Nehelenia's subjects after she took their dream mirrors to stay young. Each member of the Trio and Quartet seems to follow a basic theme with the Lemures they summon in both appearance and naming. The majority of the Lemures seen in the anime are female, but Fisheye and JunJun summon male Lemures instead. In the Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon SuperS ~ Dream Guardians - Love - Into Eternity... musical, a group of clown-like Lemures called Pierrot appeared. Some of them are loyal to Zirconia, while others work under the Amazon Trio. In Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon ~ Beginning of the New Legend, three individual Lemures named Dark Moon, Lemures, and Nightmare appear as subordinates of the Amazon Trio. These three Lemures are also made members of Shadow Galactica in Shin Densetsu Kourin, when Sailor Galaxia forced the Amazon Trio into her service. Dark Moon, Lemures, and Nightmare are respectively portrayed by Ado Endou, Miwa Takanashi, and Miki Kawasaki. \\"Lemures\\" is the singular form of the word as well as the plural. In the anime adaptation, the creatures are renamed Remless (meaning creatures who lost their dreams), possibly a reference to the REM cycle of sleep, during which dreams occur. Reception While reviewing shinto, feminism and anime, author Sarah Reeves considered that Queen Nehelenia's overall misconduct and strategies are the result of a lack of husband and children. According to author Francesca Puglia, the scenes which describe Nehelenia's life in the Moon and her curse on Princess Serenity during the Silver Millennium are one of the few examples in which the \\"legends become concrete once again in the present.\\" In her review of the Sailor Moon SuperS English dubbed blu-ray for Anime News Network, writer Rebecca Silverman described the Dead Moon Circus as a visually interesting element. The Lemures were praised, while the Amazon Trio were described as \\"the real saving grace of this season,\\" no matter in which language the viewer is watching the series. Regarding the English dub itself, Silverman said John Eric Bentley as Tiger's Eye was the highlight. While analyzing the Amazon Trio's outfits, the author wrote they \\"might leave a little something to be desired,\\" with Hawk's Eye in particular being portrayed masculine despite wearing a skirt, which is \\"relatively progressive for the time.\\" In her response to an academic essay on Sailor Moon by Mary Grigsby, author Emily Ravenwood noted the feminine traits of the members of the Amazon Trio, with Hawk's Eye having \\"what look remarkably like breasts under that little chest toga\\", Tiger's Eye having \\"some noticeable hips\\", and Fisheye being \\"the most ambiguous; he looks feminine but is also far too aggressive to fit the typical parameters of femme.\\" Bandai introduced a line of little dolls that included the Amazoness Quartet and, according to Takeuchi, these were their favorite because \\"with their costumes and faithfulness to the originals, the dolls really excelled.\\" References External links * Soul Hunter's Lemures Page * Nethermoon: Queen Nehelenia Category:Animated series villains Category:Anime and manga characters who use magic Category:Comics characters introduced in 1995 Category:Fictional characters with dream manipulation abilities Category:Fictional circus performers Category:Fictional kidnappers Category:Main-belt asteroids in fiction Category:Sailor Moon characters ","title":"Dead Moon Circus"},{"id":"3633888","text":"Little Oberon, directed by Kevin Carlin, is an Australian telemovie starring Sigrid Thornton, which was broadcast on 18 September 2005 by Network Nine.

He studied mathematics and theoretical physics at the University of Oxford, where he earned his Bachelor of Arts and went on to earn his doctorate at Princeton University. While at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, Hoffmann collaborated with Einstein and Leopold Infeld on the classic paper Gravitational Equations and the Problem of Motion. Einstein's original work on general relativity was based on two ideas. The first was the equation of motion: a particle would follow the shortest path in four-dimensional space- time. The second was how matter affects the geometry of space-time. What Einstein, Infeld, and Hoffmann showed was that the equation of motion followed directly from the field equation that defined the geometry (see main article).

Description  Bill Milliken described tough love through the expression, \\"I don't care how this makes you feel toward me. You may hate my guts, but I love you, and I am doing this because I love you.\\" Milliken strongly emphasizes that a relationship of care and love is a prerequisite of tough love, and that it requires that caregivers communicate clearly their love to the subject. Maia Szalavitz believes, based on her own experience, that this may be difficult, since some people experiencing addiction consider themselves unworthy of love and find it difficult to believe others love them. In most uses, there must be some actual love or feeling of affection behind the harsh or stern treatment to be defined as tough love. For example, genuinely concerned parents refusing to support their drug-addicted child financially until he or she enters drug rehabilitation would be said to be practicing tough love.Vine, Sarah. \\"Tough love or TLC?\\", The Times, 31 August 2007.Jardine, Cassandra. \\"The ultimate betrayal or just tough love?\\", Daily Telegraph, 4 March 2009.

They came in a range of denominations from 1 Shilling to 1 Pond. The Orange Free State's postal orders were known in Afrikaans as Post Noot (or Postal Note). The Orange Free State postal notes are inscribed in Afrikaans, even though the Orange Free State's name is given in the Dutch spelling - 'ORANJE VRIJ STAAT', which also appears in the watermark. Issued postal orders do not come with counterfoils, as the counterfoils were kept by the post office for recording purposes. Any postal orders that still have a counterfoil attached are remainders from books, which were souvenired during the Second Boer War. These are of interest to collectors of the Postal Orders. Orange Free State currency issues The Orange Free State and the South African Republic were the first countries in the world to declare postal orders to be legal tender as an emergency currency. At this time, it is currently difficult to distinguish between the currency issues and the normal postal notes. Cashed postal notes The most common postal notes that turn up are the ones that have been cashed within the Orange Free State prior to 1 September 1899. The Orange Free State's postal notes were allowed to be paid in the South African Republic and in the two British colonies (Cape of Good Hope and Natal) as well. The postal notes and postal orders of the other three entities were also allowed to be paid in the Orange Free State under the terms of the South African Postal Union Convention (which came into effect on 1 January 1898), but the postal notes and the postal orders had to be repatriated back to the issuing entity after being cashed. Popularity of the Orange Free State postal notes The Orange Free State's postal notes are very popular with banknote collectors, and in fact, some denominations are listed in the Pick Specialised Catalogue as banknotes, but it is noted there that the paid postal notes are worth half the listed catalogue value. The two most common denominations that turn up are the 1/- and the 5/- postal notes. A postal note that has been paid in the Cape of Good Hope has a 1d. red postage stamp stuck to the back and cancelled with the paying post office's datestamp in addition to the datestamp being applied to the correct area on the face of the postal order. These are regarded by collectors of the postal orders of the Commonwealth of Nations as being worth slightly more than the same item paid within the Orange Free State. It also depends on both the place of issue and the place of encashment. The most difficult of the postal notes to get is the 1 Pond, as there would have been far fewer of the 1 Pond postal notes sold than any other denomination. Denomination chart Catalogue number.

The smaller settlement and holiday location of Pounawea is 4 kilometres away on the estuary of the Catlins and Owaka rivers. History The town's name comes from the MƒÅori for \\"the place of canoes\\", a reference to the town's location close to the ≈åwaka River, which joins the Catlins River three kilometres (2 miles) from the town, close to the coast. The town was originally called Catlins River, then Quakerfield. On 22 June 1896, Owaka became the terminus of the Catlins River Branch railway, and it retained this status until an extension of the branch line to Ratanui was opened on 1 August 1904. The railway ultimately terminated in Tahakopa, but as traffic declined on the line in its later years, the Tuesday freight train (one of four per week) ran only as far as Owaka after 1958.

Options included internal combustion engines fueled by petrol, diesel, propane, or natural gas; hybrid vehicles, plug-in hybrids, fuel cell vehicles fueled by hydrogen and all electric cars. Fueled vehicles seem to have the advantage due to the limited range and high cost of batteries. Some options required construction of a network of fueling or charging stations. With no compelling advantage for any particular option car makers pursued parallel development tracks using a variety of options. Reducing the weight of vehicles was one strategy being employed. Recent developments The use of high-technology (such as electronic engine control units) in advanced designs resulting from substantial investments in development research by European countries and Japan seemed to give an advantage to them over Chinese automakers and parts suppliers who, as of 2013, had low development budgets and lacked capacity to produce parts for high-tech engine and power train designs. Characteristics The chief characteristic of an automotive engine (compared to a stationary engine or a marine engine) is a high power-to-weight ratio. This is achieved by using a high rotational speed. However, automotive engines are sometimes modified for marine use, forming a marine automobile engine. History In the early years, steam engines and electric motors were tried, but with limited success. In the 20th century, the internal combustion (ic) engine became dominant. In 2015, the internal combustion engine remains the most widely used but a resurgence of electricity seems likely because of increasing concern about ic engine exhaust gas emissions. As of 2017, the majority of the cars in the United States are gasoline powered. In the early 1900s, the internal combustion engines faced competition from steam and electric engines. The internal combustion engines of the time was powered by gasoline. Internal combustion engines function with the concept of a piston being pushed by the pressure of a certain explosion.Cummins Jr., Lyle C. (1976) Early IC and Automotive Engines. SAE Technical Papers. Wilsonville: Carnot Press, 760604, 1976. This explosion is burning the hydrocarbon within the cylinder head an engine. Out of all the cars manufactured during the time, only around one fourth are actually considered internal combustion. Within the next couple of years, the internal combustion engine came out to become the most popular automotive engine.L. Collier, James. (2006) Steam Engines. 1st ed. Tarrytown: Cavendish Square Publishing, 2006. Sometime within the 19th century, Rudolf Diesel invented a new form of internal combustion power, using a concept of injecting liquid fuel into air heated solely by compression. This is the predecessor to the modern diesel engine used in automobiles, but more specifically, heavy duty vehicles such as semi-trucks.  Engine types  = Internal combustion engines = Petrol engines quickly became the choice of manufacturers and consumers alike. Despite the rough start, noisy and dirty engine, and the difficult gear shifting, new technologies such as the production line and the advancement of the engine allowed the standard production of the gas automobiles. This is the start, from the invention of the gas automobile in 1876, to the beginning of mass production in the 1890s. Henry Ford's Model T drove down the price of cars to a more affordable price. At the same time, Charles Kettering invented an electric starter, allowing the car to be more efficient than the mechanical starter.The History of the Electric Car. (2014). Energy.gov.

Retrieved from https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Alfred_B_Chambers_Lee_s_American_Automobile_Manual?id=_lYF6H7Q0GYC. To elaborate, an internal combustion used the heat of a combustion created by the injected hydrocarbon fuel to create mechanical motion. At the time of the early 1900s, wood alcohol was a popular fuel for French and German automobiles, but as governments imposed large taxes on the production, the price of wood alcohol rose above that of gasoline. Gasoline engines became popular as a result of this, as internal combustion engines were commonly known as gasoline engines. Although gasoline engines became popular, they were not particularly desirable due to the dangers of fuel leaks that may cause explosions. Therefore, many inventors attempted to create a kerosene burning engine as a result. This was not a successful venture applying it for automotive usage. There are many different types of fuels for internal combustion engines. These include diesel, gasoline, and ethanol. = Steam engines = The steam engine was invented in the late 1700s, and the primary method of powering engines and soon, locomotives. One of the most popular steam automobile was the ‚ÄúStanley Steamer,‚Äù offering low pollution, power, and speed. The downside of these steam automobiles is the unreliability, complexity, and the frequent accidents that occurred with them. The startup time for a steam car may take up to 45 minutes, defeating the purpose of faster transportation. By the time the steam automobile was improved, the complexity of manufacturing relative to the gas automobiles made steam automobiles unprofitable. A steam engine is a device which transforms heat into mechanical motion. This is provided with the usage of boilers, which create steam by boiling water. In the early 1900s, Abner Doble introduced a steam-powered car in the United States which had capabilities that could potentially overpower Ford's Model T in efficiency.Geoghegan, J. (2017). Full Steam Ahead. American History, (1), 26-31. Steam has been known to have very efficient fuel economy with a high power source. That is why half the world was powered by steam for almost the entirety of the 19th century and almost half the 20th century. The main drawback of the steam engine in automobiles was the fact that operators were required to have full knowledge of boilers and steam engines before operating, as it was detrimental to the engine itself if the operator neglected it. = Electric motors = Electric vehicles seemed to be the most viable option, similar to the steam automobiles. It was first invented in the early 1800s, and became a viable option of transportation around 1890, when William Morrison created the first electric car that traveled 14 miles per hour. The electric cars offered low pollution and a soundless ride, unlike their gasoline counterparts. The greatest downside of electric cars was the range. The typical electric car could reach around 20 miles before requiring a recharge. Manufacturers could not increase the number of batteries, due to the bulkiness of the batteries at the time. Without an incentive to purchase the electric automobiles, gas automobiles was the most viable option at the time. Electric cars use batteries to store electricity which is used to power electric motors. The battery delivers the power to the motor, which is either AC or DC. The difference between AC and DC motors is the sort of system that is required to run it in an electric vehicle. An AC motor is generally cheaper but the components required to run it in an electric vehicle such as the controller and inverter makes it more expensive than the DC motor. A unique feature of electric vehicles compared to its gasoline counterparts, the electric vehicle is more simple than the gasoline vehicle.Schwitters, C. (2017). AC versus DC charging - what is the difference - Plug In America. Plug In America. Retrieved 11 April 2017, from https://pluginamerica.org/ac-versus-dc-charging-what-difference/ The electric vehicle bypasses the gasoline car components such as the crankshaft which allows it to generate power much faster than gasoline. Because of the faster transfer of power, the electric vehicle is able to accelerate faster than gasoline cars.How Do Battery Electric Cars Work?. (2017). Union of Concerned Scientists. Retrieved 11 April 2017, from http://www.ucsusa.org/clean- vehicles/electric-vehicles/how-do-battery-electric-cars-work#.WOqfj_ krK70 In the 1970s, the electric vehicle made its reappearance because of the 1973 OPEC Oil Embargo. Previously, the abundant gasoline had become the prime source of fuel for vehicles. But after the shortage, manufacturers began looking towards electric vehicles again. Despite the improved technology from the 1800s, the electric vehicles faced similar technological flaws such as limited mileage and speed. They could only travel up to 45 miles per hour and had a range of approximately 40 miles.Alternative Fuels Data Center: How Do All-Electric Cars Work?. (2017). Afdc.energy.gov.

Its headquarters are located in Ageo, Saitama, Japan. The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Volvo Group since 2007. Until 2010, the company was known as Nissan Diesel. The UD name was originally used for the company's Uniflow Diesel Engine (a two-stroke diesel engine), developed in 1955, but is now marketed as meaning \\"Ultimate Dependability\\". History =1935‚Äì1949= In December 1935, Nihon Diesel Industries, Ltd, in Kawaguchi, Japan on the outskirts of Tokyo was established under the leadership of Kenzo Adachi, where he purchased diesel engine schematics from a Krupp-Junkers patent. The company started production of KD-series 2-cycle diesel engines after entering into partnership and technology exchange with Friedrich Krupp AG. In November 1939, to test the durability of the LD1 truck, the company went on a test drive across Japan. The drive went to the villages of Hakone, Osaka, Kyoto, Gero, Ikaho, Niigata and Aizu before returning to Kawaguchi. The route was on very primitive mountain roads and very rural conditions. The truck returned 13 days later on November 20 without incurring any failure, and soon the trucks reliability became known. In 1940 production of 4.5-ton-payload TT6 series trucks started, and in 1942 the company was now known as Kanega-Fuchi Diesel Co., Ltd. In development of 7.5-ton-payload TN93 series trucks, featuring the largest payload capacity in the Japanese market, and the nation's first monocoque-type BR3 series buses with rear-mounted engines. In 1946 the company name changed to Minsei Industries, Ltd. In 1949 development of 7.5-ton-payload TN93 series trucks started. =1950‚Äì1959= In 1950 Minsei Diesel Industries, Ltd. was spun off from Minsei Industries; and the company was on the way to becoming a comprehensive transport equipment manufacturer. In 1955 the UD name was born, when Minsei Diesel Industries introduced a range uniflow-scavenging 2-cycle diesel engine. Of course, the UD stood for \\"Uniflow Diesel\\", named after the engine they had invented for use in their trucks. The production of various trucks and buses with 81 kW (110 PS) UD3, 110 kW (150 PS) UD4 and 169 kW (230 PS) UD6 engines began. In 1957 the development of Japan's first RFA series air-suspension buses and 10-ton-payload 6TW10 series trucks called \\"Jumbo\\" in overseas markets began. =1960‚Äì1969= Nissan Diesel 780 In 1960, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. acquired Minsei Diesel, and was renamed Nissan Diesel Motor Co., Ltd. Forward-control trucks and truck tractors were also introduced. In 1963, there was the initial production of compact 4-cycle 40 kW (55PS) SD20 and 44 kW (60PS) SD22 diesel engines. 70 to 80-ton crane-carrier truck series were also introduced to the line-up. 1969 saw the introduction of 4-cycle 136 kW (185PS) PD6 and 99 kW (135 PS) ND6 diesel engines for heavy- duty vehicles. Diesel products were sold in Japan at a separate dealership sales channel called Nissan Diesel. In 1969, the 780-series replaced the 680-series bonneted truck. =1970‚Äì1979= Nissan Diesel CW 340 In 1971 the heavy Nissan Diesel C-series arrived, being replaced by the second generation in 1979. 1972 saw the marketing of V-type 206 kW (280 PS) RD8 and 257 kW (350 PS) RD10 diesel engines. In 1973, light-duty trucks were produced for the Nissan Motor Company. =1980‚Äì1989= U31L In 1982 there was the introduction of new forward-control cab for the CWA52/45 series trucks (sold as the Nissan Diesel Resona in Japan), CKA-T series truck tractors and ultra-modern U(A)21, U(A)31, RA51 series buses. As of 1985 the company had a wide range of light-, medium- and heavy-duty trucks, as well as buses and special-purpose vehicles such as crane carriers. In 1989 there was an agreement with IVECO of Italy to jointly develop low-pollution diesel engines. =1990‚Äì1999= Jonckheere Monaco In 1992 Nissan Diesel Philippines Corp. started manufacturing deluxe coaches in cooperation with Jonckheere Bus & Coach NV/SA of Belgium. In 1995 Nissan Diesel produced its two millionth vehicles since commencing production in May 1950. 1996 brought about the establishment of PT Astra Nissan Diesel Indonesia, a joint venture company with Marubeni Corporation and Astra International, and the Dongfeng Nissan Diesel Motor Co., Ltd, a joint venture company with Sumitomo Corporation and Dongfeng Motor Corporation. =2000‚Äì2009= Space Runner A In 2000 Nissan Diesel introduced new heavy-duty trucks in Japan and Asian countries. It also acquired the sales operation from Nissan Diesel Sales Co., Ltd. In 2003, Nissan Motor and Nissan Diesel reached a basic agreement on a light-duty truck joint venture. There was also the signing of development assistance contract for air suspension of buses with China's Dongfeng Motor Corporation. Nissan Diesel was purchased by the Volvo Group in 2007, becoming a subsidiary. After the transaction between Nissan Motor and Volvo, Nissan Diesel's business relations with Nissan Motors continued as normal and the Nissan Diesel and UD brand names remained unchanged. Volvo also acquired the truck division of Renault in 2001. Starting from 2007, the OEM supply agreement between Nissan Diesel and Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation became effective, with both companies supplying engines to each other for use in new buses, and supplying some buses to each other with the partner's badge. =2010‚Äìpresent= A Volvo UD bus on trial runs in Bangalore, India On 1 February 2010, Nissan Diesel changed its name to UD Trucks. At the same time Nissan Diesel Trucks Japan, a 100% owned sales company of UD Trucks in Japan, changed its name to UD Trucks Japan. On September 12, 2012, UD Trucks of North America announced that it will no longer be part of the North American truck market. Reasons given for this decision was a combination of factors, including the continued shrinking of the cab-over-engine market segment and the accelerating cost of regulatory compliance. In 2013, UD Trucks launched the UD Quester at Bangkok, a new heavy-duty truck for developing countries. In 2014, UD Trucks merged with UD Trucks Japan. That same year, Volvo's Volvo Buses started to market UD buses in India. The first model for that market, the UD SLF, was introduced in 2015. In 2015, UD Trucks renewed its headquarters building in Ageo. In 2016, UD Trucks started selling the Kazet, a new light-duty for the Japanese market that is supplied by Mitsubishi Fuso. In December of that year, it sold its stake in Dongvo (previously Dongfeng Nissan Diesel), a joint venture with Dongfeng Motor Group, which was renamed as Dongfeng Nengdi. In 2017, UD Trucks launched new versions of the Quon and Condor trucks. The Condor, a medium-duty truck, is supplied by Isuzu as part of an OEM agreement, mainly for the Japanese market. The company also launched a new Croner and the light-duty Kuzer, both aimed at developing countries. In December 2019 Volvo signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding to form a strategic alliance with Isuzu. As part of the agreement, Volvo plans to eventually transfer UD Trucks to Isuzu. Markets UD Trucks are marketed in over 60 countries. Some of the main markets are Japan, South Africa, Australia, Asia and the Middle East. UD Trucks Southern Africa's head office and assembly plant is in Rosslyn, Gauteng and includes a competency development centre. There are 36 UD Trucks dealers and service agents in South Africa and another 30 in other southern African countries, including Angola, Malawi, Mozambique, Mauritius, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

It comprises the main antagonists of the second major story arc, which is called the Black Moon in the manga and Sailor Moon Crystal, and which fills most of its Sailor Moon R anime adaptation. They are first introduced in chapter #14 \\"Black Moon K≈çan ‚Äì Sailor Mars\\", first published in Nakayoshi on March 3, 1993. In the DIC English adaptation, their name is changed to the \\"Negamoon Family\\". Members of the Black Moon Clan are descendants of anarchists who opposed Crystal Tokyo, claiming that the governing group was corrupt and the resulting increase in human longevity by the Silver Crystal was a crime against nature. The founding leaders of the Black Moon were guided by Wiseman to the , a phantom planet that can conceal itself from anything save X-Rays and produce shards of the . All members of the Black Moon Clan have black, upside-down crescents on their foreheads (the inverse of the marking of Silver Millennium). They wear earrings which, according to the Materials Collection, are made of Black Crystal and allow them to teleport. Creation and conception Series creator Naoko Takeuchi originally intended Sailor Moon to last one season, but due to its popularity, Toei Animation asked her to keep drawing the manga series. Takeuchi stated she had difficulty developing a story for the second arc, and the whole idea of Sailor Moon's daughter coming from a future attacked by the Black Moon Clan came from her editor, Fumio Osano. To give Takeuchi enough time to develop the second arc, Toei introduced in the anime the Hell Tree aliens, thus the Black Moon Clan does not feature in the first thirteen episodes of Sailor Moon R. In the DIC English adaptation of the anime, the Black Moon Clan is called \\"Negamoon Family\\".https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=COcyAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=vgcGAAAAIBAJ&pg;=1971,3417888&dq;=sailor+moon&hl;=en The term \\"Nega-\\" was also used for the \\"Negaverse\\" (the Dark Kingdom) in this adaptation, implying that the Black Moon Clan is related in some way to Queen Beryl and her cause, since the Dark Kingdom members use the term \\"Nega-\\" as a common prefix (e.g. \\"negapower\\", \\"negahistory\\" or \\"negamonsters\\"). The Black Moon Clan members follow the pattern of the Dark Kingdom of using minerals as namesakes. Four key figures of the Clan use the four precious stones: ruby, emerald, sapphire and diamond. The Specter Sisters are named after minerals kermesite, berthierite, petzite and calaverite. The Boule Brothers do not follow this pattern; instead, they are named after the scientific terms chirality and achirality. However, the term 'boule' (sounded out in katakana) is accompanied by the kanji '‰∫∫ÈÄ†ÂÆùÁü≥', literally meaning a \\"man-made gemstone\\"; synthetic/artificial gemstones; and the English term 'boule' means \\"A single crystal ingot produced by synthetic means\\". Key figures =Prince Demand= is the leader of Planet Nemesis in the 30th century. He is the older brother of Saphir. Because of the Black Moon Clan's beliefs that the Legendary Silver Crystal is a corruptive force, Wiseman sought Demand out and convinced him to use the Malefic Black Crystal's power against Crystal Tokyo. Demand and his allies initially plan to use the Black Crystal's time manipulative powers to travel back in time to the 20th century as part of \\"Operation: Replay\\", intending kill the past versions of the \\"White Moon\\" members who established Crystal Tokyo: The Sailor Guardians and Mamoru. But Demand, wanting to see the Legendary Silver Crystal's power for himself, launched an attack that wiped out most of Crystal Tokyo in a display of power. It resulted with Demand encountering Neo-Queen Serenity as she rushed out of the Crystal Palace in search of her daughter, Chibiusa. This led to Demand becoming obsessed with Neo-Queen Serenity, which extended to her past self Usagi Tsukino as he abducted her during her visit to the 30th century. Demand intends to force Usagi to submit to him, but she eventually manages to escape. Demand later turns on Wiseman upon realizing that he used him and the rest of the Black Moon Clan, and is forced to kill Saphir as his brother is under Wiseman's spell. Demand then steals the Silver Crystal of the present from Usagi and the one of the future from Black Lady, and attempts to bring them together to destroy the time-space continuum. But Sailor Pluto uses her forbidden Time Stop attack and prevent, with Demand attacking Usagi before she and Tuxedo Mask combine their powers to destroy him. In the first anime adaptation, Demand has a similar story, with some differences. He initially intends to reason with Neo-Queen Serenity, explaining that he and his people are descendants of criminals, not criminals themselves. It is Wiseman, and not Demand himself, who kills Saphir, because the latter told his older brother that Wiseman has been manipulating them. In the final confrontation, Usagi too tries to persuade Demand to see that he is being manipulated by Wiseman. Between what Sailor Moon said and what he remembered Saphir trying to tell him, Demand is then positive that Wiseman was using him. When Wiseman tries to kill Usagi, Demand shields her from Wiseman's damage. Though fatally injured, he musters up enough strength to temporarily subdue Wiseman. Demand begged Usagi for forgiveness and asked her to watch over the remaining inhabitants of Nemesis, later dying in her arms. In the anime reboot Sailor Moon Crystal, Demand's story closely follows that of the manga, but his death is similar to the first anime as he shields Sailor Moon from Death Phantom's attack. While openly stating his reason to personally kill her, Demand accepted her as his queen before being imploded by Death Phantom's power. In the Sailor Moon: Another Story video game, Demand is encountered in the Moon Kingdom during Queen Beryl's invasion and ends up kidnapping Sailor Moon. Esmeraude mentions that Demand had the Barazuishou. When the Sailor Guardians catch up to Demand, the group is attacked by Sin. When the Guardians repel Sin, she manages to make a fatal blow on Demand quoting \\"That was for my mom and dad.\\" Demand states that this is not the destiny he wanted and if he could have changed, it would have been so that there would not be any battles between the Black Moon Clan and Crystal Tokyo. Before he dies, he tells the Guardians to head to the future for if the future does not change, the present will. In the Japanese series, Prince Demand is voiced by Kaneto Shiozawa until episode 41 of Sailor Moon R, and by Mamoru Miyano in Crystal and all media since. In the DIC English adaptation, his name is changed to Prince Diamond and is voiced by Robert Bockstael. In the Viz Media English adaptation, he is voiced by Matthew Mercer. In the musical adaptation, he has been played by Hikari Ono. Hikari jokingly commented that she was given \\"this completely unfeminine prince role\\",Sailor Moon Musical, 2001 Tanjou!

These include Hawk's Eye, Kou Taiki, and Loof Merrow.Sera-Myu.com - Ono Hikari =Rubeus= is a red-haired human and the first member of the Black Moon Clan to appear in the 20th century. Introducing himself as the Black Moon's military commander, he is charged with the capture of Chibiusa after she fled into 20th Century Tokyo while sending the Specter Sisters on missions to ensure Operation Replay's success Though the Specter sisters were each killed off, Rubeus managed to bring the captive Sailors Mars, Mercury, and Jupiter to Nemesis. Despite being loyal to Demand, his suspicions gaining further incentive when Neo-Serenity channeled herself through Sailor Moon, Rubeus expressed distrust towards Wiseman. It eventually resulted with Rubeus being strangled to death by Wiseman when he attempted to flee during the meltdown of Malefic Black Crystal Reactor. In Sailor Moon R, using an actual UFO rather than a time- space portal, Rubeus is presented in a more negative light as he is less sympathetic to the Specter Sisters and uses their love to take advantage of them as his expendable pawns. After the Specter Sisters were purified by Sailor Moon, warned by Esmeraude that Demand is losing his patience with him, Rubeus capture's Usagi's protectors to force her into handing over the Silver Crystal. In the ensuing battle, Chibiusa destroys the crystal controlling his ship, freeing the Sailor Guardians as they return to Earth. Esmeraude reminds Rubeus that he has failed too many times and that she is assuming command, before leaving Rubeus to die in the explosion. Rubeus appears as a boss in the Another Story video game. He is encountered in the past outside of the Ark near the Temple of Venus in Rias. In the anime, Crimson Rubeus was voiced by Wataru Takagi and by Hiroki Takahashi in Crystal. In the DIC English adaptation, he was voiced by Robert Tinkler. In the Viz Media English adaptation, he is voiced by Steve Cannon. In the musicals, Rubeus was portrayed by Hiroyuki Ichikawa and Riona Tatemichi. =Esmeraude= is a green-haired woman and the second of the Black Moon Clan to appear. She is a selfish, vain woman with an obsessed infatuation with Prince Demand, emulating a goddess-like appearance by wearing an elegant, tight-fitting dress along with opera-length gloves and knee-high stiletto boots. She has a distinctive laugh, loud and piercing, and is the most comedic member of the Black Moon. After she and her subordinates Chiral and Achiral, fail to kill Sailors Moon and Venus when they, Tuxedo Mask, and Chibiusa reach Crystal Tokyo, Esmeraude undertakes the mission \\"Code: Extra, Operation: Relax\\" to personally kill Chibusa. When the two Sailor Guardians and Tuxedo Mask intervene, Esmeraude uses the Beast Arms ability she received from Wiseman to overwhelm them. But King Endymion's spirit appears behind Tuxedo Mask, allowing him to channel his future self's power to kill Esmeraude with a Tuxedo La Bomber attack. In the first anime adaptation, warning Rubeus that Prince Demand is getting impatient and later leaving him to die, Esmeraude takes over the attacks on 20th Tokyo while expressing her disdain for Demand's obsession with Neo-Serenity/Sailor Moon. Consumed by her jealousy and greed, Esmeraude receives a magic tiara from Wiseman that will give her the power to kill the Guardians after they arrive to Crystal Tokyo. But Esmeraude ends up being transformed into a dragon, battling the Guardians when she attacks the Crystal Palace and is defeated by Sailor Moon. Reverted to her original state, Esmeraude plunges into a back void to her doom while her last words reach Demand. Esmeraude appears as a boss in the Another Story video game. She is encountered in the past at the Kainess Ice Caves an optional boss where the Guardians fight her in dragon form and then in normal form. She mentions that Prince Demand has the Barazuishou. She is voiced by Mami Koyama and by Houko Kuwashima in Crystal. In the DIC English adaptation, her name is changed to Emerald and is voiced by Kirsten Bishop. In the Viz Media English adaptation, she is played by Rena S. Mandel. In the musical, she is played by Miki Kawasaki and Mitsumi Hiromura. =Saphir= is the Black Moon's alchemist, and the loyal younger brother of Prince Demand. He is more cautious and rational than his companions. He is the only member of the Clan that does not wear earrings made from Black Crystal, despite having invented them. Saphir prefers to work with droids creations and maintaining Nemesis's Malefic Black Crystal Reactor, which he compared to his brother in being unpredictable. While Saphir questioned Wiseman's intentions and Demand's lack of reasoning as on the grounds that the latter's reasoning is being eroded, he only got his brother's disdain to be being by accused of wanting the power for himself. When Demand brings Usagi to Nemesis and she stumbled into the reactor room, Saphir admits that their plans were insensible and that she was guiltless yet tries to kill her on the grounds that she and the Silver Crystal are still a source of conflict. But the 20th century Silver Crystal activates and its energies cause the reactor to meltdown, with Nemesis undergoing an evolution while Saphir and Demand are rescued by Black Lady and brought before Wiseman. Wiseman uses his power to place Saphir under his control and bestows with Beast Hands, only for Saphir to be killed off by a reluctant Demand who apologizes for his earlier remarks about his brother's loyalty to him. In the first anime adaptation, Saphir grows up on Nemesis with Demand, who promised him that they will go to Earth one day and see real flowers. When Saphir overhears Wiseman's plans, he barely escapes with use the stolen Malefic Black Crystal to travel to 20th Century Earth where his wounds are tended to by the Specter Sisters before the Sailor Guardians come to his aid. When Demand appears, Saphir attempts to warn him before Wiseman kills him in midsentence. Demand carries his brother's lifeless body, with the Black Moon no longer on his forehead, away to be properly buried. In the Another Story video game, Saphir is encountered in the Moon Kingdom during Queen Beryl's invasion. He directs the Guardians to the basement of the Moon Palace where Prince Demand is holding Sailor Moon, later sacrificing himself to protect his brother from Sin. Blue Saphir is voiced by Tsutomu Kashiwakura and by Tsubasa Yonaga in Crystal. In the DIC English adaptation, his name is changed to Sapphire and he is voiced by Lyon Smith. In the Viz Media English adaptation, he is played by Greg Felden. In the musicals, he is played by Yuri Kuroda and Sora Manami. =Death Phantom= , acting under the identity of , is an immortal form of Chaos from the future. Before the events of the series, Death Phantom was originally a human who lived in the city Crystal Tokyo, and possessed dark powers which he used to reintroduce chaos and mayhem to the utopia with powers like his extending Beast Hands and his hypnotic Evil Sight. Death Phantom was later defeated by Neo-Queen Serenity, who banished him to the planet Nemesis where he will live out the rest of his days. But when Death Phantom died, his spirit and consciousness integrated into Nemesis, becoming the planet itself. He cloaked his decayed and crumbled human body to serve as a puppet and returned to Earth under the identity of Wiseman to find discontent among humans, recruiting the founding members of the Black Moon Clan whose hate towards 30th-century utopia of Crystal Tokyo and the Silver Crystal he exploited for his own. Wiseman provided the Black Moon with his Malefic Black Crystal, orchestrating their attack on Crystal Tokyo and 20th century Tokyo to shatter the Silver Crystal while exacting his revenge on Neo-Queen Serenity. Wiseman later acquires the future Silver Crystal from Chibiusa whom he corrupted into Black Lady to take the 20th century Silver Crystal as well, revealing his true colors and form as Death Phantom. But Death Phantom is destroyed when Sailor Moon and the recently awaken Sailor Chibi Moon use their Silver Crystals to obliterate the entirety of Nemesis. In the anime adaptation, the Black Moon Clan were the descendants of evil people who fled to Nemesis after having attacked Crystal Tokyo centuries before. Posing as Wiseman, Death Phantom approached Prince Demand and Saphir when they were younger. He manipulated the clan into gathering power for him, with the ultimate goal being the opening of the Dark Gate. He promised he could give them the power and ability to go to Earth and conquer it to avenge their ancestors whom Wiseman claimed had been shunned away to Nemesis by the people of Earth. Wiseman's influence warped the minds of his pawns until they carried out his true plan for the ultimate destruction of the planet Earth. Wiseman counsels Rubeus during his mission for a long time, but is unconcerned about his death. He humiliates Esmeraude when she comes to him asking to be the queen of Nemesis, and brings about her transformation into a dragon and, ultimately, her doom at the hands of Sailor Moon. He manipulates Chibiusa's childhood memories to make her believe that her past was unhappy and that she is always alone, turning her into Black Lady. Wiseman kills Saphir when Saphir realizes that he and his brother have been lied to. He ultimately kills Prince Demand when the man shielded Sailor Moon from his energy-blade. In the end, Death Phantom is killed, but Nemesis and its remaining inhabitants are saved. He is voiced by Eiji Maruyama in the original series and by Hiroshi Iwasaki in Sailor Moon Crystal. In the DIC English adaptation, Wiseman is voiced by Tony Daniels. In the Viz Media English adaptation, he is voiced by Steve Kramer. In the 2000 musical Tanjou! Ankoku no Princess Black Lady, he was portrayed by Kenji Tominaga. =Black Lady= Black Lady is the evil form that Chibiusa assumed under Wiseman's influence, using her frustration of finding her place in the 30th Century to bring out her dark, malicious side and serve as his right hand. As Chibiusa's dream was to finally grow up and become a beautiful lady like her mother, Black Lady's form is something like a femme fatale with an overblown Electra complex. Like her original self, she is voiced by Kae Araki in the first series and by Misato Fukuen in Crystal. In the DIC English adaptation, Black Lady's name is changed to Wicked Lady and is voiced by Liz Brown. In the Viz Media adaptation, she is voiced by Sandy Fox. Specter Sisters The are a group of women that serve under Rubeus, bearing the Black Moon insignia and wear earrings made of Black Crystal with each possessing a supernatural ability. They serve as the Black Moon's first line of offense in their attack on 20th Century Tokyo, their primary missions being the removal of Sailor Moon's four protectors and the capture of Chibiusa. In the first anime adaptation, the Specter Sisters appear more frequently with their characters are expanded as shallow while eventually regretting their upbringing on Nemesis. Their mission is slightly altered to target strategic points that would be essential to Crystal Tokyo in the future. Compared to the manga and Crystal, the Specter Sisters are purified and allowed to remain in the 20th century while running a makeup stand. The Specter Sisters appear as bosses on a spaceship in the Another Story video game. =K≈çan= is the youngest of the Specter Sisters and represents a counterpart of Sailor Mars. Her name is short for and her attack is \\"Dark Fire\\", which is called \\"Ice Fire\\" in the original dub. Sensing Mars, K≈çan receives Rubeus's blessing to \\"Code: 001, Operation: Recruit\\": Posing as a T.A Girls Academy student who is president of the supernatural club called the Black Moon. K≈çan uses her fortunetelling ability to predict the impending deaths of people to recruit those she promises will die painlessly for the Black Moon's cause. She also uses her Dark Fire to incinerate others under the cover of Spontaneous human combustion. Rei confronts K≈çan so she reveals her true self, while Rei transforms into Sailor Mars. In the ensuing battle, K≈çan traps Sailor Mars in a fire barrier but is killed by Sailor Moon when she first acquired the Cutie Moon Rod. In the first anime, K≈çan is very vain about her appearance to the point of swearing death upon anyone who smudges her make-up or ruins her hair, and she relies on her charms to get what she wants. She thinks that she and Rubeus are in a relationship, and competes with her sisters for his love. K≈çan directly fights Sailor Mars and the others several times, with the climatic battle taking place at the Hikawa Shrine. After K≈çan fails to capture Chibiusa, Rubeus reveals that she is a pawn and that he never loved her. K≈çan snaps and attacks everyone in a blind rage, until Sailor Mars saves K≈çan from getting hit by Sailor Jupiter, and convinces her that she is a good person that has been caught in a life of evil and that she deserves a second chance. She becomes the first sister purified with Sailor Moon's Silver Crystal. She later convinces each of her sisters to let Sailor Moon purify them. In Japanese, K≈çan is voiced by Wakana Yamazaki in Sailor Moon R and by Satsuki Yukino in Crystal. In the DiC English adaptation, her name is changed to Catzi and is first voiced by Alice Poon and later Mary Long. In the Viz Media English adaptation, she is voiced by Eden Riegel. In the musicals she is portrayed by Seiko Takuma and Hinami Someya. =Berthier= is the second youngest sister and represents a counterpart of Sailor Mercury. Her name is based on the mineral berthierite and her magical attack is \\"Dark water\\", carrying a dowsing pendulum made of Malefic Black Crystal. Berthier is sent by Rubeus to enact \\"Code: 002, Operation: Remove\\" to elimination all opposition to the Black Moon which includes the Sailor Guardians. Berthier disguises herself as a normal human and wows people with her dowsing abilities prior to finding Ami Mizuno and deducing her as Sailor Mercury when she used her power to find a leak in a pipe at the school. Skilled at chess, Berthier goes on television to challenge Ami to a chess match. After losing the match despite having the advantage, a fight breaks out as Berthier manages to capture Mercury in a water barrier for the Black Moon before being killed by Sailor Moon. In Sailor Moon R, Berthier has a very darkly playful personality, but is shown to have great respect for all of her sisters. She is the only one shown to be upset when K≈çan is purified by the Silver Crystal. As with Ami, she is also a strategist and is incredibly talented at chess, though she apparently also cheats. She confronts Sailor Mercury in a game of chess. However, she is mocked for her failure by Calaveras and Petz, but K≈çan persuades her that she is still loved and has a second chance. Berthier allows Sailor Moon to heal her. Later, she and K≈çan, along with the Guardians, are able to convince their other two sisters to join them and become normal women. She is voiced by Yuri Amano in Sailor Moon R and by Rumi Kasahara in Crystal. In the DiC English adaptation, her name is changed to Bertie and she is voiced by Kathleen Laskey. In the Viz Media English adaptation, she is voiced by Cindy Robinson. She is the only sister that does not appear in the first version of Ankoku no Princess Black Lady musical, but does she appear in the revision portrayed by Manami Wakayama. =Petz= is the oldest of the four sisters and is a counterpart of Sailor Jupiter. She is named for the mineral petzite and her attack is \\"Dark Thunder\\". Petz asks Rubeus to allow her the chance to avenge K≈çan and Berthier by enacting \\"Code: 003, Operation: Renew\\": infecting those among Tokyo populace with a debilitating cold so they can be replaced with Droids. Makoto is infected by one of the viruses and destroys a Droid double that attacks her while she starts to pass out in her apartment. Petz manages to take advantage of Jupiter's weakened condition to capture her in a barrier before being obliterated from behind by Sailor Moon. In Sailor Moon R, Petz often clashes with Calaveras, but the majority of both women's operations end up with them working together. She is very proud and is willing to step on others to achieve personal glory and power. She also appears bitter over a past relationship and reacts strongly when Calaveras teases her about it. After the treachery of K≈çan and Berthier, Rubeus gives her a stick and instructs her to use it to kill the Sailor Guardians and reconvert her fallen sisters. The stick dramatically increases Petz's powers and also corrupts her personality; however, the Guardians intervene. Rubeus appears and reveals he did not expect Petz to defeat the Guardians and activates the stick to create a massive time- vacuum that threatens to pull in everyone around it. No longer possessed, Petz decides that she has enough power in her body to destroy the stick and jumps into the vortex to sacrifice herself to stop it. However, she is stopped by her other three sisters who convince her that they still love her. After the vortex is destroyed by the Guardians, Petz is purified along with Calaveras. Later, Petz and her sisters soon discover a wounded Saphir, whom Petz tends to even though she at first thinks he came to punish her sisters. It is then that Petz and Saphir are revealed to have been romantically involved, and that Saphir is the person who caused Petz to be embittered about men. After Saphir is killed by Wiseman, Petz senses his death and is heartbroken, but remembers how he smiled for her. In Japanese, Petz is voiced by Megumi Ogata in Sailor Moon R, and by Wasabi Mizuta in Crystal. In the DIC English adaptation, her name is changed to \\"Prizma\\" and is voiced by Norma Dell'Agnese. In the Viz Media English adaptation, she is voiced by Jessica Gee. Petz is one of two female characters in the musical series to have been portrayed by trans woman actress Karen Yoda, and in another musical she is portrayed by Ai Ikegami. =Calaveras= is the second oldest of the sisters and is a counterpart of Sailor Venus. She is named for the mineral calaverite and her attack is \\"Dark Beauty\\". The last of the Specter Sisters to attack, Calaveras is sent by Rubeus to enact \\"Code: 004, Operation: Rebirth\\": using her powers of Mediumship to have Rubeus speak through her during a televised interview to promote a televised gathering of people the following day. The plan was for Calaveras to use her channeling powers to brainwash everyone at the event into joining a cult dedicated to the Black Moon. When Minako confronts her at the channeling, Artemis taking out TV cameras to prevent their enemy's influence from extending to the worldwide audience, Calaveras channels the three captive Sailor Guardians through the hypnotized Naru Osaka, Ittou Asanuma and Kotono Sarashina. Calaveras then uses her captives to channel the spirits of her sisters to use a Spirit Attack against Minako with the intend to kill, revealing that Rubeus is going after Usagi and Chibiusa at that moment. But Rubeus fails in eliminating them and Calaveras is killed by Sailor Moon when she comes to Sailor Venus's aid. In Sailor Moon R, Calaveras is a petty woman who indulges in relentlessly teasing her other siblings, especially Petz. She also appears unwilling to do anything for herself. She never accepts a single mission and instead tags along on several of Petz's missions. Even her final mission is one of Petz's, in which the elder sister was asked to use a powerful stick to kill the Guardians and reclaim her now purified siblings K≈çan and Berthier. While on the mission, Petz, corrupted by the stick, attempts to kill everyone, Calaveras included. Shocked by Petz's treachery, Calaveras is shown pity by Sailor Moon and eventually comes to understand human love. She then tells the other Guardians about the stick's power. When Rubeus arrives and uses the stick to create a time-vacuum on the bridge, Calaveras stops Petz from falling into the vortex by catching her sister using her whip. After the Guardians destroy the stick, Calaveras accepts purification and becomes a normal human woman. In Japanese, she is voiced by Akiko Hiramatsu in Sailor Moon R, and by Tomoe Hanba in Crystal. In the DIC English adaptation, her name is changed to \\"Avery\\" and is voiced by Jennifer Griffiths. In the Viz Media English adaptation, she is voiced by Cassandra Morris. In the musicals, she is portrayed by Ado Endoh. Servants =Boule Brothers= The and are two Black Moon Clan members who are under the service of Esmeraude, even appearing on her page in the Materials Collection art book. The brothers' mission is \\"Code: 005, Operation: Remake.\\" They greet the Sailor Guardians when they arrive in Crystal Tokyo. They create a replica of the Crystal Palace as a trap. When Sailor Moon attacks them, she is paralyzed by a magnetic field from a man-made crystal at her feet. Tuxedo Mask destroys the crystal by willing it to break, and the brothers are killed. In Sailor Moon R, the brothers grow \\"Dark Henges\\" at J≈´ban Park and J≈´ban Elementary School. They cause all of the pupils and teachers at the school to fight each other. They attack Chibiusa's best friend, Momoko Momohara. The Guardians fight off Chiral and Achiral, but are at a disadvantage until Chibiusa unleashes her power and attacks them after Momoko takes a hit while trying to protect Chibiusa. They are finally destroyed by Sailor Moon with her Moon Princess Halation attack. In the DIC English dub, they are called \\"Doom and Gloom\\". Chiral and Achiral are respectively voiced by Masashi Ebara and Ryotaro Okiayu in the original series, and by Wataru Hatano and Kazunari Tanaka in Sailor Moon Crystal and all media since. In the Viz Media English adaptation, Chiral is voiced by Doug Erholtz and Achiral is voiced by Kyle Hebert. =Spotted Tilmun= was a musical-only character who appeared only in Tanjou! Ankoku no Princess Black Lady. Although it was never explained why, he had a half crescent moon on his forehead, for which Esmeraude looked down on him. He shared a friendship with Aaron and Manna because they were misfits within the Clan. When the Black Moon Clan held a contest to lure out the Sailor Guardians, he acted as the announcer under the name \\"Roppongi Tilmun.\\" When Death Phantom began killing the Black Moon members, Tilmun died protecting Aaron and Manna. He was played by Ikuya Moro. The character did not appear in the revision. =Aaron and Manna= and were musical-only characters who appeared only in Tanjou! Ankoku no Princess Black Lady. They are twin girls belonging to the Black Moon Clan. Neither have the Black Moon symbol on their foreheads, and the acceptance into the clan as full members is a minor plot in the musical Tanjou! Ankoku no Princess Black Lady and its revision. Aaron and Manna wear inverted costumes, Aaron wears purple while Manna wears red. They had parents from Nemesis and Earth. They are sent by Wiseman to convince Chibiusa that nobody cares for her. When given a rose each by Tuxedo Mask, the two begin to have doubts about invading Earth. When Tuxedo Mask is seduced by Black Lady, Aaron and Manna give him back the roses, breaking the spell and distracting Black Lady long enough for Tuxedo Mask to take her Silver Crystal. They are killed by Wiseman after Black Lady is reverted to Chibiusa. Aaron is played by Nagisa Adaniya and Manna by Kasumi Suzuki. Droids The are the Black Moon Clan's army of monsters of the week. The droids are robot-like creatures resembling sand figurines; they have no eyes or mouths, and they can only produce screeching noises rather than words. The droids were manufactured by Saphir, using the power of the Black Crystal, and are all similar in shape and form; however, they are able to take on the guise of humans. In the first anime adaptation, all of the droids are individuals with feminine forms, and all can talk. When they are destroyed, they dissolve into a pile of sand, implying that they are similar to their manga counterparts, though they also produce a gemstone with the Clan's moon on it that fades away after its defeat. The musicals also feature individual droids, though they are characters originating in these adaptations. The video games feature droids from both the manga and the anime as common enemies, with the manga versions of the enemies referred to as \\"Shade\\". Jakoku, the droid that attacks Chibiusa in her nightmare during episode 75, appears as a boss in Another Story. =Veneti and Aquatici= and are a pair of Droids that appear in the manga, the musicals, and Sailor Moon Crystal. They are considered perfect creations by Saphir. Usagi stumbles onto the Black Crystal Reactor where she is attacked by Veneti and Aquatici alongside Saphir. The two Droids are destroyed by the overflowing energy of golden light from Usagi and the crystal encasing Neo- Queen Serenity. In the manga, unlike all other droids, Veneti and Aquatici are wisp-like beings, while in the musicals they are humanoid. Veneti has a masculine form in the manga while Aquatici has a feminine form, but it is unknown if they have genders. They are both female, or at least played by female actors, in the musical. In the musicals, Veneti was played by Izumi Ogino and Aquatici was played by Yuka Kuwahara. In Crystal, they are voiced respectively by Yukiko Morishita and Hitomi Oowada, while Tara Sands voices both of them in the English adaptation. Reception The members of the Black Moon Clan are called by Navok and Rudranath \\"a separatist faction\\" that not only refused to live under the reign of Neo-Queen Serenity, but were also manipulated by Wiseman into destroying Tokyo in the past in order to prevent the founding of Crystal Tokyo. The authors also compare Black Moon's attack on Crystal Tokyo with the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. On an article on shinto, feminism and anime, author Sarah Reeves considered that Black Lady's overall misconduct and strategies are the result of a lack of husband and children, which can be explained by Chibiusa herself not being an adult and her platonic love not being requited by Tuxedo Mask. Rebecca Silverman reviewed the Sailor Moon R blu-ray + DVD combo pack for Anime News Network and liked the fact that Black Moon members were given character development and were not just \\"one-off monsters, with the Specter Sisters being particularly good examples of this.\\" She particularly focused on the relationship between Petz and Saphir, describing their scenes together as \\"touching and depressing\\", while serving as a \\"counterpoint to Usagi and Mamoru's relationship.\\" The author noted the contrast between humorous scenes like that of Esmeraude showing up to battle in her bathrobe, and the transformation sequence of Chibiusa into Black Lady where her breasts and buttocks surprisingly enlarge, which she considered \\"nice, albeit awkward\\". Silverman praised voice actress Rena S. Mandel for her role as Esmeraude, saying she did a good English equivalent job of the Japanese good old \\"Oh ho ho ho\\" laugh. While reviewing the second season of Sailor Moon Crystal, IGN writer Meghan Sullivan compared the Black Moon Clan to the previous villain group, the Dark Kingdom, and said that \\"Prince Diamond (Demand)‚Äôs court seems far deadlier than Metalia and her generals.\\" In a later episode review, Sullivan admitted that while Esmeraude strangling Chibiusa or Demand kidnapping Usagi was \\"pretty darn disturbing\\", she was actually enjoying Black Moon's more aggressive tactics, as \\"it makes them feel like a legitimate threat, which in turn will make the Sailor Guardians' final victory over them all the sweeter.\\" Regarding Demand's motivations, Sullivan asked \\"He attacked Earth because he thinks peace and longevity are unnatural? That didn‚Äôt make much sense to me, given how he murdered the entire population of Crystal Tokyo and tried to alter history.\\" Commenting on Wiseman, Sullivan described the revelation that he is actually Planet Nemesis itself as a \\"planet-sized bomb\\", and in the next episode review, she gave him \\"props for being tenacious\\" after showing yet another form: Death Phantom. In the second official Sailor Moon popularity poll, out of fifty choices, Black Lady was ranked the thirteenth most popular character in the series, Berthier was nineteenth, Esmeraude was twenty-fourth, Demand was twenty-eighth, K≈çan was thirtieth, Saphir was thirty first, Calaveras was thirty-third, Petz was thirty-fourth, Wiseman was thirty- fifth, Rubeus was fortieth, Aquatici was forty-fourth, Veneti was forty-fifth, Chiral was forty-sixth, and Achiral was forty-seventh.

Caourep established its own plants or licensees in every country in which Renault, Peugeot, Fiat, VW, and Daimler-Benz operated directly or by licensing. By the late 1970s, Caourep had become a supplier to the overseas operations of Ford, GM, and Chrysler. By 1977, Caourep was the largest producer of OEM automotive adhesives and sealants in the world.

They were of 0-6-0 wheel arrangement in the Whyte notation with 700 horsepower. As built, the first 28 locomotives in the 1926 order formed semi-permanently coupled pairs grouped in three classes. The first, class BB1, were AC powered and served as prototypes. The second, class BB2, were DC powered and served in the New York Terminal district, specifically between Sunnyside Yard and New York Penn Station. The third, class BB3, was AC powered and built for the Long Island Rail Road's electrified freight operation on the Bay Ridge Branch. In 1934 a follow-up order of 14 locomotives were built as single unit class B1 for the expanding main line AC electrification system. In addition to these new units all previous BB classes were split into single units and the BB2 class were re- powered for AC operation as that system replaced the old 650 V DC system in the New York terminal. At this point all 42 units were re-classed as PRR B1. Most of the B1 fleet spent its time shuttling trains around Sunnyside Yard or between there and Penn Station. Other B1s were assigned to the Penn Coach Yard at Philadelphia 30th Street Station and a few units even made their way to the PRR Harrisburg Station. As passenger traffic decreased in the 1950s and 1960s the need for dedicated electric switchers diminished with only the Sunnyside B1s surviving into the Penn Central era. After retirement all B1s were scrapped except for a single example preserved at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania. upright=2.0 upright=2.0  References  * * (simple drawing and specifications, for general reference by railroad staff).

The last vinyl was the Disciples of Power Powertrap LP, which was released at the beginning of April 1990.  Obscenity Charges  In 1988, obscenity charges were laid against Fringe Product and Record Peddler, on the basis of their distribution of two albums by Dayglo Abortions. It was the first time that the Canadian obscenity laws, established in 1959, were used against a record label. A jury cleared the companies of the charges in a trial in November 1990.

This gave rise to a political scandal known as the Stavisky Affair, which led to fatal riots in Paris, the resignation of two prime ministers and a change of government. The film was directed by Alain Resnais and featured Jean-Paul Belmondo as Stavisky and Anny Duperey as his wife, Arlette. Stephen Sondheim wrote the film's musical score. Plot The core narrative of the film portrays the last months in the life of Serge Alexandre (Stavisky), from late 1933 to January 1934. We see glimpses of his operations as a \\"financial consultant\\", setting up a mysterious company to deal in international bonds, his 'laundering' of stolen jewellery, and his juggling of funds to stave off the discovery of fraudulent bonds that he has sold through the Cr√©dit Municipal in Bayonne (municipal pawnbrokers); we see his activity as a theatre impresario in Paris, his casino gambling, his purchase of influence among the press, the police, and politicians, and always his extravagant lifestyle and desire to impress; we see his devotion to his glamorous wife Arlette, his exploitation of her beauty to lure funds from a Spanish revolutionary fascist, his contradictory accounts to his friends of events in his own past, and gleams of political idealism - which may yet be just expedients to create further webs of deception. Interposed in the narrative are moments of flashback (to his teenage awakening to a hedonistic life, to his arrest as the petty crook Stavisky in 1926, and to his father's suicide after this family dishonour) and flash-forwards (to his funeral, and to the parliamentary enquiry into the Stavisky affair at which his friends and associates testify with varying degrees of honesty). Also punctuating the main story are scenes depicting the arrival of Trotsky in France to seek political asylum, and his sojourn in various country houses and hotels, receiving visits from left-wing activists. These scenes appear to have no link with the main narrative (apart from two minor characters: the young German-Jewish actress who moves between both stories, and the police-inspector who monitors Trotsky's movements and then also investigates Alexandre), until the end of the film when, in the wake of Stavisky's fall and exposure as a Ukrainian immigrant, a Jew, and a confidant of members of the left-of-centre government, Trotsky's presence is deemed undesirable and he is expelled from the country, while a new 'government of national unity' is formed. The death of Alexandre/Stavisky in a chalet in Chamonix becomes a further mystery: either a suicide by gunshot, like that of his father, or an assassination by the security forces to ensure his silence. Background The film began as a commission by Jean-Paul Belmondo to the screenwriter Jorge Sempr√∫n to develop a scenario about Stavisky. Resnais, who had previously worked with Sempr√∫n on La Guerre est finie, expressed his interest in the project (after a gap of six years since his previous film); he recalled seeing as a child the waxwork figure of Stavisky in the Mus√©e Grevin, and immediately saw the potential of Belmondo to portray him as a mysterious, charming and elegant fraudster.Robert Benayoun, Alain Resnais: arpenteur de l'imaginaire. Paris, Editions Ramsay, 2008. pp.143, 148, 152. Sempr√∫n described the film as \\"a fable upon the life of bourgeois society in its corruption, on the collaboration of money and power, of the police and crime, a fable in which Alexander's craziness, his cynicism, act as catalysts\\".The Times (London), 22 May 1974, p.11, col.C. Resnais said: \\"What attracted me to the character of Alexandre was his connection to the theatre, to show-business in general. Stavisky seemed to me like an incredible actor, the hero of a serial novel. He had the gift of bringing reality to his fantasies by means of regal gestures.\\" Quoted in Dictionnaire des films (G. Sadoul); Paris, Seuil, 1983. p.296. (Among many theatrical references, the film features a scene in the theatre in which Alexandre rehearses a scene from Giraudoux's Intermezzo, and another in which he attends a performance of Coriolanus. His office is adorned with theatrical posters.) Production Location shooting took place in and around Paris and in Biarritz during autumn 1973. Resnais said that he wanted to film and edit the film in the way that a 1930s film-maker would have done it, using only the camera set-ups and movements that might have been seen in 1930. He also acknowledged an influence from silent cinema in the way that intertitles were used.Suzanne Liandrat-Guigues and Jean-Louis Leutrat, Alain Resnais: liaisons secr√®tes, accords vagabonds. (Paris: Cahiers du Cin√©ma, 2006.) pp.229-230. The first screening of the film was given at the Cannes film festival in May 1974. After this performance further distribution was delayed when Stavisky's son sought to have the film seized in a legal action against the producers of the film because of its depiction of the relationship between Alexandre Stavisky and his wife. Cast *Jean-Paul Belmondo as Serge Alexandre Stavisky *Fran√ßois P√©rier as Albert Borelli, Alexandre's dourly efficient and ever- present lawyer *Anny Duperey as Arlette, Alexandre's glamorous wife *Michael Lonsdale as Doctor M√©zy, Alexandre's physician and friend *Roberto Bisacco as Juan Montalvo de Montalbon *Claude Rich as Inspector Bonny, the relentless and not wholly disinterested investigator of Alexandre's frauds *Charles Boyer as Baron Jean Raoul, a genial right-wing aristocrat who becomes Alexandre's loyal friend *Pierre Vernier as Pierre Grammont *Jacques Spiesser as Michel Grandville *Michel Beaune as The journalist *Nike Arrighi as Edith Bor√©al *Raymond Girard as Doctor Pierre *Gigi Ballista as Gaston Henriet *Yves Brainville as Monsieur de la Salle *Niels Arestrup as Rudolph *Fran√ßois Leterrier as Andr√© Malraux G√©rard Depardieu appears in a small role, the first of his several performance for Resnais, as a young inventor of the Matriscope, a device for determining the sex of a child in the womb, to which Alexandre impulsively gives his financial backing. Reception With its high production-values and the popularity of its star actor, the film was enthusiastically received by the public in France, whereas, perhaps for the same reasons, it drew a cool response from many critics who felt that Resnais had betrayed his reputation for intellectual rigour.Robert Benayoun, Alain Resnais: arpenteur de l'imaginaire. Paris, Editions Ramsay, 2008. p.143-144. A British reviewer expressed several of the doubts which were felt by critics: \\"No one could fail to respond to the elegance of the fashion-plate costumes, the Art Deco interiors, the gleaming custom-built cars, the handsome grand hotels, and so on, all paraded before us to the tinkling thirties-pastiche foxtrot music of Stephen Sondheim... But Resnais's and Sempr√∫n's Stavisky is just not a very interesting figure... what he represents to the film's authors is not clear... What the picture does not do is use the Stavisky affair to make any larger comment upon the drift of twentieth-century life, or capitalist society, or even human gullibility... One's ultimate impression of the film is of an immense gap between the sophistication of its technique and the commonplace simple-minded notions it purveys.\\"Philip French, in The Times (London), 23 May 1975, p.9, col.D. The theme of uncertainty in a fragmented narrative (previously explored by Resnais among equally elegant surroundings in L'Ann√©e derni√®re √† Marienbad) was identified by a more sympathetic American reviewer, though with some reservations about the density of the historical background: \\"The difficulty of knowing what is true, of discovering what really happened, ripples throughout Alain Resnais's \\"Stavisky\\" ‚Äî a spell- casting mood piece that is also factually frustrating. Ideally, it should be possible to relish this fascinating movie on its own. But, since so little French history of the nineteen-thirties is provided, it's likely to send you flying to the library.... Despite its mystifications, Stavisky is one of the most rewarding films I've seen this year‚Äîand also one of the most intelligent.\\"Norah Sayre, in New York Times, 30 September 1974. Robert Benayoun, Resnais's commentator and friend, writing some years later, felt that his intentions in the film had been widely misunderstood, especially by those who looked for a politically engaged analysis of a crucial period in French history and found instead a retreat into nostalgia. For Benayoun, Resnais had seen in Stavisky a Faustian archetype, haunted by visions of his oncoming death, who fights to hold on to his 'empire' (\\"Alexander the Great\\"), resorting to every kind of illusion and delusion to gain more time for himself. The kaleidoscopic method of the narrative, its theatricality and romanticism provided the director with exactly the tools to represent the dazzling and elusive career of this \\"sublime crook\\". He concluded that Stavisky was perhaps one of the films in which Resnais had engaged himself most personally.Robert Benayoun, Alain Resnais: arpenteur de l'imaginaire. Paris, Editions Ramsay, 2008. p.144-152. Another critic took up the theme of theatricality in identifying the true subject of the film, as well as linking it to the political background: \\"It is not a portrait of Stavisky, but of the r√¥le he sought to play. It is not a study of character, but of a performance. It is not an image of reality, but the analysis of an illusion. By starting precisely from these 'false appearances' which Resnais can liken to those of the pre-war political establishment, what he speaks of here is quite simply the death of an era whose false splendours will be lifted, like a curtain in the theatre, upon the outbreak of fascism in Europe and the Second World War.\\"Fr√©d√©ric Vitoux, \\"La double mort d'Alexandre Stavisky\\", Positif, n.161, septembre 1974; republished in: Alain Resnais: anthologie √©tablie par St√©phane Goudet. Paris: Gallimard, 2002. (Collection Folio). p.224. \\"Ce n'est pas un portrait de Stavisky, mais celui du personnage qu'il pr√©tendait jouer. Ce n'est pas une √©tude de caract√®re, mais celle d'une mise en sc√®ne. Ce n'est pas une image r√©aliste, mais l'analyse d'une illusion. En partant justement de ces faux-semblants que Resnais peut assimiler √† ceux du pouvoir politique d'avant guerre, ce dont il nous parle ici, c'est tout simplement de la mort d'une √©poque dont les fastes mensongers vont, tel un rideau de sc√®ne, se lever sur le d√©ferlement du fascisme en Europe et la Seconde Guerre mondiale.\\" Stavisky made Monte Hellman‚Äôs top-10 list in the 2012 Sight & Sound polls of the greatest films ever made. Awards For his role as Baron Raoul, Charles Boyer was given a special tribute by the jury at the 1974 Cannes Film Festival.The Times (London(, 25 May 1974, p.3, col.E. He also won a Best Supporting Actor award from the New York Film Critics Circle. It was his last appearance in a French film. The film was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film by the U.S. National Board of Review. Title Resnais's preferred title for the film was Biarritz-Bonheur, referring to the department store which symbolised a certain luxury lifestyle seen in the 1930s, and he continued to use this title in later interviews. However, during filming the distributors insisted that the film should be called Stavisky, a title which Resnais disliked because he thought it would suggest that the film was about the Stavisky affair which only broke out after Stavisky's death. The only concession that he was able to gain was that the title should be written with an ellipsis, as Stavisky..., suggesting something more speculative about the subject rather than a history.Fran√ßois Thomas, L'Atelier d'Alain Resnais.
