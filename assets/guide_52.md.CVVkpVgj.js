He is best known for serving as the attorney for three American hikers that were detained in Iran from July 2009 to September 2011. His specialty is representing clients in Iran with American-linked legal problems. Since the release of the Americans, Shafiee has been briefly arrested, interrogated and had his passport confiscated by the Iranian authorities. Detention of the American hikers Shafiee was the legal representative for Josh Fattal, Shane Bauer and Sarah Shourd, three Americans that were detained by Iranian security forces in July 2009 while hiking in an unmarked border area between Iraqi Kurdistan and Iran. While Sarah Shourd was released in September 2010 on humanitarian grounds, Iranian authorities did not free Bauer and Fattal until a year later in September 2011. Shafiee always maintained the three were innocent despite receiving condemnation from conservative hardliners in the Iranian regime. The Iranian lawyer also criticized the Iranian judiciary for denying him proper access to his clients, as required by Iranian law. Over the course of two years representing the Americans, he only met them three times: once before the start of the trial and once before each of their hearings, in February and August 2011. Each meeting was brief. Fattal and Bauer, after they were released, thanked Shafiee and others who had helped them regain their freedom. Fattal said their attorney \\"was never allowed to represent us properly, but he never gave up.\\" Arrest and interrogation Following the release of the two remaining American hikers, Iranian security forces raided the Shafiee's home in late September 2011. They searched his apartment, seizing his files and his computer's hard drive. He was sent to Evin Prison, his clients' former location, where he was briefly questioned but eventually released. Regarding the raid, Shafiee said, \\"Even though they [the security forces] were respectful, this act was wrong in essence.\\" In early October 2011, Agence France-Presse reported that Shafiee was barred from leaving the country and had his passport confiscated. The incident occurred when the Iranian lawyer was boarding a flight with his ultimate destination being the United States.

The tradition of protest songs in the United States is a long one that dates back to the 18th century and colonial period, the American Revolutionary War and its aftermath. In the 19th century, topical subjects for protest in song included abolition, slavery, poverty, and the Civil War among other subjects. In the 20th century civil liberties, civil rights, women's rights, economic injustice, politics and war were among the popular subjects for protest in song. In the 21st century the long tradition continues. History =Nineteenth century= 19th-century protest songs dealt, for the most part, with three key issues: war, and the Civil War in particular (such as \\"When Johnny Comes Marching Home\\"); the abolition of slavery (\\"Song of the Abolitionist\\" \\"No More Auction Block for Me\\", \\"Oh Freedom\\", and \\"Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child\\", among others); and women's suffrage, both for and against in both Britain and the U.S. Hutchinson Family Singers were one of the protest voices in America at the time. From 1839, the Hutchinson Family Singers became well known for their songs supporting abolition. They sang at the White House for President John Tyler, and befriended Abraham Lincoln. Their subject matter touched on relevant social issues such as abolition, the temperance movement, politics, war and women's suffrage. Much of their music focused on idealism, social reform, equal rights, moral improvement, community activism and patriotism. The Hutchinsons' career spanned the major social and political events of the mid-19th century, including the Civil War. The Hutchinson Family Singers established an impressive musical legacy and are considered to be the forerunners of the great protest singer-songwriters and folk groups of the 1950s and 60s, such as Woody Guthrie and Bob Dylan. Many Negro spirituals have been interpreted as thinly veiled expressions of protest against slavery and oppression. For example, \\"Oh, Freedom\\" and \\"Go Down Moses\\" draw implicit comparisons between the plight of enslaved African Americans and that of enslaved Hebrews in the Bible. These spiritual songs antedated the Civil War but were collected and widely disseminated only after the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1865. The first collection of African-American spirituals appeared in Thomas Wentworth Higginson's book Army Life in a Black Regiment, which was published in 1870, but collected in 1862‚Äì64 while Higginson was serving as a colonel of the First South Carolina Volunteers, the first regiment recruited from former slaves for the Federal service. (Secretary of War Edwin McMasters Stanton required that black regiments be commanded by white officers.) A fervent abolitionist, Transcendentalist critic, and poetry lover, who was a friend and enthusiastic champion of American poet Emily Dickinson, Higginson had been deeply impressed by the beauty of the devotional songs he heard the soldiers singing around the regiment's campfires. Higginson wrote down the texts, in dialect, as he heard them, but failed to provide tunes. The second influential book about African-American spirituals was the 1872 collection Jubilee Songs as Sung by the Jubilee Singers of Fisk University, by Thomas F. Steward, comprising songs sung by students of Fisk University on their fund-raising tours throughout the county, arranged and harmonized according to 19th-century classical music conventions. One of the known African-American spirituals is the anthem \\"Lift Every Voice and Sing\\". Originally written as a poem by African-American novelist and composer James Weldon Johnson (1871‚Äì1938), it was set to music in 1900 by his brother John Rosamond Johnson (1873‚Äì1954) in 1900 and first performed in Jacksonville, Florida as part of a celebration of Lincoln's birthday on February 12, 1900, by a choir of 500 schoolchildren at the segregated Stanton School, where James Weldon Johnson was principal. In 1919, the NAACP adopted the song as \\"The Negro National Anthem\\". This song contained strong appeals to the ideals of justice and equality, and singing it could be interpreted as an act of grass-roots self-assertion by people who were officially still barred from speaking out too overtly against Jim Crow and the resurgence of Ku Klux Klan activity in the 1920s. A topical parlor song that is arguably a precursor of environmental movements is an 1837 musical setting of \\"Woodman, Spare That Tree!\\" The text is from a poem by George Pope Morris, founder of the New York Mirror and published in that paper, set to music composed by British-born composer Henry Russell. Verses include: \\"That old familiar tree, / Whose glory and renown / Are spread o'er land and sea / And wouldst thou hack it down? / Woodman, forbear thy stroke! / Cut not its earth, bound ties; / Oh! spare that ag-ed oak / Now towering to the skies!\\" This song has never caught on as a movement song, however. =Twentieth century= In the 20th century, the union movement, the Great Depression, the Civil Rights Movement, and the war in Vietnam (see Vietnam War protests) all inspired protest songs. 1900‚Äì1920; labor movement, class struggle, and the great war Joe Hill, one of the pioneering protest singers of the early 20th century The vast majority of American protest music from the first half of the 20th century was based on the struggle for fair wages and working hours for the working class, and on the attempt to unionize the American workforce towards those ends. The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) was founded in Chicago in June 1905 at a convention of two hundred socialists, anarchists, and radical trade unionists from all over the United States who were opposed to the policies of the American Federation of Labor. From the start they used music as a powerful form of protest. One of the most famous of these early 20th century \\"Wobblies\\" was Joe Hill, an IWW activist who traveled widely, organizing workers and writing and singing political songs. He coined the phrase \\"pie in the sky\\", which appeared in his most famous protest song \\"The Preacher and the Slave\\" (1911). The song calls for \\"Workingmen of all countries, unite / Side by side we for freedom will fight / When the world and its wealth we have gained / To the grafters we'll sing this refrain.\\" Other notable protest songs written by Hill include \\"The Tramp\\", \\"There Is Power in a Union\\", \\"Rebel Girl\\", and \\"Casey Jones‚ÄîUnion Scab\\". Another known song of this period was \\"Bread and Roses\\", by James Oppenheim and Caroline Kohlsaat, which was sung in protest en masse at a textile strike in Lawrence, Massachusetts during January‚ÄìMarch 1912 (now often referred to as the \\"Bread and Roses strike\\") and has been subsequently taken up by protest movements throughout the 20th century. The advent of World War I (1914‚Äì1918) resulted in a great number of songs concerning the 20th century's most popular recipient of protest ‚Äì war; songs against the war in general, and specifically in America against the U.S.'s decision to enter the European war ‚Äì starting to become widespread and popular. One of the successful protest songs to capture the widespread American skepticism about joining in the European war was \\"I Didn't Raise My Boy to Be a Soldier\\", (1915) by lyricist Alfred Bryan and composer Al Piantadosi. Many of these war-time protest songs took the point of view of the family at home, worried about their father/husband fighting overseas. One such song of the period which dealt with the children who had been orphaned by the war was \\"War Babies\\", from 1916, with music composed by James F. Hanley and lyrics written by Ballard MacDonald, which spoke to the need for taking care of orphans of war in an unusually frank and open manner. For a typical song written from a child's point-of-view, see Jean Schwartz (music), Sam M. Lewis & Joe Young (lyrics) and their song \\"Hello Central! Give Me No Man's Land\\" (1918), in which a young boy tries to call his father in No Man's Land on the telephone (then a recent invention), unaware that he has been killed in combat. 1920s‚Äì1930s; the great depression and racial discrimination The 1920s and 30s also saw the continuing growth of the union and labor movements (the IWW claimed at its peak in 1923 some 100,000 members), as well as widespread poverty due to the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl, which inspired musicians and singers to decry the harsh realities which they saw all around them. It was against this background that folk singer Aunt Molly Jackson was singing songs with striking Harlan coal miners in Kentucky in 1931, and writing protest songs such as \\"Hungry Ragged Blues\\" and \\"Poor Miner's Farewell\\", which depicted the struggle for social justice in a Depression-ravaged America. In New York City, Marc Blitzstein's opera/musical The Cradle Will Rock, a pro-union musical directed by Orson Welles, was produced in 1937. However, it proved to be so controversial that it was shut down for fear of social unrest. Undeterred, the IWW increasingly used music to protest working conditions in the United States and to recruit new members to their cause. The 1920s and 30s also saw a marked rise in the number of songs which protested against racial discrimination, such as Fats Waller's \\"(What Did I Do to Be So) Black and Blue\\" in 1929, and the anti- lynching song \\"Strange Fruit\\" by Lewis Allan and performed and recorded by Billie Holiday, which contains the lyrics \\"Southern trees bear strange fruit / Blood on the leaves and blood at the root / Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze\\". It was also during this period that many African American blues singers were beginning to have their voices heard on a larger scale across America through their music, most of which protested the discrimination which they faced on a daily basis. Perhaps the most famous example of these 1930s blues protest songs is Lead Belly's \\"The Bourgeois Blues\\", in which he sings, \\"The home of the Brave / The land of the Free / I don't wanna be mistreated by no bourgeoisie.\\" 1940s‚Äì1950s; The labor movement vs McCarthyism; anti-nuclear songs The 1940s and 1950s saw the rise of music that continued to protest labor, race, and class issues. Protest songs continued to increase their profile over this period, and an increasing number of artists appeared who were to have an enduring influence on the protest music genre. However, the movement and its protest singers faced increasing opposition from McCarthyism. One of the most notable pro-union protest singers of the period was Woody Guthrie (\\"This Land Is Your Land\\", \\"Deportee\\", \\"1913 Massacre\\", \\"Dust Bowl Blues\\", \\"Tom Joad\\"), whose guitar bore a sticker which read: \\"This Machine Kills Fascists\\". Guthrie was also an occasional member or the hugely influential labor-movement band The Almanac Singers, founded by Millard Lampell, Lee Hays, and Pete Seeger, which had a floating personnel. Politics and music were closely intertwined with the Almanac's Popular Front political beliefs. Their first release in May 1941, an album called Songs For John Doe, performed by Seeger, Hays, Lampell, Josh White, and Sam Gary, urged non-intervention in World War II and opposed the peacetime draft and unequal treatment of African-American draftees. A month after it was issued, Hitler invaded the Soviet Union and Roosevelt issued an order banning racial and religious discrimination in defense hiring. The Almanacs immediately switched to a pro-war position and the Songs for John Doe album was withdrawn and all copies destroyed. Their second album, Talking Union, was a collection six labor songs: \\"Union Maid\\", \\"I Don't Want Your Millions Mister\\", \\"Get Thee Behind Me Satan\\", \\"Union Train\\", \\"Which Side Are You On?\\", and, of course, the eponymous \\"Talking Union\\", sung by Guthrie, who had joined the group in July. This album, issued in July 1941, was not anti-Roosevelt. After the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in December of that year, the Almanacs issued a strongly pro-war, pro-Roosevelt album, Dear Mr. President, that included Guthrie's \\"Reuben James\\" (1942), and several of them enlisted in the Army (Seeger) or Merchant Marine (Guthrie and Cisco Houston). The Almanacs were widely criticized in the press for switching positions, especially by Dr. Carl Joachim Friedrich, a Harvard political scientist who was in charge of military propaganda for domestic consumption and wrote prolifically for popular magazines.See \\"The Poison in Our System\\" (excerpt) by Carl Joachim Friedrich, Atlantic Monthly (June, 1941). In 1948 Hays and Seeger organized a quartet, which also included a young Ronnie Gilbert and Fred Hellerman, to accompany international folk dancing to raise money for their organization People's Songs. Initially known as the No Name Quartet, by 1950 it was enjoying great popular success as The Weavers. Several of the Weavers most popular songs, such as \\"If I Had a Hammer\\", were protest songs or implicitly supported Israel (Tzena, Tzena, Tzena), although the political content was not explicit. Although some in the left wing press derided them as having sold out their beliefs in exchange for popular success, their fans nevertheless recognized what their songs were about because their international and multi-racial repertoire strongly suggested support for racial justice and world peace. Because of the Red Scare and McCarthyism, the Weavers' managers directed them to avoid appearing at progressive venues and prohibited them from performing or recording songs with political content. Former Almanac members Seeger and Hays were listed in the publication Red Channels and a former Communist who had worked at People's Songs, Harvey Matusow denounced the group as Communists Party members (he later recanted and admitted that he had lied). Although their manager went to the Red Channels office in person and with promises that the group would avoid trouble, they were placed under FBI surveillance and blacklisted by the entertainment industry during the McCarthyism era. Right- wing and anti-Communist groups protested at their performances and harassed promoters. As a result, a planned Weavers's television appearance was canceled, they lost radio airplay (and royalties), and Decca Records terminated their recording contract. Because of its New Deal and popular front associations, folk music itself was under a cloud as potentially subversive, regardless of content, and disappeared from the mass media.Compare Woody Guthrie's statement about folk music in a letter to Alan Lomax of 1940: > I think real folk stuff scares most of the boys around Washington. A folk > song is what's wrong and how to fix it, or it could be who's hungry and > where their mouth is, or who's out of work and where the job is or who's > broke and where the money is or who's carrying a gun and where the peace is > ‚Äì that's folk lore and folks made it up because they seen that the > politicians could find nothing to fix or nobody to feed or give a job of > work. We don't aim to hurt you or scare you when we get to feeling sorta > folksy and make up some folk lore, we're doing all we can to make it easy on > you. I can sing all day and all night sixty days and sixty night but of > course I ain't got enough wind to be in office. (Woody Guthrie, Letter to > Alan Lomax, quoted in Roy Pratt, Rhythm and Resistance: Explorations in the > Political Uses of Popular Music, [1990] p. 115.) For the remainder of the 1950s, Seeger continued to appear at camps and schools and to write songs and pro-labor union and anti-war editorials, which appeared in his column in the folk music magazine Sing Out! under the pen name of \\"Johnny Appleseed\\". The Weavers were temporarily silenced but returned to sing before a rapturous crowd of fans in a reunion concert at Carnegie Hall in 1955. Issued in 1957, the album documenting this concert, The Weavers at Carnegie Hall, became a highly influential best-selling LP album.It included \\"Venga Jaleo\\" an anti-Fascist song from the Spanish Civil War. The Spanish- language lyrics probably were not understood by most of the audience: translation: On the eighteenth of July, In the courtyard of a convent, The people of Madrid Formed the Fifth Regiment. Chorus: Come, clap out the rhythm, Dream of a machine gun And Franco will do the walking! And Franco will do the walking! A second Weavers LP, Folk Songs Around the World, issued in 1959, was limited to traditional songs and spirituals. Paul Robeson, singer, actor, athlete, and civil rights activist, was investigated by the FBI and was called before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) for his outspoken political views. The State Department denied Robeson a passport and issued a \\"stop notice\\" at all ports, effectively confining him to the United States. In a symbolic act of defiance against the travel ban, labor unions in the U.S. and Canada organized a concert at the International Peace Arch on the border between Washington state and the Canadian province of British Columbia on May 18, 1952.Duberman, p. 400 Robeson stood on the back of a flat bed truck on the American side of the U.S.-Canada border and performed a concert for a crowd on the Canadian side, variously estimated at between 20,000 and 40,000 people. Robeson returned to perform a second concert at the Peace Arch in 1953,Duberman p. 411 and over the next two years two further concerts were scheduled. In the 1940s, one of the leading musical voices of protest from the African American community in America was Josh White, one of the first musicians to make a name for himself singing political blues. White enjoyed a position of political privilege, especially as a black musician, as he established a long and close relationship with the family of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, and would become the closest African American confidant to the President of the United States. He made his first foray into protest music and political blues with his highly controversial Columbia Records album Joshua White & His Carolinians: Chain Gang, produced by John H. Hammond, which included the song \\"Trouble\\", which summarised the plight of many African Americans in its opening line of \\"Well, I always been in trouble, 'cause I'm a black-skinned man.\\" The album was the first race record ever forced upon the white radio stations and record stores in America's South and caused such a furor that it reached the desk of President Roosevelt. On December 20, 1940, White and the Golden Gate Quartet, sponsored by Eleanor Roosevelt, performed in a historic Washington, D.C. concert at the Library of Congress's Coolidge Auditorium to celebrate the 75th Anniversary of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which abolished slavery. In January 1941, White performed at the President's Inauguration, and two months later he released another highly controversial record album, Southern Exposure, which included six anti-segregationist songs with liner notes written by the celebrated and equally controversial African American writer Richard Wright, and whose sub-title was \\"An Album of Jim Crow Blues\\". Like the Chain Gang album, and with revelatory yet inflammatory songs such as \\"Uncle Sam Says\\", \\"Jim Crown Train\\", \\"Bad Housing Blues\\", \\"Defense Factory Blues\\", \\"Southern Exposure\\", and \\"Hard Time Blues\\", it also was forced upon the southern white radio stations and record stores, caused outrage in the South and also was brought to the attention of President Roosevelt. A month later, White sang as a member of the Almanac Singers on their much criticized anti peace-time draft album, Songs for John Doe. Despite this, however, and White's membership in the Almanac Singers, instead of making White persona non grata in segregated America, resulted in President Roosevelt asking White to become the first African American artist to give a White House Command Performance, in 1941, for the Roosevelts were great fans of folk music. After the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, many people the world over feared nuclear warfare, and many protest songs were written against this new danger. The most immediately successful of these post-war anti-nuclear protest songs was Vern Partlow's \\"Old Man Atom\\" (1945) (also known by the alternate titles \\"Atomic Talking Blues\\" and \\"Talking Atom\\"). The song treats its subject in comic-serious fashion, with a combination of black humour puns (such as \\"We hold these truths to be self-evident / All men may be cremated equal\\" or \\"I don't mean the Adam that Mother Eve mated / I mean that thing that science liberated\\") on serious statements on the choices to be made in the nuclear age (\\"The people of the world must pick out a thesis / \\"Peace in the world, or the world in pieces!\\"\\"). Folk singer Sam Hinton recorded \\"Old Man Atom\\" in 1950 for ABC Eagle, a small California independent label. Influential New York disc jockey Martin Block played Hinton's record on his \\"Make Believe Ballroom\\". Overwhelming listener response prompted Columbia Records to acquire the rights for national distribution. From all indications, it promised to be one of the year's biggest novelty records. RCA Victor rush-released a cover version by the Sons of the Pioneers. Country singer Ozzie Waters recorded the song for Decca's Coral subsidiary. Fred Hellerman ‚Äì then contracted to Decca as a member of the Weavers ‚Äì recorded it for Jubilee under the pseudonym \\"Bob Hill\\". Bing Crosby was reportedly ready to record \\"Old Man Atom\\" for Decca when a right-wing \\"committee\\" headed by Bronx, N.Y., Rabbi Benjamin Schultz and closely associated with the publications Red Channels and Counterattack, began attacking Columbia and RCA Victor for releasing a song that Schultz alleged reflected Communist ideology.For Benjamin Schultz, see: Richard A. Schwartz \\"How the Film and Television Blacklists Worked\\", Department of English, Florida International University. According to a New York Times report on September 1, 1950: Buckling under, both Columbia and RCA Victor withdrew \\"Old Man Atom\\" from distribution. Henceforth, mainstream pop music would avoid songs that mentioned potentially controversial topics until the folk revival of the 1960s. Other anti-nuclear protest songs of the immediate post-war period had included \\"Atom and Evil\\" (1946) by the Golden Gate Quartet, (\\"If Atom and Evil should ever be wed, / Lord, then darn if all of us are going to be dead.\\")Lyrics quoted on the website of the Atomic Platters, along with the information that the members of the Golden Gate Quartet left the U.S. to tour Europe during the McCarthy period and decided to become permanent residents of France. and \\"Atomic Sermon\\" (1953) by Billy Hughes and his Rhythm Buckeroos 1960s: The civil rights movement, Vietnam war, and peace and revolution The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom leaders marching from the Washington Monument to the Lincoln Memorial, August 28, 1963. Bob Dylan with Joan Baez during the March on Washington in Washington, D.C., 1963 The 1960s was a fertile era for the genre, especially with the rise of the Civil Rights Movement, the ascendency of counterculture groups such as \\"hippies\\" and the New Left, and the escalation of the War in Vietnam. The protest songs of the period differed from those of earlier leftist movements, which had been more oriented towards labor activism and adopting instead a broader definition of political activism commonly called social activism, which incorporated notions of equal rights and of promoting the concept of \\"peace\\". The music often included relatively simple instrumental accompaniment, including acoustic guitar and harmonica. Many Americans still remember Odetta's performance at the 1963 civil rights movement's March on Washington where she sang \\"Oh Freedom\\".World mourns passing of Odetta One of the key figures of the 1960s protest movement was Bob Dylan, who produced a number of landmark protest songs, such as \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" (1962), \\"Masters of War\\" (1963), \\"Talking World War III Blues\\" (1963), and \\"The Times They Are A-Changin'\\" (1964). While Dylan is often thought of as a 'protest singer', most of his protest songs spring from a relatively short time-period in his career; Mike Marqusee writes: > The protest songs that made Dylan famous and with which he continues to be > associated were written in a brief period of some 20 months ‚Äì from January > 1962 to November 1963. Influenced by American radical traditions (the > Wobblies, the Popular Front of the thirties and forties, the Beat anarchists > of the fifties) and above all by the political ferment touched off among > young people by the civil rights and ban the bomb movements, he engaged in > his songs with the terror of the nuclear arms race, with poverty, racism and > prison, jingoism and war. Dylan often sang against injustice, such as the murders of Emmett Till in The Death Of Emmett Till (1962) and Civil Rights Movement activist Medgar Evers in \\"Only a Pawn in Their Game\\" (1964), or the killing of the 51-year-old African American barmaid Hattie Carroll by the wealthy young tobacco farmer from Charles County, William Devereux \\"Billy\\" Zantzinger in \\"The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll\\" (1964) (Zantzinger was sentenced to six months in a county jail for the murder). Many of the injustices about which Dylan sang were not even based on race or civil rights issues, but rather everyday injustices and tragedies, such as the death of boxer Davey Moore in the ring (\\"Who Killed Davey Moore?\\" (1964)), or the breakdown of farming and mining communities (\\"Ballad of Hollis Brown\\" (1963), \\"North Country Blues\\" (1963)). By 1963, Dylan and then-singing partner Joan Baez had become prominent in the civil rights movement, singing together at rallies including the March on Washington, where Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered his famous \\"I have a dream\\" speech.Dylan performed Only a Pawn in Their Game and When the Ship Comes In However, Dylan, glancing towards the Capitol, is reported to have asked, cynically: \\"\\"Think they're listening?\\" Then he is also reported to have answered: \\"No, they ain't listening at all.\\"\\"Scaduto, Bob Dylan, p. 151. Anthony Scaduto contends that many of Dylan's songs of the period were adapted and appropriated by the 1960s Civil Rights and counter-culture \\"movements\\" rather than being specifically written for them. Scaduto reports that by 1964 Dylan was attempting to extract himself from the movement, much to the chagrin of many of those who saw him as a voice of a generation. Indeed, some of Dylan's topical songs appear to have been retrospectively aligned with issues which they in fact pre-date. For example, \\"Masters of War\\" (1963) which protests against governments who orchestrate war, is sometimes misconstrued as dealing directly with the Vietnam War. However, the song was written at the beginning of 1963, when only a few hundred Green Berets were stationed in South Vietnam and came to be re-appropriated as a comment on Vietnam in 1965, when US planes bombed North Vietnam for the first time, with lines such as \\"you that build the death planes\\" seeming particularly prophetic. In contrast to other topical singers of the day, Dylan never mentioned Vietnam by name in any of his songs. Dylan himself has stated rather mysteriously that, although the song \\"is supposed to be a pacifistic song against war. It's not an anti- war song. It's speaking against what Eisenhower was calling a military- industrial complex as he was making his exit from the presidency. That spirit was in the air, and I picked it up.\\" This understandably must have seemed a distinction without much of a difference to his many anti-war fans. Similarly, \\"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall\\" (1963) was perceived by some as about the Cuban Missile Crisis, although Dylan had composed and performed it more than a month before John F. Kennedy's TV address to the nation (October 22, 1962) initiated the Cuban Missile Crisis. Dylan's initial and extremely fruitful 20-month period of overt protest songs ended in 1964, when he changed his musical style from acoustic folk to an electrified, rock-orientated sound, and his increasingly personal, abstract lyrics became seemingly more purely aesthetic. As he explained to critic Nat Hentoff in mid-1964: \\"Me, I don't want to write for people anymore ‚Äì you know, be a spokesman. From now on, I want to write from inside me ... I'm not part of no movement ... I just can't make it with any organisation\\". On another occasion that same year, however, he reproached fans in Northern England, when they booed him for allegedly abandoning the left, saying, \\"Come on, all my songs are protest songs.\\"Pratt (1990), p. 208. Ray Pratt, professor of political science at Montana State University, believes that Dylan stopped writing anthems and other explicit protest songs because he felt that, under the highly repressive conditions prevailing at the time, there was no side with which he wanted to be associated: \\"'It's vulgar, the idea that somebody has to say what they want to say in a message type song ... 'Which side are you on?' That's such a waste? I mean, which side can you be on.'\\"Pratt (1990), p. 208. According to Pratt, Dylan told a friend in 1964: > All I can say is politics is not my thing at all. I can't see myself on a > platform talking about how to help people. Because I would get myself killed > if I really tried to help anybody. I mean if somebody really had something > to say to help somebody out, just bluntly say the truth, well obviously > they're gonna be done away with. They're gonna be killed\\" (Pratt [1990], p. > 208). His next explicit topical protest song would be \\"Hurricane\\", written > twelve years later, in 1976. Pete Seeger was a major civil rights advocate > (1955). Pete Seeger, founding member of the Almanac Singers and The Weavers, > was a major influence on Dylan and his contemporaries, and continued to be a > strong voice of protest in the 1960s, when he composed \\"Where Have All the > Flowers Gone\\" (written with Joe Hickerson) and \\"Turn, Turn, Turn\\" (written > during the 1950s but released on Seeger's 1962 album The Bitter and The > Sweet). Seeger's song \\"If I Had a Hammer\\", written with Lee Hays in 1949 in > support of the progressive movement, rose to Top Ten popularity in 1962 when > covered by Peter, Paul and Mary, going on to become one of the major Freedom > Songs of the Civil Rights Movement. \\"We Shall Overcome\\", Seeger's adaptation > of an American gospel song, continues to be used to support issues from > labor rights to peace movements. Seeger was one of the leading singers to > protest against then-President Lyndon Johnson through song. Seeger first > satirically attacked the president with his 1966 recording of Len Chandler's > children's song, \\"Beans in My Ears\\". In addition to Chandler's original > lyrics, Seeger sang that \\"Mrs. Jay's little son Alby\\" had \\"beans in his > ears\\", which, as the lyrics imply, ensures that a person does not hear what > is said to them. To those opposed to continuing the Vietnam War, the phrase > suggested that \\"Alby Jay\\", a loose pronunciation of Johnson's nickname > \\"LBJ\\", did not listen to anti-war protests as he too had \\"beans in his > ears\\". Seeger attracted wider attention in 1967 with his song \\"Waist Deep in > the Big Muddy\\", about a captain ‚Äì referred to in the lyrics as \\"the big > fool\\" ‚Äì who drowned while leading a platoon on maneuvers in Louisiana during > World War II. In the face of arguments with the management of CBS about > whether the song's political weight was in keeping with the usually light- > hearted entertainment of the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, the final lines > were \\"Every time I read the paper / those old feelings come on / We are > waist deep in the Big Muddy and the big fool says to push on.\\" And it was > not seriously contested that much of the audience would grasp Seeger's > allegorical casting of Johnson as the \\"big fool\\" and the Vietnam War the > foreseeable danger. Although the performance was cut from the September 1967 > show, after wide publicity, it was broadcast when Seeger appeared again on > the Smothers Brothers show the following January.

It may be described as a type of local exchange trading system (LETS) network based on free software. While it can be used as an alternative to traditional currencies such as the Australian dollar or Euro or South African rand, the Community Exchange System is a complementary currency in the sense that it functions alongside established currencies. The CES name was coined by an online web service which started in 2003 in Cape Town, South Africa, as the Cape Town Talent Exchange (CTTE). From there it spread to 99 countries, with the biggest take-up in Australia, where CES Australia was founded in 2011. This original CES takes the idea of LETS and similar systems a step further by providing the means for inter-community trading; it is a global network of communities using non-monetary exchange systems. The CES is international in scope. It does not have printed money or coins but uses computer technology to serve as an \\"online money and banking system\\" or alternative exchange system and as a marketplace. It is an advance from an arrangement in which either one good or service is exchanged for another good or service, or commonly called barter, since it uses a digital unit of value (not the same as a digital currency). Background While money typically takes the form of a national currency such as dollars or euros, there have long been other types of \\"currencies\\" ranging from simple IOU notes --in which one person declares a debt to a second person in a written document --to more sophisticated programs such as frequent-flyer programs in which points are accumulated in a side-system as a result of purchases. Some communities, typically remote ones, have instituted what is sometimes called a community currency, sometimes with paper notes, such as the Totnes pound in the town of Totnes in the United Kingdom; the idea was to promote local commerce and to \\"keep money circulating within the town's local economy,\\" according to one report. The advent of internet technology made alternative (aka complementary) currencies more viable, as databases can keep account of credits and facilitate trading. History Cape Town city centre A system called the Cape Town Talent Exchange (CTTE) was started in February 2003 in Cape Town by Ashoka fellow Tim Jenkin (also known for a daring prison escape during the apartheid era) and former maths and science teacher and chemical engineer Don Northcott. The abstract unit of currency (unit of account/value) was called the \\"Talent\\", but there were no physical bills or coins made. The purpose was to bring the advantages of a trading network to destitute persons who were unable to get credit or loans using traditional national currencies, as well as assist marginalised communities within the city of Cape Town, such as Khayelitsha, to become self-sustaining. The initial design was as a local moneyless not-for-profit exchange which was similar in most respects to a LETS, which record members trading goods and services using a locally created currency called \\"LETS Credits\\".\\"LETSystems Training Pack\\", (1990) W.A. Government. The exchange later evolved into a more complex system which took advantage of internet technology to reduce the costs of administering the system and allowed expansion to other places, including areas outside of the borders of South Africa. The software permitted the exchange in one city to link up with similar exchanges in other cities to form a global network. Community Exchange Systems Ltd was formally constituted and registered as a not-for-profit company under the Companies Act of South Africa in 2008 and is known as CES International. CES Australia was set up in Australia in 2011. there are four CES servers hosting different communities, with CES International in Cape Town the \\"global\\" server, another in Taiwan, and two in Australia hosting the Australian communities and Timebanking Australia in New South Wales. A Spanish system, IntegralCESIntegral CES (serving Argentina, Brazil, France, Greece, Italy, Spain and Mexico), and Geneva-based CommunityForge.netCommunity Forge are also part of the network. Size Reports vary about the number of complementary currency exchanges linked up in the network. One report in 2011 suggested that the network consisted of 100 linked exchanges which operated in 15 different countries; a second report counted the number of exchanges at approximately 300 in 30 different countries. One estimate was that there were 2,000 members in 2006 with a total of 6,700 members in 50 groups in eight countries. By 2011, the number of participants in the Cape Town Talent Exchange was estimated to be 4,000. A report in Time Magazine suggested that alternative forms of money are \\"growing in popularity\\" in places such as South Africa and elsewhere. Since 2003, when the system was initiated, there have been about two and a half million talents traded, which was about 500,000 South African rands, according to one estimate. One estimate suggested that the total value of local exchange trading systems trades worldwide was one billion South African rands in 2004. The CES web site reported that there were 485 exchange groups hosted on its global server at the start of 2013. These were located in 53 countries, with another 37 Australian exchanges on its Australian server. Method of operation A person wishing to join creates an account with a particular local exchange via the Community Exchange System website. This gives them access to an online community, sometimes described as an \\"online shopping mall\\" which is similar in some respects to a social networking website. They can then offer to sell goods or services, and as these are bought, their credits accumulate, which in turn allows them to buy things on the exchange as well from participating sellers. Generally, each exchange has its own \\"currency\\", or unit of measurement, which serves as a recording mechanism to keep track of values as they are transferred. Most exchanges operate according to principles of mutual credit, time banks; some even use exchange-specific paper currencies as a portable physical record documenting the electronic credit. The registered member accesses a host server which manages a particular exchange, and this access enables a user to link up with other exchanges. Generally, there is not a fixed exchange rate between a Community Exchange System unit of value and a national currency; rather, values fluctuate. Database software keeps track of which persons have which amounts of \\"money\\". The buyer \\"pays\\" the seller by signing a trading sheet provided by the seller or by handing over a trading slip that records how much the buyer is agreeing to be debited by the seller for the goods/service delivered. The slip is either handed by the seller to a group administrator who will enter the amount into the computerised system, or the information is entered directly by the seller. Generally, members are not allowed to accumulate either too much \\"debt\\" or too much \\"credit\\" on the system. When a deficit builds up, other members generally will usually stop trading with such a person until the person does more work or sells more items or services; when an individual person's credit becomes too extensive, other members will urge that person to begin trading to bring down this amount. It is taxed like any currency and a \\"nation's tax rules apply ... just like national currency.\\" If a particular member does not have a computer or lacks Internet access, it is possible for a local area coordinator to enter the trade for them into the system. Benefits The CES's stated aims include mobilising the real wealth of a community, fostering self-reliance & self esteem, fostering social justice & equality, keeping wealth where it is created and fostering a sense of community. Advocates suggest the Community Exchange System is a \\"means of empowerment\\" for poor people, the elderly, disabled persons or those described as underemployed. An advantage cited is that a destitute person can begin earning credits by working, since it does not require such a person to first have an acceptable credit history or credit score to qualify for a traditional job. Regardless of a person's past financial situation, each person's new contributions have exchangeable value based on the worthiness of their contribution. Proponents claim that it is not essentially different from traditional national currencies in the sense that both types of money are in digital form. Advocate Margaret Legum of the South African New Economics Network claimed that the currency comes into existence only when a trade happens and, as a result, there is no risk of inflation or deflation since \\"there is no such thing as too much or too little money.\\" She argued that it was a superior arrangement because no interest was charged and that the system was \\"transparent\\" because everybody could see everybody else's balance of credits and debits. \\"Money is not used as a commodity in itself - to be lent and borrowed and kept out of use. By contrast, the supply of national currencies everywhere comes into existence as a commercial debt to a bank, without reference to whether or not that extra money is needed to match the supply of goods and services.\\" Persons can borrow or take a loan using the system, although generally these amounts are not large, and there are forces pushing persons to not have either a large deficit or a large surplus in their particular account. And it is international in scope. Other advantages cited include benefits for the environment, being good for remote areas without access to traditional banks, It can be \\"ideal for launching small businesses or piloting projects without spending cash\\", according to one view. Disadvantages The network still incurs administrative costs, although with internet technology, the costs are less than in a traditional LETS group. There is a small fee required to help defray administrative costs which is either a one-time fee or else a small \\"transaction tax in talents\\" to compensate the system's organizers for their work. Other drawbacks include being \\"unwieldy\\" since money is useful primarily when it is \\"widely accepted\\", and for a Consumer Exchange Service to operate effectively, many consumers and merchants and employers need to be using the system. It is also an alternative paradigm of money, requiring considerable adjustment of perception (through education) of positive and negative balances (which are erroneously perceived as debt) of one's account. Interfacing the new currency with a nation's tax accounting can \\"pose problems\\", possibly resulting in accounting issues. Other potential problems include the possibility that a particular exchange may cease operating (so persons with credits built up may lose them), as well as the possibilities for error, fraud, and difficulties with dispute resolution which are problems for any trading currency. Focus group research in 1996 on the Toronto, Canada, LETS, however, showed that the transparency of mutual credit systems makes them highly resilient and difficult to defraud. Indeed one participant joined with the expressed intent of defrauding the system and found it to be pointless. A type of class system can emerge, however, when some participants have services or products in great demand and accumulate surplus credits that they cannot spend while others have great needs and find themselves unable to accumulate them. One source suggested that an administrative upper-limit ceiling for the number of trades was 700 million; if the system gets more trades than this, it becomes difficult to manage in an administrative sense.

It is the only surviving breed of pig locally and historically produced in Murcia and is at the risk of extinction. Despite its danger of becoming extinct, the Chato Murciano is a well-managed pig known for its production of bacon and lean pork. Several Spanish authorities specialising in agriculture work on programs aiming to conserve the breed by cross-breeding and artificial insemination History In Murcia, the Spanish were in need of an improved breed of pig as the current Murcian type was not meeting their standards. To solve this problem, they mix-bred the Murciano with the Victoria, Tamworth, the Large White and the Berkshire, the Chato Murciano was and still is currently bred for its lean meat and bacon. There were about fifty thousand pigs of this breed in 1865 and more than 100,000 in 1929. The breed originated and was farmed in Murcia, a region in the south-eastern area of Spain. The pig received its name from the Spanish due of its short nose, with ‚Äúchato‚Äù meaning ‚Äúshort-nosed‚Äù, and ‚ÄúMurciano‚Äù meaning ‚Äúfrom Murcia‚Äù. Description Along with its short nose, the breed usually has a black or white color and has small sized heads. Generally the head Chato Murciano can grow up to 28.5 cm long and 20 cm wide after reaching 12 years of age. This is only a 2‚Äì4 cm growth from when it is one year old. On its head, the snout increases size up to 10.5 cm but then decreases to about 9.5 cm when the pig reaches twelve years of age. Pigs at about 3.5 years or 12 years have their eyes separated from each other at about 16 cm where at 1 year, they are separated by 12.5 cm. Although having white fur, black fur is a more common characteristic of the Chato Murciano but some tend to have white patches on parts of their body such as the tail and legs. These are believed to be inherited from the Berkshire, which is the pig the Spanish used to cross-breed with the primitive Murcian breed. Hair is found all over the pig‚Äôs body except on mammary glands belonging to the sow. There can be up to fourteen mammary glands on a Chato Murciano. Breeding and Use Bacon and lean pork is mainly why the pig is bred but it is an advantage for farmers as the breed is well adapted to southern Spain‚Äôs dry and warm climate. Being fed raw materials that are locally gathered, Chato Murciano are mostly killed at 18 months when their weight is around 180 kg. Because of its substantial amount of fat with extensive levels of oleic acid and muscle pigmentation, sausages of higher quality are able to be produced according to several studies conducted in the past. In the 1980s, the breed was on the verge of extinction but due to programs instigated by agriculturists and governments, the pig is gradually becoming more sustainable.

In fission, the central disc breaks into two pieces and each portion then regenerates the missing parts. In autotomy, an arm is shed with part of the central disc attached, which continues to live independently as a \\"comet\\", eventually growing a new set of arms. Although almost all sea stars can regenerate their limbs, only a select few sea star species are able to reproduce in these ways. Fission Coscinasterias tenuispina Fissiparity in the starfish family Asteriidae is confined to the genera Coscinasterias, Stephanasterias and Sclerasterias. Another family in which asexual reproduction by fission has independently arisen is the Asterinidae. The life span is at least four years. A dense population of Stephanasterias albula was studied at North Lubec, Maine. All the individuals were fairly small, with arm lengths not exceeding 18mm (0.8 in), but no juveniles were found, suggesting that there had been no recent larval recruitment and that this species may be obligately fissiparous. Fission seemed to take place only in the spring and summer and for any individual, occurred once a year or once every two years. Another species, Coscinasterias tenuispina, has a variable number of arms but is often found with 7 arms divided into dis-similar sized groups of 3 and 4. It is unclear why fission starts in any particular part of the disc rather than any other, but the origin seemed to bear some relation to the position of the madreporites and the longest arm. This species typically reproduces sexually in the winter and by fission at other times of year. The undivided individual has 1 to 5 madreporites and at least one is found in each offspring. New arms usually appear in groups of 4 and are normally accompanied by the appearance of additional madreporites. The presence of multiple madreporites seems to be a prerequisite of fission. In Brazil, only male individuals have been found and fission takes place all the year round, though primarily in the winter. Fission seems to be correlated with certain stress factors such as particularly low tides, when many starfish may be exposed to the air. Nepanthia belcheri has a variable number of arms and divides by fission in a similar manner. It is a hermaphrodite, some individuals having gonads that function as testes and others gonads that function as ovaries. After fission, the gonads regress and individuals that previously had mature female gonads become masculinized, developing male-type gonads. Many larger individuals provide evidence from the varying lengths of their arms that they have divided by fission on several occasions. In Sclerasterias, fissiparity seems to be confined to very young individuals. In these, there is a transitory hexamerous symmetry in what is a normally a pentamerously symmetrical genus. The immature individuals with 6 arms appear so different in appearance from mature individuals with 5 arms that they were at one time considered to be two genera, Hydrasterias and Sclerasterias. Juveniles with arms measuring between 8mm and 15mm (occasionally 20mm) are usually involved in fission and undergo multiple divisions. A sample of 36 young Sclerasterias euplecta of this size was examined. 9 had only 5 arms and did not show evidence of fissiparity while the remainder had 6 arms, usually 3 longer than the other 3, following prior fission. In another sample of juvenile Scierasterias heteropau, the arms were similarly arranged in groups of three and there were 4 madreporites, 2 on the original and 2 on the regenerated section. Active fissiparity seems to be correlated with 6 arms and 4 madreporites. At some stage in their development as yet unexplained, only 5 arms and one madreporite appear, and the ability to divide in this way is lost. Autotomy as a means of asexual reproduction =History= Writing in 1872, Lutken suggested that in certain members of the Ophiuroidea, \\"a radiary division occurs in which cast off arms formed new rays and a disk\\". Six years later Ernst Haeckel observed that members of the genus Ophidiaster (Linckia) were prone to cast off arms and that new discs, arms, madreporites and mouths formed on the severed surface of these. In 1904, Kellogg observed numerous severed arms on reefs at Apia, Samoa, noting that many were sprouting new arms and suggested that Linckia diplax and Linckia pacifica had the ability to generate new individuals in this way. He thought the arms might be shed by autotomy. In the same year, Monks showed experimentally that the \\"comets\\" developing from the severed arms of Linckia columbiae could indeed grow into new individuals. =Autotomy of arms= \\"Comet\\" of Linckia guildingi Linckia multifora and Linckia guildingi are two species of starfish found on Hawaii which were found to exhibit autotomy, shedding one or more arms frequently. The arms are known as \\"comets\\" and can move about independently and each one can grow into a new individual. Though severed from the nervous system and the water vascular system they still exhibit normal behaviour patterns. In a study undertaken in Hawaii, it was found that the detachment of an arm was not a sudden event. Most fractures took place about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the disk and started with a small crack appearing on the lower surface of the arm. This spread laterally and upwards towards the dorsal surface. Then the tube feet on the arm and those on the body pulled the two parts of the animal in opposite directions until they parted. The process could take about an hour to complete. The damaged tissue healed in about 10 days and the animal grew a new arm over the course of several months. Breaks took place in various positions on the arm, though Crozier noted a particular breaking zone in Coscinasterias tenuispina. The immediate cause of the autotomy is not always apparent. Of 50 specimens of Linckia multifora brought to the laboratory, 18 had shed one or more arms within 24 hours. The mortality rate of newly severed arms was high, many succumbing to bacterial infection while the wounds were fresh. Once the wound had healed, in about 10 days, survival was more likely. When arms were severed into several lengths in the laboratory, it was found that those over 0.5 inch (1 cm) in length were capable of regenerating. These included the tips of the arms and the central sections with wounds at each end. It takes about 10 months to regenerate a new disk with arms 0.5 inch (1 cm) in length. The first development in the regeneration cycle is the formation of a crescent-shaped ridge at the damaged end. Grooves begin to form and a mouth develops at the point from which they radiate. The arms start to form and tube feet begin to appear. As the arms grow the disc begins to develop and eventually a madreporite appears. This process lasts for some time, and about 10 months after separation, the comet has a half disc and 4 arms about 1 cm (0.4 in) long.

Winter rains put an end to campaigning after the advance from the Gaza‚ÄìBeersheba line to the capture of Jerusalem in December 1917. This lull in the fighting offered the opportunity for the captured territories to be consolidated. Extensive developments were also required along the lines of communication to ensure that front-line troops were adequately supplied, approximately from their main bases at Moascar and Kantara on the Suez Canal. General Edmund Allenby's initial strategic plans focused on his open right flank. If attacked with sufficiently large forces, he could be outflanked by an attack from the east‚Äîunlike his left flank which rested securely on the Mediterranean Sea to the west. His aim was to capture the territory east of Jerusalem stretching to the Dead Sea, where his right flank could be more secure. The area was garrisoned by Ottoman troops entrenched on hill-tops which the British infantry, Australian light horse and New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigades attacked. The infantry captured Talat ed Dumm on the main Jerusalem to Jericho road, while the light horse and mounted rifle brigades captured Jericho and the area to the south bordered by the Jordan River and the Dead Sea.

Further north at Jebel Kuruntul (also known as Jebel Quruntul, the Mount of Temptation and Mount Quarantania) the mountains end abruptly in a 1,000-foot (300 m) cliff.Blenkinsop 1925, p. 223Cutlack 1941, p. 103 Sometimes the attacking parties had to haul themselves and each other over abrupt cliffs to be in a position to fight at close quarters at the top.Cutlack 1941, pp. 102‚Äì3 Yet, in early Spring, the area was covered by wild flowers including cyclamen, anemones, poppies and tulips.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 305 =Defending force= Three Ottoman armies were deployed to defend their front line: the Eighth Army (headquartered at Tul Keram) defended the Mediterranean section, the Seventh Army (headquartered at Nablus) defended the Judean Hills sector, and the Fourth Army (headquartered at Amman) defended the eastern Transjordan section of the line.Keogh 1955 p. 219Hughes 1999 p. 73 Between 3,000 and 5,000 Ottoman troops from the 26th and 53rd Infantry Divisions XX Corps defended the area on the western edge of the Jordan Valley. They garrisoned a series of hill-tops from Tubk el Kaneiterah, near the Dead Sea, through Talat ed Dumm to the Wadi Fara. Here the XX Corps was entrenched at Ras um Deisis and El Muntar Iraq Ibrahim astride the Jericho road.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 Parts I II pp. 305, 655Erickson 2001 p. 193 There was also at least one regiment in the Jordan Valley near the Wadi el Auja.Keogh 1955 p. 204 =Mounted and infantry attacking force= By February, logistics had sufficiently developed to support the advance towards Jericho, and Allenby ordered Lieutenant General Philip Chetwode to capture Jericho as soon as the weather cleared.Kinloch 2007, p. 249 While the remainder of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force held the front line and garrisoned the captured territories in southern Palestine, Chetwode's XX Corps the 60th (2/2nd London) Division was to make the attack towards Jericho, supported by his 53rd (Welsh) Division and one infantry brigade from the 74th (Yeomanry) Division on the left. They were to move towards the Wadi el Auja, which flowed eastwards into the Jordan River (not to be confused with the Wadi el Auja which flowed westwards into the Mediterranean Sea from the same watershed). At the same time, Chauvel's Desert Mounted Corps, mounted force formed by the 1st Light Horse Brigade and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade (both brigades from the Anzac Mounted Division), was to cover the right flank of Chetwode's infantry and advance towards Rujm el Bahr on the Dead Sea.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 Part II pp. 655, 663Cutlack 1941, p. 102Brief Record of the Advance of the EEF 1919 pp. 37‚Äì79The 2nd Light Horse Brigade remained on the maritime plain, near the Mediterranean Sea, holding a portion of the front line. [Powles 1922 p. 173] Falls Sketch Map 22 shows the movements of the infantry from 13 to 21 February 1918 and mounted patrols in the Jordan Valley on 21 February The plan was for the 60th (London) Division to advance to Mukhmas north-north-east of Jerusalem, then advance forward east through El Muntar Iraq Ibrahim and Ras et Tawil. Their left flank was to be covered the 53rd (Welsh) Division, which was to capture the high ground at Rammun north of Mukhmas while their right was covered by the Anzac Mounted Division.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 304 The second stage required the 60th (London) Division to advance to a point yet to be decided, in three brigade columns: the right to Jebil Ekteif south of the main Jericho road, the centre to Talat ed Dumm, and the left column moving along the \\"Ancient Road\\" running east from Mukhmas. Their final advance would take them to the edge of the ridge overlooking Jericho and the Jordan Valley; there was no plan for them to enter the valley. Each infantry column was to be supported by a 60-pounder or 6-inch artillery battery, a Field artillery brigade and a field company of Royal Engineers. On 14 February, preliminary operations were carried out by the XX Corps; the 60th (London) Division which advanced to Mukhmas north-north-east of Jerusalem, while on their left flank the 53rd (Welsh) Division captured the village of Deir Diwan.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 306 At this time the 1st Light Horse and New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigades were at Ayun Kara; they marched out for Bethlehem arriving there on 17 and 18 February. While the infantry attacks were progressing along the road between Jerusalem and Jericho on 19 February, the two brigades of the Anzac Mounted Division were to move in a flanking movement towards Nebi Musa. They were to make their way down into the Jordan Valley towards Rujm el Bahr to cut off enemy retreat from Jericho, and drive the remaining Ottoman defenders to the eastern side of the Jordan River.Downes 1938 pp. 679‚Äì81 =Air support= On 3 January, two Australian aircraft discovered boats carrying corn and hay moving from Ghor el Hadit (behind Point Costigan) and Rujm el Bahr at the northern end of the Dead Sea. These were bombed and sprayed with bullets repeatedly until the boat service stopped.Cutlack 1941 pp. 99‚Äì100 On 10 January, as part of the preparations for the attack on Jericho, six aircraft dropped 48 bombs on Amman and Kissir, a Hedjaz railway station to the south, resulting in several direct hits on rolling stock, station buildings and troops. Aircraft patrols were then directed to fly over Jericho and Shunet Nimrin on the western and eastern sectors of the Jordan Valley on alternate days. These patrols closely watched and reported tactical details, including the number of tents and camps, the state of supply dumps, the conditions of roads and tracks, and traffic on the railway.Cutlack 1941 p. 100 Battle =Infantry attack on 19 February= The 60th (London) Division advanced with their 180th Brigade in the centre, their 181st Brigade on the left, and their 179th Brigade with the Wellington Mounted Rifle Regiment covering their right flank. At Ras et Tawil, the 2/23rd Battalion, London Regiment (181st Brigade) suffered 50 casualties in attacking some 300 entrenched Ottomans, capturing 25 prisoners and two machine guns; the Ottomans abandoned their position soon after. To the north-east of El Muntar Iraq Ibrahim, during a further advance by the 2/20th Battalion, London Regiment along a narrow ridge on the south bank of the Wadi Fara, they captured the high ground suffering 66 casualties. Meanwhile, on the left flank of the 60th (London) Division, the 160th Brigade of the 53rd (Welsh) Division captured Rammun, where the 2/10th Battalion Middlesex Regiment had some hard fighting, and the heights to the south. The Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment moved from Bethlehem to the Greek monastery of Mar Saba and onto the El Buqeia plateau, where Ottoman forces were entrenched astride the Mar Saba to Jericho road south of Nebi Musa.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 307 The remainder of the 1st Light Horse and New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigades moved from Bethlehem towards El Muntar. Chetwode and Chauvel watched these operations begin from the Mount of Olives more than above sea level; by the time the light horse and mounted rifles brigades reached Jericho on 21 February they were nearly below sea level.Hill 1978, p. 142 =20 February= Infantry attack The three infantry columns advanced: the column in the centre, the 180th Brigade, captured their objective of Talat ed Dumm on the main road from Jerusalem to Jericho. This infantry brigade moved along the Jerusalem to Jericho road towards Talat ed Dumm; they were supported by the 10th Heavy Battery and one 6-inch Howitzer of the 383rd Siege Battery. The village was captured after an hour's bombardment. On the left, the 181st Brigade was slowed in their advance by small rearguards which showed skills in manoeuvre. The brigade was only able to advance to be about halfway between Ras et Tawil and Jebel Qruntul (also known as Jebel Kuruntul, the Mount of Temptation and Mount Quarantania) by nightfall, with the 231st Brigade of the 74th (Yeomanry) Division forming a reserve. On the right, the 179th Brigade column marched towards Jebel Ekteif (to the south of Talat ed Dumm); their 2/13th Battalion, London Regiment, however, faced a sheer drop of over and had to proceed across intervening ridges into parallel wadis, arriving too late for the attack. Meanwhile, two companies of the 2/16th Battalion, London Regiment from the 179th Brigade, of the 60th (London) Division were ordered to support an attack on Jebel Ekteif by the 2/15th Battalion, London Regiment. By 08:15 they had captured the advanced trenches, three companies, and fought their way up into the firing line on the summit of the hill. At 10:00 the British infantry were reported to have captured this dominating position on the Jerusalem‚ÄìJericho road, but a strong counter-attack drove them off. Jebel Ektief was finally captured at about 12:30 when heavy artillery helped the desperate attackers secure their objective.Powles 1922, p. 178Falls states it was captured at 11:25. [Falls 1930 Vol. 2 Part II p. 307] Mounted attack Map showing the advance of the Anzac Mounted Division with Ottoman positions indicated in green Meanwhile, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade (with the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment which had returned from the 179th Brigade) led the 1st Light Horse Brigade at 03:30 in their advanced on El Muntar.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 308 The advance guard formed by the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment moved from Bethlehem along an ancient road down the Wadi en Nar to the valley near El Muntar hill, followed by their brigade and the 1st Light Horse Brigade. They zig-zagged down to the valley floor while Ottoman soldiers on the height of El Muntar above watched their approach. Because of the terrain they moved in single file: the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade was strung out from five to eight miles (8.0‚Äì13 km), and it was hours before the long column could deploy for the attack.Powles 1922, pp. 176‚Äì7Moore 1921, p. 98 Frank Hurley's photograph of the 1st Light Horse Brigade zig-zagging down a barren hillside By 06:00 all the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade was in the valley; the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment was attacking Hill 306 while the Canterbury and Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiments attacked Hill 288. Shortly after 12:00 a mounted advance by an Auckland squadron took Hill 288, and Hill 306 was captured soon after. They attacked Ottoman positions from Tibq el Quneitra to Jebel el Kahmum astride the Mar Saba‚ÄìJericho road. These were both occupied soon after 14:00, forcing the Ottoman defenders to fall back to Nebi Musa. But Nebi Musa was strongly held by entrenched Ottoman soldiers supported by artillery, which made it impossible to move on: the attack was postponed until the next day. Meanwhile, at dusk, the 1st Light Horse Brigade began its descent. They moved down the Wadi Qumran to the Jordan Valley, following a goat track which fell in to get into position to attack Nebi Musa from the rear. This journey was successfully completed by midnight. =21 February= Under cover of darkness, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade advanced north along a very rough track and by daylight had reached just east of the Neby Musa position. They made a dismounted attack while British infantry attacked Neby Musa from the rear.Moore 1921, p. 101 The Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiment occupied Neby Musa at daylight after crossing the gorge on foot to find the Ottoman garrison had withdrawn with their guns.Powles 1922, p. 179 When the 1st Light Horse Brigade reached the floor of the Jordan Valley near the Dead Sea, below sea level, it turned north towards Jericho. A single troop of 3rd Light Horse Regiment entered Jericho at about 08:00 to find the Ottoman garrison had withdrawn. The remainder of the brigade advanced up the Jordan Valley as far as the Wadi el Auja, while the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment (New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade) occupied Rujm el Bahr on the north shore of the Dead Sea.Powles 1922, p. 182 Meanwhile, the 60th (London) Division moved to the top of the cliff overlooking Jericho and the Jordan Valley from Neby Musa to Jebel Qruntul. Divisional Headquarters Staff set up their report centre about behind Jericho; when they were sitting down to a morning cup of tea, Chetwode and Chauvel joined them. Chaytor was sitting on the step of his car when shells fired from the other side of the Jordan River started to explode. One hit the front of his car and he narrowly escaped injury. This gun continued shelling the area at a range of over ; the British 13-pounders could get no further than . Chetwode's force of infantry and mounted units suffered 510 casualties during these operations. =Air support= During these three days of operations No. 1 Squadron's aircraft completely dominated all enemy aircraft, bombing and machine-gunning Ottoman positions, and reporting to headquarters on progress and estimates of Ottoman dispositions and strength. Messages were also dropped on troops in the front line with urgent news. Considerable Ottoman reinforcements were seen to arrive at Shunet Nimrin on the eastern side of the Jordan River, and an aerial raiding formation from No. 1 Squadron bombed troop tents, marquees and a supply dump in the area. Aftermath Ottoman trenches on the shore of the Dead Sea On 22 February the 60th (London) Division withdrew its main line to Jebel Ekteif ‚Äì Talat ed Dumm ‚Äì Ras et Tawil, leaving outposts on the cliffs above the Jordan Valley and the Anzac Mounted Division started their journey back to Richon LeZion via Bethlehem. The Anzac Mounted Division left behind in the Jordan Valley the Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment with a subsection of machine guns and an artillery battery (under orders of the 60th Division) in a strong position where the road from Jerusalem falls into the Jordan Valley.Moore 1921, p. 103Powles 1922 p. 184 Ottoman troops on the western bank of the Jordan River were holding a strong bridgehead at Ghoraniyeh, protecting the old stone bridge on the main Jerusalem to Es Salt road. There was also a smaller detachment down stream, covering the ford at Makhadet Hijlah (the traditional site of Christ's baptism).Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 309 The Auckland Mounted Rifle Regiment patrolled the Jordan River and valley area under enemy observation, attracting artillery shelling from Ottoman field guns. The patrols monitored the Ottoman positions at Ghoraniyeh and Makhadet Hajlah until 25 February when all Ottoman troops, guns and a pontoon bridge were found to have been removed to the east bank of the river. At the same time Shunet Nimrin was rapidly entrenched by the Ottoman Seventh Army and was soon held in force.Powles 1922, p. 183 A halt in the Jordan Valley Ottoman army garrisons continued to hold the Hedjaz railway from Deraa to Medina (although the line was harassed and cut by insurgent Arab units) and Cemal's VIII and XII Corps guarded the northern Levantine coast with four infantry divisions.Erickson 2001 p. 174 The Ottoman Empire's War Minister, Enver Pasa, had lost confidence in the commander of the Ottoman forces in Palestine, German General von Falkenhayn, and on 1 March 1918 replaced him with General Otto Liman von Sanders.Erickson 2007, p. 130 On 6 March the War Cabinet gave Allenby leave to advance \\"to the maximum extent possible, consistent with the safety of the force under his orders\\". He decided to create a third infantry corps called the XXII, commanded by Barrow with Wavell as his chief of staff.This corps was not formed because the Spring Offensive had drained Allenby's force. On 21 March an attempt to cut the Hedjaz railway at Amman began; this coincided with the launch of the Spring Offensive by Ludendorff against the Allies on the Western Front.Woodward 2006 p. 162Bruce claims that although the occupation of Jericho protected Jerusalem from Ottoman attack from the east, it did not provide the hoped-for secure base to mount operations on the Hedjaz railway.

The blunt-leaf heath grows in swampy areas and heathland in eastern Australia. It is usually seen growing less than a metre tall. Flowers form in any time of the year, but are mostly seen between July and January. The specific epithet obtusifolia is derived from Latin, referring to the thickly tipped blunt leaves.Les Robinson - Field Guide to the Native Plants of Sydney, page 107 The original specimen was collected in Sydney in the early colonial years. And it was first recorded in scientific literature in the year 1805, published by the eminent English botanist James Edward Smith. Growing up to a metre (3 ft) tall (though mostly 50‚Äì80 cm high), Epacris obtusifolia is a dainty shrub with tiny elliptic leaves which measure 6.4 to 11.5 mm long and 1.5 to 3.1 mm wide. Appearing mainly from July to January, the white bell-shaped flowers are arranged along the stems. Although only 4‚Äì8 mm long, their numbers make them conspicuous. Found in New South Wales east of the Great Dividing Range, as well as Queensland, Victoria and Tasmania, Epacris obtusifolia is found in wet heathland. In the Sydney region it is associated with such plants as coral fern (Gleichenia dicarpa), swamp banksia (Banksia robur), and the sedge Lepidosperma limicola. Plants live between ten and twenty years, and are killed by fire and regenerate from seed which lies dormant in the soil. The seedlings reach flowering age within four years. Epacris obtusifolia can be propagated by cutting and requires a well-drained yet moist position in the garden. It was first cultivated in the United Kingdom in 1804.

It was a response to a 1952 UK Ministry of Supply requirement for a new aircraft suitable for both military and civilian long-range roles. Civilian models of the Vickers Valiant and Handley Page Victor V-bombers were also planned for the same contract. The Vickers V-1000 won the contest over the Atlantic, but ultimately none of these designs would be built. In early June 1953, Sir Roy Dobson C.B.E., then Managing Director of A.V. Roe and Company, revealed that the company was working on a project for a 100-ton airliner based on the Vulcan. The aircraft as envisaged, would have carried a flight crew of five (pilot, co-pilot, navigator and two engineering officers) as well as between 76 and 113 passengers in three separate configurations (luxury, basic and tourist) at speeds in excess of or Mach 0.9 in a pressurised cabin with an equivalent altitude of at . The chief designer of Avro at the time, after Roy Chadwick's death, was Stuart Davies. Planform, with the original wing and straight leading edge The Atlantic would have been powered either by Bristol Olympus or Rolls-Royce Conway engines. Artists illustrations at the time show passengers in a diameter fuselage, seated in two rows, two-abreast, with a single central aisle, with the seats facing towards the rear of the aircraft for safety reasons. The aircraft was initially depicted in illustrations and 1/24-scale models using the original Vulcan wing planform with a straight-line, swept back leading edge, but a 1955 design revision showed the later Phase 2 \`kinked' leading edge to overcome buffet during flight. It was anticipated that the Atlantic would be complete by 1958, and initial discussions were held with British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) regarding the viability of the proposal. Avro is reported to have considered a civilian version of the Vulcan as \`inevitable' in 1954‚Äì55, and insisted on an initial order of at least 25 aircraft before it would commence production; these orders were not forthcoming.

This model can be applied in three primary scenarios: Monopoly; Maximum Sustainable Yield (biological optimum); and Open Access. Monopoly Profit maximizing firms, whether in monopoly or competitive markets, increase production to the point that marginal revenue = marginal costs. Monopoly firms produce less at higher prices than competitive markets. Maximum sustainable yield The maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is the largest amount of biomass that can be collected annually for indefinite periods. MSY assesses the productive capacity of the fishery, rather than demand or economic costs. MSY output may be greater or less than monopolistic or competitive output. Open access Open access is an unrestricted market. In open access, production in a given year is limited by demand and the costs of production without regard to that year's effects on future years. Open access markets can be competitive or monopolistic. References  Bioeconom√≠a pesquera: teor√≠a, modelaci√≥n y manejo Por J. C.

Its north-eastern neighbour is the Fl√ºela; its southwestern neighbour is the Sertig valley. The Dischma valley is drained by the Dischmabach. The valley floor is at an altitude of about 1500‚Äì2000 meters. The most important side valleys are the R√ºedisch T√§lli and Rinert√§lli.  Settlements  In the valley, there are several small settlements and alpine pastures. Among the most important are, in order from the bottom to the top of the valley: In den B√ºelen, Wildi (), Uf den Chaiseren (), In den St√ºcken (), Stillberg (), Hof (), Teufi (), Boden (), Gadmen (), Am Rin (), Grossalp () and D√ºrrboden (). These settlements form the Dischma neighborhood of the sub-municipality of Davos Platz.  Passes and glaciers  At the end of the valley are the two passes leading into the Engadin: the Scaletta Pass () and with the SAC's Grialetschh√ºtte. This pass was important in the Late Middle Ages and the Early Modern Period for the import of wine from the Valtellina valley to Davos. At the top of the valley, we find the Scaletta Glacier between Piz Grialetsch () and Scalettahorn ().  Surrounding mountains  Important mountains on the Fl√ºela side are Schwarzhorn (), Piz Rad√∂nt (), Sentischhorn () and Baslersch Chopf (). Mountains on the Sertig side include Bocktenhorn (), Jatzhorn () and the Jakobshorn (), which is surrounded by ski lifts. The Dischma and Sertig valleys are also starting points for a multi-day hike to the Piz Kesch, which is an ultra prominent peak, that is, a peak with a topographic prominence of over 1500 meters.

Format The Budget covers news relating to Western Australian football generally, but is focused on the WAFL with names and numbers of participating players listed for all WAFL and Western Australian Australian Football League matches. History The Football Budget was first produced as McMahons WA Footballer in 1921, soon becoming known just as the WA Footballer. The magazine was rebranded in 1936 as the Football Budget after the South Australian equivalent of the same name. In 1997, it was again rebranded, this time as Real Footy, to fit with the competition's change of name from the WAFL to Westar Rules. 1999 saw the programme's name change to Football WA for a season, before another change to Football 2000 the following season. The competition name reverted to the West Australian Football League in 2001, prompting the programme to also revert to its old name, the Football Budget. The publication was started by South Australian company McMahon's Agency, which was a printing and newsagency business. Frederick Crease was sent to Perth to manage its day-to-day affairs, while Ernest Grow was hired to sell advertising. The programme cost threepence in that first year, which was soured by the fraud perpetrated on the company by Mr Grow. He was convicted of fraud for claiming to have sold advertising space to non-existent companies, for which he was paid a commission. In the 1990s, publisher Wright Media was given the rights to publish the Football Budget. Media Tonic eventually bought out Wright Media and continued publishing the program. After the completion of the 2019 season, Media Tonic handed control of the Football Budget back to the WA Football Commission.

Background On 25 April 2010, the Sunday Mirror ran an article entitled \\"My Affair with England Captain Rio\\", in which interior designer Carly Storey gave an account of an alleged relationship with Rio Ferdinand. Ferdinand described the article as \\"gross invasion of my privacy\\" and brought legal action in which he sought damages and a worldwide injunction against further publication. Ferdinand said that he had not met Ms. Storey for six years at the time of publication of the Sunday Mirror article, and had exchanged text messages with her between that time and his appointment as captain of the England national football team in February 2010. He claimed that there had been a misuse of private information. Ms. Storey received a payment of ¬£16,000 for her interview with the Sunday Mirror, which had been sold to the newspaper after she had contacted the publicist Max Clifford. Lawyers acting for Mirror Group Newspapers argued that he had been appointed as captain of the England football team on the basis that he was a \\"reformed and responsible\\" character. The case centred on whether the Sunday Mirror had a public interest defence based on Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the right to freedom of expression, or whether Ferdinand was entitled to privacy in accordance with Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the right to respect for private and family lifeFerdinand to hear privacy ruling The Guardian, 29 September 2011.Rio Ferdinand anger at Carly Storey Sunday Mirror story BBC News, 5 July 2011.

Lawyers acting for Ferdinand issued a statement saying that he was \\"extremely disappointed\\" with the decision, and announced an intention to appeal.

He dropped out of school to fight in Chechnya and was probably sent to train in al-Qaeda camps in Afghanistan where he would be chosen by Osama bin Laden to participate in the terrorist attacks in America. He arrived in the United States in May 2001 on a tourist visa and helped plan out how the attacks would take place. On September 11, 2001, he boarded United Airlines Flight 175 and assisted in the hijacking of the plane so that lead hijacker and trained pilot Marwan al-Shehhi could take over the plane and crash it into the South Tower of the World Trade Center, as part of the coordinated attacks.  History  An Imam,Videotape of recorded will of Abdulaziz al-Omari and others Ghamdi was from the al Bahah Province of Saudi Arabia, a province in the south west of Saudi Arabia. It is the capital of Al Bahah Province nestled between the resorts of Mecca and Abha, Al Bahah is one of the Kingdom‚Äôs prime tourist attractions. Ghamdi shared the same tribal affiliation with fellow hijackers Saeed al-Ghamdi, Hamza al-Ghamdi, and Ahmed al-Haznawi. This group is noted as being some of the more religiously observant of the hijackers, and they are thought to have met each other some time in 1999. Known as al-Jaraah al-Ghamdi during the preparations, the only one of the hijackers to use a variation on his own name, Ghamdi quit school to fight in Chechnya against the Russians in 2000, and received a US Visa on September 3 of that year. In November, both he and Salem al-Hazmi flew to Beirut, though on separate flights and at different times. Ghamdi flew on the same flight as a senior Hezbollah operative, although the 9/11 Commission could find no evidence that either knew the other. His family claims to have last seen him in December. In March 2001, Ghamdi is reported to have met with a Jordanian who has been charged with providing false identification to at least 50 illegal aliens. Hijackers Majed Moqed, Hani Hanjour, and Nawaf al-Hazmi are reported to have met with him at the same time.Associated Press March 6, 2002. \\"Four Hijackers Stayed at CT Motel\\" Inexplicably, this is more than a month before Ghamdi first arrived in the United States, according to the FBI and the 9/11 Commission. On May 2, Ghamdi arrived in the U.S. with fellow-hijacker Moqed, on a student visa. He listed the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Florida as his permanent address on his driver's license. He and Moqed moved in with Hani Hanjour and Nawaf al- Hazmi in Falls Church, Virginia. All four later moved into an apartment in Paterson, New Jersey. He called his parents in July 2001, but did not mention being in the United States.  Attacks  Hamza al-Ghamdi purchased Ahmed's ticket online for United Airlines Flight 175 on August 29 or August 30, after buying his own. He listed a Mail Boxes Etc. address for Ahmed. Hamza and Ahmed al-Ghamdi stayed at the Charles Hotel in Cambridge, Massachusetts. On September 8, they checked out of the hotel, and moved into the Days Hotel on Soldiers Field Road in Brighton, where they remained up until the day of the attacks.Mueller, Robert S., III (09/26/02). Statement for the Record, Joint Investigation Into September 11th: Closed Hearing. On the morning of September 11, 2001, Ahmed left the hotel with Hamza, the two of them sharing a taxicab to get to Logan International Airport. There, Ghamdi showed his Virginia ID Card as identification, and boarded Flight 175 where he sat the furthest back of the hijackers, in seat 9D, helped to hijack it, and assisted as the plane crashed into the World Trade Center. Ahmed and Hamza al-Ghamdi pushed the passengers and crew to the back of the plane while Fayez Banihammad and Mohand al-Shehri killed the pilots Victor Saracini and Michael Horrocks allowing Marwan al-Shehhi to take control of the plane.

On September 11, 2001, Hamza boarded United Airlines Flight 175 and hijacked the plane along with his brother Ahmed al Ghamdi and 3 other terrorists so that the plane could be crashed into the South Tower of the World Trade Center.  History  Some reports say that Hamza left his home to fight in Chechnya against the Russians in early 2000. (Other reports say he left in January 2001.) He called home several times until late 2001, saying he was in Chechnya. Known as Julaybeeb during the preparations,Videotape of recorded will of Abdulaziz al-Omari and others Hamza traveled to the United Arab Emirates some time in late 2000, where he purchased traveler's cheques presumed to have been paid for by Mustafa al-Hawsawi. Five other hijackers also passed through the UAE and purchased traveller‚Äôs cheques, including Majed Moqed, Saeed al-Ghamdi, Wail al-Shehri, Ahmed al-Haznawi and Ahmed al-Nami. In January 2001, Ghamdi rented a post office box in Delray Beach, Florida with another hijacker, Mohand al- Shehri. According to FBI director Robert Mueller and the 9/11 Commission however, Hamza did not first enter the United States until a London flight on May 28 with Mohand and Abdulaziz al-Omari. In March 2001, Ghamdi was filmed in a farewell video that was aired on al Jazeera. In the video, many future 9/11 hijackers swear to become martyrs, although no details of the plot are revealed. Ghamdi does not speak in the film, but is seen studying maps and flight manuals. Hamza al-Ghamdi He was one of 9 hijackers to open a SunTrust bank account with a cash deposit around June 2001. Ghamdi also applied for and received a Florida driver's license on June 27, 2001. In the next two months, he obtained two duplicate licenses simply by filling out change-of-address forms. Five other suspected hijackers also received duplicate Florida licenses in 2001, and others had licenses in different states. Some have speculated that this was to allow multiple people to use the same identity.  Attacks  Ghamdi purchased his own eTicket for Flight 175 on August 29, using his Visa card. The FBI also claimed that he also purchased an eTicket for a \\"Flight 7950\\" from Los Angeles to San Francisco, although it does not give the projected date of flight. On August 30, Hamza bought his brother, Ahmed al- Ghamdi, an identical eTicket for Flight 175 and bought them each one-way tickets on an AirTran flight on September 7, from Fort Lauderdale to Boston. However, Ghamdi instead went with Mohand al-Shehri to Newark, New Jersey on $139.75 tickets purchased from the Mile High Travel agency in Lauderdale-by- the-Sea. Hamza and Ahmed al-Ghamdi stayed at the Charles Hotel in Cambridge, Massachusetts. On September 8 they checked out of the hotel, and moved into the Days Hotel on Soldiers Field Road in Brighton, Boston, Massachusetts where they remained up until the attacks.

However, the picture Ghamdi's father refers to is assumed to have not been a picture released by the FBI, as they did not make the hijacker's pictures available until September 27, 2001.

Design and development The Ikarus MM-2 was developed as a replacement for the Zmaj Fizir FN, which had been the most commonly used training aircraft of the Yugoslav Royal Air Force up until 1941. This was result of the fact that in the mid thirties trainer airplanes in the Yugoslav Royal Air Force had their maximum speed of around 200 km/h and the modern combat planes are double faster.

This first plane was marked as M-1, M coming from the last name of designer. Also at same time, was started project on two different basic training aircraft, low-wing Ikarus Aero 2 and Rogo≈æarski Bruco≈°. Design had proposed inline Renault engine and pilots in tandem. Construction of the plane and geometry was modern, with low wing and retractable landing gear.

First flight test was made in December 1940 and test pilot was Vasilije Stojanovic. Total of 45 factory test flight was made with 20 flying hours made. Plane was very stable with very good handling characteristics. As the aircraft showed excellent properties, the Air Force Command had bought the prototype, which on 4 April 1941 flew in from Zemun in Kraljevo together with experiment group Yugoslav Royal Air Force.

He is known for his work in monetary policy and economic methodology. Mayer received his Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1953.  Early life  Mayer was an only child born to middle-class Jewish parents in Vienna, Austria in 1927. He was not a good student, except for subjects that he liked and only barely passed the test to enter gymnasium. The Anschluss made it difficult for his father to find work and the family began trying to get out of Austria in 1938. The difficulty was to get a visa to enter another country; leaving Austria was then not a problem. Mayer's parents applied for a visa in March 1938. Because England was accepting refugee children, Mayer was able to get a visa, but had to leave alone in September 1938, without his parents. His father was arrested in November and was released on the condition that he leave Austria within 48 hours, enabling him‚Äîbut not his wife‚Äîto also get a visa to Britain. In November 1941, his mother received a visa to the United States and left on the last boat before Pearl Harbor, after which transit would have been impossible.Roger E.

He was released in 1942 and was allowed to work, enabling him to take care of his son. He sent Mayer to Bunce Court School, then in Shropshire, where it had been evacuated for the war's duration.

Taxonomy  The Austrian naturalist Heinrich Wawra von Fernsee described Vachellia reficiens (as Acacia reficiens) in 1859. It forms a species complex with V. luederitzii, also from central and southern Africa. Two subspecies exist: V. reficiens subspecies reficiens, which found in Angola and southwestern Africa, and has affinities to V. luederitzii, and V. reficiens subsp. misera which is found in eastern Africa, from Sudan and Somalia through Kenya and into Uganda, and has affinities to V. etbaica. With the re-typification of the genus AcaciaInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature (Vienna Code). Regnum Vegetabile 146. A.R.G. Gantner Verlag KG this species was placed in Vachellia.Maslin, B.R. 2008. Generic and subgeneric names in Acacia following retypification of the genus. Muelleria 26: 7‚Äì9. Description Vachellia reficiens can grow up to in height. Its bark is reddish-brown or greyish- black, and is quite rough and fissured. The younger growing branches can have a purple-red appearance, hence its common names. An interesting characteristic about this plant is that it has both, long, straight thorns and shorter curved/hook-like thorns, but generally not both in one pair. Leaves are bipinnately compound (as is common in most African acacia species) with 1 to 4 pinnae pairs, where each pinna again has 5 to 13 leaflet pairs. The flowers are white- to cream-coloured, and mostly seen during the summer months of December and January, but they can blossom almost all year round, depending on the geographical location. The fruit is a flat red-brown pod.  Distribution and habitat  Vachellia reficiens is found in the drier areas of Africa, in countries like Angola, South Africa, Swaziland and Namibia. This plant seems to prefer rocky soil-types and it does not grow in high-rainfall areas, but rather in semi-desert and arid shrubland. It is an abundant dominant species of arid shrubland throughout Kenya, and it forms up to 30% of total woody canopy in the South Turkana Ecosystem in the Turkana District.  Ecology  This tree's leaves are browsed upon by game and small livestock like the Greater Kudu and goats. In some areas of Namibia and Kenya, Vachellia reficiens subsp. reficiens is considered an invasive species as it can encroach on areas of farmland, especially on disturbed soil. It is very opportunistic and hardy and can subsequently take over large areas of native vegetation.  Uses  The nomadic Ngisonyoka people in the Turkana District of Kenya use Vachellia reficiens wood to build temporary houses. In Namibia's Kaokoveld region, the branches of this tree are used for fencing and the bark is used to curdle milk, while the thorns can be used to pierce ears. The seeds can be baked in hot ash, crushed, ground and mixed with tobacco to use as snuff. The Giriama people use the wood for firewood and charcoal, and straight stems for poles.

It runs from NC 903 near Ayden to U.S. Route 17 (US 17) near Hackney between Vanceboro and Chocowinity. Most of the highway is rural, the only town it serves is Ayden. NC 102 appeared on the first state highway map in 1924, running from Snow Hill to Goldsboro. At its peak, the road stretched from US 17 at its current eastern terminus to US 301 north of Fayetteville. The routing from Interstate 95 (I-95) to Snow Hill was renumbered as US 13 in 1977, and the segment of the route from its current western terminus to Snow Hill was replaced by an extension of NC 903\\\\. Route description NC 102 begins at NC 903 west of Ayden. It then heads east until it reaches Ayden. After about , NC 102 enters Ayden, and has an interchange with NC 11 Bypass and then an intersection with NC 11\\\\. NC 102 continues through Ayden along 3rd Street, and in the heart of Ayden crosses a CSX rail line. From there NC 102 then continues east out of Ayden still along 3rd Street. After leaving Ayden, NC 102 enters a very rural area with many farms and small forests. About a mile (1.2 km) further east NC 102 has a junction with Ayden Golf Club Road. As NC 102 continues to the east it crosses Fork Swamp and has a junction with County Home Road (Secondary Road 1725, or SR 1725). About a mile to the east (1.3 km) the road turns to head in a southeastern direction instead of the eastern direction of most of the route. The routing along this part of the road almost parallels NC 43 to the east of the road. after the road turned in a southeastern direction. NC 102 intersects Stokestown‚ÄìSt.Johns Road (SR 1753). The road continues across Clayroot Swamp before the intersection with NC 43\\\\. The route continues eastward from that intersection and crosses Creeping Swamp and Gorham Swamp before crossing over a railroad owned by Norfolk Southern. Immediately after NC 102 crosses the railroad tracks, it ends at US 17. History NC 102 first appeared on the 1924 first official state map running from NC 10 (present day US 70 Business) to NC 12 in Snow Hill. The 1930 North Carolina state map shows that a section of NC 102 was built from NC 60 north of Fayetteville to NC 22 in Sampson County. This section was not connected to the rest of NC 102 which had also been extended south of Goldsboro to Newton Grove. By 1931 the two sections of NC 102 were connected with NC 102 running a short concurrency with NC 23 south of Newton Grove. Between 1931 and 1936, the road was extended to its current eastern terminus at US 17\\\\. The road had a short concurrency with US 258 from Snow Hill to to the northeast. Between 1931 and 1938, NC 102 was rerouted in Goldsboro leaving NC 102A the old route. In 1941, NC 102 was routed onto US 13 through Newton Grove. Around 1953 the road was routed back onto its original routing through Goldsboro, eliminating NC 102A. Between 1956 and 1957, US 13 was extended along NC 102 from Snow Hill to US 70 east of Goldsboro. In 1958, NC 102 was routed along a freeway around Goldsboro, along with US 70 and US 117. Between 1958 and 1961, NC 102 was routed onto new routing, which is currently US 13. Between the years of 1961 and 1963, the section of routing between US 301 and I-95 was downgraded to a secondary road. During the same time the routing between I-95 and Snow Hill was renumbered as US 13. In 1977, NC 102 was truncated to its current western terminus. The routing it left behind was used to extend NC 903. The routing of NC 102 has stayed the same since 1977. Major intersections Special routes =Goldsboro alternate route= North Carolina Highway 102A (NC 102A) was established between 1931‚Äì38 as a renumbering of NC 102, from Chestnut Street, along George and Ash Streets, ending at Center Street. It also shared a concurrency with US 70/NC 111 along Ash Street. By 1953, it was decommissioned in favor of US 117-A and NC 102\\\\.

The match was held on Sunday 26 September 1971 at the Junction Oval in St Kilda, Victoria, to decide Division 1 Premiership for the 1971 Victorian Football Association season. The match was one of the most controversial in the history of the VFA. Dandenong won the match by six points; however, Preston challenged the result, on the grounds that a free kick paid to Dandenong full-forward Jim Miller before the opening bounce was not valid under the rules of the game. It was not until Preston's challenge was defeated on the evening of Wednesday 29 September that Dandenong was formally confirmed as premiers. It was Dandenong's second VFA Division 1 premiership. Lead-up The Dandenong Redlegs and Preston Bullants had both been promoted from Division 2 to Division 1 in the early 1960s, and had enjoyed success in Division 1 through the latter part of the decade. Dandenong won its first premiership in 1967, and Preston won its first premiership in 1968. The two teams then faced each other in the 1969 Grand Final, which Preston won by twelve points to secure back-to-back flags. Both sides missed the finals in 1970, but returned to the top of the ladder in 1971. At the end of the 1971 home and away season, Preston finished as minor premiers with a record of 13-4-1; Dandenong finished second with a record of 12‚Äì6. The teams had met in the final round of the home and away season, in a vigorous and spiteful match which included two brawls; Preston won the match by 14 points. The two teams faced off in the Second Semi-Final on 12 September, with Dandenong winning easily; the result was effectively decided by quarter time, when Dandenong led 12.2 (74) to 1.2 (8) by 66 points; the Redlegs eventually won 24.11 (155) to 11.15 (81), by 74 points, with Jim Miller kicking ten goals. Preston faced Sandringham in the Preliminary Final on 19 September, and survived a late comeback to beat the Zebras, 17.17 (119) to 14.21 (105), by 14 points. The field umpire for the Grand Final was Jim McMaster. The match was played at the Junction Oval in St Kilda, a neutral venue. Match report Prior to the opening bounce, and prior to the opening siren, umpire McMaster observed jostling between Dandenong full-forward Jim Miller and Preston full-back Barry Leslie. Without bouncing the ball, McMaster paid a free kick against Leslie for a push in the back, from which Miller scored the opening goal of the game, giving Dandenong an early six-point lead. This free kick would ultimately be the subject of Preston's challenge to the match result. Dandenong was kicking with the aid of a breeze in the first quarter, and controlled general play to lead by 28 points at quarter time, although wasteful goalkicking saw the Redlegs score only 7.8 (50) from its fifteen scoring shots. The sides also resumed their hostilities from the final round of the season, with a brawl started after only six minutes had elapsed. With the advantage of the wind in the second quarter, Preston kicked five goals to three to narrow the margin to 14 points at half-time. In a low-scoring third quarter, Dandenong kicked two goals to one with the wind, to lead by 21 points. Several brawls and fights took place in the third quarter, and three players ‚Äì Jim Miller and Lyall Henriksen from Dandenong, and Robert Ireland from Preston ‚Äì were reported for striking. Preston had the better of attack in the final quarter; they kicked four quick goals late in the game, and at the 22-minute mark, after trailing for the entire afternoon, hit the front by one point. In the close finish, Pat Flaherty kicked a goal to regain the lead for Dandenong by five points, and then kicked another behind to extend the lead to six. There was no further score, the final siren sounded, and Dandenong won the game by six points. Overall, Dandenong rover Rod Evans was credited as the best on ground for the Redlegs. Ruckman Bernie McCarthy was the Bullants' best player, and Preston's final quarter fightback is largely credited to McCarthy's good ruckwork. Miller was the leading goalkicker on the ground, with five; he finished with 99 goals for the 1971 season, including finals. Protest The evening after the game, Preston club secretary Alf Rowe informed the VFA that the club would protest the result of the game; a formal protest was lodged on the morning of Monday 27 September. The basis of Preston's protest was that the free kick paid to Miller prior to the opening bounce was invalid, because umpire McMaster had not formally started the match when he paid it. Preston contended that Miller's goal should be removed from the scorecard, the final score amended to 92‚Äì92, and the premiership decided by a grand final replay the following Sunday. Preston did not at any stage attempt to argue that Leslie had not pushed Miller in the back, only that he should not have been penalised for doing so because the game had not yet started. The protest was heard by a meeting of the VFA Board of Management on the evening of Wednesday 29 September. The Board of Management had a total of 44 members, including two delegates from each of the 20 VFA clubs. =Relevant rules and customs= Preston's protest was based primarily on Rule 6(b) which described the commencement of play as follows: :The field umpire shall blow his whistle and bounce the ball in the circle... at the start of each quarter. Preston's contention was that because the ball had not been bounced, the match had not started when the free kick was paid, making it invalid. Media reports on the protest also made reference to Rule 17(a), which stated: :All breaches of the laws must be penalised whether the ball is dead or in play, although it is not immediately clear how this rule interacts with the start of the game as defined in Rule 6. VFA umpires' advisor Andrew O'Neill testified during the Board of Management meeting that, regardless of the precise interpretation of Rule 6(b), umpires were formally advised that free kicks could be paid between the opening whistle and the opening bounce ‚Äì and therefore that the game is thought to commence at the opening whistle. Finally, it was testified that it was common practice (although not necessarily explicit in the rules) for an umpire to confirm that the timekeepers are ready by holding the ball above his head, and waiting for the timekeepers to sound the siren ‚Äì after which he blows the opening whistle, followed by executing the opening bounce. =Evidence related to the start of the game= The Board of Management meeting was hindered by the fact that a technical error meant there was no video footage of the first few minutes of the match; as such, all evidence presented at the meeting was verbal. According to McMaster's testimony, he blew the opening whistle once he was convinced that the teams were ready. However, the timekeepers did not sound the opening siren until McMaster was already in the Dandenong forward-line handing the ball to Miller; this contributed significantly to the confusion about whether or not the game had started. The confusion was caused by the fact that McMaster had not effectively held the ball above his head and waited for the timekeepers to sound the siren, as was the normal custom; Preston timekeeper Len Herman said that he did not see McMaster lift the ball at all, which Preston captain Laurie Hill agreed with, while The Sun News-Pictorial reporter Murray Hubbard reported that McMaster had \\"half-raised the ball\\" before blowing his whistle. McMaster testified that he saw Leslie push Miller as he was still blowing his opening whistle ‚Äì which, by O'Neill's advice, allowed him to pay the free kick, regardless of whether or not the siren had sounded. He then immediately blew his whistle a second time to signify the free kick, and ran to the Dandenong forward-line to give the ball to Miller. Witnesses had different accounts on whether or not they heard McMaster blow the opening whistle, or were able to discern it from the free kick whistle. Dandenong timekeeper, Graham Way, testified that although he did not hear the opening whistle, he did see McMaster appear to blow it. =David Sheehan's after-the-siren opportunity= Shortly before the final siren, Dandenong's David Sheehan had taken a mark in Dandenong's forward-line, roughly 30 yards out, directly in front; even considering the wind, Sheehan could easily have scored from this distance. When the siren sounded with Dandenong in front, Sheehan threw the ball away, went to celebrate with his team-mates, and did not take the after- the-siren kick for goal to which he was entitled. Had Sheehan taken his kick, any score would have pushed the final margin beyond six points, and it is almost certain that Preston would not have protested the result. =Reaction to the protest= Dandenong reacted with anger towards Preston's protest. Dandenong club secretary, Lionel Farrow, made it clear that his club believed Preston was behaving as a sore loser ‚Äì particularly considering the circumstances surrounding David Sheehan's after-the-siren opportunity. Many Dandenong players publicly stated that they would boycott any replay, and the team did not continue its training during the week, so it is questionable whether or not a replay would ever have occurred. Many players were unhappy that the glory and celebration of their premiership were ruined by the uncertainty of the protest. Preston coach Kevin Wright made it clear that the decision to protest was made at the club administrative level, and that he and his players were prepared to accept the six-point defeat without challenge. Nevertheless, the team continued its training through the week in case the protest was successful. In the uncertainty that followed the protest, the VFA postponed its tribunal session, such that the three players who were reported in the third quarter would have been permitted to play if a replay had eventuated, with their cases to be heard the following week. The VFA also secured the availability of the Junction Oval from the St Kilda Cricket Club for a replay on the Sunday, which would have delayed the opening of St Kilda's district cricket season. =Decision= Following the Board of Management meeting, which lasted 2¬Ω hours, Preston's protest was rejected, and Dandenong was formally confirmed as the 1971 Division 1 Premiers. The board ruled in Dandenong's favour by an overwhelming majority, listed in different sources as either 39‚Äì5 or 40‚Äì4. It is unclear whether the decision was based solely on Preston's arguments concerning the application of Rule 6(b), or whether other factors ‚Äì such as the breakdown in umpire-timekeeper communication, the circumstances of Sheehan's after-the-siren opportunity, or Dandenong's threats that it could boycott the replay ‚Äì were taken into account by Board of Management delegates. Historical context This was not the first incident of this type at the top level of the game. In the WAFL Grand Final of 1907 between East Fremantle and Perth, legendary umpire Henry \\"Ivo\\" Crapp awarded a free kick to East Fremantle's Chas Doig at half time, from which Doig scored a goal; East Fremantle initially won the match by five points. However, Perth lodged a protest with the league, contending that Crapp blew his whistle for Doig's free kick after the half-time bell had sounded, and therefore play was dead and the free kick was invalid ‚Äì similar to the argument put forward by Preston concerning the commencement of its game. In that case, Perth's protest was upheld, the score was amended, and Perth was awarded the premiership by one point. Under the 2011 version of the Laws of the Game, it is made explicit in Law 15.1.3(a) that an umpire may award a free kick for any infringement which takes place on the playing surface prior to the commencement of a quarter. Under this modern version of the Laws, Preston would have had no case for a challenge. Miller's goal and Preston's protest have left a legacy, with the incident celebrated as one of Australian rules football's 150 greatest moments, released coinciding with the 150th anniversary of the sport in 2008.

In February 1946, he entered the Physics Faculty of MEPHi, graduating with honors in November 1950 with a diploma of designer and operator of physics equipment. After that he worked on his PhD titled Focusing and dispersive properties of particular magnetic fields (), which he defended in May 1956 under Academician Lev Artsimovich. Starting from 1954 he worked at the General Physics Department of MEPHi, first as a lecturer and since 1976 as a full professor. Publications In 1957 Irodov published his first book, a collection of problems in atomic physics, which was republished in 1959 and later translated into Polish, Romanian and English. Its eighth and expanded edition, issued in 2002, became the last substantial work by Irodov. He also published collections of problems in general physics in 1968 and 1979, which is still used by many students around the world to hone their physics skills and prepare for various Engineering Entrance Exams. Irodov spent 27 years of his life on writing a series of handbooks fully covering a university course on general physics. He published the first part (mechanics) in 1975, the second part (electromagnetism) in 1983, and the full set in 1999‚Äì2001. In his handbooks Irodov aimed for brevity, crafting concise and clear definitions and removing unessential details and heavy calculus, and for relating theory with practical examples and problems. ;Books in English *A collection of problems in atomic and nuclear physics (1966) Google Books, Archive.org *Fundamental Laws of Mechanics (1980) Archive.org *Problems in General Physics (1981), Archive.org *Basic laws of Electromagnetism (1983) Archive.org References Category:1923 births Category:2002 deaths Category:Russian physicists Category:People from Murom Category:Soviet military personnel of World War II Category:Recipients of the Order of the Patriotic War, 2nd class ","title":"Igor Irodov"},{"id":"33258391","text":"Ask√∏yv√¶ringen is a local newspaper published in Ask√∏y, Norway.

Produced by Spencer's son Giuseppe Pedersoli's Smile Productions company, the series ran for only one season in 2010 on Canale 5. Plot Carlo Banci (played by Spencer), anagraphically known as Rosario, is a former police constable in Ischia. Once retired, he decides to open a restaurant. In his new venture, Carlo is partnered with three \\"acquaintances\\" of his, who he got jailed in the past: poison murderer Castagna, forger Margherita and robber Antonio. The grumpy but golden-hearted chef, who never lost his passion for justice and for upholding weak people's rights, collaborates indirectly to investigations of criminal cases led by his policeman adopted son Francesco. Soon, the company's routine is upset by the arrival of Elsie, a young woman who pretends she is a nun but is later revealed as an international thief and Carlo's daughter - born out of a relationship with an old crush of his in Germany, a thief as well. Elsie is forced to interrupt her thieving \\"activity\\" as she is controlled by her father; in the meantime, having realized she is a good cook, she becomes sous-chef in the restaurant and falls in love with Francesco, who is already engaged to fellow law enforcer Serenella. However, his romance with Elsie ends up as truer and more deeply felt. Historical inaccuracy The third episode in the series includes a deliberate historical inaccuracy. It is stated that Gabriele D'Annunzio was killed by two lovers of his, who pushed him down a third-floor balcony. D'Annunzio actually died of intracerebral hemorrhage; however, the incident actually happened, but instead of killing the writer, it resulted in a long agony which he recovered from after several days.

Elisa Scalzi is a poor but beautiful and determined young lady, who pleasantly takes care of the old Countess Agnese Ristori of Rivombrosa. Anna Ristori, Agnese's daughter, is jealous of the privileged relationship Elisa has with the countess (who took her at her service as her lady companion although Elisa was only a maid). The Countess's health gets worse and she keeps expressing her desire to see her son, the charming Count Fabrizio Ristori, who has been enlisted in the French army for the past 10 years. Elisa decides to communicate the Countess' desire to Fabrizio, so She writes him a letter and She signs herself as \\"Elisa di Rivombrosa\\" . As soon as Fabrizio gets her letter, he decides to come back home. Before leaving, he's asked to deliver some important and confidential documents to a friend, Capitano Lombardi, who would be waiting for him on the way home. When the two friends meet, they're ambushed by a group of soldiers, sent by Duke Ottavio Ranieri, an evil and influent aristocrat and Commander of the Guard of his Majesty the King, who wants to steal these precious documents in order to save himself and several other plotting nobles from prison and death penalty. Although Fabrizio managed to chasethe killers away , Captain Lombardi was seriously injured. Just before dying, he hands Fabrizio the documents and asks him to personally deliver them to King Carlo Emanuele III. Fabrizio then goes home to the beautiful Estate of Rivombrosa, where everyone is pleased to see him after so long. When he meets Elisa, he's amazed by her beauty. Not knowing she's a maidservant, he mistakes \\"Elisa di Rivombrosa\\" for an aristocrat because she's smart and well educated. He tries to seduce her, and Elisa realises she's seriously falling for him. Fabrizio shocks everyone - his sister Anna and all the other nobles, well aware of the girl's un-aristocratic conditions - when he dares invite Elisa to dance with him at a ball in honour of his return. The ball is interrupted by Dr. Antonio Ceppi, a former noble man who lost all of his properties and his title after getting married with Lucia, a servant girl. He's seriously worried about his wife, who can't be found, and asks the nobles to help him. The Count, against everyone's will, decides to help Antonio to look for his wife. Lucia is found dead in the lake : she committed suicide because she felt responsible for her husband's social downfall and wanted him to be happy and accepted by the Upper class. Her desperate action makes Elisa confess her social position to Fabrizio, who really gets mad at her. He starts to treat her roughly and rudely, trying several times to take advantage of her. He even ends up locking her in a cellar, in order to subdue her. When his mother is about to die, he releases Elisa. Countess Agnese Ristori, who really loves the young girl, asks her son to take care of her. After the death of the Countess, Elisa, still traumatized by Fabrizio's behaviour, decides to leave Rivombrosa and find a job somewhere else. The Count, however, doesn't want to give up on the girl and persuades all the aristocrats in the neighbourhood not to hire her. Because of this, Elisa decides to go back to the village, to live with her mother and sister. On the way home, she is attacked by the drunken Count Giulio Drago (Fabrizio's best friend). Elisa hits him with a stone and ends up in prison. When Fabrizio is informed of it, he first tries to convince his friend Giulio to remove the charges against Elisa. When his friend refuses to do so, Fabrizio goes to Turin to ask the king for Elisa's grace in exchange for the confidential documents. When he's about to give them to Duke Ranieri, he understands that the duke is the one who once tried to steal them. With an excuse, Fabrizio takes Elisa's grace and runs away from Turin.

The episodes were nothing more than tests, rough versions of what was shown in the later seasons. It was a pilot season to test the show. Ceruti said the first approach of Channel 9 in proposing a sitcom was always to test the show.

It is loosely based on the books by Domenico Starnone. The synopsis of the series is similar to the story of the film La scuola (1995), also scripted by Starnone. Plot and themes The plot centers on a high school in Turin, the Liceo Scientifico Caravaggio, and particularly on a freshmen class and a seniors class. Most teachers in the show are seen as very human and not just condemning of the students who do not study enough, while some of them are the usual strict or heartless teachers. The leading character of the series is Isa Passamaglia (portrayed by Littizzetto), a teacher of Latin and Italian at the Caravaggio High and a single mother of a teenager son, who constantly bears a grudge at her. The show also deals with the personal hardships faced by Passamaglia's colleagues as well as by her students. The series proved to be a huge success in Italy for the realistic depiction of the issues Italian students and teaching staff often face. At a certain point in the plot, it is even feared that the high school may face closure due to a lack of public fundings, a plausible scenario in the years of the economic crisis. Rivalry between teachers and misunderstandings between them and the school headmaster are also heavily featured in the series. Further themes are explored, including blended families, late pregnancy, juggling family life and job life, sexual orientation, child-parent relationship, first love, and more.

History  = Production = Arturo & Kiwi was created and development in 2006 by Andrea Zingoni, one of the founders of Giovanotti Mondani Meccanici. The animation was produced by the Cartobaleno studio. In the two-year period 2006‚Äì2007 were realized two series of 13 episodes each, with Italian recipes, in 2008 a third series of 13 episodes was produced, entitled Arturo & Kiwi ‚Äì Cooking for puppies with international recipes, and two years later a fourth series always with 13 episodes with the same title but with Italian and international recipes. The first series was aired from 7 May 2007 initially from Monday to Friday within the television program for kids Trebisonda, in the afternoon on Rai 3, to then move from the 12th of the same month exclusively to Saturday and Sunday in the morning, time slot maintained for the transmission of the remaining episodes of the first season and for all those of the second. Subsequently the program was always hosted on Rai 3, on Sunday morning, inside √à domenica pap√†, where the third and fourth series were also aired. Occasionally it also aired in La prova del cuoco by Rai 1. In 2007 the series won the High Quality Award for Childhood Il Grillo while in 2010 an application was published for the iPad where the two protagonists always explained in a humorous way the advice of use of utensils and kitchen appliances, along with some rules of etiquette.  Origin  The series is an evolution of some cartoons made some years before by Zingoni and Held and aired on the My-Tv internet portal. The series was called La Cucina Ginese, since in the first two episodes of the total six was Gino the Chicken, another important creature of the draftsman to act as assistant to the chef Q-Gino, who was none other than the cock of the logo of the Riso Gallo. In fact, the series was a sort of advertising spot for the various types of cereals produced by the company. In this series the Kiwi makes its absolute debut, first as an \\"ingredient\\" found by Gino and then, starting from the third episode, as a cooking assistant. During the episodes of La Cucina Ginese some jokes and tormentos are recognizable that today characterize the duet Arturo and Kiwi. Therefore the series can be considered a link between the two works of Zingoni. The six episodes were available online before on the official website and subsequently on the official YouTube channel of Riso Gallo since December 2013.  Characters  The strip has two characters, with the style of the comic duet. Often the kitchen changes some furnishing details, to adapt to the city or nation of the presented dish. In the presentation of the recipes a meter is adopted to define the difficulty called \\"Grado Kiwi\\" (Kiwi Grade) with values starting from 1 (very easy) to 7 (challenging). = Arturo = Arturo, the cook, is a surly (but basically good-natured) Neapolitan Mastiff who, as he himself says, has left his heart in Naples. He is a very refined and prepared \\"chef\\" and his role is to introduce and illustrate the recipes. In the squabbles with Kiwi it is often to repeat the catchphrase \\"Mammina mia give me the strength!\\". Among the various aprons worn, it often carries one with the words \\"Italians do it better\\" (Madonna's famous slogan) and sometimes one with \\"we are the champions\\" (with the background of the Italian tricolor). When exposing a recipe in which the eggs are used, in the first two series it was ensured that they were not of the Kiwi. In some episodes he makes it clear that he is a pacifist and that he hates weapons. In the episode \\"Salsicce e fagioli all'uccelletto\\" receives a call from his \\"treasure\\" (perhaps his wife), who wants it at the pentolaccia (where a double plaid is up for grabs). Arturo's voice is that of Bruno Rucoli (1941‚Äì2016). = Kiwi = Kiwi, the assistant, is a distorted New Zealand kiwi. It has the role of materially preparing the recipes, it is a \\"good fork\\" and has a passion for fine wines and spirits, and in fact every time he tries to drink it he is punctually reproached by Arturo. His entrances on the stage are always \\"curtain-raisers\\", in which he presents himself with curious costumes, to then take them off, to attack tormentons such as \\"Kiwi, kiwi allelujah!\\" and (often) to be pan-fried by Arturo. This entry into the scene, the linguistic misunderstandings with Arturo on some culinary terms, the tone of voice and the appearance of a chick, make it the \\"side\\" of the comedy duet. The character also talks about replacing the vowels at the end of the word with the \\"u\\" and is shown as a Latin lover, often on the phone with his conquests, but we also know that he is married with children (\\"tengu figli, cane, gattu... and picciuncina \\"). Although skilled in the kitchen, when he is dealing with fire he is almost always overwhelmed by a blaze, arousing the hilarity of Arturo. Kiwi's voice is that of Andrea Zingoni. = Artificial cob = A living cob that acts like a zombie appears only in the initials and appears to be the only antagonist.

Sclerasterias is a genus of starfish in the family Asteriidae. Adult individuals have five arms but small, immature individuals have six. This led to the giving of a separate generic name to the juveniles, Hydrasterias, before it was realised that only one genus was involved. These young individuals often undergo fissiparity. The disc splits into two parts, each bearing three arms, and new arms develop on each part to complete the complement of arms. This sometimes happens repeatedly and may be an adaptation to life in cold, deep seas where most of the species are found.

It is based on the Valentina comics series by Italian artist Guido Crepax. The series follows a Milanese photographer, Valentina Rosselli, and her investigations assisted by the antiquarian Phillip Rembrant, with whom she shares an ambiguous relationship. Despite being shot in Italian language, the actors were dubbed over by different people. Demetra Hampton was voiced by Claudia Balboni and Russel Case by Dario Penne. The first three episodes of the series were dubbed into English and released as a film. Production Created by Gianfranco Manfredi, the series is based on the Valentina comics by Italian artist Guido Crepax. It was co-produced between France and Spain. Among the thirteen episodes, there were only two directors: Gianfranco Giagni and Giandomenico Curi. Despite being shot in Italian language, the actors were dubbed over by different people. Demetra Hampton was voiced by Claudia Balboni and Russel Case by Dario Penne. The creator of the original comic book series Crepax later commented he found the series well scripted but thought the role of Valentina was not suited for Hampton. She was given the role after being scouted on her vacation in Los Angeles. The agent saw Hampton, took photos of her and sent them to the producer Angelo Rizzoli. Hampton was sent to Milan the next day and was immediately cast in role of Valentina. Crepax was unsatisfied with the producer's choice since he wanted the girl who would portray Valentina to be Italian, not American. The first episode, \\"Baba Yaga\\" is a remake of Crepax's original story. It had been previously made into a film, Baba Yaga (1973), directed by Corrado Farina.

The local and/or regional authorities of a country or state typically own the LGFA, sometimes with a minor ownership by the state. It works as a co-operative agency where the participating authorities come together in order to ensure lower interests rates on loans, based on the creditworthiness of the participating members. This co-operation can also help the local authorities to achieve a higher credit rating than if they act independently.

It is based on the novel Der brave Soldat Schwejk by Jaroslav Ha≈°ek and was broadcast from 1972 to 1977. Fritz Muliar played the leading role.  Plot  The Bohemian dog salesman Josef Schwejk (Fritz Muliar) is someone, who enjoys life to the full and cheats his way through life, in Prague at the start of the 20th century, when Prague was a part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and before any World Wars had taken place. He was referred to publicly as an idiot who registered as a soldier when there was a greater chance of WW1 breaking out. Here he survives frequent hair- raising adventures that drive some of the people he meets into desperation.

Through its success and because he had also filmed \\"Schwejks Flegeljahre\\" (English: Schweijk's years of being a brat) with Peter Alexander in the leading role, Liebeneiner was encouraged to produce the series. It was a foregone conclusion that Fritz Muliar would play the role of Schwejk. Fritz Muliar was even greatly acknowledged by Heinz R√ºhmann for his role, who had already played Schwejk in the movie of the same name. The first season consisting of six episodes was already a big success in 1972. However three years passed until the second season which had seven new episodes could be produced because people who were involved were not available. Filming took place in Krems an der Donau (in the series Prague), on the shipyard of Korneuburg (in the series marine ammunition storage of Trieste) as well as in the Weinviertel \\"wine quarter\\" (amongst others at the Karnabrunn train station along the line of Korneuburg-Hohenau).  Home release  A DVD with all 13 episodes of the series has been available for purchase since the 17 November 2008.

The satirical 19-episode series about a policeman from Vienna now sports cult status. Police major Adolf Kottan was played by three actors (Peter Vogel, Franz Buchrieser, Lukas Resetarits) who each gave the character a distinct 'flavor'. Plot The series centers on police major Adolf Kottan, who works for the homicide department of Vienna police. His closest collaborators are the one-legged, phlegmatic Schremser (Walter Davy), who later becomes department chief, and the extremely stupid and incompetent Schrammel (C. A. Tichy), who is responsible for many of the more exhilarating moments of the show. Kottan is married to Ilse (Bibiana Zeller), and they have two children, daughter Sissi (Birgit Machalissa) ‚Äì who disappears without explanation and is not mentioned in the later episodes ‚Äì and son Walter (Florian B√∂hm). Later on, Kottan's mother (Gusti Wolf), a passionate amateur detective, moves in with them, building an ever-deepening alliance with her daughter-in-law. Kottan's marriage is constantly threatened in the later episodes by his acquaintance with prostitute Elvira Markl (Christiane R√ºcker/Eva Kerbler), who Ilse Kottan is extremely jealous of. In the professional world, Kottan's nemesis is his crazy boss Pilch ‚Äì he is first the department chief (Harald von Koeppele), who has a phobic fear of flies; after psychiatric treatment, he is promoted chief of the police (Kurt Weinzierl). Pilch is a pathological egomaniac who develops a terrible hatred for a coffee machine Kottan has set up, as well as for Kottan himself.

He first featured on a radio drama before becoming the main character of the TV movie Hartlgasse 16a, now considered to be the first episode of the series. Because the film with Peter Vogel in the main role was a success, Austrian television ORF started a full TV series. As Vogel was unavailable for episode 3, the role was recast with playwright and actor Franz Buchrieser. Wary of his newly found popularity, Buchrieser left the show after only three episodes. The role of Kottan was then recast with comedian Lukas Resetarits, a considerably younger actor than either Vogel or Buchrieser ‚Äì and 20 years younger than his on-screen wife, Bibiana Zeller! The first seven episodes were feature-length (90 min.). When the German television channel ZDF started co- producing (1980), the length of the episodes was shortened to 60 minutes. All in all, 19 episodes were shot until 1983. Another six (of what was planned by Zenker and Patzak to be the last season) had been already fully scripted and cast, when then-ORF-boss Gerd Bacher cut short the life of Kottan ermittelt. Episodes 20 till 25 were never made into film, though they were adapted as an audio drama in 2009 with some members of the original cast. Characteristics The tone and character of Kottan ermittelt changed considerably during its production. While the first episode can be duly considered a realistic social drama, the series soon became more humorous and satirical, with veering into the frankly absurd in the last few episodes (especially from episode 13). Zenker and Patzak constantly played with expectations of TV viewers, showing the illusional character of TV (characters break the fourth wall, watch earlier episodes of the series, disappear without further notice or change their appearance, name, family situation from one episode to another etc.). There are a number of running gags, like the policemen responding Inspektor gibt's kan! (There's no such thing as an inspector), when being called \\"inspector\\" by other characters; bikers or cars crashing against the doors of Kottan's car when they are opened; a TV speaker (played by real-life TV speaker Chris Lohner) interacting with the viewers or commenting on them; the coffee machine that refuses to sell coffee to police chief Pilch etc. In the 1982 episode Kansas City, the first one aired in Germany, a news ticker in the first third of the film announced that an unknown flying object has landed in the German city of Duisburg, home of Horst Schimanski, and there will be a reportage afterwards. It was not immediately clear to the audience that the directors Patzak and Zenker made a joke in the style of Orson Welles's The War of the Worlds. The following news emission did not mention anything about this object, causing viewers to call the ZDF TV station, and finally leading to an apology by producing Austrian TV station ORF.orf.at: Ein ‚ÄûAnalprogramm‚Äú wie von Schiller Music While the tone of the first two episodes with Peter Vogel is set by the melancholy songs of Austrian singer-songwriter Georg Danzer, the music of the rest of the show consists of vintage pop songs of the 1950s and 60's. Later on, many of these are sung onscreen (always in playback) by several characters, especially Adolf and Ilse Kottan. In the episodes of the 1980s, Kottan is the leader of a band called Kottan's Kapelle, while Ilse and mother Kottan as well as police chief Pilch also strive for musical fame. The songs often ironically comment on the plot and the characters.

Macey was born in Melbourne to Reginald George Gordon and Nelly Gwendoline Macey, and trained as a teacher. He taught in Technical Schools from 1957 until 1968. While on a teaching scholarship, he taught part-time at a Primary School in 1969 and again in 1972. In his other teaching years he was seconded to the Victoria Police, and was an Education Officer there for a total of 12 years. On 18 May 1963 he married Patricia Anne Martin, with whom he had three children; Leah, Martina, and Keiran. Their marriage was dissolved in 1987, and on 29 October 1988 Macey married Maureen Griffiths, with whom he had a son, Griffith Macey. They separated in 2004. Macey was commissioner of the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works from 1974 to 1978 and area commissioner from 1978 to 1981 and 1984 to 1985. He was a South Melbourne City Councillor from 1973 to 1981 and from 1982 to 1985, serving as mayor from 1977 to 1978 and 1978 to 1979. In 1985 he was elected to the Victorian Legislative Council as a Liberal, representing Monash Province. He held his seat until 1992, when he resigned. He resigned from supporting the Liberal Party in 2004 when, as he described it, '.. the Liberals abandoned Sir Robert Menzies' dream of ‚Äúan Australian nation ‚Ä¶ in which every family is enabled to live in, and preferably to own, a comfortable home at reasonable cost and with adequate community amenities,‚Äù as articulated in his 1945 Liberal Party constitution. ' (5) He described his critical turning point was when the Treasurer in the then LNP Federal Government, Peter Costello, ignored a Productivity Commission recommendation from an Enquiry which he had commissioned... \\"The Australian Government should, as soon as practicable, establish a review of those aspects of the personal income tax regime that may have recently contributed to excessive investment in rental housing. The focus of the review should be on the Capital Gains Tax provisions. \\". Treasurer Costello ignored that recommendation. Macey claims that, consequently Australian housing unaffordability careered out of control. Subsequently, in 2013, he founded the Australian Affordable Housing Party which was registered for federal elections in 2017, with Macey as its President. Macey founded the party before the 2013 election along with a group of mature voters who were concerned about their adult children's ability to become first home owners (4) The party announced on Facebook that Macey had been replaced as party President by its Bennelong byelection candidate Anthony Ziebell in February 2018. Macey explained this development as follows...

The team usually has to solve unusual and complicated murder cases occurring in and around Kitzb√ºhel. Often enough, they involve members of the high society, Kitzb√ºhel being a popular destination for the rich and the powerful. Father of Karin Kofler is a star-chef and amateur detective, who cooperates with countess Vera Sch√∂nberg.

Bracken, S.J. is an American philosopher and Catholic theologian. Bracken is a proponent of process philosophy and process theology of Alfred North Whitehead and Charles Hartshorne. Much of his work is devoted to a synthesis of revealed religion and Christian trinitarian doctrines with a revised process theology. Bracken introduced a field theoretic approach to process metaphysics. Life Bracken was born on 22 March 1930 in Chicago, Illinois, United States.Curriculum vitae at Xavier University Bracken is Emeritus Professor of Theology at Xavier University in Cincinnati, Ohio, United States. He received his PhD from the University of Freiburg in Germany in 1968, and taught at University of Saint Mary of the Lake Mundelein Seminary in Illinois (1968‚Äì1974), and at Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin (1974‚Äì1982), before becoming Chairman of the Theology Department at Xavier in 1982. Work Bracken is the author and/or editor of 11 books and wrote about 150 articles in academic journals. He brief summarized his approach in a book review in 2007: This is why in my own rethinking of Whitehead's metaphysics I presumed from the start that his metaphysical categories needed revision in order to accommodate Christian belief in God as Trinity. With this in mind, I soon realized that Whitehead's key category of \\"society\\" needed further development. A \\"society,\\" after all, must be more than an aggregate of actual occasions with a \\"common element of form\\" (PR 1968, 34) if philosophical atomism is to be avoided. My own solution was to reinterpret a Whiteheadian society as an enduring structured field of activity for successive generations of constituent actual occasions. Thus understood, a Whiteheadian \\"society\\" serves both to legitimate a trinitarian process-oriented understanding of God and to make Whitehead's philosophy an even stronger social ontology than he himself envisioned. That is, \\"the final real things of which the world is made up\\" are not simply actual occasions but the societies into which they spontaneously aggregate.Bracken, J. A. 2007.

Aquaculture means the sea cucumbers are farmed in contained areas where they can be cultured in a controlled manner. In China, sea cucumbers are cultured, along with prawns and some fish species, in integrated multi-trophic systems. In these systems, the sea cucumbers feed on the waste and feces from the other species. In this manner, what would otherwise be polluting byproducts from the culture of the other species become a valuable resource that is turned into a marketable product. __TOC__ History The Chinese and Japanese were the first to develop successful hatchery technology for Apostichopus japonicus, prized for its high meat content and success in commercial hatcheries.James, B. D. (2004). Captive breeding of the sea cucumber, Holothuria scabra, from India. In Lovatelli, A. (comp./ed.); Conand, C.; Purcell, S.; Uthicke, S.; Hamel, J.-F.; Mercier, A. (eds.) Advances in sea cucumber aquaculture and management. FAO Fisheries Technical Paper. No. 463. Rome, FAO. 2004. 425p. A second species, Holothuria scabra, was cultured for the first time using these techniques in India in 1988. In recent years Australia, Indonesia, New Caledonia, Maldives, Solomon Islands and Vietnam have also successfully cultured H. scabra using the same technology, which has since been expanded to other species. Broodstock Sandfish hatchery (Alaminos, Pangasinan). The Philippine \\"Balatan\\" or Sea cucumber breeding/harvesting. Sea cucumbers to be used as broodstock are either collected from the wild or are taken from commercial harvests. Only the largest and healthiest individuals are used for broodstock, as the success of a hatchery relies on the healthy condition of brood individuals.James, D. B., Gandhi, A. D., Palaniswamy, N., & Rodrigo, J. X. (1994). Techniques and Culture of the Sea-cucumber Holothuria scabra. CMFRI Special Publication(57), 1‚Äì40. These individuals are kept in tanks with at least 6 inches of sand to allow burrowing behaviour. Water is changed every day and sand is changed every fortnight. Sea cucumbers are fed with a paste made from freshly collected algae added to the tanks once a week to settle on sand where they feed. If water conditions are not right and if proper food is not provided sea cucumbers will eviscerate or re-absorb their gonads rendering them unfit for spawning. Spawning Temperature shock involves cooling and heating of seawater by 3‚Äì5¬∞C until spawning is induced.Giraspy, D. A. B., & Walsalam, I. G. (2010). Aquaculture potential of the tropical sea cucumbers Holothuria scabra and H. lessoni in the Indo-Pacific region SPC Beche-de-mer Information Bulletin(30), 29‚Äì32. This is achieved by first reducing the temperature of the water by 3‚Äì5¬∞C. The sea cucumbers are left for five minutes before they are exposed to ‚Äònormal‚Äô (depending on species and climate) temperature seawater, where the small rise in water temperature is sufficient to induce spawning.Laxminarayana, A. (2005). Induced spawning and larval rearing of the sea cucumbers, Bohadschia marmorata and Holothuria atrain Mauritius. SPC Beche-de-mer Information Bulletin (22), 48‚Äì52.. Males tend to spawn first which then induces females to release their eggs. Spawning stimulation can also be achieved through lightly drying the broodstock followed by exposure to a powerful jet of seawater. Sea cucumbers are dried for 30 minutes in the shade and then are exposed to a powerful jet of seawater for 30 minutes. Usually 60‚Äì90 minutes later males will release their sperm, and 30 minutes after that females will swell and release eggs in rapid intermittent jets. Though many species of sea cucumbers can be induced to spawn using both of these methods, temperature shock is usually considered to be the preferred method. Often spawn obtained from drying and wetting with a jet of water does not produce viable gametes. Spawning induction and successful fertilization has only been achieved in some species of sea cucumbers and the likelihood that a method will work or not is highly dependent on the species. Larvae The first month after hatching is particularly crucial and mortality during the larval phases is particularly high. Larval survival drops to 30 ‚Äì 34% after the first 20 days of hatching and larval development.Battaglene, S. C., Seymour, J. E., & Ramofafia, C. (1999). Survival and growth of cultured juvenile sea cucumbers, Holothuria scabra. Aquaculture, 178(3‚Äì4), 293‚Äì322.Ivy, G. and D. A. B. Giraspy (2006). Development of large-scale hatchery production techniques for the commercially important sea cucumber Holothuria scabra var. versicolor (Conand, 1986) in Queensland, Australia . SPC Beche-de-mer Information Bulletin(24). Larvae usually hatch 48 hours after fertilisation and spend their first 17 days as feeding larvae or auricularia. During this phase they are fed on a mix of planktonic microalgae (Rhodomonas salina, Chaetoceros calcitrans, C. mulleri, Isochrysis galbana and Pavlova lutheri are most commonly used). The proportions and overall quantity of microalgal feed species varies with larval stage, and the quantity is gradually increased as larvae grow until they metamorphose into the doliolaria or non-feeding phase (around day 17.) Individuals in this phase of their development are put into a tank with settlement cues. These may include food items such as seagrass extract, seaweed extract, Algamac2000, Algamac Protein Plus, dead algae, benthic diatoms (Nitzchia sp. and Navicula sp.) and spirulina. Around day 19 of development the larvae transform into their pentacula phase and settle. Plates or polythene sheets are provided as substrate for larvae to settle on and to feed off. Benthic diatoms Nitzchia sp. and Navicula sp. are most effective as settlement cues. Nursery Juveniles are sometimes transferred to a sand-based feeding substrate in nursery tanks when they reach 10 mm; however, survival of juveniles is better if they are allowed to grow to 20 mm before transferral to sand. Juveniles are grown for a few months until they reach 5‚Äì7 cm when they are moved out to sea ranches or into ponds. Grow out Sea ranching is carried out in sheltered bays with seagrass in areas with few predators. The sea cucumbers can be kept in pens in shallow water made of fine wire mesh or bamboo, and in deeper water they are raised in cages made from fine woven mesh or in tub enclosures on the seafloor. They can also be kept and grown in ponds with appropriate water exchange and movement. Individual growth is density-dependent and is stunted at high densities. Monitoring water quality and growth characteristics are essential to survival during this phase. Sea cucumbers are ready to harvest after 12 months of grow out. Asexual methods Two sea cucumber species Thelenota ananas (prickly redfish) and Stichopus chloronotus (greenfish) have been found capable of asexual propagation through transverse fission, the process whereby an organism is cut in half and completely regenerates the missing half. Rubber bands are placed around the middle of the sea cucumbers which induces them to undergo fission within 1‚Äì2 weeks. After separating, the posterior half regrows a complete anterior half, and vice versa. This happens within 3‚Äì7 months, producing two new fully-grown individuals from one. Survival from this process by these species was found to be 80% or greater.Reichenbach, N., & Holloway, S. (1995). Potential for Asexual Propagation of Several Commercially Important Species of Tropical Sea Cucumber (Echinodermata). Journal of the World Aquaculture Society, 26(3), 272‚Äì278. Though this technique is not suitable for all sea cucumber species, it may provide a cheaper and faster alternative method of obtaining prickly redfish and greenfish for aquaculture. Polyculture Sea cucumbers are currently cultured in polyculture with prawns and some fish species. Their presence in the bottoms of the pens or nets, where they feed on debris composed of feces, excess food, algae, and other particulate organic matter, significantly reduces fouling of water and equipment.Ahlgren, M. O. (1998). Consumption and Assimilation of Salmon Net Pen Fouling Debris by the Red Sea Cucumber Parastichopus californicus: Implications for Polyculture. Journal of the World Aquaculture Society 29(2): 133‚Äì139. China currently produces around 90,000 tons of sea cucumbers using these practices and enhanced growth of sea cucumber juveniles has been reported when they are grown at the bottom of prawn farms. Farming sea cucumbers with the fouling debris of other aquaculture species helps to mitigate the impacts of marine farms' effluents and turns these wastes into a marketable product.Connor, S. (2011). \\"Ready to acquire a taste for the 'vacuum cleaners of the sea'?\\".

It is located in Guhagar, Ratnagiri District of the Indian state of Maharashtra State. It is considered the Kuladevata (Clan God) of many Chitpavan families from the Konkan region. Video of Shri Vyadeshwar Aarti being performed in the evening session Legend According to Hindu mythology, sage Parashurama created the land of Konkan by shooting his arrow into the sea and commanding the Sea God to retract the waters to the point where his arrow landed. This new land came to be known as Sapta-Konkana, meaning \\"piece of earth\\", \\"corner of earth\\", or \\"piece of a corner\\", derived from Sanskrit words: ko·πáa (‡§ï‡•ã‡§£, corner) + ka·πáa (‡§ï‡§£, piece). Shrikant Gowande (2007),\\"Guhagarche Swayambhoo Devasthan Shri Kshetra Vyadeshwar\\", Anmol Publication, Pune 411002. He asked various deities to settle in the newly created land and protect the resident clans. Parashurama was a devotee of the god Shiva, requested that the God appear to him daily, so Shiva appeared in 60 places where temples were built. The sage Vyad then installed the lingam of Shiva at this temple in Guhagar. The Shiva icon and temple was thus called Vyadeshwar (the Lord of Vyad). Vyadeshwar was lost to time and rediscovered in the era of King Sakuran, when the current temple structure was constructed.http://www.konkanyatra.com/chiplun/g8.html Style  Plan of Shri Vyadeshwar temple The architectural style is called 'Panchayatan'. A Panchayatan temple contains four subordinate shrines in four corners and the main shrine in the center of the podium, which forms the base. Here, Shiva is Vyadeshwar the central shrine, with Surya, Ganesha, Ambika (Shiva's consort) and Vishnu with his wife Lakshmi as the South-East, South-West, North-West and North-East subordinate shrines respectively. Nandi (the vahana of Shiva) sits in front of the main shrine. The temple has three entrances to the east, west and south. Garuda (the vahana of Vishnu) and the god Hanuman are installed on either sides of the East entrance, inside the temple. Updates This 'Panchayatan' temple is ancient, as are its deities. Due to aging, the three shrines were found eroded. In May 2015, the shrines of Shri Parvati (Ambikamata), Shri Garud and Shri Hanuman were ceremonially replaced by new shrines. All the required reinstatement rituals were systematically performed. The old entrance facing due East was small in size and inconvenient. That entrance (Mahadwar in local Marathi language) was replaced with a completely renovated form of the temple.http://vyadeshwar.webs.com/ Incarnations of Shri Vyadeshwar Three small pieces were chipped out from the main or core part of the Pindi. One piece was located at Borya Adoor; the second piece went to Asgoli and the third piece to Anjanwel. At these locations, new Shiva temples were erected. These temples are known as Talkeshwar, Balkeshwar (Valukeshwar) and Udaleshwar (Uddalakeshwar), respectively. These three Shiva Pindis are considered to be incarnations of Shri Vyadeshwar. Devotees of Shri Vyadeshwar are instructed to visit these three temples.

It is a community resource annotating protein sequences for intrinsically disorder regions from the literature. DisProt classifies intrinsic disorder based on experimental methods and three ontologies for molecular function, transition and binding partners. Historically, the study of disordered proteins has been hampered by the lack of an organised resource collecting them and their properties together. Release 7 of DisProt contains information on more than 800 proteins. Each protein entry in DisProt is characterised by a DisProt identifier which takes the form of the prefix DP followed by a 5 digit protein identifier. For example, DP00016 refers to the Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 protein. Release 8 of DisProt contains more than 1400 non ambiguous entries and over 3000 disordered protein regions. DisProt 8 also introduced the concept of a stable DisProt region identifier. DisProt has been widely used to train software methods to predict disordered regions in proteins. In addition, DisProt has been used to understand the properties of intrinsically unstructured proteins. Website The DisProt website provides users with an interface to search by keyword, freetext, or by sequence similarity using BLAST. Users can also browse through the entries (proteins or regions) by their identifier, detection method or PubMed ID. The entire data set can be downloaded from the website in either CSV or JSON format.

The building served the community as Thorp High School until it was demolished in 1958 to make way for a modern structure in the same location. When District No. 9 of Yakima County (Kittitas County was not separated from Yakima County until 1884) was formed, those who petitioned for its creation would have had no way of knowing that they were part of creating the foundation of the Thorp School District, the first public school system in what is now Kittitas County. In July 1873, a letter was sent by W. H. Crockett, on behalf of the local populace around the site of present- day Thorp, to the Yakima County Superintendent of Schools requesting the formation of a school district.Kittitas County School District Formation Documents 1870-1890, Washington State Archives, Ellensburg, Washington. From the letters that would follow, it appears that the new district was approved, but almost immediately a group of residents were petitioning to split-off the southern portion of the district.National Register of Historic Places Registration Form, Thorp Grade School, KT-3052 (Prepared by Tanner Dotzauer, Thorp Mill Town Historical Preservation Society) 2009-06-03. A petition to divide Thorp School District No. 9 was received by the Yakima County school superintendent's office on January 11, 1875. Twelve members of Pleasant Grove community, southwest of the current town site of Thorp, asked that the superintendent grant them permission to separate from the Thorp School District. The boundaries that would separate the southern section of District No. 9 from its northern neighbor were a point of contention for the next five years. The confusion was settled in January 1880, when Yakima County School Superintendent George W. Parrish, granted the formation of District No. 10 which encompassed the area around Splawn School on Taneum Creek. The formerly southern section of the district around the town site of Thorp reverted to the original District No. 9. It is not entirely clear where classes were conducted during the subsequent decade, however in 1885, then 7-year-old Glen Mason arrived in the Thorp area and recalled that school for District No. 9 was held in a one-room log school on the ranch of Jim McCollough in the upper valley. On November 7, 1887, District No. 9 purchased a one-acre parcel of land from William Andrew Forgey near the present-day intersection of Sisters Road (then an extension of Goodwin Road before Interstate 90 cut it off from the town) and Thorp Cemetery Road, and by 1891 a school house had been built there which became known as the Mills School. Constructed of finely fitted and painted shiplap siding, the building was 24-feet wide and 36-feet long with 14-foot high ceilings, making it stand apart from the log school houses that were common in the area.Court Case, \\"School District 46 v. Pardee and Mason,\\" Washington State Archives, Ellensburg, Washington, 1895-10-12. When the town of Thorp was officially platted around the Northern Pacific Railroad depot in 1895, residents of Thorp School District No. 9 voted to move the Mills School building a half-mile down Goodwin Road to the newly formed town. The idea of moving the school house, however, was rejected by those who lived in closer proximity to it and a dispute followed. In order to prevent the school house from being moved, the residents around Mills School formed Goodwin School District No. 46, cutting off the town from a school house. The town of Thorp and District No. 9 would go without a proper school house for several more years. Not to be thwarted by their adversaries in the upper valley, sometime in 1895 the people of the town of Thorp devised a scheme to move the school down the road to the town site. One night, the men of Thorp secretly entered the Mills School and absconded with the school equipment and necessary accoutrements, transferring them to a room above the dance hall in the town‚Äîfrom that day forward, school has been held at Thorp. When the community built its church, classes moved from the dance hall to the church.Daily Record (Ellensburg, Washington), \\"1st Thorp school recalled,\\" 1967-03-16, pp. 1. Then in the spring of 1900, just months before a fresh enrollment of 99 students were to arrive at its doors, the first Thorp school house was completed.

Over the next 26 years, the Thorp School District would continue to absorb the smaller rural school districts that surrounded it. In 1917, Thorp School District No. 27 consolidated with Splawn School District and became Thorp School District No. 45. In 1929, the district again consolidated, adding nearly 60 students to its enrollment, to become Thorp School District No. 102. Finally, in 1942, Thorp Prairie School District No. 29 was consolidated with District No. 102, forming the present boundaries of Thorp School District No. 400.The Ellensburg Capital (Ellensburg, Washington), \\"Committee votes against proposal for consolidation,\\" 1942-02-18, pp. 1-2.Washington State Library, Washington Rural Heritage, Source BBS427..

By 1932, the district's enrollment had exceeded the seating capacity of the Thorp school house, and with the town benefitting from an influx of workers from the Highline Canal project and logging operations at Taneum Canyon, plans were drawn up in 1935, for a new brick elementary school to be located next to the existing school house at Thorp. Built in 1936, at a cost of $41,000 during the depths of the Great Depression and partially funded by the WPA, the new elementary school became known as Thorp Grade School.National Register of Historic Places..

One of the earliest celebrations to be held in the new gymnasium at the school was an Armistice Day program on November 11, 1936, which was led by the district's beloved longtime superintendent Victor Karlson. Thorp Grade School still stands today, and has been used continuously by the district since its construction. A finely crafted red brick Colonial Revival structure, it was designed by noted architect John W. Maloney. After the construction of the grade school, the old school house continued to serve the district as Thorp High School until 1957, when it was razed to make way for a one-story, modern cinderblock structure in the same location. The new Thorp High School was opened in 1958. The district was twice considered for consolidation with the nearby Ellensburg School District, first in 1944, and again in 1983. In both cases, a small but vocal group of consolidation proponents were defeated by a massive and well-organized opposition of community leaders and concerned citizens. In the first instance, out of four hearings on the subject only one vote was cast for consolidation with hundreds opposing it.The Ellensburg Capital (Ellensburg, Washington), \\" finds county not ready in consolidation,\\" 1944-06-30, pp. 1. In the second instance, after months of public campaigning by merger supporters accompanied by an intense debate among voters and community members, the question of consolidation was brought before the seven- member Kittitas County Committee on School District Organization. At the conclusion of a 4-hour public hearing on the evening of March 1, 1983, before an overwhelmingly anti-consolidation, standing-room-only crowd at the Thorp High School gymnasium, the committee voted unanimously to reject consolidation of the district.Daily Record (Ellensburg, Washington), \\"Election petition rejected for Thorp-Ellensburg merger,\\" 1983-03-01, pp. 1 and 9.Daily Record (Ellensburg, Washington), \\"Referendum against consolidation: Thorp directors re-elected,\\" 1983-11-09, pp. 12. Voters in the district approved a $1.4 million bond measure for school construction on February 7, 1989, by a margin of nearly 80 percent. The 20-year bond was matched by $927,000 in state funds to renovate and expand the 1958 school building. The building, which was billed as the \\"first high-tech school in the county,\\" included the addition of ten new classrooms, a gymnasium with seating for 450 people, and a student commons area which doubles as a performance venue. The 1936 Grade School building was subsequently renovated to provide additional instructional space and classrooms for the growing needs of the district, while preserving its classic architectural integrity.Daily Record (Ellensburg, Washington), \\"Thorp school modernization gets nod,\\" 1989-02-08, pp. 1.

Composed between 1958 and 1959, it is based on the interpretative reading of the poem \\"Sirens\\" from chapter 11 of the novel Ulysses by James Joyce by Cathy Berberian and on the elaboration of her recorded voice by technological means. History and context of the composition According to the definitive piece published in 1995 (CD BMG 09026-68302-2), the text and the interpretation of it by Berberian can be heard in the first part (1 minute and 56 seconds), while the electroacoustic elaboration of it can be heard in the second part (6 minutes and 13 seconds); the complete length of the definitive composition is 8 minutes and 9 seconds. The piece was originally composed to be part of a never broadcast radio program by Luciano Berio and Umberto Eco titled Omaggio a Joyce. Documenti sulla qualit√† onomatopeica del linguaggio poetico. Subsequently, the piece, conceived for four channels, was recorded in stereo in two versions, the first titled Thema (Omaggio a Joyce) (LP Turnabout TV 34177), 1958; the second titled Omaggio a Joyce (LP Limelight LS 86047), 1959. In 1995 it was digitally restored in stereo (CD BMG 09026-68302-2) and this is the version Berio declared as definitive (8 minutes and 9 seconds). Musical form The work resumes the linguistic studies the composer had been carrying on for some years in collaboration with Eco during the first stages of the Studio di fonologia in Milan; these studies were focused, on the one hand, on the sonorous relationships between many different European languages; on the other hand, on pure vocalism from several points of view: linguistic, phonetic, anthropological, and musical. In particular, the construction of a new musical form based on the oscillation between music, literature and multimedia languages can be seen as the result of the interdisciplinary studies carried on at the Studio di Fonologia. Luciano Berio aimed to the synthesis of different fields to break down the borders of the artistic and scientific specializations between music, poetry and technology. So first of all, the main feature of the composition is the oscillation between oblivion and construction which reminds directly to the poetic writing form. The work is based on the idea of the electroacoustic montage of sounds as well. This is the first time in history of music a recorded intelligible text was literally \\"broke[n] into pieces\\". In particular, the composer had classified the recorded words included in \\"Sirens\\" according to their resonance colors, in relation to the resonance point of the vocal apparatus. The tonal colours were chosen in consideration of the phonetic sounds and their sonorous nature was then elaborated upon and mixed using the analogue technology of the Studio di Fonologia. This facility housed a number of oscillators. The long editing process was performed manually. According to Daniele (2010), the compositional category of the contemporary musical art, using words and vocals as a primary source, playing with the tension between semantic and musical characteristics, through the technology, has been constituted from this moment on. The intrinsic musicality of the language and the research of infinite possibilities of combining phonemes are very important in this work as well. The tension/relationship between construction of the words and a new elaboration of them and meaning of sounds, which is a peculiar element of the Joyce's writings, is transposed from the silent written form to a new musical, electroacoustic form. In this way, Berio fragments the Joyce's text read by Berberian to recompose it in a new technologically elaborated form. The electroacoustic elaborations and the montage are realized in the words and texts as on the sounds and noises produced by the voice. In particular, as Berio said, the sound object transformation must take into account the near- musical attributes that are contained in the sound object itself. To the degrees of the sound object transformation then corresponds a different degree of significance in relation to the original rough state of the object itself. The composition features a very peculiar structure away from every known musical theory, to create a poetical-musical opera done not through themes but with the forms of language itself. In this oscillation and in the deconstruction of the meaning of the words, in the research of pure timbre and resonances, \\"the sound becomes meaning\\" and the voice becomes the symbol of the human body itself and its expressive sign, as the \\"symbol of language\\" or the principle of the \\"languages of things\\", according to the well-known theory of Walter Benjamin.

It is located in the civil parish of Colares, in the municipality of Sintra, situated on a promontory that juts out into the ocean, made up of granite boulders and interspersed limestone. It is a third-order lighthouse, which originally began operating in 1772. It was the first new purpose-built lighthouse to be constructed in the country: the older lighthouses in existence at that time, were constructed on existing platforms or from pre-existing beacons.  History  Cabo da Roca, a tourist attraction and limit of continental Europe, with the lighthouse in the background Close- up of the base and main tower of the Cabo da Roca complex Main beacon on the lighthouse The initiative to construct the lighthouse came from the Junta Geral da Fazenda do Reino on 1 February 1758, in an order to construct six lighthouses strategically throughout the country to assist navigation. Cabo da Roca lighthouse began operating in 1772, becoming the third oldest lighthouse along the Portuguese coast. During the management of civil engineer Gaud√™ncio Fontana (1843), the lighthouse was updated with a new rotation platform, comprising sixteen Argand lamps with parabolic reflectors. Yet, by 1865, there were critics of the system, noting the inefficiency of the lighthouse. Over time this was addressed by the installation of a blow-horn signal and the renovation to electric-powered machines. The \\"electrical\\" lighthouse began functioning in 1897, with a system that included a backup petroleum lamp. The main unit was a fourth-order optical system, with rotational platform and clock mechanism, and was paired with a steam siren. In 1917 a building was constructed to produce the acetylene gas necessary to power a new lamp system. The siren was replaced in 1932 by a compressed air blow-horn, while a lighthouse radio system was installed in 1937. During the post-World War era a new fourth-order optical system replaced the older mechanism, but was quickly substituted by a third-order lamp with a 3000 Watt lamp. At the end of the 1940s, the site was reached by public water and sewage. During the mid-1950s, the Direc√ß√£o Geral dos Edif√≠cios e Monumentos Nacionais (DGEMN) (General Directorate for Buildings and National Monuments), and its Servi√ßos de Construc√ß√£o e Conserva√ß√£o (Construction and Conservation Service) branch, was responsible for periodical conservation and maintenance of the lighthouse: in 1956 a renovation was undertaken. It was only in 1980 when the electrical grid reached the site, resulting in the 1982 installation of an electrical siren. By 1990, the lighthouse was automated and the acetylene production facility was closed. In 2000, the electrical siren ceased to function, and the following year, the radio system was deactivated.  Architecture  The lighthouse stands 22 metres at its base (its light commands a 165-metre beam from sea level). In addition to the main tower, the complex is composed of nine buildings, since prior to electrification, it was necessary to marshall a team to maintain the lamp, store valuable equipment and produce the Acetylene necessary to run the torch. Currently, the lighthouse supports a team of three lighthouse keepers, in order to monitor the lamp and signal/communicate between Cabo da Roca and Ericeira. It is accessible by the Estrada do Cabo da Roca, and situated on the tip of the cape, on land that is considered the most western extent of continental Europe. Although not on that point, it does occupy the safest position on the Cape to monitor and safeguard the navigable seas, with a coastal panorama.

The Renaissance-era religious building, has been molded by successive layers of Mannerist and Baroque decorative and structural elements, that include the portico, but whose origin dates to the Gothic architecture of the early 16th century (that includes the roofing, vaulted-ceilings and two-level presbytery). The unique central tower, Baroque azulejo tile-work and 16th century pulpit are important characteristics of this parish church. History It is likely that the church was founded or rebuilt in 1528 by D. Pedro de Menezes, Master of Cantanhede, whose coat-of-arms were sculpted into the portico and intersections of the presbytery's vaulted ceiling. At the time the church was dedicated to Nossa Senhora da Assun√ß√£o (Our Lady of the Assumption), its date fixed by an inscription in the churches triumphal arch. The design was elaborated by Jo√£o de Castilho, while the decorative elements of the main doorway were completed by Jo√£o de Ru√£o. In the second half of the 18th century the mausoleum to cardinal D. Jos√© Manuel was installed in the church. The first record work on the grounds occurred in 1936, with landscaping of the churchyard by the DGMEN Direc√ß√£o Geral dos Edif√≠cios e Monumentos Nacionais (General-Directorate for Buildings and National Monuments). For the next five years there were successive projects to recuperate and/or improve the church: in 1937, the reconstruction of the lateral altars and retable; in 1938, the extension and reconstruction of the roof and opening of the northern facade; in 1939, the modification of the sacristy, with the lowering of the walls, demolition of the exterior wall and ossuary to expose the original walls; restoration of the windows and primitive buttresses; repaving with stone; and in 1941, the substitution of the old tower clock. In 1955, the confessionals were recovered and arranged. Installation of electrical services and sound system occurred in 1960-1961, in addition to new repairs to the roof. Similar public works to the roof were completed in 1969, in addition to repairs to doors and frames, restoration of the pediments, and repair of the stained glass windows in the ossuary. The ceiling was repaired, again in 1975, 1979 and 1986, in addition to repairs to the doors, painting and substitution of a column (1975/1979). On 1 June 1992, the property was placed on the protection of the IPPA Instituto Portugu√™s do Patrim√≥nio Arquitect√≥nico (Portuguese Institute of Architectural Patrimony), the forerunner of the IGESPAR, by decree 106F/92. Architecture The main portico of the facade/tower of the church tympanum The church is located in an urban context, fronted by a public roadway and encircled by small public space. The longitudinal plan features a central nave and transept, but departs from the traditional standards. The main face of the church is defined by a bell-tower and lateral extensions; rounded gables extend from the belltower/entrance facade topped with corners and pilasters decorated with pinnacles. These extensions serve as lateral \\"entrances\\" to the public spaces, with their own rounded arches. The four-story, central body includes a portico and entablature with jamb supporting a large window, crowned by tympanum by Jo√£o de Ru√£o. In Roman arch portico with square soffits, is decorated with rosettas and stars, delimited by pilasters and an entablature. The arch stands on a frame consisting of decorated pilasters and small columnar balustrades. Over the archivolts are decorated astragali, while flanking the door are pilasters divided by cornices with niches that contain the relief images of Saint Peter and Saint Paul (on either side), surmounted by urns. In bass relief are two profiles: on the left, a male figure, and on the right a female figure. The entablature, with sculpted frieze, has the coat-of-arms of the Cantanhede family, while the on either extreme ends of the architrave are two decorative spires. Flanking the main entrance are two large grated, rectangular windows, midway between the door frame and surmounted window (in the center). While the base is interrupted by a staircase of two flights, of three steps (providing access to the main portico), the three subsequent registers extend above the main entrance. This central block (consisting of separate registers for the portico, window, bell-tower and clock) were constructed in the Renaissance-era style, and distinguishable from the younger elements. The belfry includes two rounded arches on the front and back facades, while single arches on lateral faces. Meanwhile, the clock face only appears on the front face of the tower, with lateral arch openings on either side. =Interior= The three-nave interior includes five frames, with the first shorter than the rest, while a polygonal presbytery is connected directly to the sacristy. Roman arcades are supported by columnar drums fitted to the base with Ionic capitals. In the last frame the columns encounter the eastern wall and jambs of the triumphal arch, in simple motif, whose blocks are carved in grotesque motifs, and extend to the level the drums and capitals. On top of the lateral naves, are two square-framed aedicules carved from columns. The five-faceted, polygonal presbytery is covered in vaulted cross-shaped ceiling, forming a Greek cross with sharp edges, rosettas and the coat-of-arms of the Cantanhede family. In the first frame of the lateral walls are two narrow windows with rounded frame. On the left wall is the embedded mausoleum of Cardinal D. Jos√© Manuel, who was the second patriarch of Lisbon, and family member of the Counts of Atalaia. The walls of the lateral naves are decorated along the footer by sillar azulejo tiles in blue and white. Over these are pattern azulejo in blue and yellow, with scenes from the New Testament and life of the saints. In addition, there are azulejo panels with the scenes from the Old Testament that decorate the sections of the central nave. Over the triumphal arch is another azulejo panel in blue and yellow, with the dove of the Holy Spirit. Over corbels, on the presbytery wall, is an image of the Virgin. Abutting the fourth column of the lateral nave, is the pulpit with wooden balustrades and stone base. One of the better known artifacts in the church is a vermeil chalice dating to the 16th century and an armoire to guard the holy oils.

History The lateral facade of the church, identifiable for its long nave and austere Romanesque decoration The oblique lateral facade (opposite the Estrada Nacional) with the bell tower to the rear The nave interior showing the triumphal arch flanked by two murals and main altar Over the main doorway is the slit or niche surmounting the sculpted cord of Solomon and archivolt The date indicated for the foundation of the institution in Brav√£es was 1080. An 1140/1141 letter between D. Afonso Henriques and Prior Egeas (who was notary) on the transaction for the monastery of Villa Nova de Muia, suggests a level of importance for the monastery. By 28 July 1180, the monastery at Brav√£es was already autonomous; from a letter by Avelino de Jesus da Costa, it had already been granted special privileges by the same monarch. In the 1258 Inquiri√ß√µes (Inquiries) identified it as a Couto granted by D. Afonso Henriques to D. Pel√°gio Velasquez. By the end of the 13th century, following an inscription in the church, prior D. Rodrigo ordered the construction of the northern tower. The Commandery of Brav√£es was transferred from the Order of the Knights Templar to the Order of Christ, who remained at the site until the beginning of the 15th century. Of the monastery of Brav√£es, only the church remains, and was reconstructed completely during the first half of the 13th century. By letter dated 1420, Bishop of Braga D. Martinho V secularized the institution's monastic and instructional services, resulting in the institutionalization by D. Fernando da Guerra of a secular rectory. It was succeeded on 12 February 1434 by the de-institutionalization of the monastery to the status of parochial church. Around 1500 the mural painting with the depiction of S√£o Salvador was completed. Between 1540 and 1550, other mural paintings were executed, most notably the Mart√≠rio de S√£o Sebasti√£o (Martyr of St. Sebastian), and by the end of the last quarter of the 15th century, the probable work on the main chapel and the execution of the pictorial composition of the religious patron and paintings along the nave. A triptych over the main chapel was also added at the beginning of the 16th century, along with grotesque 1535 Romanesque paintings (images similar to that of Nossa Senhora da Azinheira in Outeiro Seco) and other paintings in the nave. In 1639, the lands alongside the main chapel were annexed by local. On 27 November 1755, there was a contract signed to remodel the church between Francisco Vieira Pinto (Lisboeta businessman and Solicitor for the Kingdom) and carpenter Tom√°s de Ara√∫jo (resident of Ponte da Barca) and Jer√≥nimo da Costa (resident of Pedreiro/Brav√£es) for 147$000 r√©si. The work included adjustments to the church roof, a staircase to the choir, ceiling and all the church's interior woods, to be completed in chestnut: the painting of the ceiling would be the responsibility of carpenters. This work became a function of the civil parish of Brav√£es later, as on 12 January 1843, they established a budget to be used in the maintenance of the parochial church. In the middle of the 20th century, work on the church was carried-out under the direction of architect Baltazar de Castro. Beginning in 1931, the DGEMN Direc√ß√£o-Geral de Edif√≠cios e Monumentos Nacionais (General Directorate for Buildings and National Monuments) started various restoration works on the church. This included the demolition of the northern chapel (where the sacristy functioned) and the construction of a larger annex; the demolition of the old sacristy; opening of the lateral northern doorway (which was blocked); dismantling of the choir, frontispiece, nave altars and substitution of the altar; the consolidation and repositioning of the architrave of the main chapel; removal of the pulpit, existing tiles and reconstruction of the same; cleaning and repairs to the stonework (interior and exterior); consolidation and restoration of Rosetta window; reconstruction of the granite slab pavement and leveling; regularization of the churchyard; construction and replacement of the doorways and the placement of the windows. In the course of these repairs, in 1936, a study was made of the frescoes within the church, and two years later, the cemetery was moved. Restoration work was also carried-out in 1946 along with repairs to the roof, two years later. Between 1951 and 1952, the tabernacle from the cathedral of Miranda do Douro were moved and adapted to the church. Yet, the following year, urgent work was needed in the ceiling of the nave. The spaces were modernized in 1960, with the installation of electrical lighting in the structure, that were expanded in 1961. Along with repairs to the ceiling and painting of the doors in 1968, corbels were installed in 1967, to install images. Work on the roof and ceiling were ongoing in the next few years, that included a major cleaning and repair between 1970 and 1971, especially in 1972, following damage caused by a storm. Work in 1973 included the integration with the old cemetery and churchyard. While the remainder of the 1970s, work was instituted to conserve the stonework, colonnades and cornerstones, in order to offset erosion. Meanwhile, in the interior, work was undertaken to restore and preserve the various frescoes. This work ultimately lead to the 1995 project by the IPPAR to restore two frescoes that flanked the triumphal archway, in addition to consolidation and cleaning. The municipal council of Ponte da Barca continues to study the possibility of creating a museological centre alongside the church, along with many of the frescoes that were removed to the Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga (National Museum of Ancient Art).

The longitudinal plan of the church is composed of a single-nave and rectangular presbytery (which is lower and narrower), with northern sacristy and tiled roof. Its principal facade terminates in the gabled roof and includes a central portico on the ground floor, consisting of four columns supporting an architrave with decorative zoomorphic motifs. The columns of this portico are decorated with monkeys, human figures (interpreted as the Virgin Mary and Angel Gabriel), entwined serpents and eagles with their beaks within a cornucopia. The capitals are decorated in vegetal forms or zoomorphic patterns. The first archivolt has a rosetta and rings, the second monkeys, the third monoliths and human figures. The tympanium includes a central figure of Christ secured by two angels. These images imply a level of universal surrender of the human forms by figures within the archivolt, while others suggest that the figures represent the figures of the Apostles of Christ, who were depicted as being represented by the types of images. Also problematic in this interpretation are the two figures of Mary and angel Gabriel (normally associated with the Annunciation) and who Louren√ßo Alves interprets as monks. The lateral facades with simple cornice circles the building. On the south facade is a Romanesque doorway with zoomorphic forms and tympanium with Agnus Dei and cross under a double archivolt that consists of decorated pearl fillets. Meanwhile, the north facade is decorated with a cross and two animals. Both doorways used a standard door, but the stonework suggests a double rectangular form. The interior nave is circled by frieze, with four slits flanked by columns and capitals, decorated with vegetal and geometric shapes over archways. The frontispiece likely included slits, with vestiges clearly visible in the interior. Over the axial portico is a double archivolt and tympanium with the cord of Solomon, surmounted by a covered slit or niche, and the ceiling is covered in wood. The triumphal archway to the presbytery is decorated by lions and leaves, columnar capitals and sculpted race, flanked by two frescoes representing Mart√≠rio de S√£o Sebasti√£o (Martyr of St. Sebastian) and Virgem de p√©, com o Menino nos bra√ßos (Virgin Mary and Child). Above these features in the gabled-end is a sculpted Rosetta window. The original mural paintings include the following: Mart√≠rio de S√£o Sebasti√£o high by wide; Lava-p√©s ; Deposi√ß√£o no t√∫mulo high by wide; Descida da cruz high by wide; Sagrada Fam√≠lia , date between 1540 and 1550; and the image of S√£o Salvador , date to 1500: these were transferred to the Alberto Sampaio Museum in Guimar√£es.

Germany The term Mini job was coined in Germany to describe a form of marginal employment that is generally characterized as part-time with a low wage. According to the latest law, the monthly income of a mini job is less than ‚Ç¨450, exempting them from income tax. In 2002 the Hartz commission recommended a series of measures to revitalise the German economy, known collectively as the Hartz concept. Gerhard Schr√∂der implemented it as part of his Agenda 2010 reforms in 2003 as part of a labor market reform.https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/21/mini-jobs- germany-britain. Mini jobs were introduced as part of Hartz II, which took effect on 1 January 2003. At the time Germany had no minimum wage, which was not introduced until 2015. The German government enacted legislation that ensures that employers pay social insurance for mini job workers. All German industries are allowed to offer mini job contracts, but the most common types of mini jobs are in the fields of catering, retail, and domestic work. Mini jobs were first intended to legalize informal work and to become a means of promoting employment. However, mini-jobs are tax-free and relatively abundant. For this reason, mini jobs are well-liked as secondary jobs. The employer pays a lump sum of 20% (including health insurance: 8%, pension fund: 10%, wage tax: 2%, as of 1 July 2006), or 18% in the case of domestic help for the pension fund and health insurance. The employer takes out additional accident insurance for his employees, costing about an additional ‚Ç¨60 per year. The cost of the accident insurance differs from state to state. Employees of mini jobs must be treated the same as full-time employees, except with cause. If full-time employees receive benefits, part-time employees receive a pro-rata share. A mini job can be taken during the six weeks of maternity leave prior to giving birth and during parental leave. However, the worker is not allowed to work more than 30 hours a week. Christmas bonuses or holiday pay may cause the ‚Ç¨450 limit to be exceeded. The employer must pay tax on such income. In March 2009 there were about 4.9 million people in Germany on ‚Ç¨450-a-month tax- free \\"mini jobs\\". Those whose main job is a mini-job still contribute to the national retirement pension insurance. The employee pays 3.7% and the employer pays 15%. They contribute neither to the national health insurance funds nor for unemployment coverage. They can either be covered by the health insurance of a higher earning partner (or parents, for students up to 25 years of age) or contribute voluntarily at a flat rate of ‚Ç¨140 per month. Spain On 7 December 2011 it was reported that the European Central Bank sent a letter in August to Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero's government, suggesting that Spain implemented a mini jobs job category with salaries of ‚Ç¨400, a value considerably lower than Spain's minimum wage of ‚Ç¨641. This suggestion was presented as a condition for the European Central Bank to continue purchasing Spain's debt. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom about 1.4 million people work under zero-hour contracts, with no guaranteed hours of work. A person earning under ¬£5,772 a year receives no credits for the state pension. In 2012, Justice Minister Liz Truss championed the idea of Britain following Germany's lead in allowing people to have tax-free and less-regulated mini jobs.

History  Built by the Jesuits in 1577 Mannerist Baroque-style, funded by donations from the faithful, as well as Frei Lu√≠s √Ålvaro de T√°vora, who is buried there, the Church and Convent of S√£o Louren√ßo were built enduring strong opposition from both the Municipal Chamber and the population. However, the followers of St. Ignatius of Loyola finally got the much coveted school which provided free classes - this quickly resulted in a remarkable success. With the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1759, by order of the Marquis of Pombal, the church was donated to the University of Coimbra until its purchase by the Discalced Friars of the Order of Saint Augustine that were there from 1780 to 1832. These friars came from Spain in 1663, settling initially in Lisbon, at the \\"site of Cricket\\" (lugar do Grilo), where they quickly gained the sympathy of the village, earning the name \\"brothers-crickets\\" (irm√£os- grilos) and thus the name of the church where they fixed residence in Porto. During the Siege of Porto, the brothers were forced to leave the convent, which later was occupied by the liberal troops of Dom Pedro. The Academic Battalion, integrating Almeida Garrett, settled there. Today the premises belong to the Semin√°rio Maior do Porto, to which they have belonged since 1834.

History The main facade and entrance to the Church of the L√≥ios The church of S√£o Jo√£o Evangelista, annex to the Convent of the L√≥ios, was constructed through the initiative of the first Count of Oliven√ßa, D. Rodrigo Afonso de Melo. The church was founded in 1485 by D. Rodrigo, the squire to King D. Afonso V, who entrusted his coffin and the family pantheon to the friars of the congregation of Santo El√≥i, destined for his family (a branch of the Dukes of Cadaval). D. Rodrigo also left his lands in the medieval castle, for the construction of a monastery. The church was consecrated in 1491. In addition to the tomb of D. Rodrigo de Sousa and his wife (in the presbytery), are the graves of his brother-in-law, D. Rui de Sousa (who was the chief-of- mission to the Congo in 1490 and ambassador of King D. Jo√£o II to the Catholic Monarchs of Spain during the Treaty of Tordesilhas, in 1491) and D. Branca de Vilhena. The notable Flemish tombstones, in bronze, are actually in the Museum of the House of Cadaval. In the sacristy is a fresco from the early 15th century, attributed to Jos√© de Escobar, of calvary figures flanked by angels, revealed in a restoration intervention. The sub-choir was constructed in the 16th century, resulting in the removal of the frontispiece. At the same time, the narthex was constructed to replace the primitive structure constructed in the 15th century. In 1630, the main altarpiece was constructed. Between the 17th and 18th century the frontispiece and gable elevation were rebuilt. The lateral azulejo tiles were ordered by D. Nuno √Ålvares Pereira de Mello, descendant of the founder, and first Duke of Cadaval, from the Lisboeta master Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Bernardes. The panels were date-marked 1711, and are one of the most monumental works of the artisan, with natural, expressive figures and large scenes. In the beginning of the 18th century, the donatary tribune was installed in the nave. As a consequence of the 1755 earthquake, much of the church was damaged, losing many of its original features. On 13 September 2011 a declaration was issued to rectify the announcement 281/2011 on the public tender proposal for interventions in the public spaces in √âvora to include several buildings and structures. Architecture The church is situated on the clifftop escarpment known as √âvora's acropolis (almost at the highest point), integrated into a complex of buildings that developed from the medieval castle, bordered by the Roman Temple of √âvora. It has a unique nave along a longitudinal plan, consisting of a polygonal apse and transept (though without the southern wing) covered in tile roofing. The principal facade includes three registers articulated vertically. On the first is the access to the narthex, through a Gothic portico with archivolts and flanked by imposing large columns with sculpted vegetal capitals. The archivolts are supported by columns of white marble with granite capitals, also with vegetal sculpted carvings, with the central archivolt supported by two thin colonnades. The outer doorway is framed by a small stone edicule over a broken-line, set on thin colonnades with similar vegetal capitals. The second register includes a decorated rectangular window and entablature. The side wall of the Gospel is adorned by a commemoration of the feats of Dom Rodrigo de Melo in Tangier, in An√ß√£ stone. It is constituted by a column with capital supporting a hexagonal base with two long-hair seraphs opening curtains to a tent, to show the heraldry of the Melos. The lateral facades are defined by large buttresses, adorned by continuous three-lobed friezes that extend to the apse. =Interior= The large nave has five sections with ribbed ogival interior with heraldic buttons. Formed of arches and of solid ribbed edges discharged into thin columns with vegetal capitals and abacuses in circular bocel. The first lower section of the entrance, includes the high choir and narthex, with lateral facades lined with historic azulejos and large rectangular windows. Following this section is the triumphal arch which opens to the main chapel, through three archivolts with broken stone arch. The remainder of the two- story chapel is covered by three sections of the ogival ceiling with polychromatic ceramic panels of the life of S√£o Louren√ßo Justiniano, covering the lateral walls to the gilded woodwork altarpiece with a tribune and pyramidal throne to expose the Blessed Sacrament. The founder's pantheon is situated under the sub-choir, that includes numerous tombstones in white marble. At the front, near the Chapel of the Blessed Sacramento, are the tombs of D. Manuel de Melo and his son D. Francisco de Melo. About half-way down the nave, on the right-side and second register is the tribune balustrade of the donation box, forming a wooden canopy supported by four pilasters. This canopy is highly decorated in gilded woodwork, that meets at the coat-of-arms of the Melo family. Farther along the opposite wall is a balustrade marble pulpit with radial petals base.

History A view of the church on the hilltop with the skyline of M√©rtola The building was likely built at the end of the 12th century as a mosque. But, by the 13th century, the building had already become transformed into a Christian church, and its altar relocated to the northern wall. It was re-installed in the east sometime at the end of the 15th century. In 1506, Duarte de Armas represented the church with a timber roof truss and a minaret/tower.Almeida (1943) By the middle of the 16th century, though, Pedro Dias described the changes to the building: the minaret had already been substituted for a belltower and the roofline had become adorned with merlons, which crown the roof of the building (authored by Fern√£o Pires). Between the 17th and 18th century, the belltower was redecorated. On 2 February 1969, the region experienced an earthquake resulting in damage to buildings on the hilltop, including the church. Architecture The principal facade showing a mix of elements The characteristic interior with the vaulted ceiling and pillars typical of Islamic architecture, juxtapositioned with Christian elements The church is located on an isolated hilltop, implanted on the steep slopes below the Castle of M√©rtola, but dominating the northern aspect of the town, on terraces above the Guadiana River. Its principal facade is situated along a roadway delimited by wall across (PT040209040017), and nearby the Chapel of Calv√°rio. The plan consists of a large, rectangular nave, rectangular annex (in the north), a pentagonal mihrab (in the east) and a square bell tower (in the southeast) all covered in differentiated tile roof. The four facades are crowned by triangular staccato merlons, alternating along the lateral walls with conical pinnacles and chamfered merlons. The principal facade, oriented on an angle to the south, one of the pinnacles acts as decoration and cylindrical buttress (in the left corner), adjoining the prismatic bell tower with windows in the upper section and fogar√©us in the four corners. Attached to the middle axis of the facade, is a three-storey buttress of differing molding that ends in a conical pinnacle. To its right, in decentered position, is a rectangular portico framed by low relief and colonnades, surmounted by molded oculus. On the rear facade, is a prismatic annex and an oblique archway portal framed by alfiz. On the right lateral facade is the faceted volume of the mihrab. Several buttresses reinforce the main elevation and the lateral elevations, one of them disposed in a diagonal, another flying buttress. =Interior= The interior consists of five naves, divided into four sections (with a central nave) and the last wider section forming a \\"T\\", covered by ogive/cross vaults on cylindrical column/shafts and corbels attached to the walls.

History The church was initiated by D. Afonso Henrique's mother in the 12th century The front facade and belltower, showing the four archivolts over the portico In 1152, Queen D. Mafalda, wife of D. Afonso Henriques, founded in the location of Neiva a monastery, a public construction that was incomplete at the time of her death. By 1220, the church was considered a royal church and continued to be operated as one of the monarchy's churches even by 1258. King D. Dinis donated the territory of Neiva to master Martinho in 1301, the King's physician and deacon of the S√© Cathedral of Braga. Around 1310, by request of Martinho, the archbishop of D. Martinho de Oliveira, instituted a collegiate at the church, that consisted of a rector and three chaplains. By the beginning of the 14th century, the church factory begun to operate, as part of the founding of the collegiate, as suggested by Almeida (1978). But, shortly after (1410), the site was donated to D. Afonso, future Duke of Braganza, where it remained part of his possessions until 1833. The tower was completed in the 15th century. From the writings of Father Carvalho da Costa (dated 1706), who was vicar and archdeacon of Neiva, he received a stipend of 60$000 re√≠s. At the same time, the monastery paid tithes to the Diocese of Braga. In 1732, orders were given to repair the porch that existed over the principal facade. Two years later, work was undertaken to open-up two belfries in the tower and erect a choir. This was followed closely behind by painting of the ceilings and plastering of the walls in the main chapel and nave (in 1744). Similar public work on the walls of the churchyard was also undertaken in 1758. But, by 1831, the church was already in ruins. Beginning in 1904, the first work to rebuild or reconstruct the church began with the front wall, which was in a state of ruin, while in the interior the wood floors were replaced. Architecture The Gothic portico with four archivolts The church is located in a rural community, situated in an elevated area on the flank of a hilltop overlooking the national roadway (Barcelos to Viana do Castelo). It is encircled by churchyard, parochial cemetery, public gardens and small, short residential buildings. The plan consists of a longitudinal nave and rectangular presbytery, with the areas covered in varying tiled ceiling. The principal facade includes a portico without tympanium, but tall Romanesque entranceway consisting of four archivolts, supported by 8 columns with plain shaft and capitals with anthropomorphic and zoomorphic elements. Over the main door is a round oculus. The lateral doorways also have vaulted entranceways, but more in keeping with the Gothic style. At about halfway up the walls are small, simple slits, while along the lateral nave walls are Romanesque cantilevers, with sculptures of faces, fish, animal heads (including bulls and pigs), a series of balls and a post-Dionisic shield (on the north). In the interior is a triumphal arch with supported by two simple columns. The head of the main chapel is illuminated by Gothic window with four-lobed oculus. The walls are covered in lettering, that is almost alphabetic. Along the southern part of the church is a low, imposing tower crowned by pyramidal merlons.

First construction began before 957, as evidenced by a document donated to Lorraine Monastery. It was rebuilt in the last decades of the twelfth century in the reign of Sancho I of Portugal. The elegant south portal probably dates to the late 12th century, and consists of several unpainted archivolts, surrounded by a vine-shaped frame, and capitals and columns with plant motifs. The four-arch portal in the front facade was built later. It capitals contain various motifs, both plant and animal, some derived from the Old Cathedral of Coimbra, and its columns are decorated with spiral-shaped geometric reliefs and plant motifs. The church interior has three naves and three chapels at its head. In the 15th century, a quadrangular chapel was added to the north side of the church, with a Gothic-style portal and a decorated alfiz. Although it has undergone several modifications over the centuries, the most radical intervention took place in the 1540s, when a second church was built over the early church to serve as the city's Mercy Church. This addition was removed in the restoration work of the first half of the twentieth century. An important mutilation of the church occurred in 1861, when the current Visconde da Luz street was widened. In this work, much of the southern apsidiole and main chapel were lost.

Rio Mau Romanesque Church  History  This is a monastery church with a simple Romanesque construction, consisting of a nave with a timber roof and a rectangular apse.Jos√© Cust√≥dio Vieira da Silva, Portugal ¬ß2: Architecture; Oxford Art online It is dedicated to St. Christopher. This small church is all that remains from an ancient monastery, founded in the 11th century, and belonging to the Canons Regular of St. Augustine. The earliest reference to this monastery dates from 1103. The present church is the result of a rebuilding carried out from 1151, as indicated by an inscription on the apse. This reconstruction in Romanesque style, was performed in several stages under different artistic influences. The apse was built first and reveals the strong influence of contemporary Galician art. The capitals on the columns are performed masterfully, representing, among others, medieval poet-musicians playing instruments. The current nave and the most western parts of the church were built during late twelfth century and early thirteenth century. The portals show the Romanesque influence of the Portuguese Benedictines, typical of Northern Portugal. The tympanum of the north portal shows a dragon and a griffin, a likely representation of the struggle between Jesus and the devil. The tympanum of the main portal is more elaborate. In the center stands a bishop in a blessing attitude (probably St. Augustine), flanked by two young deacons and two small figures, a bird with a sun and a mermaid holding a moon, symbols also associated with St. Augustine. In 1443 the monastery was dissolved and its assets passed to the Monastery of St. Simon of Junqueira, located close-by. This possibly contributed to the survival of the Romanesque church although the convent buildings were demolished. In the twentieth century the church underwent restorations and has become a National Monument since 1910.

It is classified as a National Monument. The church was dedicated in 1241 and was, at one time, the largest church in Lisbon. Prior to the establishment of the modern Portuguese republic in 1910, the church typically hosted Portuguese royal weddings. Formerly the home of the Inquisition, Jesuit missionary Gabriel Malagrida was famously executed at the church in 1761 after being accused of treason. The church was damaged by the 1531 Lisbon earthquake and almost completely destroyed in the 1755 earthquake. Rebuilding began quickly but wasn't completed until 1807. In 1959 the church was devastated once more when a fire broke out in the building. The fire, which killed two firefighters, took more than six hours to extinguish and completely gutted the church, destroying many important paintings and statues. In 1994 the church reopened. The restoration left many signs of the fire in place.

History The austere frontal aspect of the hermitage, showing the paved stone courtyard According to Concei√ß√£o Pires Coelho the construction started in or after 1535, during the priorship of Anthony of Padua, and concluded during the administration of Friar Bas√≠lio (1573). Coelho, Maria da Concei√ß√£o Pires (1987). But one can only speculate about such matters as there was no contemporary document about the beginning of the construction. The building was one of the last constructions completed by architect Jo√£o de Castilho. Initiated in 1551, with construction beginning in 1535, the temple was concluded in 1572-1573, after the death of the architect, under the direction of Diogo de Torralva. Conceived as funerary pantheon by King John III,Rafael Moreira (1981) the hermitage was innovative for the period. It was comparable to the temple of Rimini Malatestiano, designed by Leon Battista Alberti, with some motifs, including the use of windows and the \\"compressed interior design\\"Rafael Moreira (1981), p. 98 In 1711, friar Agostinho de Santa Maria referenced the temple in correspondence, referring to it as a Marian sanctuary.In√™s Borges (2006) An commemorative inscription was installed in 1848, following restorations completed in this church. In 1933-1934, the General-Directorate for National Monuments and Buildings () was charged with the consolidation and reinforcement of the central vault; reconstruction of the slats, frame and roof with glazed tiles; installation of exterior wall guards; the opening of exterior cracks and reinforcing them with water- resistant cement; reinforcement of the dome with hidden iron struts; and the reconstruction of the lateral and central doors. In 1946, a process was defined to designate the space as a zone of special protection (), which was published in the following year. Between 1965 and 1966, the support walls, churchyard spaces and staircase were defined and expanded, which included the reinforcement of the northern, southern and western limits with cap-stone and erecting an eastern fence. The project also involved the cleaning and repair of the staircase access to the main chapel and removal of rubble from the doorway and cracks in the walls, doors, window frames and spaces. These improvements lead to the installation of exterior illumination in 1967 to attract tourism. Reconstruction of the support wall, the roofing, construction of interior doorways and painting of the exterior doors were completed at the beginning of 1970. Similar cleaning and lateral door replacement occurred by the end of 1979. On 1 June 1992, the property was transferred into the authority of the Portugu√™s do Patrim√≥nio Arquitect√≥nico (IPPAR) (forerunner of the Institute for the Management of Architectural and Archaeological Heritage), under decree 106F/92. In a public tender, dated 13 February 2001, the IGESPAR published a request for competitive bids to (Di√°rio da Rep√∫blica III S√©rie, n¬∫ 37, public competition n¬∫ 306/IPPAR-L/E/2000) complete restoration and conservation projects in theConvento de Cristo, Ermida da Imaculada Concei√ß√£o. These public works began in 2002, which included the study of exterior walls; full restoration and masonry repair; the cleaning and restoration of stone in interior and exterior; the repair and replacement of joints; the establishment of an electrostatic system to deter pigeons from landing; replacement and restoration of plaster; the consolidation of the decorative elements inside and outside; installation of interior lighting and signage; improvement of peripheral drainage systems; and the full restoration of the statue of Nossa Senhora da Concei√ß√£o. Architecture The chapel is on an elevated part of the city of Tomar, on a platform delimited by a low wall, below the Castle of Tomar and Convent of Christ. It reflects the influence of classical Italian architecture in Portugal, with a stylistic interior aesthetic that is presupposes its use as a funerary chapel. While most of the churchyard is open with tiled pavement and landscaping, the rear of the hermitage includes a terraced garden, accessed by double symmetrical staircases. The longitudinal plan consists of three naves, with a slight transept, and a narrow prismatic chancel. While most of the hermitages roof is covered in tiles, the transept is finished with a central tower and domed cupola with corner pinnacles, and the chancel encircled by square roof. On the parapet that crowns the chancel is a small bell-tower arch, accessible by a domed staircase opening over the chancel. The exterior walls are generally smooth, but broken by ornamented Italianate windows and doorways with simple friezes and cornices. The main fa√ßade includes a rectangular door surmounted by an entablature, on the front of a triangular pediment with frieze and semi- circular window. A Latin cross surmounts this frontal entrance. The fa√ßades of the transept, also with triangular pediments on the northern and southern directions, are oriented north to south, with the southern fa√ßade having a rectangular door under one of the nave windows. All the windows on the exterior are decorated with cornices, friezes and triangular pediments. =Interior= The interior three naves are separated by two rows of three Corinthian columns, surmounted by square capitals that support a semi-circular vaulted ceiling broken by the cupola. Decorated square capitals divide each section of the cross, and support the cupola, its corners decorated with rosettes. The semi-cylindrical chancel, with apse niche supporting an image of the patron saint, is preceded by a stretched dome which opens into two small lateral chapels. The chancel chapels were constructed to house the tombs of King John III and Queen Catherine. The floor includes several stones with inscriptions that were removed from the Chapel of Santa Catarina within the Castle of Tomar. The transept is covered by a vaulted ceiling decorated with geometric and floral motifs, with corners embellished with grotesque masks, as noted by Rafael Moreira: \\"demons personified from the rivers of Hades, crying, with the two towards the nave with an air of indignation and scare, with the two alongside the triumphal arch exemplifies sorrow and horror of the subterranean world...\\"'Rafael Moreira (1981), p.99 The decorated capitals in the transept and chancel are funerary symbols, with the skulls symbolizing death and the phoenix symbolizing resurrection: this humanist iconography forms a logical expression of triumph over death and glorification of the institution of the Crown. The internal decoration demonstrates an understanding of classical themes, and expresses Jo√£o de Castilho's theoretical conception: inspired by Diego de Sagredo's \\"Medidas del Romano\\", which was published in the mid-16th century (1541) in Portugal. Further, the structure of the temple offers an understanding of royal architecture, including Roman influences and concepts that divided space between the \\"city of man\\" (the village of Tomar) and the \\"city of God\\" (represented by the nearby Convent of Christ).

By 1758, the curia of Castanheira were presented by the rector of Sanfins, annexed to the brotherhood of the Company of Christ, in the Colegio od Coimbra, supported by 60$000 in land rents. On 4 July 1774, D. Jos√© incorporated all the possessions of the extinct Company of Christ into the property of the University of Coimbra, which assumed its administration. On 5 May 1835, a decree incorporated the church into the Bens Pr√≥prios Nacionais (national assets) of the University, but continued to operate independently with the same land rents. But, by 21 November 1848, there was a new law passed to delimit what which possessions the University required function in Coimbra. In 1984, there was a collapse of the nave's ceiling and lateral cornices; the masonry was damaged and various decorative elements were destroyed. Architecture The church is located in a rural, isolated area, implanted in a mountainous zone, alongside the cemetery (which is located to the rear). The church is planted longitudinally, composed by two volumes: a rectangular nave and secondary section with sacristy addorsed to the northern wall. The main facade is oriented to the west, featuring a portal with perfect arch, composed of high chamfered staves over a smooth base and surmounted by small central oculus. Over the portal are three protrusions that mark the disappeared awning that use to exist, while over the frontispiece is a stone cross. On the southern facade along the nave wall has a chamfered Romanesque door and rectangular window. The eastern facade has a rectangular window along the sacristy. Along with a simple cornice, the north facade conserves sculpted representations of humans and animals.

The HOX gene contains four clusters (A, B, C, and D). The sense strand of the HOXA gene codes for proteins. Alternative names for HOXA11-AS lncRNA are: HOXA-AS5, HOXA11S, HOXA11-AS1, HOXA11AS, or NCRNA00076. This gene is 3,885 nucleotides long and resides at chromosome 7 (7p15.2) and is transcribed from an independent gene promoter. Being a lncRNA, it is longer than 200 nucleotides in length, in contrast to regular non-coding RNAs. The HOX genes code for transcription factors that are key to embryonic development. This lncRNA is one of the three lncRNAs present in the 5-prime region of the HOXA11 gene. The other two lncRNAs are HOXA10-AS and HOTTIP. Of these lncRNAs, HOXA11-AS, is the most conserved sequence in a wide range of organisms, which shows its longevity in the phylogenetic tree. Since HOX genes play a prominent role in embryogenesis and carcinogenesis, genes on the sense strand and antisense non-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes are often studied in their role of aberrant epithelial differentiation and cancer development. Location of HOXA11AS1 locus on chromosome 7  Function  Many lncRNAs are sequences that regulate the expression of nearby or distant genes. Common in HOX genes, lncRNAs can either regulate through cis or trans mechanisms, respectively. Cis mechanisms are transcription based when nearby genes are regulated, whereas trans mechanisms are transcript-based and regulate genes afar. HOXA11-AS regulates transcription factors and is a co-activator of the HOXA gene and other genes. Coming from HOXA homeobox, HOXA11-AS lncRNA regulates HOXA11 mRNA by blocking transcription. HOXA11-AS is similar to other lncRNAs in that it can affect many genes at once, thus allowing both local and genome-wide control. It is also similar because of its function in regulating cell proliferation, cell cycle, migration, apoptosis, and promoting angiogenesis. Some studies have shown that overexpression causes aberrant functions of the mechanisms listed above; however, other studies have shown downregulation is the cause.  Mechanism  Not much is known about the exact mechanism of HOXA11-AS lncRNA. Studies of Drosophila however show that many intergenic regions in the HOX genes code for lncRNAs that regulate the transcription of genes. Similar to other lncRNAs, HOXA11-AS lncRNA has epigenetic control over the transcription of genes. Typically found in the nucleus of cells, HOXA11-AS lncRNA regulates the recruitment of transcription factors, and thus plays a role in chromatin remodeling. As with most lncRNAS, HOXA11-AS lncRNA is attached to the site of transcription through the Polymerase II ternary complex, which allows for allele specific action. This feature is not seen in proteins or small nuclear RNAs. LncRNAs are concentrated in the nucleus because these sequences, contained in the intron sequences, are removed from the final mRNA transcript in mRNA processing. Sequences that are not removed make up the mRNA and are capped, polyadenylated, and exported out of the nucleus. Above: Cis regulation of nearby genes Below: Trans regulation of distant genes Epigenetic proteins that are involved with lncRNAs are categorized as either: writers, readers, or erasers. These proteins either add epigenetic modifications, recognize epigenetic changes, or remove epigenetic modifications, respectively. LncRNAs are able to complementarily hybridize to DNA sequences in the genome, thus targeting sequences and localizing epigenetic changes. Oftentimes, lncRNAs are not free-floating in the nucleus and are attached to chromosomes. Studies regarding HOX genes have found that lncRNAs are highly expressed in relation to the homeobox genes. Known antisense HOX lncRNAs, such as HOTAIR, are scaffolds where transcription factors bind, which makes them mediators of epigenetic regulation. Furthermore, this and other HOX lncRNAs are required for the normal development of the organism and are overexpressed in different forms of cancer. The overexpression of HOX lncRNA promotes cancer because it causes epigenetic regulator proteins to relocate and the chromatin of the cell to be remodeled. This remodeling can cause highly regulated functions of the cell, like proliferation, migration, and apoptosis to become unrestrained. Given the sparse research on the specific mechanism of HOXA11-AS lncRNA and what is known about the role of HOX genes, it may hold that HOXA11-AS lncRNAs act in a similar manner to other HOX lncRNAs.  Cancer Research  HOXA11-AS has been reported to have roles in various different cancers, including breast cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, glioma, and cervical cancer. Some studies have indicated that lncRNAs can be markers or targeted for treatment in various types of cancers. = Breast Cancer = Tissue samples of patients with breast cancer show high expression levels of HOXA11-AS, indicating its carcinogenic nature. Evidence of over-expression of HOXA11-AS as a causative factor of cell proliferation is seen when proliferation is blocked, once the lncRNA expression is knocked-down, or removed. Manipulating or removing the expression of this lncRNA allowed scientists to halt the progression of the cell cycle and initiate cell apoptosis at common cellular checkpoints, such as G1/G0 stage. The expression of the lnRNA was also suppressed by using small interfering RNAs (siRNA), that would degrade HOXA11-AS lnRNA transcripts. Upon doing so, cell proliferation was blocked. In addition to interfering with proliferation, degradation of HOXA11-AS lncRNA with siRNA was also seen to influence cell migration and cell tumor invasion, which is cancer metastasis. Scientists were able to determine these effects of HOXA11-AS lncRNA on breast cancer by monitoring the changes of epithelial-mesenchymal markers in the cell. Current research is looking at the potential possibility that breast cancer can be controlled or blocked by regulating the interaction between the lnRNA and epithelium/mesenchyme. = Lung Cancer = In non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), researchers found that HOXA11-AS plays a role as an oncogene, and that patients who had decreased HOXA11-AS lncRNA had a greater survival time. In addition, HOXA11-AS lncRNA was found to be up-regulated in the lung tissue of patients with NSCLC. HOXA11-AS lncRNA was found to inhibit apoptosis, promote cancer cell proliferation, promote cell migration, and activate the cell cycle. = Ovarian Cancer = HOXA11-AS lncRNA is studied in cancer research since its over-expression has been reported in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). In addition, on the molecular level, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have also been observed in the lncRNA sequences of HOXA11-AS in EOC patients. Studies have shown that the SNP variants in these lncRNA sequences do not increase risk of EOC in patients, but may be the driving force of the cancer phenotype. Regularly, HOXA11-AS lncRNA is a tumor-suppressor that inhibits EOC proliferation and migration; however, in many EOC cases, researchers observed downregulation of the lncRNA in the ovarian tissue. = Gastric Cancer = HOXA11-AS has been shown to be significantly up-regulated in gastric cancer tissue cells. The increase in expression of HOXA11-AS promotes cancer cell migration, tumor cell invasion, as well as metastasis of gastric cancer cells. HOXA11-AS has also been shown to affect cell apoptosis. Research that investigates the mechanism for the upregulation of HOXA11-AS shows that it specifically promotes transcription of beta-catenin through its interaction with EZH2. Additionally, current research has found that HOXA11-AS interacts with miR-1297 and blocks its ability to repress EZH2 protein translation. = Colorectal Cancer = Tissue samples from patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) were observed to have decreased expression of HOXA11-AS lnRNA when compared to normal colon cells. Correlations were seen between patients with larger tumor size, higher carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and increased metastases to decreased expression of the lncRNA. These metastases were tumor- node metastases (TNM) and lymphatic metastases. Lymphatic metastases is significant, as it is a common route for cancer cells to migrate to other parts of the body. Scientists were able to determine the effect HOXA11-AS lnRNA had on migration by blocking the transcript with siRNA and observing decreased cell migration and invasion. There was no correlation found between the migration distance and decreased HOXA11-AS lnRNA expression.

The webcam captured video footage of the summit of Mount Everest and was the highest webcam in the world. It was installed by Italian scientists as part of the Everest Share 2011 research project by the Nepalese Ev-K2-CNR team, which was intended to gather information regarding climate change by working together with the Everest weather station. As of 2019, the camera is no longer operating. Features The camera was an M12-type model made by the German-based company Mobotix. The M12-type camera is powered by solar cells and operated from 6am to 6pm local time (UTC +5:45). It was capable of operating at temperatures as low as and broadcast its live, high- definition video worldwide via the Internet. Operation The captured video was transmitted wirelessly to the Ev-K2-CNR Pyramid Laboratory/Observatory, located on the slopes of Mount Everest at an altitude of . The live video was analyzed in the observatory, then sent to Italy for further processing. Last images were given as of 09.11.2015. Location Kala Patthar was chosen as the location for the webcam because of its excellent view of the summit of Mount Everest, including both the north and south-west faces as well as the west ridge.
