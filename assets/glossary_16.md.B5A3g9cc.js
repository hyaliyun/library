She later made some controversial comments about the contest, posting on Facebook that the contest was rigged and that she believed the next winner would be Elena Correa, a fellow Costa Rican model who at the time of her comments was involved in a romantic relationship with Costa Rican businessman Carlos Rodriguez, some 40 years Correa's senior. She also accused the contest's producer, television channel Teletica, of fixing the contest so that those candidates favored by the channel won it, saying that Teletica practiced what she referred to as \\"social prostitution\\". Correa eventually won the Miss Costa Rica contest, but in 2017. Carboni, who has dual American and Costa Rican citizenship, participated in the 2017 Miss Florida contest. She did not qualify among the top 15 finalists in this contest. =Athletics= Carboni won the gold medal at the Heptathlon competition at the 2009 Central American Junior and Youth Championships in Athletics in San Salvador, El Salvador. Bodybuilding career Carboni spent eight months residing in Mexico during 2014, hoping to do well in the Musclemania Prestige contest, and on September 2014, she won the contest's \\"Sport Model Femenino\\" category, winning a gold medal at Mexico City's Teatro de la Jventud. With this, she was able to appear on an issue of the Mexican bodybuilding magazine, \\"Fisico y Fitness\\". Carboni also caused some controversy after this contest, alleging that some Mexican participants felt discomfort after her win since, according to Carboni, they expected to be chosen as winners instead of her, because of their nationality. She did not mention any specific contestants, however. Nicole Carboni also won gold medals at the same contest's Puebla and Veracruz versions. Further controversies On April 2, 2019, Carboni went live on national television in Costa Rica, on a show named \\"Divas Pero Divinas\\" and declared that the 2014 Miss Costa Rica Universe winner, Karina Ramos, had only won that pageant because she was, according to Carboni, sleeping with Teletica's president, Ren√© Picado. Ramos sued Carboni but on Apriul 10, it was announced that the courts had ruled in favor of Carboni, because her comment was done in a country where there is freedom of speech. Carbobi's allegations were similar to the ones she had done in 2015 concerning another model, Elena Correa and businessman Carlos Rodriguez. During March 4, 2020, a young, 18 year old model named Allison Pamela Bonilla V√°zquez disappeared without a trace. Carboni got involved in the news of the disappearance when she declared that Bonilla V√°zquez had both a boyfriend and a lover and that Carboni considered the man she alleges was her lover to be the main suspect. She added that she hoped her body gets found and the murderer gets executed, so that Bonilla V√°zquez's family got a \\"soon and fair resolution\\". Bonilla V√°zquez's mother Yendry V√°zquez answered by criticizing Carboni for what Vazquez alleged is an attempt at gaining further public attention by Carboni, declaring \\"What argument does she have to say that about my daughter? A person with feelings would not say that. God bless her\\". As of September, 2020, Bonilla V√°zquez remains disappeared. Personal She has a son named Odin Zeus L√≥pez Carboni, who was born in 2016. Nicole Carboni as of 2020 resides in Mexico.

As a branch of the special forces, the Communication Troops were an integral part of all five branches of the Armed Forces of the Soviet Union (Ground Forces, the Navy, the Air Force, Air Defense Forces and Strategic Missile Forces). The general command of the Communication Troops of all five branches of the armed forces was carried out by the Chief of the Communication Troops of the Ministry of Defense of the Soviet Union. The Communication Troops, which were part of the Internal Troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Soviet Union, the Border Troops and the Government Communication Troops of the State Security Committee of the Soviet Union, were not part of the Communication Troops of the Ministry of Defense of the Soviet Union.

June 1942 =Civil War= After the October Revolution, in the context of the outbreak of civil war and military intervention, in order to protect the Soviet Republic, the creation of the first units of the Red Army began. In the first half of 1918, measures were taken to create a system of governing bodies of the Red Army. On April 20, 1918, order No. 294 of the People's Commissariat for Military and Naval Affairs was issued, which determined the staff of the rifle division. In this state, a place was allocated for a separate communications battalion with a personnel of 977 people, and in rifle regiments ‚Äì communications teams. The battalion commander combined the position of divisional communications commander, respectively, the regimental communications team commander ‚Äì regiment communications commander. The lack of personnel, transport and equipment prevented the implementation of these steps. In November 1918, new staffs were introduced for the communications battalion of the rifle division, the communications company for the rifle brigade and the communications command for the rifle regiment. According to the new states, the communications battalion of the division and the communications teams of the rifle sections had less communications, transport and personnel, which made it possible to put them into practice. In December 1918, communications units began to be created in the military aviation and cavalry. The difference from the organizational structure of the troops of the Russian Empire was the independence of the battalions and communications teams, which, as in the tsarist period, were not included in the engineering troops. In October 1918, the issue of centralized management of radio communications in the Red Army was resolved, for which the position of a radiotelegraph inspector was established, subordinate to the headquarters of the Revolutionary Council of the Republic in operational terms and to the chief of the Main Military Engineering Directorate in technical terms. At the same time, on all fronts, the post of inspector of the front radiotelegraph was introduced, and in the combined arms armies ‚Äì the head of the army radiotelegraph. At the headquarters of the front, post and telegraph departments of the People's Commissariat of Post and Telegraph were created (they provided postal communication and communication via permanent communication lines). The supply of the Red Army with communications equipment was assigned to the Main Military Engineering Directorate. On October 20, 1919, by Order No. 1736/362 of the Revolutionary Military Council, the Communications Directorate of the Red Army was created, headed by the Chief of Communications of the Red Army, as well as the communications directorate of fronts and armies, communications departments in divisions and brigades. Thus, the official registration of the unification of the communications leadership of the Red Army into a harmonious system took place. October 20, 1919 became the birthday of the communication troops of the Armed Forces of the country, as independent special forces. The Communications Directorate of the Red Army was responsible for organizing and maintaining communications between the Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic and the Field Headquarters of the Red Army with the fronts and armies, the formation of communications units, their staffing, training, provision of equipment and other equipment. Artemy Lyubovich (formerly People's Commissar of Posts and Telegraphs) was appointed the first head of the Red Army's Communications Department; from September 1920 to April 1924, Innokenty Khalepsky was the head of the Red Army's Communications Department (formerly the head of communications of the Caucasian Front), who did a lot for the formation and development of the communications troops. The Communications Department of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army was responsible for organizing and maintaining communications between the Revolutionary Council and the field headquarters of the Red Army with the fronts and armies, the formation of communications units, their staffing, training, provision of equipment and other property. By December 1920, the communication troops consisted of 13 separate battalions and 46 communication battalions of divisions and brigades, a large number of companies and communications teams, warehouses, workshops and other units and subunits. The personnel of the troops exceeded 100,000 people. During the hostilities of the Civil War, general provisions for organizing communications at all levels of the Red Army were worked out, the main responsibilities of communications officials were defined, and ways of organizing communications by various means were developed. Continuously progress was made in the organizational structure of the linear and nodal units and communications units. For the first time in the history of military communications, communications trains were used to control the troops of the Red Army. The activities of the communication troops during the Civil War were highly appreciated in a special order of the Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic of February 17, 1921, which noted: \\"The heroic Red Army, which covered itself with unfading glory, owes much to the communication troops, who performed during the long struggle against enemies and had big and responsible tasks\\". At the end of hostilities, the communication troops were reduced to 32,600 people. The armament was mainly outdated and worn‚Äìout communication equipment of foreign production. Great difficulties in organizing communications were caused by the multi‚Äìtype and deterioration of communications equipment. The issue of improving military communications has become topical. By order of the Revolutionary Military Council of June 6, 1920, under the head of communications of the Red Army, a full‚Äìtime Military‚ÄìTechnical Communications Council was established, which was responsible for making decisions on all the main issues of organizing and developing military communications, including the management of scientific research and the creation of new technical means, as well as resolution of current pressing issues. =Interwar period= After the persistent efforts of the Chief of Communications of the Red Army, Innokenty Khalepsky, the Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic on April 15, 1923 established the Research Institute of the Military‚ÄìTechnical Communications Council of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army (now the 16th Central Research and Testing Institute). A scientific center appeared in the communication troops, which, on the basis of constant analysis of scientific and technical achievements in the country and the world, began to search for and military‚Äìtechnical substantiation of specific ways of their use in military communications. From the first days of its formation to the present time, the Institute has become a reliable support for the leadership of the communication troops in the formation and implementation of technical policy in the field of improving and developing systems and technical complexes of military communications. On the basis of research by the institute and the country's communications industry (including its own personnel) in the pre‚Äìwar period, the first generation of military field radio stations, telephone and telegraph devices, switching devices, communication cables, ground electronic reconnaissance equipment with which the Red Army entered into the Great Patriotic War. In terms of their technical level, these funds basically met the requirements of the troops of that time, but they were not enough. A significant number of obsolete communications equipment continued to remain in the Red Army. The problem of providing troops with communications equipment became especially acute with the beginning of the massive deployment of the army and navy in the fall of 1939. By the end of the 1920s, the communication troops remained qualitatively at the level of the final stage of the civil war. The subsequent industrialization of the country led to organizational and staff changes and an overall increase in the size of the Red Army, which was reflected in changes in the communication troops. In 1924, the First Congress of the chiefs of communications of military districts, formations and commanders of communications units was held. The congress examined theoretical and practical issues of the development of military communications. The recommendations of the congress were included in the Field Manual of the Red Army in 1925, which outlined the main principles and methods of organizing communications by various means, the responsibilities of commanders and staffs for command and control of troops and communications. In the early 1930s, the communication troops had in their composition (excluding corps and division battalions and communication squadrons): *9 separate communications regiments; *1 separate radio regiment; *12 separate radio battalions; *20 separate companies of rifle corps; *71 separate company of rifle divisions; *4 communications squadrons of the cavalry corps; *12 squadrons of cavalry divisions. By June 1941, the communication troops were: *19 regiments (14 district and 5 army); *25 separate line communications battalions; *16 separate radio divisions (including special purpose divisions); *4 separate companies. By the middle of 1941, the number of troops radio equipment was: in the General Staff ‚Äì Front link up to 35%, in the Army ‚Äì Corps link ‚Äì 11%, in divisions ‚Äì 62%, in regiments ‚Äì 77%, in battalions ‚Äì 58%. Of the total number of obsolete radio stations in the front‚Äìline radio networks were 75%, in the army ‚Äì 24%, in the divisional ‚Äì 89%, in the regimental ‚Äì 63%. By this time, a set of communications units only of central and district subordination consisted of 19 separate communications regiments, 25 separate communications battalions and other units and organizations. Communication warriors in the pre‚Äìwar period took part in hostilities on the Chinese‚ÄìEastern Railway (1929), near Lake Khasan (1938), near the Khalkhin‚ÄìGol River (1939), in the liberation of Western Belarus and Western Ukraine (1939), in the Soviet‚ÄìFinnish War (1939‚Äì1940). The communication troops from April 1924 to June 1941 were consistently led by Nikolai Sinyavsky, Roman Longva, Alexey Aksyonov, Ivan Naydenov, Nikolay Gapich. =Great Patriotic War= Field telephone TAI‚Äì43 during the Great Patriotic War With the outbreak of hostilities in the Great Patriotic War, in connection with the urgent need to provide communications in all levels of the Red Army's command and control, the number of communication troops increased sharply. For this reason, on August 5, 1941, the Communications Department of the Red Army was reformed into the Main Communications Department of the Red Army. In 1941, during the Great Patriotic War, by order of the People's Commissariat of Defense, the post of chief of the communications troops of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army was created. In the first, most difficult period of the war, major shortcomings in the preparedness of the border areas with regard to communications, technical equipment and in the preparedness of the communication troops of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army became obvious. The basing of wire communications on the network of state permanent air lines allowed aviation and enemy saboteurs to disable it. Radio communications were neither organizationally nor financially prepared to ensure stable command and control of troops. In the conditions of retreat and the most difficult defensive battles, the formations and units of the Red Army were not fully equipped with communications units and subunits. The staffing and equipment of the communications units and subdivisions were extremely insufficient. These circumstances were one of the reasons for the failures of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army in the initial period of the war. At the same time, the scale of the unfolding battles from the very beginning demanded the use of all the country's capabilities in the interests of ensuring communication with the troops. In November 1942, special radio divisions, engaged in electronic reconnaissance, were allocated from the Communication Troops of the Red Army, which were transferred to the subordination of the People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs of the Soviet Union. The experience of combat operations brought changes to the organization of the communication forces. So, in the period from May to August 1943, separate communication divisions of the Reserve of the Supreme Command and special‚Äìpurpose communication centers were created to provide communication between representatives of the Headquarters of the Supreme High Command with the General Staff and with the headquarters of the fronts. In order to centralize the leadership of communications in the country and the army, by the decision of the State Defense Committee of July 23, 1941, Colonel Ivan Peresypkin (since February 1944 ‚Äì Marshal of the Communication Troops) was appointed Chief of Communications of the Red Army, who also retained the post of People's Commissar of Communications of the Soviet Union. As new front‚Äìline and army directorates were formed, the need for communication troops and technical means for them continuously increased. During the first year of the war, under the energetic leadership of Ivan Peresypkin, over 1,000 new communications units were formed, schools and courses were created for the accelerated training of various specialists to meet the needs of the front in them. Ivan Peresypkin managed to use all the resources and opportunities available in the country to establish mass production of communications equipment and supply them to the troops. As a result of all these efforts, it was possible to reverse the situation with providing communications for the active forces. In 1942, the first portable domestic ultrashort‚Äìwave radio station A‚Äì7 with frequency modulation for rifle and artillery regiments was developed, which received very high praise in the troops. A noticeable increase in the role of radio communications occurred already during the operations of the summer‚Äìautumn campaign of 1942. The experience of military operations has convincingly shown that radio, especially in an offensive, is becoming the main, and often the only, means of communication providing command and control of troops. In the course of the war, the equipment of troops with radio communications equipment increased sharply. In 1944, the industry supplied more than 64 thousand radio stations of all types to the troops. Further improvement of communications control bodies, organizational and staff structure of formations, units and subdivisions of communications, an increase in their number took place. New elements were introduced into the communications system of the General Staff ‚Äì special‚Äìpurpose communications centers, through which direct wire communications of the Supreme High Command Headquarters were provided with 2‚Äì4 fronts. Communication centers for special purposes were located 50‚Äì200 kilometers from the front line. Through them communication was also provided between adjacent fronts. Throughout the war, the proportion of signalmen in the total number of army personnel increased continuously. By the end of 1944, separate communications brigades were created, consisting of several separate battalions, and additional communications centers were deployed. Due to the increase in the number of active fronts and the increase in the distance between the General Staff and the headquarters of the fronts, the number of communication units of the Supreme High Command Reserve increased significantly, and communication brigades of the Supreme High Command Reserve were formed. By the end of the war, the Red Army had in its composition a large number of communication formations, the largest type of which was the communication regiment. In total, by May 1945, the Communication Troops of the Red Army had: *125 communication regiments (of which 10 communication regiments of the Air Defense and 20 communication regiments of the Air Force); *300 separate communication battalions (excluding corps and divisional); *About 500 separate communication companies. 6 regiments were awarded the rank of guards. 294 signalmen became Heroes of the Soviet Union, more than 100 signalmen became full holders of the Order of Glory. Many thousands of military signalmen were awarded orders and medals. During the war, almost 600 communications units were awarded orders. A number of front‚Äìline and army communications units were awarded the title of Guards. In 1944, the rank of communications marshal appeared (3 more generals were appointed marshals of troops after the war). =Post‚Äìwar period= In connection with the post‚Äìwar mass demobilization in the armed forces and the reduction of the armed forces in the period from 1945 to 1946, more than 300 communications units were disbanded (not counting those that were part of the corps and divisions). In March 1946, the Main Directorate of Communications of the Red Army was reorganized into the Directorate of the Chief of Communications of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of the Soviet Union. Also in 1946, the Special Forces of the Intelligence Directorate of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, which carried out radio intelligence, were returned to the subordination of the War Ministry from the structure of the People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs ‚Äì People's Commissariat of State Security. In April 1948, by a directive from the Minister of Defense of the Soviet Union, the Office of the Chief of Communication Troops of the Ground Forces was transformed into the Directorate of Communication Troops of the Soviet Army. In October 1958, the Directorate of the Communication Troops of the Soviet Army was transformed into the Directorate of the Chief of the Communication Troops of the Ministry of Defense of the Soviet Union. The main part of the formations and units of the Communication Troops supported the activities of the ground forces. The generalization and analysis of the experience of the combat use of communication troops convincingly showed that success in operations and battles depends to a decisive extent on the quality of command and control, and command and control ‚Äì on the state of technical equipment, capabilities and level of preparedness of the communication troops. In the first post‚Äìwar years in the communication troops of the Soviet Army, much attention was paid to the development and implementation into practice of new principles for organizing communications of operational formations and combined‚Äìarms formations on the basis of the richest experience of the Great Patriotic War, as well as the development and substantiation of operational‚Äìtactical requirements for new means and complexes of communications, capable of providing command and control in the new conditions of warfare. Marshal Ivan Peresypkin at the end of 1944 set the task of starting work on the preparation of the first post‚Äìwar weapons system for military communications. In the late 40s and 50s, the troops began to receive new communication systems with qualitatively new tactical and technical characteristics. Short‚Äìwave car radio stations were created for the radio networks of the General Staff, for front‚Äìline, for army (corps) radio networks, as well as for divisional networks and a tank radio station. Portable ultra‚Äìshort‚Äìwave radio stations were created, which provided search‚Äìfree and tuningless communication in the tactical control link. At the same time, technical means were created for a fundamentally new type of communication for the Soviet Army ‚Äì radio relay communication (multichannel station R‚Äì400 and low‚Äìchannel station R‚Äì401), as well as frequency multiplexing and channelization complexes, qualitatively new samples of telephone and telegraph equipment, switching devices, several types of field communication cables. Equipping troops with radio relay stations was a qualitatively new stage in the development of communication systems of operational formations and combined‚Äìarms formations, increased their reliability, survivability and noise immunity, and also improved a number of other indicators. The introduction of new technology into the troops required a revision of the organizational and technical structure of communication centers. Based on the use of new means of communication, standard complexes of automobile control rooms were created for the formation of mobile field communication centers for various control points. For the first time, mobile communications units of industrial production began to enter service with the troops. The time for the deployment of such communication centers was sharply reduced, the mobility of communication systems in general increased significantly. In the second half of the 50s, the rapid development of nuclear missile weapons began, and the qualitative improvement of other means of armed struggle began, which led to significant changes in the structure of the Armed Forces of the Soviet Union. These circumstances, in turn, necessitated the development of new methods of command and control of troops and weapons. The period of the 60s, in general, is characterized by the beginning of practical work on the creation of automated complexes for command and control of troops and weapons (anti‚Äìaircraft, artillery and missile forces) and design work in the field of automation of control of the armed forces. Increased requirements for communication systems and channels began to appear in terms of their stability, noise immunity, secrecy and timeliness in the transmission of information. The Communication Troops were successfully solving these complex new tasks. With the retirement of Marshal of the Communication Troops Ivan Peresypkin in 1957, Alexei Leonov began to lead the Communication Troops (since 1961, Marshal of the Communication Troops). Under his leadership, work continued to improve the structure of the troops and create new means of communication. The introduction of new short‚Äìwave and ultra‚Äìshort‚Äìwave single‚Äìband radio stations of high and medium power has significantly increased the quality characteristics of radio communication channels in operational and operational‚Äìtactical levels of command and control. Radio relay communications were further developed. Means were created for a new type of communication ‚Äì tropospheric communication, which made it possible to provide high‚Äìquality multichannel communication directly between control points at a distance of up to 150‚Äì250 kilometers from each other (without retransmission). In the 60s, the first practical work on the creation of satellite communication lines was launched. Complexes of unified compression and channeling equipment common for cable, radio relay and tropospheric communication lines, new means of telephone, telegraph and facsimile equipment, data transmission equipment and complexes of equipment for classifying information for various purposes were created. Based on the use of a new generation of various communication technologies, a new generation of hardware field communication centers was created, as well as several types of command and staff vehicles on an automobile and armored transport base for commanders of motorized rifle (tank) regiments and battalions. Appropriate clarifications were also made to the organizational structure of the communication troops and to the system of training highly qualified command and engineering personnel. The next stage in the development of the communication troops since 1970 is associated with the activities of Andrei Belov (in 1973, he was awarded the military rank of Marshal of the Communication Troops). At the beginning of the 70s, on his initiative, a system of routine maintenance and controlled operation of communications equipment was developed and introduced into the troops. Vigorous measures were taken to solve the problem of managing the communication system itself and its elements. The industry at that time did not produce technical means for equipping communications control posts. In this regard, the 16th Central Scientific Research Testing Institute of the Ministry of Defense of the Soviet Union was instructed to promptly develop and manufacture atypical complex equipment for communications control posts. Based on the provisions of the theory and practice of the communication troops, it was concluded that it was necessary to create unified communication systems of large formations and formations while preserving the communication subsystems of the combat arms, special forces and services with a certain specificity of combat activities (reconnaissance, air defense and aviation, missile troops and artillery, rear and more). In this regard, and also taking into account the increasing role of communication systems and complexes in the management of the Armed Forces of the Soviet Union, on May 26, 1977, a directive of the General Staff No. 314/3/0534 was issued according to which the Office of the Chief of Communications of the Ministry of Defense of the Soviet Union was included in the General headquarters as the Office of the Chief of Communications of the Armed Forces of the Soviet Union. At the same time, the position of the head of this department began to be called as \\"Chief of Communications of the Armed Forces ‚Äì Deputy Chief of the General Staff\\". At the end of the 1970s, measures were taken to develop comprehensive research in scientific organizations of the Ministry of Defense and Industry to substantiate conceptual issues of the creation and operation of a promising automated communication system of the Armed Forces. Based on the results of these studies, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union in 1980 issued a special decree on the creation of a large cooperation of industrial and research organizations of the Ministry of Defense in order to launch work on the creation of a United Automated Communication System of the Armed Forces and the creation of technical equipment for it. At the same time, an automated front communications system, a unified satellite communications system of the Ministry of Defense (separately from the system of the Ministry of Communications ‚Äì while maintaining the general system for launching spacecraft and command and measuring complexes) and promising technical means for them were created. Measures were taken to develop comprehensive research in scientific organizations of the Ministry of Defense and Industry to substantiate conceptual issues of creating and operating a promising automated communication system of the Armed Forces. Based on the results of these studies, by a special resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union in 1980, a large cooperation of industrial organizations and research organizations of the Ministry of Defense was created, work was launched on the development of a Joint Automated Communication System of the Armed Forces and the creation of complexes of technical means for it. At the same time, a unified satellite communications system of the Ministry of Defense and promising technical means for it were created. To ensure the functioning of the developed automated control systems for the Armed Forces, troops and weapons, special data transmission systems were created. The creation of automated control systems has caused a significant increase in the requirements for the technical characteristics of communication facilities and the communication system as a whole. In this regard, attention was constantly paid to the creation of new generations of basic communication means of general use and the modernization of some of the existing means. At the end of the 1980s, to ensure reliable radio communication at the tactical level, an automated complex of short‚Äìwave and ultra‚Äìshort‚Äìwave radio stations R‚Äì163 (12 types) was created. At the end of the 1990s, to replace it, a perfect complex of noise‚Äìimmune radio communications of the tactical level R‚Äì168 (17 types) entered the troops. New promising radio relay stations for multichannel and low‚Äìchannel communications were created, including the first domestic microwave radio relay communications, as well as new effective means of tropospheric communications. Communication Troops at the last stage of the existence of the Soviet Union =Classification of troops= The communication troops were classified according to the following main features: *Belonging to the control system that they provided with communication: :*Communication troops of the General Staff (central subordination); :*Communication troops of the main headquarters of the branches of the Armed Forces; :*Communication troops of operational‚Äìstrategic commands (fronts, groups, districts); :*Operational commands (armies and corps); :*Associations of the branches and services of the Armed Forces; :*Communication units of formations and subunits of the arms and services of the Armed Forces. *Organizational composition: :*Formations ‚Äì brigades; :*Separate units ‚Äì regiments, battalions (field communication centers), companies (centers, platoons, squads and crews); :*Institutions ‚Äì research institutes, etc.; :*Educational establishments; :*Repair factories, storage bases and warehouses. *The functional purpose of formations, units and communications units: :*Nodal; :*Linear; :*Territorial; :*Courier‚Äìpostal service; :*Communication security control; :*Communication technical support and automated control systems. =Tasks of the Communication Troops by belonging to the control system= The main tasks of the Communication Troops of the Armed Forces of the Soviet Union were: *Operation of existing communication systems; *Carrying out measures to maintain communication systems in the established degrees of combat readiness; *Creation, development and improvement of communication systems, ensuring their reliable operation; *Strengthening and building up communication systems during the transfer of the Armed Forces from peacetime to wartime; *Deployment of the field component of the communications system during operational deployment of troops. The communications troops of the central subordination allowed the leadership of the Armed Forces to respond in real time to changes in the military‚Äìpolitical and operational‚Äìstrategic situation in the world, to bring decisions and orders for the combat use of formations and units guaranteed and on time. The communication troops included: separate brigades and communication regiments, field and stationary communications centers, communications security control units, research institutions, educational institutions, repair plants, storage bases, warehouses. The communication troops of the main headquarters of the branches of the Armed Forces provided command and control of the commanders and the headquarters of the branches of the Armed Forces of groupings of troops (forces) in their daily activities, during the period of military danger and during the performance of combat missions. Their structure is similar to the composition of the communication troops of the central subordination. The communication troops of the operational‚Äìstrategic command (strategic commands of directions, fronts, groups, districts, fleets) provided control to the commanders and headquarters of the operational‚Äìstrategic commands of subordinate formations, formations and units in their daily activities, during a period of military danger and during the performance of combat missions. At this level, the troops included: a nodal communications brigade, a territorial communications brigade, a separate regiment (or battalion) of rear communications, a headquarters communications center, a center for automated control systems, a command post (communications and automated command and control system); courier‚Äìpostal communication center, communication security control centers (points), communication equipment repair base, storage and repair base for military equipment. Liaison formations of operational commands (armies and corps) ensured command and control of subordinate formations and units both in daily activities and during a threatened period and during combat missions. They consisted of: a separate communications regiment, a junction, a communications center of the headquarters, a courier‚Äìpostal communications center, a communications warehouse, a storage and repair base for military equipment. Communication formations and units of the central, operational‚Äìstrategic and operational control levels were intended for the deployment and maintenance of stationary and field communication centers of the command posts of the General Staff, the main headquarters of the Armed Forces, operational formations, the deployment of communication lines by various means, the mutual exchange of communication channels with interconnected communication network of the country. =Staff structure of troops= By the final period of the existence of the Soviet Union, the communication troops of the central subordination (or the Supreme High Command) and the communication troops of the Ground Forces were most massively represented. Since the end of World War II, the largest formations of the signal troops were brigades, of which there were about 50. The massive creation of brigades began in the second half of the 1970s, when the existing regiments and separate battalions of central and district (group) subordination began to grow larger and reorganized into brigades. Centrally subordinate brigades differed in their tasks: *Communication brigades of the Supreme High Command; *Nodal brigades; *Linear (territorial); *Rear communications brigades; *Reserve communications brigades; *Communication training teams. Each of the brigades (except for the nodal ones) was a compound consisting of 3 to 5 separate battalions of various types (radio, tropospheric communications, long‚Äìdistance communications, radio relay, radio relay cable, underground cable, line, nodal, construction and operational), as well as field and stationary nodes. Field and stationary communications centers were a battalion‚Äìlevel communications formation, consisting of communications units of various types listed above. The nodal brigades consisted of field communication centers. At the tactical level of command and control of troops (motorized rifle, tank and airborne divisions), as well as combat arms, special forces, technical support and rear, separate battalions and communication companies, communications platoons (command platoons), courier and postal stations, platoons of technical support, workshops for the repair of communications equipment were included in their regular structure. The main commands of each of the 4 directions (Western, Southwestern, Southern and Far Eastern) had 2 brigades and 2‚Äì3 separate communication battalions, and each of the border districts and the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany also had 2‚Äì3 communication brigades at their disposal, a regiment and 2‚Äì4 separate battalions, including a regiment or rear communications battalion. For each tank or combined arms army, there was an army communications regiment and a radio relay‚Äìcable battalion, and in the army corps there was a separate battalion. The basis of the army regiment was 2 field communications centers and a communications company. In the communication troops of the ground forces, the main combat unit of the communication troops were battalions of various types, which were both an integral part of brigades and regiments and parts of combined arms formations. These include the following types of battalions: *As part of an army corps, tank, motorized rifle or airborne divisions ‚Äì a separate communications battalion; *As part of the communication brigades: :*Separate communications battalion (junction); :*Separate line (line‚Äìcable) communications battalion; :*Separate long‚Äìdistance communications battalion; :*Separate construction and operational communications battalion; :*Separate battalion of heavy underground cable; *As part of the combined arms (tank) army, army corps: :*Separate radio relay battalion (or tropospheric communications); :*Separate radio relay and cable battalion. Communication Troops armament R‚Äì145BM ‚Äì the main command and staff vehicle of the battalion and regimental level of the Ground Forces of the Soviet Union Airborne Forces of the Soviet Union During the Great Patriotic War, the ground forces were supplied with radio stations 12‚ÄìRT, RBM, A‚Äì7, RSB‚ÄìF, RAF‚ÄìKV‚Äì3 and others, as well as many samples of telegraph and telephone equipment, including field telegraph devices 2BDA‚Äì43 made at that time. At the end of 1944, the signal troops began to receive the radio station RAF‚ÄìKV‚Äì4 with the \\"Karbid\\" equipment, which ensured the operation of direct‚Äìprinting telegraph devices over radio lines with protection against interference. The industry of the Soviet Union mastered the production of ultra‚Äìshort‚Äìwave radio stations. In the troops, the saturation with radio communications equipment was constantly increasing at various command and control levels. For example, at the initial stage of the war, the rifle division had only 22 radio stations, but by the end of the war their number had grown to 130. From the late 1940s and into the 1950s, the communication troops began to receive more advanced means of communication. The following samples of shortwave car radios were created: *For radio networks of the General Staff ‚Äì R‚Äì100 and R‚Äì110; *Front‚Äìline radio networks ‚Äì R‚Äì101 and R‚Äì102; *Army and corps ‚Äì P‚Äì118 and R‚Äì103; *Divisional ‚Äì R‚Äì104 (portable and transportable modification); *For tank troops ‚Äì R‚Äì112. To ensure search‚Äìfree and tuningless communication at the tactical level, the troops were supplied with small‚Äìsized ultra‚Äìshortwave radio stations: R‚Äì105, R‚Äì1Ob, R‚Äì108, R‚Äì109, R‚Äì114, R‚Äì116 and R‚Äì113 (tank). In the same period, a fundamentally new radio relay communication scheme was introduced for the Soviet army (multichannel station R‚Äì400 and low‚Äìchannel station R‚Äì401), as well as frequency multiplexing and channelization complexes (P‚Äì310, P‚Äì304, P‚Äì311, P‚Äì312 , P‚Äì313, P‚Äì314). Improved samples of telephone and telegraph equipment, switching devices, several types of field communication cables were delivered. The first samples of command‚Äìstaff vehicles R‚Äì125 \\"Alphabet\\", radio stations R‚Äì118 and radio relay stations R‚Äì403 and R‚Äì405 appeared in the troops, the installation of which was carried out on GAZ‚Äì69 and GAZ‚ÄìbZ vehicles, and later on UAZ‚Äì469 and GAZ‚Äì66. In the postwar years, emphasis was placed on the mobility of field communication centers. In the 1950s and 1960s, the troops were supplied with complexes of mobile communication centers for command posts of different command levels: *Mobile Communication Center No. 1 ‚Äì front command post on 22 vehicles; *Mobile Communication Center No. 2 ‚Äì front‚Äìline on 6 vehicles; *Mobile Communication Center No. 3 ‚Äì army on 9 vehicles; *Mobile Communication Center No. 4 ‚Äì corps on 4 cars; *Mobile Communication Center No. 5 ‚Äì divisional on 1 vehicle. For operational and operational‚Äìtactical units of command and control, new shortwave and ultrashortwave single‚Äìband radio stations of high and medium power were delivered: R‚Äì135, R‚Äì136, R‚Äì137, R‚Äì140. For the tactical level of control, portable and transportable broadband ultra‚Äìshortwave radio stations R‚Äì107 and R‚Äì111 with automatic tuning to previously prepared frequencies were developed. Radio relay communications have also made progress. New types of radio stations such as R‚Äì121, R‚Äì122, R‚Äì408 made it possible to provide high‚Äìquality multi‚Äìchannel communication directly between control points at a distance of up to 150‚Äì250 kilometers from each other (without retransmission), including through hard‚Äìto‚Äìreach terrain. Since the beginning of the 1970s, the signal forces began a radical modernization and rearmament to more advanced models, which is associated with the assumption of the post of chief of the Communication Troops of the Ministry of Defense of the Soviet Union, Colonel‚ÄìGeneral Andrei Belov. The troops began to receive command‚Äìstaff vehicles made on the basis of military equipment (BMP‚Äì1KSh and BMD‚Äì1KSh), new models of Command and Staff vehicles on an automobile base (R‚Äì141, R‚Äì142, R‚Äì148), a mobile field communications center R‚Äì146A, a unified complex for sealing communication lines \\"Topaz\\" (P‚Äì300, P‚Äì301, P‚Äì302); classified communication equipment (T‚Äì206‚ÄìZM). In 1972, atypical communication equipment was developed and manufactured for the first samples of air command posts of division, army, front, which made it possible to control troops from board aircraft and helicopters. In the 1970s, the armament of tropospheric communication units was updated, in which the old complexes on several vehicles (R‚Äì408 on 3 ZIL‚Äì157 vehicles with long trailers) were replaced by mobile and compact stations on one vehicle (R‚Äì410 and R‚Äì412). In 1972, the troops began to supply the complex of ground stations for satellite space communications R‚Äì440 \\"Kristall\\". Hardware and stations of all types of field communication centers were improved, which received a new automotive base and modified equipment: *Telephone exchanges P‚Äì225; *Complex hardware rooms P‚Äì240 and P‚Äì241; *Equipment for long‚Äìdistance communication P‚Äì234, P‚Äì255 and P‚Äì257; *Control rooms of the secret communications equipment P‚Äì242 and P‚Äì244; *And other. A large list of stations and hardware, power plants and antenna devices for various purposes for the communication troops were installed on the chassis of off‚Äìroad vehicles. These included: GAZ‚Äì63, GAZ‚Äì69, GAZ‚Äì66, ZIL‚Äì157, ZIL‚Äì131, Ural‚Äì375, Ural‚Äì4320 and KamAZ‚Äì4320. For these chassis, standard box bodies were developed that made it possible to place communication equipment (such as KUNG‚Äì1M, KM‚Äì66, KM‚Äì131). In order to unify, part of the communications equipment was installed on the basis of armored personnel carriers and infantry fighting vehicles. For example, the following samples of armored vehicles became the basis for the following command and staff vehicles and radio stations: *BTR‚Äì50 ‚Üí BTR‚Äì50PU and BTR‚Äì50PUM; *BMP‚Äì1 ‚Üí BMP‚Äì1KSh; *BMD‚Äì1 ‚Üí BMD‚Äì1KSh; *BRDM ‚Üí BRDM‚Äì5; *BTR‚Äì60 ‚Üí R‚Äì137B, R‚Äì140BM, R‚Äì145BM, R‚Äì156BM, R‚Äì238BT, R‚Äì240BT, R‚Äì241BT, R‚Äì409BM, PU‚Äì12.

Photos: ¬© WTO/Jay Louvion Aid for Trade includes measures to help countries develop trade strategies, plans or projects and implementation, such as building roads, ports, and telecommunications that link domestic and global markets, or investing in industries and sectors to help diversify exports. Many have credited Aid for Trade with economic improvements in developing countries, while others point out that not all trade initiatives are successful and some of the funding is lost to corruption. The OECD and WTO established an 'aid-for-trade monitoring framework' to track progress in implementing the Aid-for-Trade Initiative. It consists of the following elements: * mainstreaming and prioritising trade (demand). * mainstreaming and prioritising trade (demand) * trade-related projects and programmes (response). * enhanced capacity to trade (outcome). * improved trade performance and reduced poverty (impact).

Prison guards selected Manning for a strip search, which he obeyed. He was then ordered to squat for an anal and genital examination, which he refused to do. A struggle then ensued, where Manning was thrown to the ground face down, whilst other prison officers held down his hands and legs. He was carried half-naked along a corridor and held in a neck hold. Officers then noticed a pool of blood near his head, and his body became limp. They then called for medical assistance, while they continued to restrain him. When the nurse arrived he was found to be dead, and attempts to resuscitate him failed. A postmortem found that Manning died of asphyxia. He reportedly had \\"blood from the ear and mouth, bruising to the neck and back, blood spots in the eyes, face and neck, and eight separate injuries to the face\\". It was also found that none of the officers had sustained any injuries, though they claimed that Manning resisted violently.  Prosecution  The Crown Prosecution Service refused to bring criminal charges against the officers, stating that there was \\"insufficient evidence to proceed\\". An inquest into the death was conducted, which concluded on 25 March 1998 and found that the killing was unlawful. The court added that \\"Alton Manning died a brutal, inhuman [and] violent death as a direct result of a neckhold unlawfully applied by a senior prison officer at HMP Blakenhurst\\". The inquest recommended that the CPS consider bringing charges against the involved officers. Following the result of the inquest, seven prison officers were suspended, though no charges were brought forward against the individuals. Manning's family sought judicial review against the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions, David Calvert-Smith, to not bring charges against the officers involved. The request for judicial review was successful; in May 2000 Lord Bingham, the Lord Chief Justice, stated that the decision to not bring manslaughter charges was flawed and must be reconsidered. Bingham added that the expectation would be, after a finding of unlawful killing, a prosecution to follow. Following a review in 2002, a CPS spokesperson said that \\"after careful consideration\\" they decided that \\"there is insufficient evidence\\" to bring forth criminal charges against anyone involved. Consequently, no officers have been charged in the killing.  Reaction  Following the death, Richard Tilt, the Director General of Her Majesty's Prison Service, commented that black people were more likely than white people to suffer \\"positional asphyxia\\" while being restrained by prison officers, due to \\"physiological differences\\". Following public backlash and comments from medical experts who stated no evidence supported the claim, Tilt apologised for his comments.

The exhibition included a showcase of Canadian natural resources and fine art. Background The Canadian pavilion, designed by Lawrence Fennings Taylor The 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition was the largest exhibition held in the Western hemisphere to date. Canada was one of 62 nations invited to participate. The Canadian government erected a Canadian pavilion, spending more than $30,000 on the building and on beautifying the grounds. The official guide to the exhibition said the pavilion where Canada's forest, game and fruit wealth was exhibited was a spacious structure, said to be a clubhouse. The building was designed by Lawrence Fennings Taylor in a Gothic style. Fine art from Canada was shown in another building, the Palace of Fine Arts (today the central part is the St. Louis Art Museum), in galleries 49 to 52 of its east pavilion, adjacent to Germany and Sweden's showrooms. Fine art The Tiff (around 1902) by Florence Carlyle. Oil on canvas. The art exhibition included 117 works by 51 Canadian artists (88 in oil, 29 in pencil and watercolour). Landscape, genre scenes and portraits predominated. The Canadian exhibition was small but choice, wrote David R. Francis, the President of the exhibition in his three volume book on the Fair. As in previous exhibitions such as the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893, Canada was shown as an independent nation and not as part of Great Britain. On viewing it, Francis wrote that Canadian art was never represented better at any international exhibition, adding that it most closely resembled developments in the United States and praising many of the Canadian exhibitors, among them Florence Carlyle, Robert Harris, Edmond Dyonnet, Curtis Williamson, Laura Muntz (who also exhibited in 1893 at the World's Columbian Exposition) and F.M. McGillivray Knowles. He also praised the show's conservatism. The St. Louis Republic, in 1904, called it a ‚Äúvery credible display‚Äù. It wrote that the hanging was effective and in good taste and added, ‚Äúit has been said of the collection that no better work was shown for its size by any other country‚Äù. It also praised the fact that there were quite a few distinctively Canadian subjects. The Dominion government had left the selection of paintings entirely in the hands of the Royal Canadian Academy (RCA), which upheld traditional values and academic training in art. The Academy chose works from the annual RCA show that year which had an unusually good selection, artists having been encouraged to put their best, not only their latest works, in the show. Relative newcomers were included, such as Mary E. Wrinch who showed a case of miniature paintings on ivory, among established artists. Robert Harris. Oil on canvas. The installation in St. Louis was done by distinguished Academicians, Robert Harris, the Academy President; long-term member, E. Wyly Grier; and seventy-year-old F. M. Bell- Smith, the Academy Secretary. At the Fair, they were met with surprises, among them the news that they had to decorate and furnish the four Canadian galleries, line and paint the walls which were covered with burlap and brocaded cloth, and paint a frieze at the top. The walls, as in the international and British sections, were coloured a strong red with light grey, white and gold in the frieze. In the handbook of the exhibition, three artists were singled out for illustration: Harris (Countess of Minto), Homer Watson (The Flood Gate) and F. M. McGillivray Knowles (Landing the Catch). Knowles's painting was said to form a delightful colour harmony and Watson was described as a dramatic, colourful, vigorous painter. Taken as a whole, the exhibit reflected credit on such a young country, one critic wrote. A number of artists received awards from the exposition. The Commemorative Diploma and Gold Medal of Honour for Distinguished Service in Art was given to Harris; silver medals were given William Brymner, Florence Carlyle, Edmond Dyonnet, and A. Curtis Williamson, and bronze medals to F. S. Challener, Maurice Cullen, Clarence Gagnon, John Hammond, William Hope, F.M. McGillivray Knowles, Laura Muntz, G.A. Reid, Sydney Strickland Tully, and Homer Watson. In Harris's report on the exhibition to the Royal Canadian Academy, he said the facts spoke for themselves: at Chicago in 1893, five medals were given Canadian artists; at St. Louis, 15 were awarded. Harris's correspondence with Halsey C. Ives, Chief of the Art Exhibition, can be found in the St. Louis Art Museum Archives, St. Louis World's Fair Correspondence. His letters home about the Fair are in the Robert Harris collection in the Confederation Centre Art Gallery, Charlottetown. In 2020, the Art Gallery of Ontario exhibited Mary E.

It connects All Hallows-by-the-Tower, Byward Street, with St Olave's Church, Hart Street. The street is named after an Old English expression meaning \\"full of chaff\\", which was derived from the nearby corn market in Fenchurch Street. Samuel Pepys lived there and is buried in St Olave's Church at the junction with Hart Street. A bust of Pepys, created by Karin Jonzen, sits in the public garden at the south end of the street.  Etymology  The term 'seething' originated from the Old English word sife√∞a that meant bran, chaff, or siftings. The street was named prior to the thirteenth century, when the lane was a narrow path, and grain was threshed there. History In the 14th century, the street contained several houses owned by the Lords Grey of Codnor, with records suggesting ownership dating back at least a century. The Knollys Inn, on the west site of Seething Lane, was established in 1370 when Sir Robert Knollys purchased the estate from Thomas de Brandon.. Sir Francis Walsingham lived on Seething Lane from 1580 until his death ten years later. Frances Seymour, Duchess of Somerset was born at the house in 1599. The Navy Office building here was constructed in 1656. Samuel Pepys moved into a house on the lane in 1660 when he became Clerk of the Acts of the Navy. The office was destroyed by fire in 1673 and rebuilt over the following two years, designed by Sir Christopher Wren. It was demolished in 1788. Catherine Court, also by Wren, was a combined office and residential building on the east side of Seething Lane constructed between 1720 and 1725. It supported two large doorways flanked by four large Roman Doric columns. The property was demolished in 1913 and replaced with offices for the Port of London Authority.. Samuel Pepys Seething Lane was Samuel Pepys's home when he became the Navy Board's Clerk of the Acts, and is mentioned in his diaries as the site of an erotic encounter with a Mrs Daniels, after which he bought her eight pairs of gloves at a nearby milliner's shop. He is buried in St Olave's Church which is at the north- western end of the street at its junction with Hart Street. A bust of Pepys, created by Karin Jonzen, sits in the public garden at the south end of the street.

The installment was first discussed at a Television Critics Association press tour by director Michael Kirk and Frontline executive producer Raney Aronson-Rath on July 28, 2020, and was later formally announced on August 7. A three-minute trailer was released on the same day of its announcement. Kirk explained that he approached the film seeking a new way of telling the stories of President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden, as they are \\"two people who have been in the public eye for a half century\\". Due to the COVID-19 pandemic afflicting the United States during the 2020 election season, the film's production team could not fully conduct face-to-face interviews as done in previous installments of The Choice. Kirk stated that the team had to use the videotelephony software program Zoom for most of their interviews, stating that \\"I‚Äôm used to interviewing people for hours at a time. Doing that over Zoom is a challenge in its own.\\" At the same time, Kirk considers The Choice 2020 to be the \\"most important and essential\\" out of the five installments he has made so far due to the nation's deep political divide, along with the pandemic, a weakened economy, and renewed grievances against systemic racism. As the film will air during what Rath described as a \\"perilous time\\" for the United States, Frontline decided to release some of its interviews in advance of the film's premiere as part of the program's ongoing Transparency Project, beginning on September 14 with Mary Trump's interview.

The 308th episode overall of the series, it premiered on Comedy Central in the United States on September 30, 2020, while also being simulcast for the first time on MTV and MTV2. The episode is a stand-alone special, and is not considered to be the premiere of the 24th season, which has yet to be announced. It is the first hour-long episode and the first special episode of South Park in the show's history. After airing, it was released on the South Park website for free, as well as on the Comedy Central app and website with TV Everywhere authentication, and was released on HBO Max in the United States 24 hours after the premiere. It is the first new South Park episode released on HBO Max after the service obtained the rights for the show from ViacomCBS, ending the Hulu second window. The special satirizes aspects of the United States' COVID-19 response, police brutality, and racial unrest, including mental health, improper mask- wearing, education, sinophobia and divestment from police. Plot Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, fourth grader Butters Stotch is upset that his parents will not allow him to visit Build-A-Bear. His father, Stephen Stotch, is criticizing improper wearing of protective masks, derisively calling them \\"chin diapers\\", when he is distracted by a crowd assembling for a live show staged by Randy Marsh, who announces a \\"pandemic special\\" on marijuana sold by his Tegridy Farms. Randy's wife, Sharon, berates him for seeking to profit from the pandemic. Meanwhile, Eric Cartman sings ecstatically about social distancing, as he can stay at home and avoid online school lessons by faking connection problems with Zoom classes. His joy turns to fury when his mother, Liane Cartman, tells him that school could soon reopen. At Tegridy Farms, Sharon informs Randy that her brother, Jimbo Kern, has COVID, but Randy insists Jimbo is sick because he is a \\"fat alcoholic\\". Randy learns from the TV news that a bat in Wuhan, China started the pandemic, prompting a flashback to a past visit to China, in which he cavorted with Mickey Mouse, during which they both had sexual intercourse with a bat. Realizing they are responsible for the virus, Randy then calls Mickey Mouse and wanders around South Park, guiltily observing the negative impacts of the virus. Cartman visits Kyle Broflovski to complain about the prospect of having to return to school. The South Park Elementary school board convenes a Zoom meeting led by Mr. Mackey. The meeting quickly devolves into a shouting match of obscene insults, prompting Mr. Mackey to use a mute button. The meeting decides that South Park Elementary will reopen, however it will be run by the now defunct police force, which had lost most of its funding because of police violence. Back at Tegridy Farms, Randy tries to block Sharon, Shelly Marsh and Stan Marsh from watching the news, only to learn the virus actually originated from a pangolin. Randy has another flashback, recalling he had sexual intercourse with the same pangolin in China as well, which created the virus. As the local school reopens, the police officers find they have no idea how to teach when Cartman is suddenly dragged in and handcuffed to a chair. He tries to escape and attacks Kyle who then fights back, prompting police to open fire and shoot Token Black. The pangolin from Wuhan is brought to the United States for study in the hope of developing a vaccine. Fearing his zoophilia will be exposed, Randy steals the pangolin. Mickey Mouse threatens to kill Randy and send his DNA samples to scientists to create a vaccine. Randy convinces Mickey to give him more time by promising to find a cure. That night, Randy enters Jimbo's hospital ward and gives him a marijuana joint mixed with Randy's semen. The following day, Sharon informs Randy that Jimbo has recovered. Randy sets about augmenting his Pandemic Special marijuana with his semen but is interrupted when Sharon summons him to observe that Jimbo has grown a mustache identical to Randy's. The local hospital becomes packed with male and female patients afflicted by the same type of mustache. Dr. Anthony Fauci appears on television, telling people to wear masks over the area where their mustaches are, while the news advises people to stay home and relax with some Pandemic Special. The police claim Token was hospitalized because of coronavirus and the entire school is placed under quarantine, which becomes more like a prison under the officers' watch. Butters becomes increasingly upset he may never get to visit Build-A-Bear, while Stan starts to suffer a nervous breakdown. In the White House, President Garrison receives a call from Stan, who tells him that one of the students is really sick, but Garrison refuses to do anything about the virus because Mexicans and other ethnic minorities have a higher fatality rate than whites. Stan promises to take Butters to Build-A-Bear and convinces the students to break out of the school. Protests, rioting and looting erupt in South Park, enabling police to regain their funding and munitions to quell the civil unrest. Kenny McCormick is among those killed by the police. The boys break into Build-A-Bear but Stan is unable to successfully operate the equipment. Police are about to open fire on the boys, when Randy intervenes and hands over the pangolin. Cartman grabs the pangolin, intending to kill it, but changes his mind when Stan makes a passionate speech. Cartman gives the pangolin to a scientist, only for President Garrison to suddenly appear and kill both it and the scientist with a flamethrower. He then reminds people to vote in the upcoming presidential election while the police, Randy, and the boys just stand by flabbergasted. In the aftermath, wildfires have broken out and South Park is placed under lockdown for the unforeseeable future. Randy is about to confess his actions to Sharon when he notices that she too has a mustache. This changes Randy's mind and he decides to run a few more specials.  Reception  =Critical reception= Jesse Schedeen for IGN gave the episode a 5 out of 10, writing, \\"There's no doubt that some new South Park is better than no South Park at all. Unfortunately, the series' first experiment with a longer, standalone format doesn't really pay off. \\"The Pandemic Special\\" has moments of comedic brilliance but is brought down by a messy plot that struggles to put a fresh spin on the reality of life in 2020.\\" Stephanie Williams for The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+, stating, \\"While things were far from normal for the residents of South Park in this hour-long special, the show stays true to form, offering a surprising source of consistency. The world is in complete chaos, which couldn‚Äôt be any more on-brand for South Park.\\" =Ratings= The episode drew 2.3 million viewers on Comedy Central and a total of 4.05 million viewers overall including the simulcast on MTV and MTV2, making it the highest-rated South Park episode in seven years. The episode was the number one rated cable broadcast on the evening of September 30, 2020.

Mount Royal College Calendar, 1971-1972 (Calgary, 1971): p. 213. He began his undergraduate studies with a focus on Engineering, but shifted mid-course to major in Philosophy. Two of his philosophy mentors at University of Wisconsin were Julius R. Weinberg (Medieval philosophy and Logic), and E. F. Kalin (Aesthetics and Existentialism).Julius Rudolph Weinberg (September 3, 1908 ‚Äì January 17, 1971) and E. F. Kalin were both American philosophers and university professors. = Graduate Studies = After graduating from University of Wisconsin ‚Äì Madison, Weir relocated to San Francisco and conducted two years of self-study in architecture and Chinese culture. In preparation for pursuing a Master's Degree, Weir took the Graduate Record Exam (GRE) and scored in the 97th percentile. He applied and was accepted to the Master's program in Interdisciplinary Studies at San Francisco State College. While attending San Francisco State, Weir was a graduate teaching assistant and had the rare opportunity to develop and teach courses in the Humanities department. It was there that he created and introduced several courses such as \\"An Inquiry on the History of the Book of Kells,\\" and \\"Job and Faust: Two Faces of Evil.\\" Weir had the opportunity to study philosophy under the guidance of Jacob Needleman. His Humanities under- professor was Rabbi Alvin Fine (1917‚Äì1999), and his academic advisor was Dr. Kai-yu Hsu (1922‚Äì1982). Amidst the rioting of 1969, San Francisco State had to be shut down, however, according to Weir‚Äôs own reports, he was picked to graduate in spite of the shutdown ‚Äì in order to send the message that even in times of chaos education must prevail. He attended San Francisco State from 1965 to 1969 and earned both a Master's of Arts (M.A.) Degree and a lifetime California Teaching credential. Additionally, he received a Chinese Scroll degree from Kai-Yu Hsu which was a symbol of Taoist competency to teach. = Extracurricular and Post-Graduate Studies = During the late 1970s ‚Äì approximately from 1976 to 1979 ‚Äì Weir stepped back from teaching. During this time, he studied Vajrayana Buddhism with Karma Thinly Rinpoche (a master of Tibetan Buddhism), Theravada Buddhism with Julius Weinberg, and he also studied other mystic and esoteric traditions. Around this same time period, Weir had plans to resume his studies and work with Dr. Kai‚Äìyu Hsu in the San Francisco Bay area but Kai-yu's tragic death in January 1982 due to a landslide in Tiburon prevented this from being realized.Belcher, Jerry (January 6, 1982). \\"New Slides Engulf a Dozen Homes: Ben Lomond, Sausalito Hit; Death Toll 22\\".

In the spring of 1970, he was recruited by Mount Royal College to design, develop, and teach a special interdisciplinary curriculum which would come to be known as ‚ÄòGeneral Education: An Interdisciplinary Approach to the Study of Man‚Äô.Mount Royal College. Mount Royal College Calendar, 1970‚Äì1971 (Calgary, 1970): p. 47. Weir created a sixteen-part curriculum over the course of five years, and taught nine of these courses himself. These courses included Symbols and Myth courses amongst others. A guest speaker in his World Mythology course was Hansens Bear Paw of the Siksika Nation. Weir opened his courses to Indigenous Canadians and was instrumental in educating the first Indigenous Canadians to receive degrees at Mount Royal College: Mavis Running Rabbit and her husband Floyd Running Rabbit ‚Äì grandson of Running Rabbit. While at Mount Royal, Weir achieved tenure. After six years at the school (1971-1976), Weir and his family decided to return to the United States relocating to Los Angeles.Weir‚Äôs name appears in the Mount Royal College Academic Calendars starting in 1970‚Äì1971 and ending in 1975‚Äì1976. = Bookseller (1976‚Äì1980) = After leaving his position at Mount Royal College in 1976, Weir took a break from teaching and became a bookseller. He established the bookstore Bodhisattva Books in conjunction with the College of Oriental Studies (in Los Angeles). Later he purchased Partridge Books (in Hollywood, Los Angeles) in approximately 1978 and operated it until about 1980 when he began lecturing at the Philosophical Research Library.Partridge Books was located adjacent to the famous Hollywood bookstore, Pickwick Books (or Pickwick Bookshop). In this new role ‚Äì as bookseller ‚Äì Weir was in regular contact with authors from the Golden Age of Science Fiction ‚Äì including, Theodore Sturgeon and A. E. van Vogt ‚Äì and the unique Los Angeles creative milieu of the era. = Independent Educator (1980‚Äì2018) = In 1980, encouraged by Theodore Sturgeon to continue his teaching, Weir began lecturing in a number of venues across the Los Angeles metro area, including: The Philosophical Research Society, Whirling Rainbow,Whirling Rainbow was located at 2029 Hyperion Ave, Los Angeles, California and served as Weir‚Äôs residence and presentation venue for a number of years during the 1980s and early 1990s. It also housed a library which, in 1985, contained more than 30,000 volumes, and served as a resource to support Weir‚Äôs work and complement his presentations. Bruchion Center for Art and Gnosis,According to an undated course catalogue for activities at Bruchion, the organization was originally founded in Malibu, California in 1983 by Liv and Jan Saether, and at the time of the catalogue was currently located at 3264 Motor Avenue, Los Angeles, California (https://sites.google.com/site/bruchion/documents/Bruchion_katalog.pdf). the Phoenix Bookstore (Santa Monica), the Bodhi Tree Bookstore (West Hollywood),Bodhi Tree Bookstore was located at 8585 Melrose Avenue, West Hollywood, California. According to conversations between the editor and one of the co-founders and former owners of Bodhi Tree, Weir delivered his lectures at the Bodhi Tree Bookstore Meeting Room which was located adjacent to the bookstore. Historical details about the Bodhi Tree Bookstore were outlined in an article in the Los Angeles Times on December 30, 2011 ‚Äì https://www.latimes.com/local/la-xpm-2011-dec-30-la-me- bodhi-20111231-story.html. among others. Weir lectured at the Philosophical Research Society from 1980‚Äì1990 while Manly P. Hall was still involved in the organization. He would lecture off and on at Whirling Rainbow from approximately 1983‚Äì1996. With the death of his daughter Sara in 1993, Weir stopped teaching for a period of time. Then in 1994, he started teaching again with four lectures called Our New Aion in commemoration of the passing of his daughter Sara, in the Bodhi Tree Bookstore Meeting Room. This was the beginning of Weir‚Äôs association with the Bodhi Tree Bookstore. Starting in January 1996, Weir taught every Saturday in the Bodhi Tree Bookstore Meeting Room until it closed in 2011, and the classes were entirely open to the public. During these years, Weir taught a number of different programs, including: Ecumene (1996‚Äì1997, a 2-year course that met weekly); The Learning Civilization (1998‚Äì2007, a 2‚Äìyear course ‚Äì presented in 2‚Äìyear cycles ‚Äì that met weekly); Jesus in Alexandria & Mary Magdalene (January‚ÄìMarch 2008, 13 week course); Hermetic America (April‚ÄìJune 2008, 13 week course); Hermetic America Future (July‚ÄìSeptember 2008, 13 week course); Mary Magdalene & Jesus' Great Way: Shared Presence Transforms of Civilization and Species (October‚ÄìDecember 2008, 13 week course); Homo Sapiens Stellaris: Star Wisdom Man (January‚ÄìMarch 2009, 13 week course); Shared Presence (April‚ÄìJune 2009, 13 week course); Quintessential Dimensions of Consciousness: An Ecology of Four Dimensions in Complementarity in Spacetime (July‚ÄìSeptember 2009, 13 week course); Parayana: The Way Beyond (October‚ÄìDecember 2009); Our Star Wisdom Humanity (2010, a 1‚Äìyear course that met weekly); and Science Fiction Vision (2011, a 1‚Äìyear course that met weekly). After the Bodhi Tree Bookstore closed in 2011, Weir continued to teach every Saturday at a private office in Beverly Hills until the end of 2015 (these presentations were by invitation only and not open to the general public). Weir's research continued after 2016, focusing on the origins and development of America by artistic and scientific persons such as Benjamin Franklin, and the influence of other cultures such as indigenous peoples of the Americas. During the years 1987‚Äì1995 Weir received financial support from Laurance S. Rockefeller to conduct his research and work.Laurance S. Rockefeller, \\"Gifts ‚Äì Weir, Roger,\\" Laurance S. Rockefeller General Files, 1992‚Äì1996, RG 43 (Sleepy Hollow, New York: Rockefeller Archive Center).

His coursework encompassed Chinese, Greek, Egyptian, and other ancient world cultures. He also traced the development of the Egyptian, European, and early American Hermetic tradition, the Taoist tradition, and others, including early Christianity and its development to the present. Weir delivered presentations on a variety of interweaving subject matter that incorporated philosophy, art, history, science, mythology, symbols, and others on a weekly basis, sometimes even three times a week, for nearly four decades, 1980‚Äì2016. To aid in creating these works, he gradually developed a vast research library ‚Äì in part through the direct patronage of Laurance S. Rockefeller and later Spencer Compton, 7th Marquess of Northampton ‚Äì that today comprises approximately 80,000+ volumes.  Legacy  The Shared Presence Foundation, founded in 2010, is driven to preserve and publicly disseminate Roger Weir's teachings and coursework.

His best known work is Die Frauenfrage vom Standpunkte der Natur, der Geschichte und der Offenbarung (), a treatise on the woman question published in 1893.  Early life  R√∂sler was born in G√≥ra and died in Wroc≈Çaw.  Writing  Augustin R√∂sler was the first German Catholic to discuss the woman question from a Catholic viewpoint. Among his works is a monograph on the writing of Prudentius. His Die Frauenfrage vom Standpunkte der Natur, der Geschichte und der Offenbarung, translated into French as La Question F√©ministe examin√©e au point de vue de la Nature, de l'Histoire et de la R√©v√©lation (The Woman Question, Considered from the Standpoint of Nature, History, and Revelation) was widely reviewed at the time. The work was a reply to August Bebel's book Die Frau und der Sozialismus. Whereas Bebel demands that women and men be treated as equal, R√∂sler denied that both genders are equal, and stressed that a woman's freedom lies in the ability to fulfill her role as a mother. In 1899, Franz Hitze invited R√∂sler to discuss the woman question at a conference titled Praktisch-Sozialer Kursus in Strasbourg. He decided to write Wahre und Falsche \\"Frauen-Emanzipation,\\" which translates to True and False Emancipation of Women, which contained the same content as the speech, but with a more detailed discussion of the topics of women at medical university courses and women's suffrage. In Wahre und Falsche \\"Frauen- Emanzipation\\", R√∂sler explains his ideas of what rights women should or should not be given. The book consists of an introduction, followed by three main chapters that each focus on distinct aspects of a woman's life, and a conclusion. While explaining the problems of the Frauenfrage, also known as the woman question, R√∂sler bases his arguments on quotes from the Bible, metaphors or direct quotes from women or men of his time. R√∂sler was seen as revolutionary, because he was one of the first Catholics to criticize that women and men are not treated in a balanced way. More specifically, R√∂sler, on the one hand, demands that women deserve more rights than they have in certain fields, but on the other hand he argues that their rights should only be enough to help with her task as a mother and wife.  Reception  R√∂sler's call for more rights for women, althoug limited, were seen as too liberal by many bishops of the time. The author's efforts to speak to other men, with the aim to free up some space for women in order to allow a more liberal development, was seen as revolutionary. Nevertheless, his traditional view on gender differences and the idea of fixating women to the task of being a loving and gentle mother and wife was criticized by many leading women of the Catholic women's movement, including Hedwig Dransfeld and .

The action plan was launched in 2008 with 8 sub-missions. The plan aims at fulfilling India's developmental objectives with focus on reducing emission intensity of its economy. The plan will rely on the support from the developed countries with the prime focus of keeping its carbon emissions below the developed economies at any point of time. The 8 missions under NAPCC are as follows:- * National Solar Mission. * National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency. * National Mission on Sustainable Habitat. * National Water Mission. * National Mission for Sustaining Himalayan Ecosystem. * Green India Mission. *National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture. * National Mission on Strategic Knowledge for Climate Change. National Solar Mission National Solar Mission was launched as Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission in 2010. It has been revised two times since then. The Mission was launched with a target of producing 20,000 Megawatts of solar power in three phases of (2010-2013); (2013-2017); and (2017-2022). In 2015 Budget speech, a revised target of 100,000 Megawatts was fixed, which is to be achieved till 2022. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy has also set up a target of producing 40 Gigawatts of solar power by 'Rooftop Solar Power Projects' while the rest 60 Gigawatts is planned to be obtained from large and medium scale grid connected solar power projects. The Ministry will provide capital subsidy in the form of viability gap funding to the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI). The Government of India also planned to leverage the funding from bilateral donors like Green Climate Fund under United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), as the solar power production could reduce greenhouse gas emissions from coal based power plants. The target of 100 GW solar energy capacity generation was part of production of 175 GW of energy through renewable sources by 2022. In 2019, speaking at the United Nations Secretary General's Climate Action Summit, Prime Minister, Narendra Modi announced the target of 175 GW renewable energy production to be extended beyond its ceiling to reach an ambitious target of 450 GW till 2022. To fulfill the targets set up under the mission, the Government launched several schemes in order to promote solar power and reduce dependency on the traditional power sources. One such scheme called Kisan Urja Suraksha Evam Uthhan Mahabhiyan (KUSUM) was approved by Cabinet Committee on Economic affairs in 2019. The program aims for installation of off-grid solar pumps in rural areas and reducing dependence on grid in grid connected areas. The Domestic Content Requirement provision for the procurement of component used in the solar power projects has remained a disputed step for foreign players who have often complained of discrimination against their manufacturers. National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency (NMEEE) India has fifth lowest energy efficiency in the world. Further, the GDP to energy consumption ratio is also poor. The mission thus plans sustainable economic growth along with reduction in energy and carbon intensity of the economy. The Mission has four components:- *Perform Achieve and Trade. *Energy Efficiency Financing Platform. *Market Transformation For Energy Efficiency (MTEE). *Framework For Energy Efficiency Economic Development. The Perform; Achieve and Trade component of the mission assigns targets to the energy intensive industries for reducing energy intensity and also allots them energy saving certificates (Escerts), which are tradable amongst the candidates which either breached their targets or remained unsuccessful in achieving it. The Energy Efficiency Financing Platform on the other hand boosts the confidence of the financial institutions and investors to support energy efficiency initiatives. The other two components promote the use and adoption of energy efficient equipment‚Äôs as well promote energy efficiency initiatives by hedging against investment risks. Under the Market Transformation For Energy Efficiency component, the Government launched Bachat Lamp Yojna to replace the incandescent lamps with the CFL bulbs. In the scheme which was running since 2009 where the CFL were distributed at reduced prices, Government was able to recover the cost through sale of Certified Emmission reduction certificate. The \\"Bachat Lamp Yojna\\" was later replaced by \\"Unnat Jyoti Affordable LED for All\\" (UJALA) scheme in 2015, which LED bulbs were distributed to replace the comparatively more efficient CFL bulbs. The UJALA scheme is implemented by Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL); which is a joint venture of Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) under power ministry. Under the same component of MTEE, the Government also launched \\"Super Efficient Equipment Program\\", which was supported by the World Bank. The scheme aimed at transfer of the assistance from the World Bank to the energy equipment manufacturers to enable them produce the products that consume less electricity. The \\"Super Efficient Equipment Program\\" is implemented by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency. In order to hedge the financial institutions providing loans for the energy efficiency projects against credit risks, the Bureau of Energy Efficiency has also institutionalised two funds namely \\"Partial Risk Gaurantee Fund for Energy Efficiency\\" and \\"Venture Capital Fund for Energy Efficiency\\". Both these funds have been launched under \\"Framework for Energy Efficient Economic Development\\" component of the NMEEE. National Mission on Sustainable Habitat The transport sector along with urban buildings are major consumers of energy in India apart from electricity production sector. The National Mission on Sustainable Habitat is an umbrella programme to reduce the energy consumption and hence the risk of climate change due to the urban settlement pattern. The mission envisages a shift to Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC) in the design of new commercial buildings as well as solid and liquid waste management. The mission also covers under its ambit, the water resource management as well as drinking water management. One of the most important plan under the mission is to pave the way for a shift to public transport. The research and development is an important component of the mission to promote the waste water use and sewage utilisation along with waste management. National Water Mission National Water Mission is a comprehensive programme for equitable distribution of water across the country as well as for enhancing the capacity building process for the management of over exploited blocs. It is focused upon tackling the issues related to water availability and pollution which is owed to the global warming and climate change. The mission promotes research and development as well as timely review of National Water Policy is also proposed. The mission while promoting the traditional water conservation system, also promotes the expeditious implementation of the multipurpose water projects. It has a target of increasing water use efficiency by 20%. The convergence of various water conservation schemes for a better outcome and implementation of water resource management prpgram via the MNREGA route with participation of the elected representatives of the over exploited water blocs is central theme of the mission. The program has focus on decentralised approach which is reflected in its plan of \\"basin level\\" integrated water resource management and sensitization of the urban local youths. The National Water Mission also have an identified goal of putting comprehensive water resource database in public domain. The onus of implementation lies on Ministry of Jal Shakti. National Mission for Sustainable Himalayan Ecosystem The Himalayas are one of the most important ecosystem of India with millions of people depending upon it. The adverse impact of climate change has remained detrimental to the Himalayan Ecosystem which provides a variety of Ecosystem Services. To ensure the provisions from the Himalayas, the mission has a multi-pronged approach to understand the impact of climate change on the Himalayan Ecosystem for the Sustainable Development of other part of country. The Ministry of Science and Technology is the nodal Ministry for its implementation but the collaboration of \\"Himalayan states\\" as well as Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change is instrumentation in the success of the Mission. One of the primary objective of the mission is to assess the health of Himalayan Ecosystem, for which the scheme was released with an outlay of Rs.550 Crores during the 12th \\"Five Years Plan\\" period. Green India Mission The Green India Mission is aimed at protecting, restoring and enhancing India's green cover in response to the climate change. The mission has a cumulative target of increasing forest cover on 5 million hectares of land while improving the forest cover on additional 5 hectares. The mission also has a target of providing livelihood to 3 million people through the forest based activities and enhancing the provisioning capacity of the Indian forests along with their carbon sequestration capacity. The scheme was proposed for 10 years with an outlay of 60,000 crores but it has remained grossly underfunded. Due to investment crunch, the scheme which was planned to be launched in 2012 was delayed for its final launch in 2015. The scheme also has an important goal of fulfilling India's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) target of sequestrating 2.5 Billion tonnes of \\"Carbon emissions\\" by 2020-30, which it submitted to UNFCCC. National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture includes multiple programmes for the sustainable growth of agriculture sector. It includes interventions like Soil Health Card Scheme, Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana, Mission organic value chain development for North-East region, Rainfed Aread Development program, National Bamboo Mission and Sub Mission on Agro-Forestry. These programs along with others like \\"Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana\\" are aiming to promote judicious use of natural resources. The NMSA has four components, namely \\"Rainfed Area Development Program\\", \\"On Farm Water Management Program\\", \\"Soil Health Management Program\\" and \\"Climate Change and Sustainable Agriculture Monitoring, Modeling and Networking Program\\". Under NMSA, the Cabinet Committee on Economic affairs released the restructured \\"National Bamboo Mission\\" in 2018 to last till the end of 14th Five Year Plan period. The Mission is a centrally sponsored scheme in which the funding pattern for General states is in 60:40 ratio with the central government while for North- East and hilly areas it is 90:10. The Union Territories will get 100% funding from the centre. The goal of the scheme is to promote Bamboo cultivation on non-forest government land and on the private lands of farmers in the states where it has social, commercial and economic importance. Earlier in 2017, to further its aim of market development and commercial cultivation of Bamboo for the livelihood improvement of the tribals and farmers, the government had amended the Indian Forest Act, 1927, in order to remove the Bamboo plant from the category of trees to enable its cultivation and felling without permit in non-forest areas. National Mission on Strategic Knowledge for Climate Change This sub-mission involves formation of knowledge networks among the existing knowledge institutions involved in research and development relating to climate science and facilitating data sharing and exchange through a suitable policy framework and institutional support.

Most of the building was constructed in 1500: a three-storey, five-bay range facing onto the east side Goodramgate, and a single-storey hall behind its northern part. It probably originated as the house of a wealthy citizen, with a shop at the front. Early in the 1600s, a further two-storey building was constructed south of the single-storey range about six feet away from it, and the gap between the two was closed up soon after. A passageway ran back-to-front through the central part of the building. By 1800, the front of the building had been plastered over, and shop windows had been installed in the ground floor, with leaded lights in the windows above. These were replaced by sash windows by the end of the century. Both 41 and 43 Goodramgate were refronted in brick during the 1800s. The property was bought by Cuthbert Morrell in the 1920s, and in 1929, Walter Brierley and Harvey Rutherford restored the building. They removed the external plaster to reveal the timber framing, all internal partitions erected over the past few centuries were removed, and the passageway was closed off. The building now forms three properties. 41 Goodramgate is of four stories, it attic having been converted into an extra floor, while 43 Goodramgate is the same height but of only three stories, its floor heights having been altered. 45 Goodramgate is the largest property, incorporating both the buildings to the rear. It is the only one to retain its jettied front. Although there are windows in the roof, added in 1929, it remains of three stories, the roof windows providing extra illumination for the second floor. The timber framing inside is largely intact, although heavily restored. Few other original fixtures remain although there is a cornice and simple fireplace on the first floor. 45 Goodramgate was listed in 1954, as an example of a rare building type, with few examples known nationally, while 41 and 43 Goodramgate were added to the listing in 1971. In 1957, 45 Goodramgate was donated to the York Civic Trust, who lease it out for use as a restaurant. 41 and 43 Goodramgate are a separate cafe and shop.

Biography He was born in Finsbury, London, and taught himself to play piano and harmonium as a child. He spent some time in South Africa before returning to England, where at one time he was the manager of the Canterbury Music Hall on Westminster Bridge Road. He started to write songs for music hall performers, and was one of the first to write both words and music - previously words had usually been written to fit existing tunes. His first success came with \\"The Organ Grinder\\", sung by George Leybourne and by Arthur Lloyd; and was soon followed by \\"Poor Old Uncle Sam\\", a Civil War song successfully performed by Scottish singer Tom MacLagan, and \\"The German Band\\", sung by Lloyd. He developed a partnership with lion comique George Leybourne, with Hunt regularly visiting Leybourne's house and playing tunes on the harmonium until Leybourne, lying in bed upstairs, shouted out that he liked one of the tunes. \\"Jingo\\", The Musical Herald, 1 April 1904, p.101 Hunt wrote over 50 songs performed by Leybourne, including \\"Awfully Clever\\", \\"Up in a Balloon\\", and \\"Don't Make a Noise Or Else You'll Wake the Baby\\". He also wrote songs for many of the other popular performers of the period, including Alfred Vance, Herbert Campbell, Jenny Hill, Annie Adams, and Fred French. In all, it was estimated that he wrote some 7,000 songs, and it was later said of him that \\"his faculty for rhyming was as strong as his gift of melody.. for long he had no rival\\" as a songwriter. His fellow songwriter Felix McGlennon described Hunt as \\"the originator of the modern comic song for, breaking away from the worn-out methods, he composed new tunes to all the songs he wrote, his melodies being so catchy that many of them have achieved a world-wide popularity.\\" Hunt's most successful and lasting song, G. H. MacDermott's \\"War Song\\", best known for its chorus of \\"We don't want to fight, But by Jingo if we do...\\", was written in 1877 at the time of the Great Eastern Crisis and the threat of all- out war between Russia and Turkey.Dave Russell, Popular Music in England, 1840-1914, Manchester University Press, 1997, , p.147 After initially rejecting the song, MacDermott changed his mind and bought the song from Hunt for five pounds.Richard Anthony Baker, British Music Hall: an illustrated history, Pen & Sword, 2014, , pp.22-26 Some years later, Hunt said: > My breakfast was half an hour late that morning, so I sat down and wrote the > whole chorus. After breakfast I wrote the verses and the melody. The whole > thing was the work of barely four hours. I sent the song to MacDermott > because he seemed to me to have just the voice and style to make It go. Ten > days later he sang it from the stage of the old Pavilion in Piccadilly > Circus. From that moment he was a made man. I didn't do so badly out of the > song, either. Altogether, with fees, royalties, and other charges, I netted > some ¬£750. Not bad for just on four hours' work... \\"By Jingo, If We Do: > Story of a Famous Song\\", The Horsham Times, Victoria, 28 March 1902, p.3 The popularity of the song had an immediate and direct effect on national policy, catching the national mood of the moment; its words were quoted in the House of Commons, and the word \\"jingoism\\" entered the vocabulary. Hunt also wrote \\"Charlie Dilke Upset the Milk\\", sung in 1885 by Fred Gilbert and satirising Sir Charles Dilke, a Liberal politician involved in a scandalous divorce case. Hunt wrote music for ballets and the theatre, including the 1886 burlesque play Monte Cristo Jr..

History The memorial chapel at King's Stag was built in 1914 at the expense of the Right Rev. Huyshe Yeatman-Biggs, the Bishop of Worcester, in memory of his wife, Lady Barbara Yeatman-Biggs, who died in 1909. Prior to its construction, a small mission room had served the hamlet. At the time, the churchyards at both Stock Gaylard and Lydlinch were full, and the Bishop also believed a chapel would benefit parishioners when journeying to a parish church was difficult, such as in bad weather. The site of the chapel, approximately a quarter of an acre, was gifted by the Bishop's son, Mr. Lewis Yeatman. Its position spanned two ecclesiastical parishes, with the chapel and part of the burial ground belonging to that of Stock Gaylard, while the rest of the ground was based in Lydlinch. The foundation stone was laid by Lady Octavia Legge, the sister of Lady Yeatman-Biggs, on 1 August 1914. The chapel was built by Mr. R. G. Spiller of Sherborne. The chapel's bell was gifted by Miss E. F. E. Yeatman. Architecture The chapel is approximately 40 feet in length and 18 feet wide. It is built of brick, with cement rendering and half-timbered framing using oak, and a tiled roof. The porch is built of Bath stone. The west side of the chapel has a small vestry and adjoining store room which was designed for the bier, coal and other stores.

He is considered one of the world's foremost authorities on viruses transmitted by mosquitoes, including Dengue, Japanese encephalitis, chikungunya and Zika. He was one of the first researchers to identify the phenomenon known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), where the antibodies generated from a first dengue infection can sometimes worsen the symptoms from a second infection. A former president of the global health organization American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH), he also co-founded the Children's Vaccine Initiative, and founded the Pediatric Dengue Vaccine Initiative. He has published hundreds of papers and book chapters about viruses and diseases.  Early life and education  Scott Halstead was born in 1930 in Lucknow, India to Gordon P. and Helen Halstead, Methodist missionaries based in Lucknow. In 1936, they moved to White Plains, NY, where he attended White Plains High School. He graduated from Yale University with a BA in sociology in 1951 and from Columbia University with a MD in 1955. Career =Early research= In 1957, Halstead was drafted by the U.S. Army Medical Corps. He was assigned to the Department of Virus and Rickettsial Diseases (DVRD) in Sagamihara, Japan, and began studying mosquito-borne viruses. He was then transferred to work as a virologist at the Department of Virus Diseases at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), in Washington, D.C. =Dengue research= From 1961 to 1965, Halstead served as the director of the United States Army's SEATO infectious disease laboratory in Bangkok, Thailand. During this time, he studied the dengue virus, and published research on the isolation and propagation of dengue virus in tissue culture; secondary infections in children; and dengue infection of infants born to dengue immune mothers. In 1965 Halstead left Bangkok to join the Yale Arbovirus Research Unit, part of the Yale School of Public Health. In a memoir published in 2002, he wrote that he worked at the newly opened Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, where he also worked on his dengue data set at Yale and published white papers that consolidated his research. In 1967 he presented the first paper describing severe dengue hemorrhagic fever as the result of a second infection by one of the other four types of dengue, a phenomenon now known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). This discovery influenced the future development of the dengue vaccine candidates. In 1968, Halstead retired from the Army. From 1968 to 1983, he served as the first chair of the Department of Tropical Medicine and Microbiology at the University of Hawaii School of Medicine, in Honolulu Hawaii. =Public health and vaccine development= In 1983, Halstead joined the Health Sciences Division of the Rockefeller Foundation in New York as associate director, eventually becoming the group's director. During this period he helped found International Clinical Epidemiology Network (INCLEN), a global research and medical-education network designed to strengthen the research capacity of medical schools in the developing world. In 1990, while with the Rockefeller Foundation, Halstead co-founded the Children's Vaccine Initiative, now the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI). In 1991, Halstead was president of global health organization American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH). From 1995 to 1997, he was director of infectious disease research for the U.S. Navy, becoming chief scientist in 1997. In 1999, he began working at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Maryland, and remained a consultant with the U.S. Navy. In 2003, he founded the Pediatric Dengue Vaccine Initiative (PDVI) at the International Vaccine Institute, with $55M from the Gates Foundation. PDVI was founded to promote and fund basic science and applied clinical research to accelerate the development of dengue vaccines. He served as director of research and development from 2003 to 2010. =Dengvaxia controversy= Halstead played an important role during 2015‚Äì19 as a consultant and later as a scientific critic of Sanofi Pasteur‚Äôs Dengvaxia, the first dengue vaccine to be licensed for widespread use in countries where dengue is prevalent. Based on his review and analysis of Sanofi's Phase 3 clinical trial data in 2016, he determined that the vaccine posed a substantial danger of contracting severe dengue to individuals who had no prior history of dengue infection. Dr. Halstead and colleague Dr. Phillip Russell then proposed that the vaccine only be used after antibody testing, to rule out prior dengue exposure and avoid vaccination of sero-negative individuals. Sanofi rebutted their analysis and sold Dengvaxia to the Philippines, where 700,000 school age children were vaccinated. An alarming rate of hospitalizations were found in vaccinated children following a dengue exposure. After an analysis of Phase 3 clinical trial data, Sanofi scientists concluded that Halstead and Russell were correct and that Dengvaxia posed a significant risk for previously uninfected people. More cases were likely after vaccination due to a subsequent dengue infection. The led to the vaccine being banned in the Philippines, and Sanofi and Filipino public health officials were accused of malfeasance in proceeding with an unproven vaccination program. In 2018, Halstead served as an expert witness, testifying in person at Philippines Senate hearings on what became known as the Dengvaxia controversy. =COVID-19= During the global COVID-19 pandemic that started in 2019, Halstead began researching protecting at-risk groups via antibody-based strategies including convalescent plasma and monoclonal antibodies. He published papers about vaccine development and potential risks associated with ADE including vaccine hypersensitivity reactions, to assist with ongoing COVID-19 prevention. Awards and recognition In 2017, Halstead received the Walter Reed Medal from ASTMH.

The episode was directed by Luke Scott and written by Aaron Guzikowski. Plot Ten years ago, the Mithraic spacecraft Heaven was launched carrying a thousand passengers to colonize Kepler-22b. While in a state of suspended animation, they are able to engage in telepathy in virtual reality. Back in the present, Marcus (Travis Fimmel), having awoken from his concussion, finds himself at the ark's crash site with Sue (Niamh Algar) and a handful of other Mithraic survivors. Marcus postulates that Mother is a reprogrammed \\"necromancer\\" android, but de facto Mithraic leader Ambrose (Steve Wall) declines to send soldiers to rescue the children. While discussing Paul's safety with Sue, Marcus recalls his violent youth as an atheist soldier whose partner was killed in action. Almost ambushed by Mother while scavenging for supplies, the survivors hide underground. A Mithraic android (Awissi Lakou) is sent back up to distract Mother and is swiftly destroyed. Back on the plantation, Campion (Winta McGrath) locks Father in a shed and alleges to the other children that Mother has poisoned them. They flee in search of the crash site, but Paul (Felix Jamieson) becomes separated from the rest while searching for his pet mouse. Father escapes from the shed; while refueling their landing craft with biofuel from their crops, he inadvertently discovers that their pits are radioactive and deduces that Campion's siblings may have died of acute radiation syndrome. While Mother searches for Paul, Father tracks down five of the children and convinces Campion of Mother's innocence. Campion is nearly attacked by an unidentified creature; Father comes to his rescue and is wounded in the neck.

The hospital is one of the largest military hospitals in Asia, initially constructed with over 600 beds. Notably, the hospital treats the President of India and the chiefs of the military. In an interview in 2018, Lt. General U.K. Sharma, commandant of Army Hospital (R&R;) said that, \\"We treat SAARC nation‚Äôs armed forces‚Äô patients here too. There is a quota for each country. MEA gives a sanction and payment comes from MEA. Exchange programme with CIS nations for doctors and para medics. There are two missions going to Uzbekistan and one to Egypt. Return visits are MEA-MOD joint decision\\". The first patient simulator in India was acquired by the hospital. The first cervical disc replacement and bi-level cervical disc replacement in Asia was carried out in the hospital's neurosurgery department in 2002 and 2003 respectively. The assisted reproductive technology facility at the hospital undertook 500 test tube pregnancies in 2012 itself. The Army Organ and Retrieval Transplantation Organisation (AORTA), formed in 2006, handles organ donations at RR Hospital. In 2018, an entire unit of the Territorial Army submitted applications pledging their organs. The conversion rate for organ donations at RR Hospital is among the best worldwide.

Biography  Henricus Franciscus von S√∂hsten was born in Colombo on Dutch Ceylon to Henricus Volraad von S√∂hsten and Dorothea Henrietta Diedericks. He was baptised in Wolvendaal Church on 23 September 1792. His father and grandfather had been employees of the Dutch East India Company and Henricus Franciscus was destined to follow in their footsteps. After Ceylon was transferred to the British in 1796, the Von S√∂hsten family ended up on the Coromandel Coast. Under the terms of the Anglo- Dutch Treaty of 1814, Dutch Coromandel was to be restored to Dutch rule, and a commission under the leadership of was installed by the Dutch East Indies government on 28 June 1817 to effect the transfer of the Dutch possessions on the Indian subcontinent. After having secured the transfer of the Dutch possessions in Bengal first, Van Braam arrived on the Coromandel Coast in January 1818 and was handed over the Dutch possessions on 31 March 1818 at Fort Sadras, which after the destruction of Fort Geldria in 1804 became the new capital of Dutch Coromandel. Van Braam installed F. C. Regel as the new governor of Dutch Coromandel, who now went by the title of opperhoofd. Von S√∂hsten's father was installed resident of Palakol by Van Braam and was promoted to resident of Tuticorin on 28 June 1820, where he died in office on 21 January 1824. Henricus Franciscus himself was installed first secretary at Sadras, where he made a favourable impression on opperhoofd F. C. Regel. He was promoted to resident of Jaggernaikpoeram on 1 June 1820. When Regel became severely ill in October 1823, he transferred his duties to an acting council of three men, and stipulated that in the event of his death, Von S√∂hsten was to become the new opperhoofd. Regel died on 27 November 1823, and Von S√∂hsten was swiftly informed of the decision to appoint him as the new head of the colony. By letter of 12 December 1823, Von S√∂hsten initially declined to accept his new position, as he was not sure of the legality of the procedure, since the decision was made without the consent of the superiors in Batavia. Von S√∂hsten was then summoned to Sadras, and accepted the office of opperhoofd on 24 January 1824. Von S√∂hsten did not remain in office for long, as the Dutch conceded to relinquishing all their possessions on the Indian subcontinent in return for control over Bencoolen in the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824. This meant that the Dutch possessions in Coromandel were to become British again. Even though the treaty stipulated that the transfer should take place on 1 March 1825, Von S√∂hsten declined to hand over Sadras to the British due to lack of instruction from Batavia. The instructions eventually arrived on 9 May 1825, and on 1 June 1825, the Dutch flag was lowered for the last time on Fort Sadras, and the possession was officially transferred to the British officer Brooke Cunliffe. Von S√∂hsten remained on the Coromandel Coast and died in Madras on 28 October 1844.  Personal life  Henricus Franciscus married Anna (\\"Nancy\\") Pochont (1791‚Äì1866) from Yanaon in French India, with whom he had six children.

Until September 2020 the tower was named David Hume Tower or DHT. The building contains lecture theatres, teaching spaces, offices, a caf√© and a shop.  Name  The tower was originally named after the Scottish Enlightenment philosopher David Hume, who was an alumnus of the university. In September 2020, in response to the Black Lives Matter movement, the university announced that they would be renaming the tower to 40 George Square. The university stated that Hume's \\"comments on matters of race, though not uncommon at the time, rightly cause distress today.\\"  Background  The tower was built as part of a significant 1960s redevelopment of George Square by the university, which saw the demolition of numerous Georgian terraced houses and tenements to make way for new university buildings. The redevelopments saw years of major opposition from community groups and organisations, such as the Cockburn Association and the Scottish Georgian Society. Other buildings constructed included the university's Main Library and Appleton Tower.  Design and construction  The building was designed for the university's Arts Faculty by the Scottish modernist architect Robert Matthew of Robert Matthew Johnson-Marshall & Partners (RMJM), alongside the structural engineering firm Blyth & Blyth. The tower is , and 14 storeys high. To the rear of the tower there is a row of lecture theatres, which are joined to the tower via a lower ground floor. The lower ground floor, known as the Hub, includes a caf√© and shop surrounding a central atrium. The structure of the tower is made from reinforced concrete with brick infill, and is cladded with slabs of polished black slate and York sandstone. The block of lecture theatres is similarly made of reinforced concrete and clad in York sandstone. The construction took place from 1960 until 1963, and was carried out by the contractor firm Crudens. In 2006 Historic Scotland designated the building as category A listed, the highest category, stating the building is \\"one of the key monuments of Scottish Modernism\\", the architecture is of a \\"very high standard of design and execution\\" and the materials to be of \\"exceptional quality\\"  Renovation  In 2014 the lower ground floor was renovated to create the DHT Hub, including teaching space, a caf√© and a EUSA shop. The renovations cost ¬£15 million and won the RICS Conservation Award, Scottish Design Awards commendation, and a GIA Awards commendation.

Decades after he was killed in action during the war he was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Russian Federation in 2010.  Early life  Passar was born on 30 August 1923 to a Nanai family of fur hunters in Nizhny Katar of the Russian Far East. As a young child he helped his father hunt for furred animals. From this he gained strong marksmanship skills, including the ability to shoot squirrels in the eye so that he could use as much of the fur as possible. He also developed the patience necessary to remain still observing a target in the winter cold. Having started attending school in 1933, he dreamed of going to Leningrad for higher education after graduating.  World War II  Despite traveling 60 kilometers to reach the Troitsk military enlistment office in February 1942 to join the army and demonstrating his sharpshooting skills to the recruiters, he was initially posted as a mortarman on the front. However, he was soon allowed to switch to becoming a sniper and placed in brief sniper training. He went on to participate in the Battle of Stalingrad starting in July 1942, where he became one of the best snipers. By early September 1942 he was credited with taking out 56 enemy combatants, having adopted a daily routine of stalking potential targets in his trench from dawn to dusk. Later that month on 28 September he celebrated his 100th kill, noting the date in his diary. By November he increased his tally to 152 kills, and despite being wounded in battle in December he remained on the front lines. Passar's photo and descriptions of his accomplishments as a sniper were featured in several wartime newspaper issues including Pravda, Komsomolskaya Pravda, and Krasnaya Armiya. After the publicity, the German Army put a bounty of 100,000 marks for his death. In addition to his regular sniper duties he also trained other snipers, three of whom went on to tally over 100 kills each before his death. On 22 January 1943 he was killed in action while taking out machine gun crews he was buried in the mass grave in Gorodishche; his tally at the time of his death 237 enemy soldiers killed. A memorial marker with his name on the gravesite mistakenly labeled him as a Hero of the Soviet Union, even though his nomination for the title in February 1943 was reduced to the Order of the Red Banner. His comrades from the war petitioned for him to receive the title later, but it was never awarded. He was eventually made a Hero of the Russian Federation on 16 February 2010.

Suffragists in Missouri held conventions, lobbied the Missouri General Assembly and challenged the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS). The case that went to SCOTUS in 1874, Minor v. Happersett was not ruled in the suffragists' favor. Instead of challenging the courts fro suffrage, Missouri suffragists continued to lobby for changes in legislation.

It was bounded by the Germama river to the south, which formed the historical boundary between it and Minjar in the south. It presently encompasses the modern woredas of Hagere Mariamna Kesem, Asagirt, and Berehet. History According to religious tradition and hagiographies, the area known as Bulga had historically been inhabited by Christians since Axumite times, where Christian Amhara families had migrated there from the north around the time of the decline of Axum. Amongst these was the family of the widely revered Saint Tekle Haymanot, who was born in the district of Zorare, in Silalish, an ancient name for Bulga in 1215 and where he first launched his first evangelisations. While Silalish seems to have been the name for the southern part of Bulga, Sarmat is thought to have the ancient name of the northern and central parts. Around the time of Tekle Haymanot in the 13th century, the area according to his hagiography had been under the control of Damot and its ruler Motolemi. Soon however it became one firmly under the control of the Christian Kingdom and was appointed regional bishops by Abba Filipos, Echege of Debre Libanos becoming one of the earliest traditional Christian localities of central Ethiopia. The region of Fetegar, (modern Menjarna Shenkora) was bordered by it in the south, although according to Johann Ludwig Krapf, Bulga was considered a part of Fetegar by 1842 After the Islamic invasions led by Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi in the 16th century and the subsequent Oromo migrations that followed Bulga, like the rest of Shewa was invaded and conquered by the Oromo, who settled there as newcomers, forcing its inhabitants to live in gorges and becoming isolated from the rest of the Ethiopian Kingdom, which by then had relocated its base to the Lake Tana region in Gonder. It was not until Meridazmach Amha Iyasus had reconquered Bulga from the Kereyu Oromos in the mid 18th century that it was re- incorporated with the rest of the historical Amhara regions of Shewa along with Merhabete, Angolala, Tegulet and others. By the 20th century, Emperor Haile Selassie had incorporated Bulga with the historical region of Tegulet to create the woreda known as Tegulet ena Bulga , and in 1993, the EPDRF divided it into the Hagere Mariamna Kesem , Asagirt , and Berehet woredas.

There were significant developments in the St. Louis area, though groups and organized activity took place throughout the state of Missouri. An early suffrage group, the Woman Suffrage Association of Missouri, was formed in 1867, attracting the attention of Susan B. Anthony and leading to news items around the state. This group, the first of its kind, lobbied the Missouri General Assembly for women's suffrage and established conventions. In the early 1870s, many women voted or registered to vote as an act of civil disobedience. The suffragist Virginia Minor was one of these women when she tried to register to vote on October 15, 1872. She and her husband, Francis Minor, sued, leading to a Supreme Court case that asserted the Fourteenth Amendment granted women the right to vote. The case, Minor v. Happersett, was decided against the Minors and led suffragists in the country to pursue legislative means to grant women suffrage. Women's suffrage groups continued to fight in Missouri and also outside of the state. The Marysville Ladies Marching Band was featured in the Woman Suffrage Procession on March 13, 1913. It was the only all-female marching band and helped quiet the angry crowds. During the 1916 Democratic National Convention, suffragists Emily Newell Blair and Edna Gellhorn planned a silent, motionless parade. This event received national attention and helped gain some support from the Democratic delegates. Women in Missouri gained the right to vote in presidential elections in April 1919, a few months before Governor Frederick D. Gardner called for a special legislative session to ratify the Nineteenth Amendment. Missouri ratified the amendment on July 3, 1919, making Missouri the eleventh state to ratify. Soon after, Missouri's groups formed the Missouri League of Women Voters and other local chapters of the League of Women Voters.  Early efforts  Anna L. Clapp, President, St. Louis Ladies Union Aid Society Much of the women's suffrage activity in Missouri took place after the Civil War and was centered in St. Louis. However, other areas, such as Columbia and Kansas City also played a key role in working towards women's suffrage. A group that was important early on in Missouri women's suffrage history was the Ladies Union Aid Society of St. Louis (LUAS). On May 8, 1867, the Woman Suffrage Association of Missouri was created by former members of LUAS who met at the Mercantile Library Hall. It was the first political organization in the United States formed solely to advocate for women's suffrage. Among the founders were Anna Clapp and Lucretia Hall. Virginia Minor became its first president. Susan B. Anthony, impressed with the immediate success of the group, visited them in 1867. In October 1867, a women's suffrage convention took place in St. Louis, drawing a large attendance. The Woman Suffrage Association of Missouri also attracted attention in news coverage around the state. One of the first actions the Woman Suffrage Association of Missouri took on was to collect signatures for a petition for women's suffrage. The group succeeded in obtaining more than 350 signatures which it presented to the Missouri General Assembly. Phoebe Couzins spoke before the legislature for women's suffrage. The St. Joseph Gazette reported that the women from the Woman Suffrage Association were received with \\"favor\\". Legislators talked about combining women's suffrage with suffrage for African-American people in the state. However the proposition was voted down. The first suffrage convention in Missouri was held in St. Louis in 1869 at the Mercantile Library Hall. The Missouri Woman Suffrage Convention hosted a number of speakers and influential suffragists like Susan B. Anthony and Julia Ward Howe. It drew women from out of state, including one woman from Kansas who was arrested and briefly detained for wearing bloomers. At the convention, Virginia Minor put forth the idea that the Fourteenth Amendment already provided women the right to vote. Virginia's husband, Francis Minor, wrote up resolutions and pamphlets were printed up based on this idea. These pamphlets were circulated around the country and the idea it spawned was called the \\"New Departure\\". Much of the work on these legal ideas was based on the law that Francis Minor had practiced to protect his wife in case he died before she did. In this same year, the Missouri Woman Suffrage Association decided not to affiliate with any national groups, though they did send two delegates to a national convention in Washington D.C. Meetings were well attended by both men and women and were held twice a month. Other active groups at the time included the St. Louis branch of the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA). \\"An Important Decision\\" from St. Louis Post-Dispatch, March 31, 1875 In the early 1870s, across the United States, Black and white women were attempting to register to vote or to vote in various elections, many of them inspired by Virginia Minor. Virginia Minor attempted to register to vote on October 15, 1872 in St. Louis and was denied by the registrar, Reese Happersett, on the basis of sex. Her husband, Francis Minor, sued on her behalf since women could not file suits in Missouri until 1889. Based on the argument that she was a United States citizen, he argued, Virginia Minor should be allowed to vote. The case went to the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) in 1874 as Minor v. Happersett. The court ruled against Minor in a unanimous decision, stating that citizens are not guaranteed the right to vote by the United States Constitution. Chief Justice Morrison Waite wrote: \\"If the law is wrong, it ought to be changed; but the power for that is not with us.\\" Minor v. Happersett showed suffragists across the country that the path to women's suffrage would be through changing the laws, not challenging them in the courts. In 1875, Missouri considered women's suffrage during the state constitutional convention. Couzins went on a lecture tour to support women's suffrage in 1876. Women brought petitions to the Missouri General Assembly asking for a women's suffrage amendment to the state constitution in 1881. In 1883, women again petitioned the assembly for general and presidential suffrage. The Missouri Woman Suffrage Association seems to have lost momentum around 1886 while other groups in the state remained fairly active. Another women's suffrage convention took place in St. Louis 1889. More areas of the state were represented here with women from Bloomfield, Brookfield, Cameron, Fayette, La Monte, Maryville, Montgomery, and Wentzville elected as officers in the Missouri branch of NAWSA. Petitions for women's suffrage came from all over the state, including Clinton County, Jackson County, Pike County and St. Clair County. In 1892, the Kansas City Equal Suffrage League was formed with Kersey Coates as president. A suffrage convention took place in Kansas City, Missouri that featured women and their groups from around the country. The Mississippi Valley Congress held a convention in St. Louis in 1895 and was sponsored by the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). Both Susan B. Anthony and Anna Howard Shaw spoke at the convention. The Missouri Equal Suffrage Association (MESA) was formed in 1895 after delegates from Missouri attended the Mississippi Valley Congress of Women. In 1896, MESA organized a convention in St. Louis to take place concurrently with the 1896 Republican National Convention. Delegates from women's suffrage groups across the country came to try to influence the Republicans to add a women's suffrage plank in their platform. They were unsuccessful, and in addition, there was a lot of infighting between MESA and the St. Louis suffrage group.  Suffrage efforts gain visibility  Marysville marches in Washington, D.C. on March 3, 1913 In 1910, Emmeline Pankhurst came to tour the United States. Her visit inspired women in St. Louis to create the Equal Suffrage League (ESL). Pankhurst was not able to come to St. Louis, but the effort of getting together and inviting her to talk had given the suffragists more strength and helped grow the movement again in Missouri. On April 10, 1910, the ESL of St. Louis was formed with Florence Wyman Richardson as president. In 1911, three other clubs merged into the Missouri Equal Suffrage Association (MESA). MESA divided the state into districts. Missouri was represented in the Woman Suffrage Procession on March 3, 1913. The Maryville Ladies Marching Band, from Maryville, Missouri, was the only all-women band in the parade. When the parade became violent with men pushing and harassing the women, the band was used to calm the crowd. It was reported that the men were \\"shocked at the sight of women playing such 'wonderful music.'\\" That spring, in the state of Missouri, MESA collected more than 14,000 signatures in support of women's suffrage. Representative Thomas J. Roney brought the petition to the Missouri General Assembly and helped create a women's suffrage bill. The bill was defeated in the Senate, and its defeat was discouraging for many women in Missouri. In the fall of 1913, the St. Louis managers of the Merchants and Manufacturers Street Exposition helped the suffragists plan a car parade for September 30, 1913. The parade had 30 cars with men and women waving yellow \\"Votes for Women\\" pennants. One car was covered with the purple banner of MESA. After the car procession, the women marched again on the street behind a marching band. They ended the parade at Franklin Avenue where the suffragists gave speeches on soap boxes. During a 1913 suffrage conference in Missouri, Black suffragist, Victoria Clay Haley, attended as a representative of the Federated Colored Women's Club. It took place in a hotel that was fairly segregated and Haley, while asked to leave, did not, showing she had just as much right to be there as the white suffragists. Haley also went to the Mississippi Valley Suffrage Conference in 1914. Throughout 1913 and 1914 suffragists in Columbia gave speeches at every women's organization in the city. The Columbia suffragists also brought in suffragists from other states. An amendment to add women's suffrage to the state constitution was up for a vote in November 1914. After the defeat of the women's suffrage amendment in 1914, Emily Newell Blair accepted a position as the first editor of the suffrage magazine The Missouri Woman. Later, in April 1916, Mary Semple Scott took over as editor of the magazine.Delegates to the Democratic National Convention walk on the Golden Lane 1916 During the 1916 Democratic National Convention, suffragists staged a demonstration. The idea for the silent protest came from Emily Newell Blair in February earlier that year. More than 3,000 women lined twelve blocks along Locust Street, wearing white dresses, \\"votes for women\\" sashes and holding yellow umbrellas. They did not move or talk and the event, which was organized by Edna Gellhorn, was called a \\"walkless, talkless parade,\\" or the \\"Golden Lane\\". The demonstration was meant to show how women had been silenced by not being allowed to vote. The event gained national attention in the media. The Democratic delegates voted to support women's suffrage on a state by state basis. Also in June, during the 1916 Republican National Convention, women sent telegrams to the Missouri electors to convince them to support women's suffrage in the Republican platform. The Republican convention declined to support a federal suffrage amendment, but instead supported suffrage by state. In 1916, ten Missouri women went to the National Suffrage Convention in Atlantic City as delegates. They pledged Missouri's suffragists to work towards passage of a federal suffrage amendment. Missouri women organized themselves into congressional districts. Suffragists in Missouri opened up headquarters in Jefferson City in order to lobby members of the Missouri General Assembly. Eventually, a bill to provide women the right to vote in a presidential election was proposed in both the Senate and the House. In attempting to influence lawmakers, suffragists provided politicians with maps showing how suffrage had increased throughout the U.S. They also took out ads in the newspapers. Unfortunately, the bill did not pass. Suffragists again tried to petition for limited suffrage in 1917. While it passed the House, it did not pass the Senate in the general assembly. Later in the year, suffragists in Missouri worked to petition Missouri members of the House Rules Committee to create a House Committee on Women Suffrage. Suffragists continued to communicate with Missouri politicians and let them know that they expected them to support women's suffrage. During World War I, suffrage groups in Missouri worked to help aid the war effort. The suffrage magazine, The Missouri Woman offered space to the Missouri Women's Division of the Council of National Defense where they printed war propaganda and news. Suffragist, Victoria Clay Haley, who chaired the Colored Women's Unit of the Council of National Defense, hosted a patriotic rally in St. Louis where more than 5,000 Black people attended.  Presidential suffrage and ratification  Ratifying suffrage in Missouri July 3, 1919 On January 8, 1919, the first bill introduced in the Missouri General Assembly was to allow women in Missouri to vote in presidential elections and was called \\"Bill Number One\\". The bill was introduced by a Jasper County representative, Walter E. Bailey in the House and in the Senate by James McKnight from Gentry County. In the Senate, there was some controversy over whether the bill would be able to pass and three women, Marie Ames, Alma Sasse, and Mrs. Wm. Haight, watched the proceedings and made sure that senators who might vote for suffrage would be on the floor during any votes. Bill Number One passed the Senate and on February 11, it passed the House with a vote of 122 to 8. After this, the bill went back for the final write up. Some anti-suffrage senators tried to attach amendments in hopes of killing the legislation, but they were unsuccessful. The proceedings stretched into March. In the week of March 23 to 29, 1919, NAWSA held their Golden Jubilee Convention in St. Louis. The final vote for the presidential bill was on March 28. Suffragists worked together to procure a special train for one of the senators who was pro-suffrage and was out-of-town. The bill passed the senate again by 21 to 12. On April 5, 1919, the Presidential Suffrage bill was signed by Governor Frederick D. Gardner while suffragists watched. When the United States Congress passed the Nineteenth Amendment, suffrage leaders urged the states to call special legislative sessions for state ratification. In Kansas City on June 16, 1919, suffragists met at the Grand Avenue Temple to work on strategies to influence the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment by Missouri. Suffragists lobbied the state government and met with Governor Gardner. They were able to persuade the governor to call a special legislative session in July. Missouri suffragists also contacted the state legislators to persuade them to ratify the amendment. The day before the special session convened, suffrage groups, along with members of the Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) hosted a suffrage luncheon and dinner. The dinner was also accompanied by speeches and had a general sense of celebration. On July 2, women lined the streets from the New Central Hotel to the Missouri Capitol, holding yellow umbrellas and wearing sashes and yellow flowers. That day the amendment passed the Missouri house by 125 to 4 and in the Senate by 29 to 3. During the proceedings the galleries were filled with suffragists. The next day, Governor Gardner signed the ratification bill. Missouri League of Women Voters at the Statler Hotel on Sep 9, 1920. Women like Madeleine Liggett Clarke and Mary A. Kennedy began to hold \\"school for voters\\" which included classes on citizenship, history, law and other topics. Fannie C. Williams set up a suffrage school at the city's Black YWCA. Paid organizers went to women's homes to help prepare them for voting. The Missouri League of Women Voters (LWV Missouri) was created in October 1919 with Edna Gellhorn as the first president. The Missouri Woman Suffrage Association met at the Statler Hotel in St. Louis where the group changed its name to the LWV. The meeting had 500 attendees, both men and women, and was accompanied by speeches. The National League of Women Voters was established on February 14, 1920. Marie Ruoff Byrum became the first woman voter in Missouri on August 31, 1920.  Anti-suffragists in Missouri  The anti-suffrage arguments in Missouri were often based on adhering to women's traditional roles. An 1872 letter to the editor published in the Warrenton Banner described suffragists as \\"Free Lovers and loose divorced people,\\" and asserted that there were different roles for men and women. In 1887, Senator George G. Vest argued on the Senate floor that a women's place was \\"at home, not the ballot box.\\" In 1914, arguments against giving women the vote included the idea that it would cause an imbalance between rural and urban communities. It was proposed that urban areas would get a disproportionate amount of the vote and that this was undesirable. Minnie Bronson came to Missouri in 1916 in order to persuade state legislators against passing women's suffrage bills. She spent time with Missouri lawmakers telling unflattering, but interesting anecdotes about women.

Life  Thornton was born on February 25, 1849 in Governor's Island, New York, the son of General William A. Thornton and Helen Smith. William A. Thornton, a West Point graduate and veteran of the Black Hawk War, the Seminole Wars, the Mexican-American War, and the American Civil War, was stationed on Governor's Island at the time of Thornton's birth. After graduating from New York City public school in 1865, Thornton began attending the City College of New York for the next two years. He was planning on using his father's influence to get into West Point, but his father died and he was unable to get admitted. Instead, he attended Union College in Schenectady, graduating from there in 1872. Thornton then studied law under Eugene A. Brewster of Newburgh. He also began attending Albany Law School, graduating in 1874. He returned to Newburgh and Mr. Brewster's law office, and in 1883 he opened his own law office. He also served as president of the board of trustees of Washington's Headquarters State Historic Site and a member of the board of education. He also served as director and president of the National Bank of Newburgh. In 1891, Thornton was elected to the New York State Assembly as a Republican, representing the Orange County 1st District. He served in the Assembly in 1892, 1893, and 1894. Thornton was a member of the Sons of the American Revolution, via his grandfather John Thornton and great- grandfather Samuel Clyde. His great-grandfather William Thornton was believed to be the brother of Matthew Thornton, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. He was Master of his local freemason lodge, and was a member of the Royal Arch Masonry, the Knights Templar, and the Chi Psi fraternity, the University Club of New York, and the Loyal Legion of the United States. He was also a trustee of Union College, a trustee and director of the Newburgh City Club, and an honorary member of a local fire company. Thornton died from a stroke in his apartment in the Palatine Hotel on January 13, 1917. He was buried in Cedar Hill Cemetery and Mausoleum in Newburgh.

The observation is in contrast to Moore's law that predicted the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit (IC) doubles about every two years. Huang's law states that the performance of GPUs will more than double every two years. The hypothesis is subject to questions about its validity. History The observation was made by Jensen Huang, chief executive officer of Nvidia, at its 2018 GPU Technology Conference (GTC) held in San Jose, California. He observed that Nvidia‚Äôs GPUs were \\"25 times faster than five years ago\\" whereas Moore's law would have expected only a ten-fold increase. As microchip components become smaller, it became harder for chip advancement to meet the speed of Moore's Law. In 2006 Nvidia's GPU had a 4x performance advantage over other GPUs. In 2018 the Nvidia GPU was 20 times faster than comparable GPUs: the GPUs were 1.7x faster each year. Moores law would predict a doubling every two years, however Nvidia's GPU performance was more than tripled every two years fulfilling Huang's law. Huang's law claims that a synergy between hardware, software and artificial intelligence makes the new 'law' possible. Huang said, ‚ÄúThe innovation isn‚Äôt just about chips,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about the entire stack.‚Äù He said that Graphics processors especially are important to a new paradigm. Elimination of bottlenecks can speed up the process and create advantages in getting to the goal. ‚ÄúNvidia is a one trick pony,‚Äù Huang has said. According to Wang: \\"Accelerated computing is liberating, ... Let‚Äôs say you have an airplane that has to deliver a package. It takes 12 hours to deliver it. Instead of making the plane go faster, concentrate on how to deliver the package faster, look at 3D printing at the destination.‚Äù The object \\"... is to deliver the goal faster.‚Äù For artificial intelligence tasks, Huang said AlexNet took six days on two of Nvidia‚Äôs GTX 580 processors to complete the training process but only 18 minutes on a modern DGX-2 AI server, resulting in a speed-up factor of 500. Compared to Moore's law, which focuses purely on CPU transistors, Huang's Law describes a combination of advances in architecture, interconnects, memory technology, and algorithms. reprinted in Bharath Ramsundar wrote that deep learning is being coupled with \\"[i]mprovements in custom architecture\\". For example, machine learning systems have been implemented in the blockchain world, where Bitmain assaulted \\"many cryptocurrencies by designing custom mining ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits)\\" which had been envisioned as undoable. \\"Nvidia‚Äôs grand achievement however is in making the case that these improvement in architectures are not merely isolated victories for specific applications but perhaps broadly applicable to all of computer science.\\" They have suggested that broad harnessing of GPUs and the GPU stack (cf., CPU stack) can deliver \\"dramatic growth in deep learning architecture.\\" \\"The magic\\" of Huang‚Äôs law promise is that as nascent deep learning powered software becomes more availed, the improvements from GPU scaling and more generally from architectural improvements\\" will concretely improve \\"performance and behavior of modern software stacks.\\" There has been criticism. Journalist Joel Hruska writing in ExtremeTech in 2020 said \\"there is no such thing as Huang's Law\\", calling it an \\"illusion\\" that rests on the gains made possible by Moore's Law; and that it is too soon to determine a law exists.

It received its first station building in 1922 with the transfer of an old station house from K√§pyl√§; it was then replaced by a brand new building designed by Jarl Ungern in 1930. The Finnish state had gained possession of the lands of Nuppulinna during the land acquisition operations related to the imminent building of the Helsinki‚ÄìH√§meenlinna railway, and it became home to the official gardening facilities of the Finnish State Railways in the 1950s. The farmlands' significance for this purpose grew further in the 1960s as the FSR built a new greenhouse in Nuppulinna in 1962, where it then transferred the operations of its former garden in Hyvink√§√§. This garden was closed in 2002. Nuppulinna was again made an unmanned halt in 1972 and its station building was demolished in 1995. The former cross-platform pedestrian level crossing was replaced by an underpass in 1999. Nuppulinna continued to act as a halt on the Helsinki commuter rail network until its closing in 27 March 2016.  Services  Until its closing, Nuppulinna was served by line on the Helsinki commuter rail network.

During his seven years in Paris he became personally acquainted with Pablo Picasso, Pierre Bonnard, Jean Cocteau, Constantin Brancusi and attended for a short time Fernand L√©ger‚Äôs studio. In 1943 he settled in London where he joined the London Group and exhibited regularly. In 1948 he was invited to work in the Bath School of Art, in order to bring his experience of twenties Paris to an English art world untouched by the deep changes taking place on the continent. His much-needed European influence on painting, specifically abstraction, was acknowledged by contemporaries including Peter Lanyon, Patrick Heron, Adrian Heath and William Scott. Potworowski‚Äôs paintings and constructions were considered some of the finest works of British art in the 1950s. In 1958 he was invited to return to Poland in to take up the post of Professor of Painting at Pozna≈Ñ and in 1960 he was a prize winner at the 30th Venice Biennale. He died in Warsaw in 1962. In 1996 a major retrospective exhibition was held at the Polish National Gallery of Contemporary Art in Warsaw consisting of 70 works in oil and 80 sculptures, scenography projects and watercolours. Life Duet, 1949 Piotr Tadeusz Potworowski was born on June 14, 1898 in Warsaw, then part of the Russian Empire. The family owned an engineering factory and a summer villa on the River Wis≈Ça. He was considered a ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù child and attended a school for the disturbed. His mother was killed in a sledging accident in 1913 and in August 1914 at the start of the war he and his two brothers were sent for safety to relatives in Moscow. His sketches from that period show interest and talent which was put aside when he volunteered for the Polish Cavalry Brigade, part of the Russian Army, fighting first the Germans then the Ukrainians and finally the Bolsheviks. After the war in 1920 he studied design in the Warsaw University of Technology then in the following year moved to the Academy of Fine Arts in Krak√≥w and discovered French painting. In 1924 he travelled to Paris as a member of Komitet Paryski (KP) a group of young painters and stayed there for seven years immersing himself in avant garde culture of that period. For a short time he joined the studio of Fernand L√©ger and was a leading light in organising the Bal Polonaise which was attended by Picasso, Braque and other luminaries. In 1927 he spent three months working on a French commercial schooner and followed this in 1928 with an exhibition of ships at the Claridge Gallery, London. In 1929 he married Magdalena Ma≈Ñkowska, and in 1930 returned to Poland, where their son Jan was born. They lived near Pozna≈Ñ in Rudki Palace which was owned by his wife‚Äôs family and in which they hosted, for months on end, fellow artists and officers from his regiment. In 1935 the family moved to Grebanin, a village near the town of Kƒôpno in which he initiated a regional museum and commenced a large fresco in the town hall. In 1936 Anusia, his daughter was born. He exhibited frequently in Poland and in 1937 was awarded a silver medal at the International Exhibition of Art and Technology in Paris. He fought in the 1939 campaign and when that collapsed attempted to reach allied forces in Narvik. When the fall of France made this impossible he settled in Sweden where he continued to paint and sculpt, and organised an exhibition of Polish-Norwegian Art. In 1941 his family joined him but in September 1943 he was ordered to join the Polish Army in Britain. On arriving in Scotland in a Mosquito he was told that he was too old for front line duty and was stationed in London. There he engaged with enthusiasm in the Polish cultural life, was appointed President of the Association of Polish Artists and joined the exclusive London Group. A number of exhibitions in London led to a position in the Bath Academy of Art, Corsham, where he significantly influenced creative thinking of new wave of British painters such as Peter Lanyon, William Scott and Patrick Heron. Every two years he exhibited in the Gimpel Fils Gallery. In 1958 he was invited to work in Poland. There followed four very intensive years where he not only produced his most powerful paintings but also sculptures and scenography projects. He had his first exhibition at the National Museum in Pozna≈Ñ, 1958, then in National Museums of Krak√≥w, Gda≈Ñsk, Warsaw, Wroc≈Çaw and Szczecin. The very good reception of his work contributed to his decision to stay in the country. He exhibited in the Venice Biennale in 1960 receiving a silver medal and also in the Galerie Lacloche, Paris. He died on April 24, 1962 in Warsaw, where he rests in the PowƒÖzki Cemetery in the Avenue of Merit. Influence Black Cow, 1954 Kenneth Armitage fellow tutor, Corsham: \\"... while we were all individuals before his arrival we must have seemed, thereafter, rather ordinary compared to Piotr‚Äôs personal approach to everything. He came from an outside world, from a longer time-life span; he brought a foreign flavour and his values and approach were different. Once or twice in a lifetime at just the right moment ‚Äî somebody else can move into one‚Äôs own small private world endowed with mysterious authority to push and pull in directions that, without such encouragement, one might only slowly (or even never) take necessary and positive action. Such a one was Peter ... We became close friends.\\" Adrian Heath fellow tutor, Corsham: \\"To this community (of artists at Corsham) be brought a catholic taste and breadth of understanding that can truly be described as cosmopolitan; a quality that was hungrily accepted by men who had been insulated from continental opinions by seven years of war.‚Äù Key exhibitions * 1927: [Salon des Ind√©pendents , Grand Palais, Paris * 1937: International Exhibition, Polish Pavilion, Paris * 1947‚Äì1957: annual , Gimpel Fils Gallery, London * 1958 National Museum, _Pozna≈Ñ * 1962 Galerie Lacloche, Paris * 1996 National Gallery of Contemporary Art, Warsaw * 2013 Galeria Studio, Palace of Culture, Warsaw Works in state museums and galleries * Tate St Ives * Royal West of England Academy * Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery * National Museum of Warsaw * National Museum of Pozna≈Ñ * National Museum of Krak√≥w * National Museum of Katowice * National Museum of Gda≈Ñsk See also * Polish visual artists  References  External links * Collection Ewa Twarowska-Sioda & Joanna Twarowska-Hauser, Galeria Miejska, Pozna≈Ñ Category:Polish male painters Category:Artists from Warsaw Category:Abstract artists Category:1898 births Category:1962 deaths ","title":"Piotr Potworowski"},{"id":"65381294","text":"The Evangelische Nachrichtenagentur idea e.

History The Freedom Memorial Museum is a project of the Human Rights Violations Victims' Memorial Commission (HRVVMC), a body created under Republic Act No. 10368. The legislation also known as the \\"Human Rights Victims Reparation and Recognition Act\\" was signed into law in 2013 by then President Benigno Aquino III. The HRVVMC is tasked to raise awareness among the youth information regarding the excesses of President Ferdinand Marcos' administration as well as opposition against his regime. The HRVVMC in cooperation with the United Architects of the Philippines, held a design competition for a museum which will be dedicated to the Martial Law Era in the Philippines. Five final designs were shortlisted from 106 entries with \\"Fall of Brutal\\" design by architects Mark Anthony Pait, Mark Angelo Bonita and Wendell Crispo selected as the winning entry on August 21, 2019. The HRVVMC opened the bidding for the construction of the museum on September 21, 2020. The museum is projected to open on September 23, 2022, which coincides with the 50th anniversary of the declaration of Martial Law over the country by President Marcos. Architecture and design The Freedom Memorial Museum will be built inside the University of the Philippines Diliman campus in Quezon City. The museum building will be erected beside the College of Fine Arts Gallery. The museum's design is a result of a design competition with the winning entry being \\"Fall of Brutal\\" by a team consisting of architects Mark Anthony Pait, Mark Angelo Bonita and Wendell Crispo. The museum will exhibit Brutalist architecture which is a common style adopted by infrastructure projects built by President Marcos' administration such as the Cultural Center of the Philippines and the Philippine International Convention Center. The facade of the museum building is patterned after a clenched fist with flower patterns of ikat, patadyong, Moro and T'boli textiles to signify the \\"beauty of democracy unfolding\\"; or the years of resistance against the Marcos administration which culminated with the People Power Revolution of 1986. The surrounding landscape of the building was pattern after dried land to represent the negative impact of Marcos' decades-long rule.

Neither latitude nor longitude was shown in the edict.Dokdo Development and Imperial Ordinance No. 41 of the Korean Empire(Northeast Asian History Foundation) On January 28, 1905, Japanese Cabinet reached a decision to incorporate Liancourt Rocks. \\"Imperial Edict No. 41\\" is before \\"the Cabinet decision\\". Therefore, Korean government claims that Japan robbed Korea of \\"Dokdo\\". In fact, since there are no Korean maps showing Liancourt Rocks, it is very likely that Korean officials did not even know about Liancourt Rocks in 1900. There is also an estimate that ‚ÄùSeokdo‚Äù is \\"Gwaneumdo\\"(Ë¶≥Èü≥Â≥∂), which is very close to Ulleungdo.  Imperial Edict No. 41  \\"Uldo-gi(È¨±Â≥∂Ë®ò)\\" written by U Yong-Taeng.(1900) \\"Seakdo\\" is an island that appears in the Korean Empire \\"Edict No. 41\\" on October 25, 1900. This edict was given to Lee Kun-Ha (Êùé‰πæÂ§è, Minister of Internal Affairs, Uijeongbu Temporary Office), and is a formal one with the privy seal of the Korean Emperor Gojong. This edict stipulates that the area under the jurisdiction of Ulleungdo County is \\"UlleungdoÔºåJukdo and Seokdo\\". However, this edict only indicates the administrative scope of Ulleungdo County and is positioned as the governmental and local system of the Korean Empire, and was not issued for the purpose of incorporating the territory. If it is an order for the purpose of territorial transfer, the evidence is that there is no reference to latitude and longitude that should be shown. U Yong-Taeng(Á¶πÁî®Èºé), an official of the Korean Empire, who was appointed as an inspector a few months before the edict was issued, accompanied Deputy Consul Shosuke Akatsuka, who is stationed at the Busan Consulate in Japan, and Laporte, a French tax officer, to explore the area around Ulleungdo. However, the three have not visited Liancourt Rocks. And there is no mention of Liancourt Rocks in the report \\"Uldo-gi\\" written by U Yong-Taeng after the survey.  \\"Seokdo = Dokdo\\" theory  Ulleungdo, Jukdo and Gwaneumdo Of the \\"Á´πÂ≥∂Áü≥Â≥∂\\" in Imperial Edict No. 41, the Korean government has designated \\"Á´πÂ≥∂\\" as Jukdo and \\"Áü≥Â≥∂(Seokdo)\\" as Liancourt Rocks. And the government claims that the edict is evidence that Seokdo, or Dokdo, officially became Korean territory as of October 1900. The opinion that \\"Á´πÂ≥∂\\" is Jukdo is almost in agreement with the Japanese side. As for Dokdo, it is 87 kilometers east-southeast of Ulleungdo, many Japanese scholars have denied Korea's claim. The Japanese side thinks that the Korean government's \\"Seokdo = Dokdo\\" theory is to make Takeshima(Liancourt Rocks)'s incorporation into Shimane Prefecture an \\"aggression\\". And they view this theory as a forced theory to prove the fact that Dokdo was Korean territory before 1905 when Takeshima became Japanese territory. The reason why Korean government thinks \\"Seokdo = Dokdo\\" is that \\"Dokdo\\" eventually changed to \\"Seokdo\\". Koreans infer that some residents of Ulleungdo referred to Liancourt Rocks as ‚ÄúDokseom\\". \\"Dok\\" was a dialect of Jeolla Province of \\"Dol (stone)\\". (In the 1950s, it claimed to be a dialect of Gyeongsang Province.) \\"Dokseom\\" or \\"Dolseom\\" literally means \\"Stone Island\\" in Korean. When expressing the Korean words ‚Äúdol‚Äù and ‚Äúdok‚Äù in written Chinese characters, they become ‚Äúseok‚Äù (Áü≥) . When the pronunciation is written in Chinese, it becomes \\"dok\\" (Áç®). Korean claims that Dolseom ‚Üí Dokseom ‚Üí Seokdo ‚Üí Dokdo are all variations of the same name of Liancourt Rocks. They give an elaborate linguistic explanation of how the name \\"Seokdo\\" (Áü≥Â≥∂) evolved into \\"Dokdo\\" (Áç®Â≥∂).  Doubts about \\"Seokdo = Dokdo\\" theory  Gim Jeong-ho \\"Daedongyeojido\\" (1861) rightthumb250px1906 July 13, \\"Hwangseong Shinmun\\" (ÁöáÂüéÊñ∞ËÅû) . \\\\---- It was officially confirmed that the Uldo County range was 60 ri (24 km) east-west and 40 ri (16 km) north-south. Doubt 1: If Uldo-county was officially decided to belong to Gangwon Province by Imperial Ordinance No. 41, why did they adopt the Jeolla dialect \\"dok\\" instead of the Gangwon dialect or the Korean standard \\"dol\\"? Korean scholars explain this because many Ulleungdo fishermen were from Jeolla Province in western Korea. However, Japanese scholars argue that Ulleungdo islanders began fishing on Liancourt Rocks after 1903. Doubt 2: The Korean sound of Chinese Character \\"Áü≥(stone)\\" is \\"seok\\". If they decide to use this, they should use the official name \\"Seokdo\\", but why change the letters to \\"Dokdo\\" later? No other example of changing the letter \\"Áü≥(stone)\\" in the place name to \\"Áç®(alone, only one)\\" or vice versa has been confirmed. Borrowing other characters and borrowing sounds only appears when there is no character that accurately represents a certain meaning or you do not know the Hanja(Chinese character). There is no reason for Korean Empire, which has a long tradition as a Chinese character civilization sphere, to dare to borrow sounds that do not need to be done. Doubt 3: There are no maps or literature records on \\"Dokdo\\" on the Korean Peninsula before 1905. Liancourt Rocks were not depicted in the Gim Jeong-ho's Daedongyeojido(1861), which is said to be the masterpiece of maps in the Joseon Dynasty. But why can we equate Seokdo in Imperial Edict and Dokdo? Doubt 4: If \\"Usando\\" is Dokdo (Liancourt Rocks), as Korea has claimed for many years, why did the Korean Empire's Edict of 1900 use the name \\"Seokdo\\" instead of \\"Usando\\"? Why did Usando, which had been used until 1899, suddenly disappear? The most rational explanation is that the legendary island \\"Usando\\" was not found as a result of the exploration activity by U Yong-Taeng, Akatsuka and Laporte in 1900. Therefore, the names \\"Jukdo\\" and \\"Seokdo\\" were renamed to the two islands near Ulleungdo. On the other hand, the name \\"Dokdo(Áç®Â≥∂)\\" first appeared in historical literature in 1904. Moreover, this is a historical source on the Japanese side. It is appropriate to think of \\"Seokdo\\" and \\"Dokdo\\" as completely separate islands. Doubt 5: In 1899, the officially published \\"Daehanjiji\\", written by Hyeun Chae, states that the territory of the Korean Empire ranges from 33¬∞15‚Ä≤N to 42¬∞25‚Ä≤N and from 124¬∞30‚Ä≤E to 130¬∞35‚Ä≤E, which would exclude the Liancourt Rocks (located at 37¬∞14‚Ä≤30‚Ä≥N 131¬∞52‚Ä≤0‚Ä≥E). \\"Daehanjiji\\" is an authoritative book that was also used in Korean geography textbooks. On the map attached to this book, \\"Usando\\" has drawn, but \\"Dokdo = Liancourt Rocks\\" has not. (In addition, Usando has drawn as Jukdo.) Why? Park Eun-sik, who is famous as a nationalist, also sets the eastern limit of Korea at 130¬∞35‚Ä≤E in \\"Painful History of Korea\\"(1919).Yamasaki(2019) Isn't it because he didn't consider Liancourt Rocks to be his own territory? Doubt 6: In a May 19, 1906 article in the Korean newspaper, Hwangseong Shinmun (ÁöáÂüéÊñ∞ËÅû) reports.The Russo-Japanese War and the Invasion of Dokdo(Northeast Asian History Foundation) This is an article based on a report sent by Uldo County Magistrate Sim Heung-taek to his direct superior, Gangwon Province Observatory. The report was written on March 29, 1906, the day after the Japanese delegation left. From this, it can be seen that Sim Heung-taek had considered \\"Dokdo\\" to belong to \\"Uldo County\\" until then. However, neither he nor his superiors nor the Korean government protested against the Japanese government. \\"Dokdo(Áç®Â≥∂)\\" in the article is the first case to be found in Korean literature and the only case before World War II. Uldo County Magistrate Sim Heung-taek uses the name \\"Dokdo\\". If \\"Dokdo\\" is \\"Seokdo\\", the county Magistrate who was ordered to manage it did not use the word \\"Seokdo\\" used in the edict, but dared to use another word \\"Dokdo\\". It is equivalent to ignoring the edict and is inconsistent. Isn't it appropriate to think of \\"Seokdo\\" as another island? Doubt 7: On July 19, 1906, the \\"Hwangseong Shinmun\\" reported that the Japanese Resident-General asked the Korean Ministry of Interior to clarify whether the neighboring islands were part of \\"Uldo County\\". The Korean ministry replied that the neighboring islands were \\"Jukdo\\" (Á´πÂ≥∂) and \\"Seokdo\\" (Áü≥Â≥∂). In addition, the Korean ministry also explained that the range of Uld County as being sixty ri from east to west and forty ri from north to south for a total of 200 ri. Since a Korean 1ri was 0.4 kilometers, that means Uldo County was 24 km east‚Äìwest and 16 km north-west.The value of 200 ri is considered to be the sum of the four laps around the sea surrounding the county. The Liancourt Rocks are located about 90 km southeast of Ulleungdo, providing evidence that the Korean government did not consider Liancourt Rocks part of Uldo County as of 1906. Korean side reaffirms that the range of Uldo county is \\"Ulleungdo\\", \\"Jukdo\\" and \\"Seokdo\\". \\"Dokdo\\" does not appear here. If, as the Korean government insists, the relationship of \\"Seokdo = Dokdo\\" is established, \\"Sekdo\\" in 1900 became \\"Dokdo\\" in May 1906, and returned to the name \\"Seokdo\\" in July 1906.  \\"Seokdo = Gwaneumdo\\" theory  thumb250pxGwaneumdo seen from Jukdo (photographed in 2018) \\\\---- In the old days, Koreans lived and grazing goats. Based on the above doubt, it is natural to think that \\"Seokdo\\" and \\"Dokdo\\" of the edict are different islands. At least the \\"Seokdo = Dokdo\\" theory has not been proved. The \\"Kankai Tsugyo Shishin (Migrant Fishery Guidline in sea area toward Korea) \\" written by Japanese Shusuke Kuzuu in 1901 states that Korean at that time called Liancourt Rocks \\"Yanko\\" and did not call it \\"Seokdo\\". Therefore, \\"Yanko = Dokdo\\" theory holds. On the other hand, Seokdo is within the range of 60 ri east and west (about 24 km) and 40 ri north and south (about 16 km) according to an article in the Hwangseong Shinmun on July 13, 1906. Considering that the main island of Ulleungdo is about 10 kilometers east‚Äìwest and about 9.5 kilometers north‚Äìsouth, it can be considered that both Jukdo and Seokdo are very close to Ulleungdo. Koreans have lived on Gwaneumdo, but never lived on Liancourt Rocks before the 1950s. According to the Imperial Edict No. 41, the area under the jurisdiction of Uldo County is \\"Ulleungdo, Jukdo and Seokdo\\". From this, it is presumed that \\"Jukdo\\" is the largest Boussole Rock (Oo-san) among the attached islands of Ulleungdo, and \\"Seokdo\\" is the second largest \\"Gwaneumbo\\". The Korean government says that \\"Dokdo\\" is made of rock, so it is suitable for \\"Seokdo\\" of the edict. Gwaneumdo is also made of rock except for the upper topsoil, and was also known as \\"Stone Buddha Island\\". The recognition that Ulleungdo has two genera islands is none other than that of the Korean Empire. In Yi Kyu-won's 1882 \\"È¨±ÈôµÂ≥∂Â§ñÂúñ(Ïö∏Î¶âÎèÑ Í∑∏Î¶º, Ulleungdo Outer Map)\\", he considers Ulleungdo to belong to two islands, \\"Á´πÂ≥∂(Jukdo)\\" and \\"Â≥∂È†Ö(Somok)\\", or Gwaneumbo. The maps depicting \\"Jukdo\\" and \\"Somok\\" were also followed by the map of Naoe Higaki, a Japanese who went to Ulleung Island in 1883, and the map of Shosuke Akatsuka, a Japanese in 1900. Moreover, in the \\"ÈüìÂúãÊ∞¥Áî£Ë™å(ÌïúÍµ≠ ÏàòÏÇ∞ ÏßÄ, Korean Fisheries Magazine)\\" published by the Korean Empire government in 1910, \\"Jukdo\\" and \\"Somoku Somu(Èº†È†ÖÂ≥∂)\\" are listed as two islands attached to Ulleungdo. Somoku Somu is now Gwaneumdo, too.\\"Falseness in Tok-do of 10 South Korea doesn't know\\" The 6th times(Web Takeshima issue Research) In other words, in 1882 and 1910, the Korean Empire regarded the islands of Ulleungdo as two islands, Jukdo and Gwaneumdo. Nevertheless, it is unreasonable to treat \\"Dokdo\\" as an attached island of Ulleungdo and describe it as \\"Soekdo\\" only in 1900 Royal Decree No. 41, which is in the middle of the era.

After the occupation of Tibet by China in 1950 and the Indo-China war in 1962, patterns of trade changed, and the use of the old trading route between India and Tibet dwindled and the salt-carrying caravans became redundant. Background Middle Hills Tibetans with Yak and a sheep carrying a bag of salt, near Boudhanath Throughout history, Nepalis and Tibetans have traded with each other via a number of mountain passes. Two of the most important goods traded were salt from the lakes of Tibet (e.g. Namtso), and rice from the Middle Hills of Nepal. For centuries, the barter of grain and other agricultural products from Nepal with salt and wool from Tibet formed the basis of a trade that has traditionally been in the hands of various, mostly Tibetan-speaking communities. Nomadic groups like the Khyampa, with no land of their own, traded both salt and rice, using sheep, goats and yaks in their travels as a means of survival. Other products from India and China were also bartered. Tibet had plenty of salt but little rice, while rice was plentiful in southern Nepal but salt was lacking. Traders could solve this problem; the further they carried their salt from Tibet, the more valuable it became. When sea salt from India became available on the India/Nepal frontier, the price of salt fell. The nomad traders adapted by buying Indian salt, and spending the winter in camps in the lowlands of Nepal. Here they made blankets from the wool from their sheep, trading the blankets and the salt with villagers, receiving rice in exchange. In March, they would move north, with their sheep and goats carrying the rice, and yaks carrying their domestic belongings. They passed across the mountain passes when the snow had melted sufficiently. Arriving in Purang, Tibet in August, they traded the rice for Tibetan salt, and started on the return journey southwards the following month. By the 1950s, things were beginning to change. China's presence in Tibet resulted in highways being constructed on the Tibetan plateau allowing wheat and rice to be brought in from China for consumption by the Tibetan nomads. At the same time, in Nepal, better roads meant that iodised salt from India was becoming more widely available. This was important because goitre and cretinism were widespread in Nepal. With less demand for the products they carried, the traditional cross-border trade became less economic. In the 1980s, the new Dadeldhura to Doti and the Kohalpur to Banbasa highways were the final blows to the trade. Trade routes Some of the easiest paths were in the Mustang District of Gandaki Pradesh. This made the Kali Gandaki Gorge a focal point for trade. The Upper Mustang comprises the northern two-thirds of the Mustang District in Nepal. Villages like Dana or Tukuche, located in the Kali Gandaki Gorge, were stops along the trade route. The Dolpa District also benefited from the trade. Historically, there are a number of border crossings. The crossing at Kora La between Upper Mustang and Tibet for example was a major salt trade route. However, this crossing was closed due to Tibetan guerrillas in the 1960s. It remains closed for most of the year to this day, except when opening for limited local trade during the semiannual cross-border trade fairs. For hikers, the Manaslu Circuit follows the salt-trading route along the Budhi Gandaki River, and is part of the Great Himalaya Trail.

She was renamed Ro-38 on 1 November 1942, and was provisionally attached to the Maizuru Naval District that day. She was launched on 24 December 1942 and completed and commissioned on 24 July 1943. Service history Upon commissioning, Ro-38 was attached formally to the Maizuru Naval District, and on 31 July 1943 she was assigned to Submarine Squadron 11 for workups. On 31 October 1943 she was reassigned to Submarine Division 34 in the 6th Fleet, and she departed Maizuru bound for Truk that day. She arrived at Truk on 8 November 1943. Ro-38 got underway from Truk on 19 November 1943 to begin her first war patrol, assigned a patrol area in the Gilbert Islands in the vicinity of Makin and Tarawa. The Japanese never heard from her again. On 20 November 1943, the Battles of Makin and of Tarawa began with the U.S. landings on those atolls. That day, the commander-in-chief of the 6th Fleet, Vice Admiral Takeo Takagi, ordered Ro-38 and the submarines , , , , , , , and to attack the U.S. invasion fleet off the atolls. On 26 November 1943, Takagi ordered I-19, I-40, I-169, and Ro-38 to form a patrol line north of Makin, with Ro-38 northeast of Makin at the eastern end of the line. The 6th Fleet ordered Ro-38 to move to a new patrol area southeast of Tarawa on 27 November 1943, and on 4 December 1943 it sent her orders to patrol between Tarawa and Canton Island. Ro-38 did not acknowledge any of these orders. The circumstances of Ro-38‚Ä≤s loss are unknown. It is possible that the United States Navy destroyer sank her west of Tarawa on 24 November 1943. On 2 January 1944, the Imperial Japanese Navy declared her to be presumed lost off the Gilbert Islands with all 77 hands. She was stricken from the Navy list on 30 April 1944.

The society holds biennial conventions and occasional special events, such as memorial ceremonies at sites associated with the Titanic and a tribute to Titanic writer Walter Lord in his Baltimore hometown. It is one of several organizations worldwide dedicated to the memory of the Titanic. The society publishes Voyage, an illustrated quarterly journal. In addition to stories about the Titanic and her passengers and crew, other ships related to the Titanic disaster are also covered, such as the and the rescue ship . Although Titanic is the Society's primary focus, issues of Voyage have also featured other famous ocean liners. The Society's logo reflects these multiple interests, with silhouettes depicting Titanic, the acclaimed French vessel , and , the world's fastest liner. History =Founding= The Titanic International Society began in 1989 when eleven friends formed an organization, which they initially called Titanic International, to perpetuate the memory of Titanic and promote greater knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the ill-fated White Star Liner's disastrous maiden voyage and the people who sailed aboard her. The group's first meeting took place on Saturday, April 15, 1989, at the Philadelphia Maritime Museum (now the Independence Seaport Museum), with Titanic survivor Louise Kink Pope as guest of honor. In its first year, the organization had 50 members. =1990s= In 1991, Louise Pope again attended the Society's convention in Rochelle Park, New Jersey, which included her visit to the old Pier 54 in Manhattan, where Carpathia had docked with the Titanic survivors. She also participated in that convention's \\"Dream of Freedom\\" ceremony at Ellis Island, where the Society presented the Ellis Island National Museum of Immigration with a plaque in memory of the immigrants traveling to America in Third Class on the Titanic, who died at sea when Titanic foundered. The plaque remembered those, \\"...who never made it to safety and were lost at sea\\". Other Titanic survivors attending Society conventions were Edith Haisman, Eleanor Ileen Johnson, Millvina Dean, Michel Navratil, Marjorie Newell Robb, and Frank Philip Aks. Morro Castle survivors Agnes Prince Margolis, Ruth Prince Coleman, and Dolly McTigue, and Andrea Doria survivor Jerome Reinert were honored guests at the 1991 and 1992 conventions, respectively. Memorials to victims Ronald Wallace prepare to place a wreath at the graves of Titanic victims, 1991left In 19901991, the Society worked to identify six Titanic disaster victims buried in unmarked graves at Fairview Lawn Cemetery in Halifax, Nova Scotia, so that their headstones could be inscribed with their names. In September 1991, more than 50 society members joined a cruise to Halifax aboard the Cunard Line's Queen Elizabeth 2. While there, Society members attended the unveiling of the newly inscribed gravestones, made possible by the society's research. Titanic survivor Louise Pope joined Halifax Mayor Ronald Wallace at the Fairview Lawn Cemetery unveiling ceremonies (pictured). The event was attended by hundreds of Halifax residents and televised by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. The QE2 Captain, Robin Woodall, also participated, expressing to the assemblage the Cunard Line's pride in Carpathia vital role in rescuing the survivors. In cemeteries in the northeastern U.S., the Society has also provided headstones for the previously unmarked graves of Titanic second-class passenger Marshall Drew; U.S. Sea Post officer John Starr March; third-class passengers Oscar Palmquist and Catherine Buckley; and Robert J. Hopkins, an able seaman aboard Titanic. In 1993, the society presented a plaque to the Smithsonian Institution's National Postal Museum in Washington, D.C., in memory of the American and British postal service workers who lost their lives when Titanic sank and added a grave stone at a New Jersey cemetery where an American Titanic postal worker is buried. A \\"Salute to Walter Lord\\" was held in nearby Baltimore, Maryland, the hometown of the celebrated author. He was feted for his seminal work, A Night to Remember, the narrative of the Titanic disaster which inspired television and film adaptations and led to renewed interest in the ship's fate. Also that year, Society founding members Charles A. Haas and John P. Eaton, co-authors of Titanic: Triumph and Tragedy, each made dives to the Titanic wrecksite. continued: Haas, then a New Jersey high school English and journalism teacher, and Eaton wrote first-person accounts of their expedition experiences for Voyage. The Cunard Line's former Pier 54 site in Manhattan was revisited in 1997 for an 85th anniversary memorial service. By then, membership had grown to 900 individuals in 24 countries. Producers of the Tony Award-winning musical, Titanic, consulted the Society's archives for accurate portrayal of the play's characters before the show's Broadway debut in 1997. In early 1998, the trustees voted to amend the organization's name to \\"Titanic International Society\\". On July 28, 1999, the Society returned to Halifax's Fairview Lawn Cemetery and presented a ceremony \\"For the Children,\\" remembering the 53 children under age 14 who perished in the disaster. Support for recovery efforts The Society was an early supporter of the efforts by RMS Titanic Inc. to recover, conserve, and exhibit Titanic artifacts, by providing historical information to the company and publishing multiple articles in Voyage about its activities. The Society believes it is important to retrieve artifacts from the disaster before they disintegrate completely and are gone forever, for future generations to see firsthand. Some members served in an advisory capacity as consultants. In 1990, the Society's first full year of operation, it published a featured article, \\"Recovery and Exploration: The 1987 Titanic expedition offers new insights into its operations, plans\\", describing the anticipated recovery and exhibition plans. The Society defends the recovery of such artifacts as spoons, luggage, wine bottles, and a portion of Titanic hull from the wreckage, despite criticism. The Society's journal, Voyage featured the recovery with photos in the Winter 2003 issue. When George Tulloch, one of the founders of RMS Titanic Inc. died early in 2004, then-Titanic International Society president Michael Findlay lauded his work, saying, \\"He has done more to preserve the memory of Titanic than anyone else\\". Shortly before his death, Tulloch had written in Voyage of his hope that future generations would \\"... understand the reverence and dedication for this tragic story\\" motivating the salvagers. By 2013, more than 25 million people had visited the Titanic exhibits in Orlando, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and elsewhere, said Premier Exhibitions (the affiliate of RMS Titanic Inc.). The Society has occasionally been contacted to authenticate various Titanic-related items. A dollar bill signed by the Titanic barber, for example, was verified by Society co-founder Michael Findlay and displayed on television by his colleague Charles Haas. =2000-present= At its 2003 convention in Newport, Rhode Island, the Society‚Äôs guest of honor was Lusitania survivor Barbara McDermott. In 2004, the Society's journal, Voyage, featured a cover story on the life of William MacQuitty, who died in February of that year at age 98. MacQuitty was the British producer of the 1958 film, A Night to Remember, which recreated the story of the sinking of the Titanic. As a six-year old, he had witnessed her launch in Belfast. The Voyage cover was headlined, \\"A gentleman to remember\\". At the 2008 and 2012 conventions, members toured sites connected to the White Star Line in New York City, the intended destination of Titanic. During the centennial memorial cruise that re-traced the ship's route across the Atlantic Ocean in 2012, society members presented lectures to participants aboard two cruise ships and participated in memorial services directly above the wreck. The 2016 convention featured a visit to the Titanic artifact exhibition, then on display at New Jersey's Liberty Science Center. Current activities The Society is led by an eleven-member board of trustees, elected by the membership to three-year terms. From among their number, the trustees elect the Society's three officers ‚Äì president, treasurer and corporate secretary ‚Äì and appoint the Society's historian. Officers‚Äô responsibilities are enumerated in the Society's bylaws. Members occasionally make multimedia presentations about the Titanic to the public. As of , Charles Haas is president, John Eaton is historian, and Robert Bracken is treasurer. Like many members, Bracken first became interested in the Titanic after reading Walter Lord's book, A Night to Remember. At the time, he was just in junior high school, reported NJTV. Past-president and founding member Michael Findlay likewise became fascinated by the Titanic saga after doing a book report for school on A Night to Remember, as a 9-year old. Fall 2018 Voyage cover -- the rows of Titanic victims' graves in Halifax, visited during the Society's convention in Nova Scotia's capital One of the society's principal endeavors is publication of a quarterly journal, Voyage, containing illustrated articles pertaining to the Titanic, her sister ship , and other famous vessels, and those who sailed them. The controversial role of and the rescue ship have been covered in depth. Although the Titanic is the Society's primary focus, Voyage has also covered other notable ocean liner disasters, such as those involving the Morro Castle, , and the , which was torpedoed by a German submarine in World War II and sunk while evacuating children from Great Britain to Canada. Past issues have featured other iconic ships as well, such as the Cunard liners Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth 2. Conventions are held every two years, with guest speakers and authors sharing their expert knowledge on maritime subjects. In 2007, several worldwide Titanic-interest groups came together in Halifax, Nova Scotia, for the 95th anniversary of the ship's sinking. The British Titanic Society took the lead in planning the event, which the Titanic International Society co-sponsored. Representatives from the Scandinavian Titanic Society, Swiss Titanic Society, German Titanic Society (\\"Der Deutsche Titanic-Verein\\"), and the Irish Titanic Historical Society attended. The Society had joint conventions with the Belfast Titanic Society in 2011 and the Titanic Society of Atlantic Canada in 2018. Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Society's 2020 convention, planned for Boston, Massachusetts, was rescheduled tentatively for June 2022. The Society participates in the Coast Guard's annual observance of the disaster, placing a commemorative wreath over the vessel's watery grave in the Atlantic Ocean. On April 15, 2010, the traditional wreath laying in the Atlantic Ocean was preceded by a special memorial service at Fairview Lawn Cemetery in Halifax. In the media The society and its individual members are frequently consulted by the news media regarding aspects of the Titanic disaster, especially when the ill-fated liner is in the news, with various trustees responding to queries. More than twenty Society members are active researchers and experts who have authored books about Titanic or maritime history. Several members contributed the majority of segments presented on the Titanic Channel, a subscription-based video-on- demand service from 2016 through 2018. Two Society trustees will be featured in the History Channel documentary History's Mysteries ‚Äì Titanic: Lost Evidence, scheduled for broadcast in November 2020. Also, three Society members are leading the team designing Titanic: Honor and Glory, a virtual reality game set aboard Titanic. On the 75th anniversary of Titanic sinking in 1987, Charles Haas explained the public's ongoing fascination with the disaster: \\"We admire the great display of courage and heroism -- latent qualities in people not often seen in this hurry-up world\\". Both Haas and John Eaton appeared in the acclaimed television documentary, Titanic: The Complete Story, produced by A&E; Television Networks in 1994 and Haas narrated the Discovery Channel program Titanic: Untold Stories, which featured footage taken during his second dive to the wreck in 1996. \\"The Unknown Child\\", identified in 2007 In 2007, the identity of \\"The Unknown Child\\" buried in Fairview Lawn Cemetery was finally established by DNA evidence to be Sidney Leslie Goodwin, after having been thought by researchers to be another toddler. The Society had been following the ongoing research closely, having previously published an article, \\"The Identity of Titanic Unknown Child\\", in its Fall 2002 Voyage journal. Haas was asked by USA Today for comment on the new finding. He said, \\"Science is a fluid thing, it's not set in concrete\\". When the last living Titanic survivor, Millvina Dean, died in 2009, Haas called her a \\"remarkable, sparkling lady\\". Speaking for the Society, he told the Chicago Tribune, \\"She knew her place in history and was always willing to share her story with others\\". The BBC also interviewed him about the death of Dean, whom he had met several times. He told the British audience: \\"She had a marvelous approach to life. It is almost as if God gave her the gift and she really took advantage of it\\". Another book by Eaton and Haas, Titanic: Destination Disaster: The legends and the reality, was subsequently cited by Stephen Brown, et al., in the academic publication, Journal of Consumer Research. In their journal article, \\"Titanic: Consuming the Myths and Meanings of an Ambiguous Brand\\", the authors examined the public's fascination with all aspects of the Titanic story and its marketing, while separating fact from fiction. They referred to the book's factual recounting of the ship's construction and launching at the Harland and Wolff shipyards. The Society was again approached by the news media when Australian tycoon Clive Palmer announced plans to build and sail a replica, dubbed Titanic II. Haas doubted the likelihood of commercial success such a reincarnation of the original Titanic would have, telling the New York Times, \\"As good as the Titanic was in her day, it would be a practical and financial disaster\\", due to the relative lack of onboard activities and amenities today's traveling public expects, such as theaters, casinos, and waterslides. Commenting on the project's appropriateness, Scientific American quoted him as saying, \\"It's a matter of sensitivity, respect and thoughtfulness ... We commemorate tragedies and those lost in them, not duplicate them\\".

It is a yellow, tube-forming or encrusting sponge and is native to the eastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea; the type locality is the Adriatic Sea. Description Aplysina aerophoba forms colonies up to across of irregular, yellow, tubular processes. Individual tubes are up to long and wide, with small oscula or exhalant pores in the centre of the flattened end. The surface of both basal mass and tubes bears small, cylindrical projections of variable length. The surface is slippery to the touch and the texture is firm and rubbery. When removed from water, this sponge turns blue, leading to its specific name \\"aerophoba\\" (Greek: \\"fear of air\\"). Aplysina aerophoba could be confused with another yellow sponge, Aplysina cavernicola, but the two have different textures, morphology and pigmentation, and occupy different habitats, with A. aerophoba being found in sunlit spots and A. cavernicola in marine caves. Another, dis-similar, dwarf yellow sponge has been found in the Mediterranean in the early 21st century; genetic analysis has confirmed that it is a miniature form of A. aerophoba. The dwarf form is a bright sulphur yellow colour and forms small lobular patches on the surface of rocks. These do not usually touch each other, but there may be some non-apparent connection between them. Each lobe is somewhere between in diameter and often has small, slender cylindrical projections a few millimetres long. The surface is pitted with small puncture marks which correspond to the inhalant pores. The oscula are very small, usually less than 1 mm in diameter. Distribution and habitat Aplysina aerophoba is chiefly a Mediterranean species, but is also found in adjacent parts of the Atlantic Ocean in Portugal and northwestern Spain. It is common in the Canary Islands. Its depth range is from the lower intertidal zone to about , usually being found in sunlit locations. The dwarf form is known from a few locations in the Mediterranean Sea including Liguria, Provence and Corsica, and lives in caves and under overhangs in very shallow water. Ecology This sponge feeds by drawing water in through small pores known as ostia at the base of the sponge and ejecting the water from the oscula, having filtered out organic particles such as bacteria, unicellular algae and tiny particles of detritus. It is a hermaphrodite; the gametes are released into the sea where fertilisation occurs, the larvae are planktonic and soon settle in a suitable location and undergo metamorphosis into juvenile sponges. Under certain conditions, the sponge can produce buds which separate off from the parent and form new colonies.

It was held as late as the 1950s, and was repudiated or superseded by the Second Vatican Council of 1962‚Äì1965. History Catholic theology prior to Vatican II held that the ideal was a confessional state unified with the Church, with the reasoning that the Catholic Church's revealed truth would lead to \\"perfect justice\\", and if the state allowed error to be expressed, it would detract from this. The underpinning of this preference for an absolutist confessional state was the view that error had no rights, and that non-Catholics could or should be persecuted. According to this traditional view, people who were not members of the Catholic Church did not deserve any civil and political rights because they were deemed to be in error. For centuries, the Catholic Church maintained close connection to the state and used state coercion (such as the Inquisition) to punish people who they deemed to be heretics. In practice, while often persecuted, non-Catholics in Catholic-majority countries were sometimes tolerated, often either because of the personal sensitivities by members of the clergy, or out of hope of converting people to Catholicism. In 1832, Pope Gregory XVI released the encyclical , rejecting freedom of the press, religious liberty, and separation of church and state as based on indifferentism. Liberty of conscience, Gregory wrote, was \\"a pestilence more deadly to the state than any other\\". The arguments condemning freedom of religion were reiterated by Pius IX in his 1864 Syllabus of Errors. Repudiation The American Catholic theologian John Courtney Murray worked throughout the 1950s to reconcile Catholic teachings with religious pluralism and democracy. He encountered significant resistance from more traditionalist Catholics. However, his ideas were eventually included in the Vatican II reforms as the Declaration on Religious Liberty (1965). According to the new view, people do have rights even if they are considered in error. After Vatican II, some Catholic leaders such as Cardinal J√≥zef Glemp and part of the Spanish Church hierarchy still sympathized with the older \\"error has no rights\\" approach. However, they realized that it was inconsistent with developments in the world at large and therefore supported counter- proselytization rather than legal restrictions on non-Catholic religions. Traditionalist Catholics such as Society of St. Pius X have rejected the Vatican II reforms, especially their teaching on religious liberty.

He promoted the stage works of Bela Bart√≥k and other contemporary music at the Oper Frankfurt, the Cologne Opera, where he conducted the world premiere of The Miraculous Mandarin, and in Berlin. He conducted all of the symphonies by Gustav Mahler. Szenkar escaped the Nazi regime in 1933 to Vienna, Paris, and Moscow, from where he was expelled in a Stalinist purge. He tried to build musical life in Rio de Janeiro from 1939 but returned to Germany after World War II. He remained faithful to his intentions for life, although he was often restricted as a Jew, a foreigner, a perceived leftist, and a non-conformist. As he preferred live performances to recording, few sound documents of his work are extant.  Life  Szenkar was born in Budapest, the son of the conductor, organist and composer N√°ndor Szenk√°r. He appeared in public as a pianist and conductor from an early age. He was accepted into the composition class of Victor von Herzfeld at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music in Budapest in 1908, and also studied with Ernst von Dohnanyi and Hans Koessler in Vienna. Szenkar took up his first position as a r√©p√©titeur at the Budapest Volksoper in 1911. In 1912, he got a contract for one year at the Deutsches Landestheater in Prague, first as a choir director, later as second Kapellmeister. In 1913, he returned to the Budapest Volksoper, which existed until 1915. After one season at the Stadttheater Salzburg and a short intermezzo at the Centraltheater Dresden, he became Kapellmeister at the ducal court theatre in Altenburg, Thuringia, in 1917, a position he held until 1920. There he conducted Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen and all symphonies by Gustav Mahler, then still a composer who was not generally accepted. In 1920, Szenkar became first Kapellmeister, with Ludwig Rottenberg, at the Oper Frankfurt, where Paul Hindemith played principal viola. Szenkar conducted the world premiere of Wellesz' Die Prinzessin GirnaraDie Prinzessin Girnara and the German premieres of Bart√≥k's Herzog Blaubarts Burg and Der holzgeschnitzte Prinz. He met Bart√≥k there and became a pioneer of his works in Germany. From 1923 to 1924, Szenkar was Generalmusikdirektor (GMD) of the Volksoper in Berlin, where he conducted a highly acclaimed performance of Mussorgski's Boris Godunov in 1924. The same year, he succeeded Otto Klemperer at the Cologne Opera. There, he conducted, besides world premieres of contemporary operas (Braunfels, Wellesz), the European premiere of Prokofiev's The Love for Three Oranges, the German premiere of Kod√°ly's H√°ry J√°nos as well as performances of Wagner's Ring cycle and five Mozart operas. He conducted the world premiere of Bart√≥k's Der wunderbare Mandarin on 26 November 1926, but it caused a \\"near riot\\" at the premiere, and further performances were banned by the then-mayor, Konrad Adenauer. In the Gesellschaft f√ºr Neue Musik, he championed contemporary composers with numerous premieres. At opera house concerts, Szenkar performed Mahler's Das Lied von der Erde, his symphonies nos. 2, 3, 5, and 7, as well as Symphony No. 8 with 800 singers. He conducted Sch√∂nberg's Gurre-Lieder with almost 1000 performers. In 1928, the Cologne Opera gave guest performances at the Vienna State Opera with Mozart's Cos√¨ fan tutte, Handel's Giulio Cesare and Debussy's Pell√©as et M√©lisande. The same year, a recording of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony was made for the 100th anniversary of his death. In 1928 and 1932, Szenkar gave guest concerts at the Teatro Col√≥n in Buenos Aires. In 1933, he fled the Nazi regime to Vienna. There he conducted Mahler's Symphony No. 3 with the Wiener S√§ngerknaben, the Wiener Singakademie and the Vienna Symphony Orchestra25.4.1934 / Szenkar, Szantho, Wiener S√§ngerknaben, Singakademie / Mahler Symphonie Nr. 3 Vienna Symphony Orchestra and a performance of Wagner's Der fliegende Holl√§nder. In 1934, Szenkar accepted an invitation to Moscow, where he conducted the State Philharmonic Orchestra and was guest conductor at the Bolshoi Theatre. He also held a conductor class at the State Conservatory. His most famous student was Kirill Kondrashin. Szenkar was friends with Prokofiev and Nikolai Myaskovsky. He conducted the world premieres of Aram Khachaturian's First Symphony and Myaskovsky's 16th symphony. In 1937, he was expelled from Russia during the first great wave of Stalin's purge. In 1938 and 1939, Szenkar lived in Paris where he conducted concerts with the Palestine Orchestra, founded by Bronis≈Çaw Huberman. In 1939, he was invited as guest conductor at the Theatro Municipal of Rio de Janeiro. The beginning of World War II kept him in Brazil, where he and a few colleagues founded the Brazilian Symphony Orchestra in 1940, which he led until 1948. He built up musical life based on European models in Rio, gave up to 80 concerts a year, initiated Sunday matinees and youth concerts and founded a choir of amateur singers. During a guest performance in 1958, he was made an honorary citizen of the city. At the end of 1949, Szenkar returned to Europe and lived in Paris. From 1950 to 1952, he was GMD in Mannheim and at the same time had an extensive guest contract with the Cologne Opera. From 1952 to 1956, he worked as opera manager at the D√ºsseldorf Opera under general manager , and GMD of D√ºsseldorf. In 1954, he led the D√ºsseldorf Symphony Orchestra and the choir of the Musikverein on their first tour abroad. At a concert in the Royal Festival Hall in London, he conducted Bruckner's Seventh Symphony. In 1958, he conducted the world premiere of the Fifth Symphony by Wellesz. He was awarded honorary membership of the International Gustav Mahler Association. In 1960, he resigned as GMD due to his age. In the following years he was a traveling conductor in Europe, particularly to Hungary. His last conducting performance was Bizet's Carmen in Cologne on the occasion of his 80th birthday. Szenkar married the opera singer Hermine Zeitschel. Their son was the music producer and composer . Eugen Szenkar's brother Alexander was also a conductor. Szenkar died in D√ºsseldorf at the age of 85.  Recording  A CD released in 2005 combines a 1928 recording of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony with Mahler's Third and Fourth, recorded after World War II. The Beethoven was recorded with the Staatskapelle Berlin. The Third Mahler, recorded in Cologne in 1951 with the K√∂lner Rundfunk-Sinfonie-Orchester, is possibly the second recording of the work.

He was an MLA in the First Legislative Assembly of Uttar Pradesh. In 1952 he participated in the election on behalf of Indian National Congress from the Deoria (North East) Legislative Assembly constituency of Deoria District of Uttar Pradesh. Farooq, three times MLA, remained very close to Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru. Early life The younger son of Maulvi Muhammad Ismail Chishti, resident of Railway Station Road, Mohammad Farooq Chishti was born in 1901. His father, barrister Maulvi Muhammad Ismail, born in Jaunpur, returned to India after graduating from Cambridge University and settled in Deoria. Farooq's family enrolled in King Edward School (now Government Inter College). It was during the initial training that they started participating in the movements to liberate the country. His name came up in the Chauri Chaura incident, which caused Headmaster Akhtar Adil to give the advice to send him to school elsewhere, so as to avoid a British reaction. This was followed by Allahabad, where Farooq is credited with organizing the students' first successful strike. During that time he came in contact with Mahatma Gandhi and became very close to him. Political activity After that, whenever Gandhi and Nehru came to Deoria district, they stopped at the Chishti House on Railway Station Road. After the efforts of Jung-e-Azadi, an important character and close to Mahatma Gandhi Maulana Mazharul Haq, his elder brother Hamid Chishti left the British and joined the fight for independence. Hamdi was jailed several times. Due to this, Chishti House became a hideout for the freedom lovers. Mohammad Farooq Chishti blew the trumpet against the British rule during the First World War. He brought the proposal of the post of Home Minister of Pakistan on behalf of Muhammad Ali Jinnah to the king of Salempur, saying that it was not the ticket of Muslim League and that the country needed independence. By-elections in Uttar Pradesh were held in 1950 in four assembly constituencies in which Farooq Chishti of Congress could win. Apart from this, he won the general elections in 1952 and also won in 1957, but was defeated in 1962. Became MLA for the third time in 1967. He died in 1968.

She had been renamed Ro-39 by the time she was launched on 6 March 1943 and completed and commissioned on 12 September 1943. Service history Upon commissioning, Ro-39 was attached to the Maizuru Naval District. On 25 December 1943 she was assigned to Submarine Division 34 in the 6th Fleet. In company with the submarine , she departed Maizuru on 28 December 1943 bound for Truk, which she reached on 6 January 1944. At Truk, she took aboard stores from the auxiliary submarine tender on 17 January 1944. Ro-38 got underway from Truk on 20 January 1944 with the commander of Submarine Division 34 aboard to begin her first war patrol, assigned a patrol area in the Caroline Islands in the vicinity of Woleai. On 22 January 1944, she received orders to rescue Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service aircrews of the 531st Naval Air Group at Woleai and the 755th Naval Air Group at Maloelap. With U.S. ships gathering for the invasion of the Marshall Islands, Ro-39 was ordered on 30 January 1944 to move to a patrol area northeast of Wotje. The United States Navy destroyer gained radar contact on a vessel on the surface on the night of 1 February 1944. She closed with it and fired star shells which illuminated a submarine, probably Ro-39. The submarine crash-dived, but Walker picked it up on sonar and sank it with a single depth-charge attack at . The 6th Fleet received a distress signal on 2 February 1944 at 10:38 Japan Standard Time that Ro-39 transmitted as she crash-dived, but it was indecipherable. On 6 February and again on 10 February 1944, the 6th Fleet ordered Ro-39 to return to Truk, but she did not acknowledge the order either time. On 5 March 1944, the Imperial Japanese Navy declared her to be presumed lost east of Wotje with all 70 hands. She was stricken from the Navy list on 30 April 1944.

Description Pimelea venosa is an erect shrub that typically grows to a height of with its stems and leaves densely covered with long, soft, whitish hairs. The leaves are elliptic to lance-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, long and wide. The flowers are bisexual, white, arranged in groups of three to six with between two and six small, leaf-like bracts at the base. The fruit is oval, green and about long. Taxonomy and naming Pimelea venosa was first formally described in 1983 by S. Threlfall in the journal Brunonia, from a specimen collected by Ernst Betche near Bolivia in 1886. Distribution and habitat Bolivia Hill rice-flower is only known from near Bolivia on the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales but was previously recorded near Tenterfield and east of this region. Surveys in 1999 and after a bushfire in 2012 found no plants in known sites but after a low intensity fire in late 2019, about 200 seedlings were found.

One of the greatest Greek midfielders of the 90s, Vassilis Karapialis, and prolific striker Theofanis Gekas, both started their career from the club.  History  The club was founded in 1943 during the Axis occupation of Greece and a few years later it started playing in the league of the Thessaly Football Clubs Association until 1960 and subsequently in the league of the Larissa Football Clubs Association until 1964. In that year, the club alongside other three local clubs from the town of Larissa formed AEL, and after merging with Panthessalikos it was renamed to Olympos Larissa F.C. Two years later in 1966, Toxotis under the new name of Olympos Larissa F.C., won the Larissa Football Clubs Association championship and gained promotion to Gamma Ethniki. In 1976 the club returned to its original name Toxotis and 11 years later in 1986 managed to win promotion to Delta Ethniki for first time in its history after winning the Larissa Football Clubs Association championship.  Stadium  Toxotis Larissa first stadium was the Alcazar Stadium in the town of Larissa which was the largest in Thessaly in the 1940s with a capacity of 8.000. The club played there alongside other local teams such as Iraklis Larissa, Aris Larissa and Larisaikos until 1964, the year that the four of them merged to form AEL. During the 80s and 90s Toxotis played its home games in the training ground which is right next to Alcazar Stadium, with a wooden stand of a 400 capacity. The club has been using the Koukoulitsios-Mousiaris pitch in recent years, a ground which was named after two local footballers, Dimitrios Koukoulitsios and Dimitrios Mousiaris who died at young age in a car accident in 1979.  Club's academy  Toxotis Larissa former player Christos Gkatas was in charge of the youth academy and at the helm of the club from 2011 to 2020. But in 2018 the club's youth academy was dissolved and moved under the umbrella of AEL, the biggest club of the town of Larissa in a bid for Toxotis to get financial aide.  Chairman Tourlakopoulos  Stavros Tourlakopoulos was involved in Toxotis board of directors since 1964 and the merge with Panthessalikos, a club of which he was the chairman between 1960‚Äì1964.

It is a Category I registered building on the West Coast of New Zealand.  Background  The first St Andrew's Church in Hokitika was built in February 1867, following the arrival of the first minister of the Hokitika parish, Reverend John Gow. It was a wooden building with a prominent spire, sited on Stafford Street. In 1919, the congregation of St Andrew's elected to build a new church, to be known as the Scot's Memorial Church, to honour the contribution of Westland Scots who died in the First World War and as an offering to God for the Allied victory. A ground-breaking ceremony was held on Peace Day in 1919, although the church was eventually built on a different site. An architect was not commissioned until 1931, when Roy Lovell-Smith completed his design. Construction was then delayed by both the choice of site and financial problems. Tenders were finally called In January 1935, and a month later the tender for ¬£2,450 from J.O. Grant of Christchurch was accepted. The church was officially opened on 24 November 1935, at a final cost of just over ¬£2,540. The original church building of 1867 was used as a Sunday School, until it was demolished in 1946. In 1941, a booklet describing the history of the church was published to celebrate the 75th anniversary. In 1970, the Presbyterian St Andrew's Church united with the Methodist church to form St Andrew's United Parish.  Construction  The church is built in the Gothic style with a minimum of interior ornamentation. The tower is notable for having wide Gothic arch windows on four sides. The Westland Scots Memorial inside St Andrew's Church The church is built of reinforced concrete, with double walls and exterior roughcast cement plaster. The roof is slate with wooden bargeboards. The interior walls are plastered, and the ceiling and interior fittings, all designed by the architect, are of oiled rimu. The church contains the Westland Scots Memorial, a marble roll of honour listing forty locals fallen in the First World War.  Current status  The church is registered by Heritage New Zealand as a Category I structure, with registration number 5013. The listing recognises the importance of St Andrew's as the first Presbyterian congregation to be established on the West Coast, and the church as a visible symbol of that, as well as a memorial. Further, the listing describes the building as a fine example of a small Gothic style parish church, and acknowledges its importance as a local landmark. The Roll of Honour in the church is 'very fine'.

The reasons that prompted the Russian politicians to revive the ex-USSR are quite complex - from the imperial mentality of Russians, aimed not at the development of their state, but at the enslavement of neighbouring nations, to the desire to keep the production capacities of the former USSR and guaranteed sales markets under their control. Thus, relations with Ukraine in Russia were traditionally viewed in the context of their global geopolitical interests. The information war against Ukraine is being waged by all possible means, and not only Ukrainians are its indirect victims. As an example, the well-known statement of Vladimir Putin addressed to US President George W. Bush: ¬´You understand, George, that Ukraine is not even a state! What is Ukraine? Part of its territory is Eastern Europe, and another part, and a significant one, was donated by us!¬ª(From a conversation between Vladimir Putin and George W. Bush, Bucharest, April 2‚Äì4, 2008). Since November 2013, when Viktor Yanukovych blocked the legislatively enshrined course towards European integration and began the Revolution of Dignity in the country, the Kremlin propaganda has evolved into an openly chauvinistic, aggressively imperial and deceitful information war against Ukraine, which had the goal of preparing wolds public opinion for external aggression of Russian Federation to Ukraine. The beginning of the Russian-Ukrainian war in 2014 marked Russia's desire to increase its influence on Ukraine,–õ—ñ—è –ê—Ö–µ–¥–∂–∞–∫–æ–≤–∞ –≤–≤–∞–∂–∞—î, —â–æ –ø—Ä–æ–ø–∞–≥–∞–Ω–¥–∞ —ñ —Ü–µ–Ω–∑—É—Ä–∞ –≤ –†–æ—Å—ñ—ó –ø–æ—Å–∏–ª—é—é—Ç—å—Å—è, –¢–°–ù which began a geopolitical turn to the West with the Revolution of Dignity. Traditionally for Russia, this influence began to take the form of a hybrid (in fact - undeclared) war, bordering on state terrorism. Thus, the information war, which Russia intensified with the beginning of the Russian armed aggression, is aimed at providing information to the separatist movement in eastern Ukraine, weakening the control of the central government, and creating security and economic problems  Informational potential and resources of the parties  = Russia =  Media  The Russian media, including those accredited in the West, were used for intensive, multi-channel propaganda and persuading the world community in the points of view proposed by the Russian military-political leadership. Among the most famous: Sputnik, RussiaToday, Ria Novosti, LifeNews. According to Simon Schuster, the global network RussiaToday is the main weapon of the Russian authorities in the information war. Its audience as of 2015 was 700 million people in more than 100 countries around the world. The budget of RussiaToday for 2012 was ‚Ç¨275 million, and in 2014 it was already $500 million. As of 2012, this channel ranked first in the world in terms of government spending per employee, which reached $183 thousand per person. According to former US Congressman Dan Mike, as of 2014, Russia has spent more than $9 billion on its propaganda. At the local level, Russia also funds numerous pro-Russian regional media outlets, including in Ukraine.  Information Operations Forces  According to the American Washington Post, in 2014 the Russian military intelligence (RMI) created more than 30 pseudo- Ukrainian groups and social media accounts, as well as 25 \\"leading English- language\\" publications. Posing as ordinary Ukrainians, RMI operatives concocted news and disseminated comments to turn pro-Russian citizens against the protesters.National Security Inside a Russian disinformation campaign in Ukraine in 2014 In February 2017, the Russian Minister of Defense acknowledged the existence of \\"information operations forces\\" in Russia.  Representatives of culture  Representatives of Russian culture and their products, which directly or indirectly glorify baseness, extol the life and customs of representatives of the underworld, make heroes of representatives of Russian power structures, and the like, have become another means of waging war.  Using Wikipedia as a Means of Information Warfare  The high webometric characteristics of Wikipedia and other factors that determine the great popularity of the free online encyclopedia do not go unnoticed by the structures waging an information war. One of the most used methods in this plane is the influence on historical consciousness. A typical example is the article \\"Kievan Rus\\" of the Russian-language segment of Wikipedia and the war of edits that goes around this article, or the article \\"Konotop battle\\" (rus.), in which the Konotop battle is defined as an episode of the Russian- Polish war (in the Russian-language Wikipedia, the Russian-Ukrainian wars are absent as a concept ). On the other hand, the Russian version of Wikipedia lacks articles on Russian soldiers who died as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine or were taken prisoner, and there is no article on the Russian forces invading Ukraine. = Ukraine =  Media  On August 11, 2014, the first Ukrainian international TV channel, Ukraine Today, began broadcasting in test mode.  Ukrainian Crisis Media Center  With the beginning of the Russian aggression, the Ukrainian Crisis Media Center was created, which is a platform for speeches by experts, government officials, international organizations and the diplomatic corps. It provides support to media representatives who cover events in Ukraine.  Methods  = Russian =  The split of self-identification  Beginning in the 2000s, Russia launched a large-scale anti-Ukrainian and anti-Western propaganda on the territory of Ukraine, which was based on the doctrine of the \\"Russian World\\". The ideological basis of this doctrine is the revanchism of the Russian Federation for the collapse of the Soviet Union through the cultural, economic, and then the political restoration of Russia within the borders of the USSR until 1991 and the restoration of the former \\"zone of influence\\". in the Soviet camp \\"in Europe and Asia.–¶–µ–Ω–∑—É—Ä–∞ –≤ –†–æ—Å—ñ—ó: –∑–∞–∫—Ä–∏–ª–∏ –ó–ú–Ü, —â–æ –ø–∏—à—É—Ç—å –ø—Ä–∞–≤–¥—É –ø—Ä–æ –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—É–ú–ó–° –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏ —Å—Ç—É—Ä–±–æ–≤–∞–Ω–µ —Å–∏—Ç—É–∞—Ü—ñ—î—é –∑—ñ —Å–≤–æ–±–æ–¥–æ—é —Å–ª–æ–≤–∞ –≤ –†–æ—Å—ñ—ó. –ö–æ—Ä–µ—Å–ø–æ–Ω–¥–µ–Ω—Ç (–∂—É—Ä–Ω–∞–ª)–¶–µ–Ω–∑—É—Ä–∞ –≤ –¥—ñ—ó: –ú—ñ–Ω–∫—É–ª—å—Ç –†–æ—Å—ñ—ó –∑–∞–±–æ—Ä–æ–Ω–∏–≤ –≤–∏—Å—Ç–∞–≤—É –ø—Ä–æ –ú–∞–π–¥–∞–Ω –Ω–∞ –∫–Ω–∏–∂–∫–æ–≤–æ–º—É —Ñ–µ—Å—Ç–∏–≤–∞–ª—ñ. –ï—Å–ø—Ä–µ—Å–æ TV–£ —Ä–æ—Å—ñ–π—Å—å–∫–∏—Ö —Å–æ—Ü—ñ–∞–ª—å–Ω–∏—Ö –º–µ—Ä–µ–∂–∞—Ö –∞–≤—Ç–æ–º–∞—Ç–∏—á–Ω–æ –≤–∏–¥–∞–ª—è—é—Ç—å –ø–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –∑ –∫—Ä–∏—Ç–∏–∫–æ—é –ü—É—Ç—ñ–Ω–∞. –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–∏–π —Ç–∏–∂–¥–µ–Ω—å According to this doctrine, three categories of the world's population are considered \\"Russians\\":–†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–∏–µ —Å–µ–Ω–∞—Ç–æ—Ä—ã –ø–æ–¥–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∞–ª–∏ –∑–∞–∫–æ–Ω–æ–ø—Ä–æ–µ–∫—Ç –æ —Å–æ–æ—Ç–µ—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–∏–∫–∞—Ö, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–π –ø–æ–∑–≤–æ–ª–∏—Ç –∏–º –≤—ä–µ–∑–∂–∞—Ç—å –≤ –†–§ –±–µ–∑ –≤–∏–∑—ã ‚Äî NEWSru.com, 12 –∞–ø—Ä–µ–ª—è 2006 ethnic Russians, regardless of where they live; Russian-speaking population regardless of nationality; compatriots who have ever lived on the territory of the Russian Empire, the USSR and other state entities, as well as their descendants.  Stamps and cliches  Since the collapse of the USSR, Russia has implemented a developed system of anti-Ukrainian propaganda and disinformation, which was aimed at forming an image of the enemy, splitting Ukrainian civil society, changing the guidelines of social and political development, etc. A whole series of propaganda clich√©s have become striking signs of this propaganda and disinformation. One of the first such propaganda cliches in the early 1990s was the clich√© in which the phenomena of that time were usually presented together with the phrases ‚Äúafter the collapse of the USSR‚Äù, ‚Äúwith the collapse of the USSR‚Äù, etc., which subconsciously created the impression that these phenomena arose in as a result of the collapse of the USSR, and not, among other things, for the reasons that led to the collapse. In the early 1990s, propaganda clich√©s became popular, designed to prove the economic and then political bankruptcy of Ukraine as a state. It was at this time that the well-known ¬´Ukraine steals Russian gas¬ª, ¬´Independent¬ª instead of ¬´Ukraine¬ª and others belong.  Disinformation and falsification  Disinformation and falsifications were used by Russia mainly to create the illusion of the significance and greatness of Russia, and in some cases - as a way to avoid responsibility for illegal actions. Thus, one of the examples of creating the illusion of one's significance was the falsification of photographs of the visit of the Russian patriarch to Kharkiv in 2011,–£ –•–ê–†–ö–û–í–Ü –í–Ü–†–Ø–ù –î–û –ö–ò–†–ò–õ–ê ¬´–ó–Ü–ì–ù–ê–õ–ò¬ª –§–û–¢–û–®–û–ü–û–ú where painted people were found.

Blocking Ukrainian media and Facebook accounts  * On August 10, 2014, the German provider Hetzner Online AG sent a letter of forgiveness to Glavkom. The provider previously wanted to block the Glavkom at the request of the Russian \\"Roskomnadzor\\" for publishing material about the March for the federalization of Siberia. * According to the host MSNBC in October 2017, Russian information warfare operatives used surprisingly successful blocking technology on Ukrainian activists to remove Ukrainian voices from Facebook and deny Russian competition in the information space during the invasion of a neighbouring state. The operatives \\"reported\\" the posts of Ukrainian activists, and whatever the posts or photos were, they claimed that it was pornography or another category of messages that Facebook has to eliminate. * On July 14, 2014, the administration of the Facebook social network blocked the page \\"Book of Memory of the Fallen for Ukraine\\" in this network. Before blocking, the social network warned that the content of some messages ‚Äúviolates Facebook standards.‚Äù. It was primarily messages about the death of Ukrainian soldiers from the OZSP NSU ‚ÄúAzov‚Äù. I * n July 2019, the German provider Hetzner Online GmbH warned the Ukrainian Week that the site should be blocked until \\"extremist content\\" is removed. The provider received a request for this from Roskomnadzor, which considers the 2015 material on Right Sector to be a violation of Russian legislation.  Discrediting the discussion  According to The Guardian, the statistics of discussions under articles of the newspaper, which mentions Ukraine, receive tens to hundreds of times more discussions, comments, etc., destroying the type and possibility of discussion. According to Natalia Popovich, the co-founder of the UCMC, the armies of bots paid by Russia only undermine the discussions in the forums in which they participate. Thus, undermining confidence in Russia as a source of information. = Ukrainian =  Propaganda and disinformation  At different stages of the Russian-Ukrainian information war, the methods of waging it changed from emphasizing the desire for freedom from the predominantly Soviet past, which was not directly identified with Russian imperial politics, to the assertion of national characteristics Ukrainian compared with Russians (Ukraine is not Russia) and to a confrontation with Russian all-out propaganda aimed at concealing or justifying Russian armed aggression against Ukraine. At the same time, despite the transformation of methods of information confrontation and temporary concessions, they were based on the formation of public opinion based on truthful information about real facts and events.  Blocking Russian and pro-Russian media  Since the summer of 2014, the State Committee for Television and Radio Broadcasting of Ukraine began fighting against separatist and anti-state materials in the media. In October 2014, they have revoked the certificates of state registration of 1 collection, 7 newspapers and 11 magazines.–î–µ—Ä–∂–∫–æ–º—Ç–µ–ª–µ—Ä–∞–¥—ñ–æ –∑–≤–∏–Ω—É–≤–∞—Ç–∏–ª–æ –≤ —Å–µ–ø–∞—Ä–∞—Ç–∏–∑–º—ñ 18 –≥–∞–∑–µ—Ç —Ç–∞ –∂—É—Ä–Ω–∞–ª—ñ–≤ –¢–í—ñ. 16.10.2014  Prerequisites  The first victims of the information war before the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine were the Russians themselves: the propaganda of a future war against Ukraine covered almost all spheres of their public and private life.

A huge number of actors - citizens of Russia, Ukraine and other countries - as well as other specialists in Ukraine, are involved to get the right TV picture. For several months, DDoS-attacks have been carried out on Ukrainian information sites: Censor.NET, Tizhden.ua, Ukrainskaya Pravda and others - as well as on the website of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, with the appearance of ads for V. Yanukovych. Representatives of the leadership and diplomats of the Russian Federation in their speeches, including speeches at the UN, spread false information.

In Russia, neo-Nazi organizations are encouraged by the special services. The letter also states that \\"stability in our country is under threat. And this threat comes from the Russian authorities, that is, from you. It is your policy of inciting separatism and crude pressure on Ukraine that poses a threat to us - the Jews, as well as to the entire people of Ukraine, including the inhabitants of Crimea and southeastern Ukraine, and they will be convinced of this very quickly \\"[56]. An assessment of the information war against Ukraine on March 7 was given by Yevhen Marchuk, the former head of the SBU, earlier - the prime minister, defence minister and secretary of the NSDC of Ukraine. He also pointed out the necessary measures of state bodies today to counter the information and military aggression of the Russian Federation [57]. The well-known Russian politician Boris Nemtsov described the information war, which is the information support for the aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, as a war of the Nazi regime against a democratic state: ‚ÄúThe Nazis with Goebbels at their head can win the war. The fact that Ukraine has lost the information war is a fact. But the fact that you shouldn't worry too much about this is also a fact. You are not a Nazi state, \\"the Russian oppositionist said. = Information attacks of the aggressor = On March 6, ‚Äú1 + 1‚Äù and the fifth TV channels were turned off on the territory of the ARC. Earlier, the Russian TV channel \\"Russia 24\\" captured the air frequencies of the Crimean private \\"Chernomorskaya TV and Radio Company\\". The state television and radio company Krym in Simferopol was also blocked by people in camouflage uniforms without weapons. General Director of the TV and Radio Company Stepan Gulevaty called the police, but they did not respond to the call [59]. On March 6, 2014, an Internet referendum was held on the ATR TV channel website, during which one could express one's opinion on the annexation of Crimea to the Russian Federation. Most of the people who took part in the vote were against. [60] Therefore, on March 7, the Russian military in Crimea disconnected the first Crimean Tatar TV channel ATR from the Internet. On the same day, they stopped the analogue broadcasting of the Ukrainian TV channel Inter, on the frequencies of which NTV is broadcast. [60] = Complete denial of the introduction of their troops = At meetings and in an interview, V. Putin for some time denied that the troops of the Russian Federation were brought into the territory of Ukraine. On April 17, he recognized the presence of Russian troops in Crimea even before the ‚Äúreferendum‚Äù, which ‚Äúprotected‚Äù the Russian-speaking part of the population. But representatives of the population argued that they did not need protection.  The course of events  = 2014 = With the beginning of the occupation and annexation of Crimea and Ukraine's resistance to the Russian aggression in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the information policy of the Russian Federation turned into total military disinformation aggression aimed at demonizing the Ukrainian leadership in the eyes of the Russian and international communities. [61] [62 ] [63] [64]. One of the first and main manifestations of the information war was the throwing into the information space of the thesis of an unconstitutional coup in Ukraine. At the same time, the Russian media and Russian politicians deliberately distorted the provisions of the Constitution of Ukraine, according to which power in Ukraine belongs to the people and is exercised by them through elected representatives, and that the current power at the time and after the Revolution of Dignity all countries, including Russia itself. The next thesis was about the unconstitutional nature of removing Viktor Yanukovych from power and appointing acting President Alexander Turchinov. At the same time, it was not mentioned that the exclusive right to interpret the Constitution of Ukraine belongs not to Russian politicians and various experts, but exclusively to the Constitutional Court of Ukraine, which in its current composition of anti-constitutional actions in the appointment of acting did not find the president. * On the night of February 20‚Äì21, 2014, in Korsun- Shevchenkivskyi, Cherkasy Region, a bus convoy of Anti-Maidan participants was stopped by Euromaidan activists and residents. They took the anti-Maidan activists off the buses, smashed the windows and burned several buses. Russian media have come up with a story about 7 Anti-Maidan participants who died in the fight. On April 3, 2014, the occupying Crimean authorities made a statement about 7 people dead and 30 went missing as a result of an attack by Ukrainian activists on a convoy of anti-Maidan buses near Korsun. There were no casualties or missing in the episode, on the contrary, three Maidan activists who were held hostage were released from the buses. [66] [67] [68] Vladimir Putin called this story the reason for the military operation in Crimea, and the killings of anti-Maidan activists near Korsun were later reflected in the Russian film ‚ÄúCrimea. The way home \\", which is positioned as a documentary. * On March 2, 2014, Russian media reported on the alleged shooting of Ukrainian saboteurs by the crowd and the House of Trade Unions near the Crimean Cabinet in Simferopol. The masked saboteurs were armed with modern Russian weapons, including the latest GM-94 grenade launcher, and the \\"victims\\" of the attack were unharmed. * On March 19, 2014, Russian media reported that a 17-year-old Lviv sniper who had fired in Simferopol the day before had been detained, killing APU serviceman Sergei Kokurin and a Russian mercenary. Information about the 17-year-old sniper was not further confirmed, but Igor Girkin later admitted that the responsibility for the shooting lay with his assault unit. * On March 24, 2014, several media outlets reported that the deputy commander of the Kerch Marine Battalion, Alexei Nikiforov, had written a statement about joining the Russian army. However, Alexei went to the mainland and studied at a Ukrainian military university. * On April 27, 2014, Russian media covered a story about \\"EU concentration camps in Ukraine.\\" * On April 28, 2014, the Russian news agency ITAR-TASS commented on the brutal attack by a pro-Russian mob at a Ukrainian peaceful march in Donetsk as \\"[Ukrainian] radicals attacked members of thousands of anti-fascist marches.\\" * In June 2014, after the capture of Nadezhda Savchenko, Russian TV channels, in particular, NTV and Channel 5, showed the story, using an excerpt from an interview with Nastya Stanko from a soldier Vladimir Kosolap, a resident of Happiness and a fighter \\"Aidar\\". Russian media presented his words as a confession of a \\"punisher\\" from a barricading detachment, who was ordered to shoot anyone who did not want to kill \\"his fellow citizens\\" - members of pro- Russian armed groups. However, in the full Public video of June 16, 2014, Vladimir Kosolap denies the misinformation of the Russian propaganda media LifeNews about the alleged executions of the city's residents after its liberation by Ukrainian forces. He also said that if any of Aidar's fighters had such an opinion, Volodymyr would have shot him with his hand, which was taken out of context by Russian propaganda. * On July 15, 2014, the English- language Russian resource The Voice of Russia published an article in which pro-Russian militants attributed the killing of Pentecostals in Sloviansk to \\"Ukrainian nationalists,\\" twisting Anton Gerashchenko's words. * In late July- early August 2014, a video of Bohdan Butkevich was widely publicized, allegedly calling for the destruction of 1.5 million Donbas residents. [77] [78] The video is a rough snippet from his interview, which completely distorts the meaning of what was said. = 2015 = * On March 23, 2015, Russian resources spread the news about the alleged death of a 10-year-old girl from Ukrainian shelling in the Petrovsky district of Donetsk. [80] BBC correspondent Natalia Antelava went to Donetsk to find out the details, and it turned out that the whole death story was invented by Russian propaganda. The journalist asked Russian media about the girl's death, to which they replied that \\"she is not here anymore\\" and no one was killed. When asked why TV stories were published about it then, they answered that they were \\"forced\\". [81] [82] [83]2016 = 2016 = * On December 12, 2016, the press centre of the Special Operations Forces of Ukraine reported that unofficial information resources appeared with symbols and photo materials of the Special Operations Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which may provide distorted official or unverified information. * On December 13, 2016, Russian media preliminarily accused Ukraine of initiating gas theft. * On December 22, 2016, the American cybersecurity company CrowdStrike released a report according to which Russian hackers from the Fancy Bear group monitored the situation of APU D-30 howitzers through an Android application written by Ukrainian gunner Yaroslav. 2017 2018 = Staged videos = * On July 22, 2015, the information resources of the Luhansk People's Republic organization spread the news that a warehouse of American weapons was discovered during the excavation of the debris near Luhansk airport. The video allegedly showed army boxes and an American Stinger MANPADS. The analysis of the video revealed that the Stinger demonstrated was a rough model of a weapon of poor quality welded from pipes, and the markings on it were taken from the video game Battlefield 3, including the identification number and an error in the text. [104] [105] The fake was distributed by the Russian media, in particular by RIA Novosti and TV-Zvezda. [106] [107] * On the eve of the Dutch referendum on the signing of the EU- Ukraine Association Agreement, on January 18, 2016, a video was circulated through Russian sources where Azov fighters allegedly burned the flag of the Netherlands. The video was exposed as a Russian forgery. * On December 2, 2016, an attempt by the speakers of the DNR organization and the Cyberberkut group to accuse Ukraine of fighting ISIS militants on the side of the Azov Regiment was stopped. In materials released in January 2016, there were photos and video productions by pro-Russian militants, where armed men with ISIS and Azov symbols fired on industrial buildings. [109] [110] The building was identified as the hangars of the Isolation mineral wool plant in Donetsk, which in 2011 were converted into an art space for the Isolation art project, and in June 2014 were seized by pro-Russian militants. [111] [112 * On July 23, 2018, a video was spread through the Russian media, where allegedly a special unit of the SBU stormed the base of Ukrainian volunteers using armoured personnel carriers. The video then showed a scene of the alleged beating of volunteers. As early as July 25, the video was exposed as fake: the SBU uniform had outdated elements and insignia; the armoured personnel carrier had white identification lines in a form that has not been used for a long time, as well as anti-accumulation grilles, which the SBU does not equip the equipment with. Actors who played SBU special forces spoke with an accent, threw demonstrative phrases about hatred for Bandera members and unprofessionally imitated the beating with their feet. [113] On September 11, an armoured personnel carrier was filmed on video in Donetsk. [114] [115] On September 20, the location of the staging assault was identified - the territory of the abandoned Reaktiv chemical plant in occupied Donetsk. * On August 16, 2018, a video of alleged brutal detention of a person at a Ukrainian checkpoint was published on an unknown YouTube channel. The video immediately began to be distributed among the Russian occupation forces, in particular through the Lost Armor website. The Ukrainian militarist portal published a revelation of falsification - the appearance of all Ukrainian checkpoints (Majorca, Marinka, Gnutovo, Stanitsa Luhanskaya, as well as Chengar and Kharkiv) was analyzed, and none of them looked like the video. Besides, it was noticed that in a frame there was a minimum of cars and practically there are no people though the Ukrainian checkpoint during the day passes 5-10 thousand. people and 1000-2000 vehicles. Assumptions were also made about falsified car numbers in the frame. The reason for the falsification was an attempt to discredit the SBU program. You are waiting at home - this is exactly the context in the words of the actors in the video.

Plot summary Denial of Destiny is an adventure set on the USS Enterprise; the player characters ‚Äî assumed to be Federation officers ‚Äî are ordered to take Ambassador Fox and a rescue fleet to the doomed planet of Aleriad, which lies in the path of a debris field that will cause an extinction-level event. Although the inhabitants have no knowledge of space travel or the Federation, the player characters are ordered to break the Prime Directive and rescue as many inhabitants as possible. If any inhabitants agree to be rescued, the player characters may have to deal with a revolt when the inhabitants discover their planet has been destroyed. Publication history Denial of Destiny was the third adventure published by FASA for Star Trek: The Role Playing Game, a 40-page book with eight loose-leaf pages containing the deck plans of four starships. The book was written by Andrew Philip Hooper, with interior graphic design and art by Dana Knutson. The cover art used on both the book and the cardstock slipcover packaging is by David Deitrick, from his original artwork, a 12\\" x 16\\" illustration board using airbrush, inks and dyes. Keith DeCandido noted that the \\"abrasive\\" Ambassador Fox first appeared in the original Star Trek TV episode \\"A Taste of Armageddon\\"; Ambassador Fox subsequently made appearances in many Star Trek products, including Denial of Destiny, several novels and the DC Comics Star Trek monthly comic. Reception In the January-February 1985 edition of Different Worlds (Issue #38), William A. Barton called this adventure \\"full of possibilities for exciting Star Trek adventure in the spirit of the TV series' exploration of new worlds and contact of new civilizations.\\" Although Barton viewed the book in a mostly favorable light, he did comment that \\"Denial is not without its problems, though they are minor.\\" He noted that deck plans for the Enterprise were not included, but are necessary, so gamemasters would need to salvage those from another FASA product. Barton also thought the book could have been organized better. Nonetheless, Barton concluded by giving the adventure a rating of 2.5 out of 4 stars, saying, \\"Overall, though, for a solid enjoyable Star Trek adventure, Denial Of Destiny is a sure bet. The website RPG Collecting highlighted Denial of Destiny, noting that it and other FASA products for Star Trek \\"are hard to find, and often, they're even harder to find in good condition. Prices range widely based on condition, but if you're a hard core collector who's interested in collecting their entire line, you can expect to spend a lot of money doing it.\\" References Category:Star Trek: The Role Playing Game adventures ","title":"Denial of Destiny"},{"id":"65383571","text":"Conrad Josef Gustaf van Albedyll (5 October 1786 ‚Äì 5 November 1846) was the last resident of Dutch Suratte between 1818 and 1825. He was an heir of the .  Biography  Conrad Josef Gustaf van Albedyll was born in Colombo, Dutch Ceylon, to Carl Ludwig Maximilian van Albedyll and Maria Amalia de Crouse. His father was a Swedish nobleman originally from Stralsund, who had served as an officer in the Prussian army and had later made a career as a merchant in the service of the Dutch East India Company on Ceylon. His mother was the daughter of the Dutch resident of Kochi. By 1796, Dutch Ceylon and the Dutch possessions on the Indian subcontinent had fallen in the hands of the English due to the provisions of the Kew Letters issued by Dutch stadtholder William V, who wanted to prevent revolutionary France from taking possession of the Dutch holdings in Asia. The Treaty of Amiens of 1802 was supposed to restore all Dutch possessions with the exception of Ceylon to Dutch rule, leading the Dutch to send a commission under the leadership of Carl Ludwig Maximilian van Albedyll, Conrad Josef Gustaf's father, to take possession of the Dutch factory in Suratte. However, before Suratte could be restored to the Dutch, hostilities in Europe had resumed, and Van Albedyll and his company were made prisoners of war on 30 August 1803. Carl Ludwig Maximilian van Albedyll died less than a year later while still imprisoned, on 12 August 1804. When the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814 again restored the Dutch possessions in Suratte to Dutch rule, Conrad Josef Gustaf van Albedyll, who had traveled to Surat as part of the commission under the leadership of his father, was installed as the new resident of Dutch Suratte on 1 May 1818. He remained in office until Dutch Suratte was again relinquished to the British by the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824, which divided East Asia into Dutch and British spheres of influence. After the transfer of the Dutch possessions in Suratte to the British, Conrad Josef Gustaf moved to Kochi, the birthplace of his mother, where he died on 5 November 1846.  Personal life  Henricus Franciscus married Amalia Ernestine van der Stoet on 5 May 1815. They had six children.

History The street follows the line of a Roman road which ran between the walls of Eboracum and the River Ouse. In the Mediaeval period, it was regarded as part of Coney Street, sometimes distinguished as Little Coney Street. It was a narrow street, known for its spur makers, and by 1538 this led to it becoming known as \\"Spurriergate\\". The south-west side of the street is dominated by St Michael's Church, and its churchyard lay on both sides. In 1337, two rows of cottages were built along Spurriergate, on part of the churchyard. In 1770, the width of the street was doubled, leading to the demolition of all the buildings on the north-east side of the street, other than 1 Spurriergate, and their replacement by a terrace, which was itself demolished in 1959. In 1841, the street was widened again, with the length of St Michael's Church being reduced, and all the other buildings being demolished and also replaced by a new terrace. The street now forms part of the city's central shopping area. Layout and architecture The street runs south-east, from the junction of Coney Street and Market Street, to the junction of High Ousegate, Low Ousegate, and Nessgate. On the south-west side, there is a snickelway, the Mediaeval common lane to the river. Notable buildings on the south-west side of the street include St Michael's Church, and the terrace at 4-24 Spurriergate, which is listed. The north-east side is largely occupied by Spurriergate House. The City of York Council is critical of the building, which it describes as having a facade \\"with no interest or depth\\", while the corner is \\"overly dramatic\\".

Their name is derived from the reggage group Scare Dem Crew The crew originated with Dark and his mates running around east London but has since grown to several hundred people who meet every Tuesday. As a group they choose to differentiate themselves from a traditional running club as they are not registered with England Athletics and the emphasis is on family and community. Run Dem Crew are committed to change and work closely with young people across London providing mentoring and advice along with the opportunity to explore London in a safe, unique, positive and supportive environment. The crew are currently based at Brixton Street Gym. Traditionally the group ran in speed groups such as Tortoises, Greyhounds, Hares, Cheetahs and Elites. Dark has recently foregone this method to focus on community culture at Brixton Street Gym. Charlie Dark is also a Lululemon Global Running Ambassador has received a Points of Light award from the UK prime minister Theresa May for his dedication to establishing the alternative running community.  Run Dem Crew Youngers  Charlie Dark has also created the Run Dew crew Youngers initiative, which brings the Run Dem Crew message and ethos to young people in London, giving them the tools and confidence to grow and change their lives and their community for the better. Run Dem Crew is an mix of urban teenagers and positive-minded adults from all walks of life. Charlie as a founder and the group work hard to transform Britain's urban culture, replacing the dangerous and destructive values of the street-gang mentality with a sense of optimism and opportunity.  Membership  The crew rules are as follows: * WE ARE NOT A RUNNING CLUB * LEAVE YOUR EGO AT HOME Run Dem is open to all regardless of speed, class, colour, religion or creed.  Associated Groups  Due its success and size, the group has spawned several other London running crews including Track East as well as off shot community projects including Swim Dem Crew, Bike Dem Crew and Strong Dem Crew.  Events  = London Marathon = Since 2012, the group has organised a cheer zone at mile 21 of the London Marathon transforming it into a street party with music and confetti. The group are well known to place up to 300 signs across the route the night before the race to cheer on the participants. = 'Bridge the Gap' = Dark has made links globally with other run crews and hosts 'Bridge the Gap' events in London. Bridge The Gap is the movement that brings all of the global urban running crews together. Formed by founding father Mike Saes (New York City Bridgerunners) and Charlie Dark, Bridge The Gap connects running culture, lifestyle, music, art and creativity with events around the globe where crews come together to meet, run, create and party together.

Stemming from a French Huguenot family; he notably held the fortress of Graudenz against Napoleon's troops throughout 1807, long past the Peace of Tilsit, until the siege was finally lifted after 11 months. Early life Wilhelm Ren√© While originally named Guillaume Ren√©, the Germanised version is Wilhelm Reinhard. He is mostly referred to in the combined form of Wilhelm Ren√©. de l'Homme de Courbi√®re was born on February 25, 1733, into a Franco-Dutch family, paternally expatriates from the Dauphin√© province, in Maastricht in the Dutch Republic. Following his father, Alexis Baron de l‚ÄôHomme de Courbi√®re, young Courbi√®re joined the Dutch States Army in 1746. He served with the Regiment d‚ÄôAylva in the War of the Austrian Succession, participating in the defense of Bergen op Zoom. He left Dutch service in 1753 and entered the Prussian Army as a company commander in 1757. Then he served in the Third Silesian and Pomeranian wars. Gaining the attention of King Frederick the Great, after the Siege of Schweidnitz (1758) he was given the rank of Major and command of a free battalion.Fischer, p. 15von Alten, p. 851Woodward/Cates, p. 378 After the Siege of Dresden he received the Pour le M√©rite.Henninger, p. 1Lippe-Wei√üenfeld He also fought at Liegnitz and Torgau. Prussian service When the war ended he stayed in the army as garrison commander at Emden. In 1766 Courbi√®re married Sophie von Weiss. The couple, married until her death in 1809, had nine children. Among the laters' private teachers was Johann Gottfried Seume. Courbi√®re was a known duellist, fighting at least two duels during his time in Emden.Henninger, pp. 2-3 Among Courbi√®re's descendants was Ren√© de l'Homme de Courbi√®re, who served as Generalleutnant in the Wehrmacht during World War II. Wilhelm Ren√© de l'Homme de Courbi√®re was made a Generalmajor in 1780 and was a Generalleutnant when the French Revolutionary Wars began. In those he led formations at Verdun and Pirmasens, receiving the Order of the Red Eagle for the later. Then he became a corps commander and in 1798 he was promoted to General der Infanterie. In 1802 he was bestowed with the knighthood of the Order of the Black Eagle. Napoleonic Wars The city and fortress of Graudenz along the Vistula river In 1803 he was made governor and garrison commander at Graudenz, a fortress and city along the Vistula in West Prussia. During the War of the Fourth Coalition much of Prussia was occupied after the Battle of Jena‚ÄìAuerstedt and the Fall of Berlin in 1806. King Frederick William III of Prussia himself relocated to East Prussia, staying at Gradenz for a day during his journey.Fischer, pp. 16, 18-19 While in the follow-up months many isolated Prussian fortresses and detachments surrendered or dissolved, Courbi√®re and his roughly 5,700-strong garrison stood firm on January 22, 1807, when French troops took the city of Graudenz and began blockading the fortress. The French forces consisted of French and Hessian troops as well as contingents of Polish insurgents. Initially commanded by General Marie Fran√ßois Rouyer, their numerous demands to surrender were refused by Courbi√®re. Then, after briefly leaving the field, they reoccupied the city and, by now commanded by General Johann Georg von Sch√§ffer-Bernstein, started besieging the fortress again.Fischer, pp. 24-31 In March Napoleon, impending to besiege Danzig (situated down on the end of the Vistula), sent General Anne Jean Marie Ren√© Savary to demand surrender again. In one of his depeches Savary argued that there was no King of Prussia anymore as he had left his lands in French hands. However, in reference to King Frederick William Courbi√®re refused to surrender and verbally answered \\"While there may be no King of Prussia anymore there still is a King of Graudenz.\\", though the exact wording or meaning is somewhat disputed.The reply, made in French, has been given as Eh bien, √ßa se peut; mais s‚Äôil n‚Äôy a plus un Roi de Prusse, il existe encore un roi de Graudenz. or alternatively as Eh bien, √ßa se peut; mais s‚Äôil n‚Äôy a plus un Roi de Prusse, il existe au moins un roi de Graudenz; with some thinking that King of Graudenz was meant to refer to Courbi√®re himself.Fischer, pp. 32-35 In the following months the siege was intensified, the French got more reinforcements and after Danzig fell command was briefly given to Claude Victor-Perrin, Duc de Belluno before Rouyer took over again.Fischer, p. 35, 40, 42 Graudenz was still in Prussian hands when the Peace of Tilsit was signed on July 9, however Courbi√®re did not receive confirmation of this until July 27. Enclosed in the official dispatch was a royal commission promoting him to Generalfeldmarschall.Fischer, pp. 47-50 Meanwhile, the French, against the statutes of the signed treaty, upheld their blockade of the fortress and continued to occupy the area; their troops now consisted mainly of Saxons under General Georg Friedrich August von Polenz. After the borders between Prussia and the new Duchy of Warsaw were finally set, with Graudenz remaining Prussian territory, on December 12 the blockade was lifted and the last French troops left the city. The siege had ended after 313 days with some 3,140 men remaining in the garrison.Fischer, p. 50, 54 Later life and legacy Courbiere's house within the citadel at Graudenz Afterwards Courbi√®re was named governor general of West Prussia and kept his official residence in Graudenz. He died there on July 23, 1811, and was laid to rest in the garden of the fortress headquarters.Fischer, pp. 55-56 The general was the namesake of two regiments; the 58. Infantry Regiment \\"von Courbi√®re\\", which eventually became the 7th (2nd West Prussian) Grenadier Regiment \\"King William I\\", and decades later later the 19th (2nd Posen) Infantry Regiment \\"von Courbi√®re\\".Fischer, p. 55 Likewise the fortress he defended carried his name from 1893 until it became a Polish possession in 1920 after World War I.Monzer, p. 293 His monument there was removed in the same year.Paetzold, p. 13 He also was the namesake of streets in Emden and Berlin as well as a square in the later.Henninger, p. 3Scholtze, p. 176Elfert See also *List of German field marshals *List of the Pour le M√©rite (military class) recipients Notes Footnotes References    Category:1733 births Category:1811 deaths Category:Field marshals of Prussia Category:Dutch people of French descent Category:German people of Dutch descent Category:German people of French descent Category:Dutch military personnel of the War of the Austrian Succession Category:Prussian military personnel of the Seven Years' War Category:People of the Silesian Wars Category:German military personnel of the French Revolutionary Wars Category:Prussian Army personnel of the Napoleonic Wars Category:Recipients of the Order of the Black Eagle Category:Recipients of the Order of the Red Eagle, 1st class Category:Recipients of the Pour le M√©rite (military class) ","title":"Wilhelm Ren√© de l'Homme de Courbi√®re"},{"id":"65383814","text":"George Bernard Frazer (28 December 1933-20 January 2018), or Bernard Frazer was a Sierra Leonean medical doctor who was a gynaecologist based in Freetown, Sierra Leone.

Indigenous Ways of Knowing (IWOK), also referred to as Indigenous worldview, are a set of epistemological frameworks and belief systems associated with Indigenous peoples around the world. Indigenous knowledge comes from a community being in an interrelated relationship with the land in a particular location on Earth over many generations and continuously passing that knowledge on to future generations. While it is widely recognized that there is not a single universal Indigenous belief system, since Indigenous peoples throughout the world vary widely in terms of geography, language, and social structure, it is accepted by prominent scholars that there are many key similarities among Indigenous philosophical approaches that together form the foundation of IWOK. In addition to 'pre-colonial' knowledge, IWOK are informed by the past and current sociopolitical power dimensions of the Western world. IWOK differs from the dominant Eurocentric or Western worldview, sometimes referred to as Western Ways of Knowing (WWOK), since colonization, which is a product of Western thought, interrupted and undermined IWOK. While IWOK reflect the interconnectedness of all things, Western thought is embedded in claims of objectivity and a decoupling of culture from nature, viewing places as \\"devoid of a living force\\" and humans as separate from nature. IWOK have been described as ecological, sustainable, relational, cyclic, interdependent, and holistic in nature. Indigenous worldviews also emphasize the presence of spirit in all things as well as other worlds or dimensions that are independent yet overlap and are deeply interrelated with the material world. Lisa Grayshield, Marilyn Begay, Laura L. Luna, Denny Hurtado, and Amileah Davis have cited the response of Chief Seattle (1786-1866) to U.S. government demands for ownership of the land during treaty negotiations in 1850 as reflecting the basic philosophical stance underlying IWOK: \\"This we know, that all things are connected like the blood that unites us. We did not weave the web of life, we are merely a strand in it‚Äîwhatever we do to the web, we do to ourselves.\\" Scholars have cited the importance of sharing IWOK to decolonize and challenge the hegemony of WWOK. As described by Norman K. Denzin and Yvonna S. Lincoln, \\"in some ways, the epistemological critique initiated by Indigenous knowledge is more radical than other sociopolitical critiques of the West, for the Indigenous critique questions the very foundations of Western ways of knowing and being.\\"  Indigenous vs. Western worldviews  A diagram of what scholars Lisa Grayshield and Anita Mihecoby (2010) outline as some of the fundamental differences between Indigenous and Western paradigms as they relate to IWOK. Although there are estimated to be 250 million to 600 million Indigenous peoples in the world, the central tenets of IWOK share many similarities. Heather Harris notes that \\"although the outward manifestations of Indigenous cultures across North America and beyond vary greatly, there are surprising similarities in worldview, enough so that it is possible to contrast Indigenous worldview with Western worldview.\\" Washoe scholar Lisa Grayshield and Comanche scholar Anita Mihecoby compare and contrast Indigenous and Western worldviews, referring to an Indigenous paradigm as a model of sustainability and a Western paradigm as a model that prioritizes economic growth or Gross National Product (GNP). James (S√°k√©j) Youngblood Henderson states that \\"the discord between Aboriginal and Eurocentric worldviews is dramatic. It is a conflict between natural and artificial contexts.\\" As Henderson and Marie Battiste state: > No separation of science, art, religion, philosophy, or aesthetics exists in > Indigenous thought; such categories do not exist. Thus, Eurocentric > researchers may know the name of a herbal cure and understand how it is > used, but without the ceremony and ritual songs, chants, and relationships, > they cannot achieve the same effect. Tewa educator Gregory Cajete stated in reference to what he refers to as the rise of the Indigenous mind that while Indigenous people globally are very diverse \\"in terms of languages and in terms of places in which we live, what we have in common is this understanding of connection, of relationship, to the places in which we live.\\" Hawaiian scholar Huanani-Kay Trask states that \\"Indigenous knowledge is not unique to Hawaiians, but is shared by most Indigenous peoples throughout the world.\\" Lakota thinker Vine Deloria Jr. recognized that there is \\"a great unanimity among Aboriginal nations when they express their views on the natural world and on the behavior of humans in that world\\" while also emphasizing that Indigenous nations are distinct because of the different places they live and learn in. Osage-Cherokee thinker Rennard Strickland stated \\"cosmologies differed from tribe to tribe, but basic beliefs were constant. Central to all tribes was the perception of an organic cosmos precariously balanced.\\" Scholars emphasize that while IWOK contrast with WWOK, that it is important not to view Indigenous worldviews as opposite of Western worldviews or vice-versa. For example, Western scientists and historians have recognized that in some aspects Western thought is only now 'confirming' what Indigenous peoples have already known. It has been noted however that when Indigenous worldviews conflict with Western scientific or historical accounts that \\"its utility is questioned or dismissed as myth\\" in the Western world because of the ways in which WWOK are privileged. Additionally, Indigenous scholars such as Carl Mika of the Tuhourangi and Ngati Whanaunga have noted that, although they are not dominant, that there are strands of anti-colonial thinking present in Western thought such as in aspects of continental philosophy. Scholar Arthur W. Blume notes that \\"generalizing about the prevailing worldview of colonial cultures is nearly as risky as generalizing about Indigenous worldview,\\" yet determines that \\"with that acknowledged, colonial belief systems do have common elements that can be discussed, evaluated, and contrasted with an Indigenous worldview.\\" = Origins = IWOK originate from the communal experience of living in an interrelated relationship with the land in a particular location on Earth over a period of many generations, passing knowledge on from generation to generation. In contrast, WWOK have their origins in the European Age of Enlightenment, also referred to as the Age of Reason. The Enlightenment was a counter-movement to the divine right of kings that, as described by Blackfoot scholar Leroy Little Bear, \\"attempted to subject anything and everything to rationalism\\" and upheld a belief in the concept of objectivity. However, the Enlightenment primarily benefited the ruling classes of Europe and \\"did not dispose of social hierarchies in colonial societies.\\" Europe was already a place of warring ruling class leaders who sought to expand their power and influence over one another and an exploited underclass who possessed limited power and resources and the Enlightenment did little to alter this hierarchy. The Age of Enlightenment informed Western thinkers who came to classify Indigenous knowledge as primitive or backward because it was not perceived as rational, but also because it existed outside of Christianized logics. Christian nations used \\"coercive methods such as the Inquisition to enforce the practices of the church and to punish those who did not believe in it or believed it in a way that seemed to defy Christian orthodoxy.\\" = Apocalypse = buffalo herds to destroy lifeways for Indigenous peoples of the Great Plains. IWOK were effected with the arrival of colonizers to Indigenous lands. The violence, disease, and death that the invaders brought totally altered the landscape often times beyond recognition. Indigenous lifeways and knowledge in many cases were intentionally destroyed and targeted by the invaders so as to control and exploit Indigenous people and the land. For this reason, many Indigenous peoples express that they live in a post-apocalyptic world, which differs from Western worldview. In response to the apocalypse, Indigenous artists and writers imagine worlds that explore concepts of Indigenous futurisms, creating ways in which, as described by Joni Adamson and Salma Monani, post-apocalyptic \\"communities recover and survive for viable, healthy futures.\\" As stated by writer Rebecca Roanhorse, who is of Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo descent, \\"we‚Äôve already survived an apocalypse.\\" Lower Brul√© Lakota activist Nick Estes contextualizes settler colonialism as an apocalypse: \\"Indigenous people are post-apocalyptic. For my community alone, it was the destruction of the buffalo herds, the destruction of our animal relatives on the land, the destruction of our animal nations in the nineteenth century, of our river homelands in the twentieth century. I don‚Äôt want to universalize that experience; it was very unique to us as nations. But if there is something you can learn from Indigenous people, it‚Äôs what it‚Äôs like to live in a post-apocalyptic society.\\" Estes recognizes that while Indigenous worlds have been destroyed in many ways, they can be reclaimed: \\"we‚Äôre trying to rebuild them, reclaim them, and reestablish correct relations. The severity of the situation shouldn‚Äôt undermine the willingness to act. Not to act, to succumb to a kind of paralysis, of inaction, is itself an action.\\" In 1992, Thomas Banyacya delivered a message on Hopi prophecy at the United Nations stating, \\"This is now a time to weigh the choices for our future... If you, the nations of the Earth, create another great war, the Hopi believe we humans will burn ourselves to death with ashes.\\" Banyacya spoke of alienation from the natural world being experienced from people throughout the world as creating a \\"life out of balance with nature and the spirit, which the Hopi call Koyaanisqatsi or 'crazy life'.\\" Banyacya outlined two possible futures for humankind, a pathway of \\"technology separated from natural and spiritual law,\\" which would ultimately lead to destruction, or a path in harmony with nature: \\"if we return to spiritual harmony and live from our hearts, we can experience a paradise in this world.\\" In the aftermath of a global catastrophe from failing to listen to the Creator's instructions, the Hopi believe that \\"only the traditional Hopi will survive as well as those non-Hopi who choose to live in a more ecological way of life in indigenous reciprocity with Nature and the Earth,\\" as summarized by M. A. Jaimes-Guerrero; \\"Those who are evil will not survive.\\" In the Western worldview, the idea of the apocalypse is only dawning with the rise of global climate change and threats of a sixth mass extinction which themselves are rooted in the effects of WWOK. This has created a pessimistic and bleak vision of future. Fredric Jameson stated that this reflects that for some \\"it‚Äôs easier to imagine the end of the world than it is to imagine the end of capitalism.\\" = Community = Vasco N√∫√±ez de Balboa executing Indigenous Panamanians by war dog for same-sex practice (1594). Colonizers altered Indigenous worldviews on community through Christianization which was enforced through violence. Indigenous worldviews are based on the approach that each member of a community is interdependent on every other member, and that this must extend beyond human relationships. As summarized by Arthur W. Blume, \\"the community cannot exist without each member working together to ensure the survival of the community and therefore is as strong as its most vulnerable member and as weak as its inability to get along well together... Existence is a function of we and us in an Indigenous worldview. However, connectivity goes beyond human relationships. Indigenous people often live with an awareness of the connectivity of their lives with all other nonhuman things in Creation, an approach that is not typically appreciated in non-Indigenous social orders.\\" Indigenous worldviews are not based in using systems of punishment or force to maintain community. As stated by M√©tis scholar Wanda D. McCaslin, \\"just as harm occurs when we are not mindful of how we are related, so we are healed as we live more mindfully of our relatedness. This awareness is not reducible to specific techniques or practices. Instead, it constitutes our worldview which then permeates every aspect of our lives and societies.\\" Indigenous communities were increasingly conditioned to conform to the colonizing Western or Eurocentric paradigm. In many instances, Indigenous ways of knowing were lost, replaced, and excluded from colonial institutions while Western values were privileged. For example, scholars have noted how \\"the mainstream educational systems in the Americas are based in Eurocentric values such as individualism, Christianity, paternalism, competitiveness, and nuclear family systems, which are often incompatible with Indigenous value systems of community, sharing, extended family systems, giving back to one's community, and a respect for creation as a relation not as a resource.\\" Indigenous peoples often prefer to let their actions speak for themselves \\"and see little reason to highlight how they are better than hypothetical others,\\" which has been noted to be oppositional in a colonial capitalist world that stresses individualism and self-promotion. As stated by Masiiwa Ragies Gunda in the Zimbabwean context, \\"as Christianity made significant inroads among Indigenous communities, the monadic Western cultural traits found their way to the converts and eventually workers and their dependents. Pre-colonial cultural traits were throughout this period stigmatized and receding from public view. By the time of the end of the colonial period, the Western monadic cultural traits had become the dominant culture of the 'elite' who aspired to whiteness.\\" Indigenous communities were instructed under threat of violence to reject members of their community based on qualities such as their gender or sexuality. As stated by Cherokee researcher Wade Blevins who references the words of elder Benny Smith, third gender people were traditionally \\"our caretakers of orphans, they helped put away our dead, and they had their own medicine.\\" Blevins explains how Smith told him that, until transgender people are accepted, the community and nation will never be as strong as it could be; \\"our fire has become diminished and weak because not everyone is there.\\" Khoesan teacher Dr. Yvette Abrahams states that what colonial religions asked of them was \\"to reject our own children....\\" Abrahams explains how \\"our very concept of the divine, our very concept of the proper relationship within an ecosystem was being challenged, and what we were being asked to do was to turn our backs on beliefs that were so ancient and so inherent in our way of life that there is no other way to describe it but as a huge shock, an incredible trauma. So it's not so simple to say that 'we could keep the rest of our precolonial culture, just that we accepted queer people.' It was that our very precolonial culture was so diverse and so accepting that the notion of queerness in fact didn't exist. We didn't think of gender as a binary.\\" Laguna Pueblo writer Paula Gunn Allen referenced how people now seen in the West as queer were \\"integral people in the culture. They're not 'deviants' sent out to the wilderness to die.\\" In traditional Indigenous circles, Allen notes that this way of knowing is still honored, while in more Christianized circles they may not be. Mark Rifkin states that \\"the civilization, allotment, and Indian education programs, illustrate how the U.S. government has sought to enforce Christian heteronuclearity as the structuring principle of the social order.\\" This, along with the work of early anthropologists, has been cited as influencing Indigenous peoples \\"to distrust ethnographers and hide evidence of gender diversity.\\" Blevins echoes this stating that many Indigenous peoples learned to hide and publicly deny that they had third gender or two-spirit people in order to protect them. = Metaphysics = The whistling kite (pictured), black kite, and brown falcon, colloquially referred to as 'firehawks' in northern Australia were 'discovered' by Western scientists in 2017 to intentionally carry burning sticks to spread fires. However, this has long been known to the Alawa, Mulluk-Mulluk, Jawoyn and other Indigenous peoples of Australia, who incorporated this knowledge into their ceremonies In an Indigenous worldview, nothing is inanimate and everything is alive, including plants, animals, rocks, mountains, weather phenomena, celestial bodies, and the Earth itself. Conversely, as noted by scholar Heather Harris, \\"the dichotomy between animate and inanimate held in the Western worldview usually has little meaning in Indigenous ways of seeing.\\" Blackfoot scholar Leroy Little Bear compares: \\"in Blackfoot there is no such thing as 'inanimate'\\" while stating that in the Western worldview, while humans and animals are often understood as animate, trees and especially rocks are seen as inanimate or as not sentient. Little Bear reflects how Western thought conceives of the world as stagnant and primarily full of matter and that this worldview is reflected in Western noun-based languages such as English. In contrast, IWOK reflect that the world is fluid and primarily full of energy or waves, or what Little Bear refers to as \\"constant flux.\\" IWOK understand humanity as interconnected with nature in a web of life and not above any other being or placed higher in a hierarchy. For example, the Tongva/Kizh approached reality with \\"the cosmological belief that humankind was not the apex of creation but simply a strand in the web of life,\\" as summarized by scholar Edward D. Castillo. Chief Joseph, a Nez Perc√©, stated, \\"the Earth and myself are of one mind. The measure of the land and the measure of our bodies are the same. Do not misunderstand me, but understand me fully with reference to my affection to the land.\\" Conversely, Western worldviews believe that IWOK belong to a \\"failed savage past\\" that should be abandoned for \\"a better civilized future.\\" James (S√°k√©j) Youngblood Henderson states, \\"Europeans self-righteously set out to convert all others with whom they came into contact to their understanding of an artificial future society.\\" Indigenous understandings of time differ from how time is understood in the Western context. Scholars note that many people with Western-trained understandings may view their perception of time as universal because of the effects of colonization throughout the world. In an Indigenous worldview, time is cyclical while in the Western worldview time is viewed as linear. Vongai Mpofu states that Indigenous time operates within socialized understandings, meaning \\"that time is programmed into socio- cultural norms and values that shape human behavior and interpersonal relationships.\\" Mpofu notes how in the unhu worldview, or ubuntu philosophy, this means that \\"apart from being reckoned by animal sounds, plant behavior, and astronomic patters of the stars, moon and sun, time is attached to social activities such as milking cows, fetching water, and time of return from the fields.\\" This differs from Western perspectives on time, which are linear, individualized, and disconnected from responsibilities to community and human relations, focusing instead on punctuality. Indigenous worldviews have always incorporated what is referred to in Western science as the concept of a multiverse, or the idea \\"that reality consists of a number of simultaneously existing alternate worlds and/or parallel worlds.\\" For example, in an Indigenous Vugalei Fijian conceptualization, there is an understanding that the spiritual and material worlds are interlinked, as described by Dr. Akanisi Kedrayate. Grace L. Dillon states that \\"incorporating time travel, alternate realities, parallel universes and multiverses, and alternative histories is a hallmark of Native storytelling tradition.\\" Dillon expresses that what is perceived as \\"cutting edge\\" in Western science \\"replicates what Natives have lived for millennia and what Euro-Western science has only recently come to understand.\\" This has been further demonstrated through recent scientific studies which 'confirm' what Indigenous peoples have known about the interconnected nature of reality, such as a study on 'firehawks' in northern Australia that garnered international attention in 2018. Indigenous worldviews understand that there is constant connection between the spiritual and natural worlds. For example, in the unhu worldview there is an understanding that ancestral relationships can be defined through totems, which are usually animals such as the Shava (Eland), which work to \\"connect the living to their ancestors and the animal.\\" Indigenous metaphysics are \\"directly related to the everyday world and [are] not, as dominant Western philosophy tends to treat it, a 'study,'\\" as described by scholar Carl Mika. From an Indigenous perspective, \\"metaphysics simply must be thought of as an integral, infusing element within the world.\\" For this reason, Mika states that \\"in a colonized reality, it is insufficient to recite traditional ideas without further theorizing on their significance in a counter-colonial sense,\\" even though there are some inherent challenges with this approach due to differences in Indigenous and Western understandings of the nature of reality and conceptualizations of time and space. = Philosophy = Indigenous philosophical approaches are relational and do \\"not lie in assessing the truth of a proposition through logic, but in how the self is located in the world,\\" as noted by Carl Mika. In many instances, Indigenous peoples recognize that silence is the best mode of interacting with other beings, whether human or non-human. Unangan teacher Ilarion Merculieff states that \\"doing things without thought may be a difficult concept for Western-trained minds to understand since the mind is perceived as the center of intelligence, whereas Indigenous people know that true knowledge comes as a result of suspending thought.\\" Mika describes that \\"utterances of knowledge or propositions of truth about things were likely secondary to the sheer initial and primordial perception of a phenomenon\\" and notes that Western philosophy rejects this approach because it is non-analytical and therefore should be rejected as legitimate philosophy. As summarized by Mika: > Here we meet one of the most entrenched biases of Western philosophy, > comprising as it does the very profound and subconscious rejection of the > mere possibility that non-analytical thought might belong in the discipline > of philosophy. Dominant analytic philosophy and its associated domains are > fortified quite staunchly against even the mention of other forms of > thinking. For the Indigenous thinker, this reaction is an emotional and > subjective one, not one based on any particular objectivity that, > ironically, this particular kind of philosophy claims. It also, again, > uncovers a peculiar underbelly of Western philosophy: that, ultimately, it > must revert to an emotional response rather than a thoroughgoing detached > one. In this, it is likely no different to Indigenous philosophy, which > reacts along lines of feeling in the very first instance. The difference > lies in the fact that Indigenous philosophy is clear that thought must be > based from the very outset on one's visceral response to a thing. Western > philosophy, when viewed from the Indigenous perspective, is thus gripped by > the very problem that it is attempting to eradicate. For this reason, many Indigenous peoples view the Western philosophical tradition in bleak terms because of its tendency since the scientific revolution (and even since Plato) to obsess over recording and measuring knowledge and to dismiss any approach that does not conform to its version of truth; \\"Western philosophy, more than any other discipline, may exemplify for the Indigenous mind the dominant horizon of colonizing thought.\\" = Self- actualization = The Blackfoot tipi reflects Blackfeet worldviews regarding the role of community-actualization in achieving cultural perpetuity. Indigenous and Western worldviews differ on the concept and role of self- actualization (a person's pursuit of their full potential) in a theoretical hierarchy of needs. The popular Western philosophical theory Maslow's hierarchy of needs, which places physiological needs at the base and self- actualization at the top, emerged and was informed by Abraham Maslow's work with Blackfeet Nation through conversations with elders and inspiration from the shape and meaning of the Blackfoot tipi. However, Maslow's original application of Blackfoot philosophy does not actually reflect the Blackfoot worldview and has since been criticized by scholars such as Cindy Blackstock and Sarena Johnson for misrepresenting Blackfoot philosophy. In Blackfoot philosophy, self-actualization is community-actualization, otherwise known as the \\"community's pursuit of its full potential,\\" because in Blackfoot tradition, \\"one's self, actualizes as a member of a community, the so-called 'self' is therefore interconnected and interdependent within a larger structure,\\" as stated by Blackstock. Finally, at the top of the tipi is the concept of cultural perpetuity, rather than individualized transcendence (as it is in Maslow's Western model). Cultural perpetuity has been described as \\"the idea that the knowledge and wisdom of a community can live on in perpetuity, so long as the individual and the community become actualized.\\" Blackstock has referred to cultural perpetuity as \\"the breath of life.\\"  Implications  In 2020, Gregory Cajete stated that \\"for quite some time Indigenous thought has been placed in this anthropological, archaeological sphere, as if it was interesting to study, but really not of consequence to modern life, contemporary living, and what's happening with the rise of Indigenous scholarship, with the rise of many of the issues that are being faced today worldwide, is that that kind of thinking, that Indigenous thinking, that way of knowing and understanding relationship is rising as well and becoming much more active.\\" = Healing = For people who have been disconnected from Indigenous ways of knowing because of colonialism, IWOK has been cited as a way to heal spiritually, mentally, physically, and emotionally. Lara Medina states that IWOK is critical to Chicano/a spirituality and healing. In a book with scholar Martha R. Gonzales on Xicanx and Latinx spiritual expressions and healing practices, Medina and Gonzales state \\"reclaiming and reconstructing our spirituality based on non-Western epistemologies is central to our process of decolonization, particularly in these most troubling times of incessant Eurocentric, heteronormative patriarchy, misogyny, racial injustice, global capitalist greed, and disastrous global climate change.\\" The Circulo de Hombres group in San Diego, California spiritually heals Chicano, Latino, and Indigenous men \\"by exposing them to Indigenous-based frameworks, men of this cultural group heal and rehumanize themselves through Maya-Nahua Indigenous-based concepts and teachings,\\" helping them process integenerational trauma and dehumanization from colonization. A study on the group reported that reconnecting with Indigenous worldviews was overwhelmingly successful in helping Chicano, Latino, and Indigenous men heal, with many of the men stating that this was more helpful than the presence of Christian or Catholic organized religion in their lives. Scholars have argued that employing an IWOK framework by \\"working in partnership with individuals who have indigenous knowledge, skills, and abilities in the area of health might help us to minimize rates of chronic conditions or disabilities and to ensure equitable access to appropriate health and rehabilitation services.\\" = Gender and sexuality = In 2010, the Indigenous Ways of Knowing Program of Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Oregon was founded \\"to engage tribes; two-spirit community members; and organizational partners, such as the Native American Program of Legal Aid Services of Oregon, Western States Center, and Basic Rights Oregon, in order to develop resources for tribes seeking to adopt policies that affirm two- spirit people and their families.\\" In 2013, a Tribal Equity Toolkit was created by this coalition to address and Support Two Spirit and LGBT Justice in Indian Country. = Research = Scholars have also noted how employing IWOK will fundamentally change how research itself is conducted by prioritizing community needs and desires over individualistic academic careerism and institutional prestige. Linda Tuhiwai Smith writes about decolonizing methodologies as being of critical importance to changing the colonial method of research which is currently prioritized in the Western academy. Tuhiwai Smith states that Western research is rooted in \\"a set of ideas, practices and privileges that were embedded in imperial expansionism and colonization and institutionalized in academic disciplines, schools, curricula, universities, and power.\\" Tuhiwai Smith explains that decolonizing methodologies bring about \\"new ways of knowing and discovering [and] new ways of thinking about research with indigenous peoples.\\" = Sustainability = Washoe scholar Lisa Grayshield and Comanche scholar Anita Mihecoby describe the differences in Indigenous and Western perspectives on the Earth as follows: in an Indigenous worldview \\"the Earth is our Mother and our Teacher to be loved and respected\\" while in a Western worldview \\"the Earth is a commodity for man to exploit for his own gain.\\" In an article for the United Nations, the UN Resident Coordinator of Guatemala stated \\"the whole world, has much to learn from indigenous peoples. It is a painful irony that they have been so exploited and oppressed, and yet they may hold a key to our collective survival. It is a painful irony, too, that indigenous people are among those most affected by climate change, and yet they contribute the least to it.\\"  References  Category:Indigenous American philosophy Category:Indigenous people Category:Epistemology ","title":"Indigenous Ways of Knowing"},{"id":"65384108","text":"Atlantitrygon is an extinct genus of marine river stingray from the Paleogene period.

Biography  Wang was born Hefei, Anhui Province, to a country doctor. He was involved in socialist activism in his youth, which eventually brought him into trouble with regional warlords and forced him to leave Anhui and settle in Shanghai in 1913. Here, Wang became a labor organizer, but also founded the Anhui Gang, a criminal organization involved in drug trafficking and assassination. The Anhui Gang was often employed by the warlord Lu Yongxiang. For a time, Wang mentored Dai Li, who would later become Chiang Kai-shek's secret police chief, but Dai became disillusioned after 1923 when Wang arranged the assassination of police chief Xu Guoliang, who was attempting to suppress his drug trafficking operations. In 1924, Lu Yongxiang's forces were defeated by Qi Xieyuan and from then on Wang's Anhui Gang was often employed by the New Guangxi clique. During the 1930s, Wang became notorious as \\"the king of assassins\\" for masterminding the killing of numerous Japanese servicemen and figures associated with China's Nationalist government. He was linked to assassination attempts on T. V. Soong in 1931 and Wang Jingwei in 1935. Wang eventually became one of China's most wanted criminals. For a time, he evaded the police in Hong Kong, but later escaped to Wuzhou.

This was inaugurated on December 14, 1977 by the anthropologist Reina Torres de Ara√∫z. Currently, it is administered by the Ministry of Culture of Panama. This museum is framed in the context of Panamanian history, encompassing the Colonial Period (1501 to 1821), the Union to Colombia (1821 to 1903) and the Republican Period (1903 to the present). Among its collections there are maps, plans, religious objects, the Declaration of Independence of Panama from Spain, photographs and engravings of the construction of the Panama Canal Railway, and copies of the Political Constitution of 1972, among other documents of historical value. Her most outstanding work is a replica of the first Panamanian flag, made by Mar√≠a Ossa de Amador, wife of one of the heroes of the Separation of Panama from Colombia and the first president of Panama.  History  Before the museum, a restoration of the property was carried out in 1975, in which a meeting room and library of the Panamanian Academy of History were enabled on the ground floor; a local office of the Directorate of Historical Heritage of the National Institute of Culture and a room known as \\"Room of the National Symbols\\". The museum was founded on December 14, 1977 by Dr. Reina Torres de Ara√∫z, founder of other museums in Panama that were in the custody of the National Institute of Culture (INAC), current Ministry of Culture. = Remodeling = In 2000, the building was restored by the Friends of the Museums. The museum was handed over on September 1, 2000 to INAC. The rehabilitation process also included donations of museum material, among other contributions.

It was established in the late 16th or early 17th century near a cemetery in which victims of the 1592‚Äì1593 Malta plague epidemic were buried. It was originally dedicated to Saint Roch, but after a convent was built next to it in the early 17th century it was rededicated to Our Lady of Sorrows. The church later gave its name to the town of Piet√† which developed nearby, and the present building dates back to the mid-18th century when it was reconstructed. Both the church and the convent are currently in the hands of a Catholic youth ministry.  History  = First church = The 1592‚Äì1593 Malta plague epidemic was a severe plague outbreak which killed thousands of people in Malta. At the time, it was standard practice to bury the deceased within churches or chapels, but due to the epidemic's high death toll it became necessary to establish a new cemetery. This was located on a plot of land outside the city of Valletta, and a chapel dedicated to the patron saint of the plague-stricken Saint Roch was built nearby. Some sources state that the chapel was built in 1592‚Äì1593 while others state that it was constructed in 1612. In around 1617, a small Augustinian convent was constructed near the chapel. Devotion to St Roch was closely related to devotion to Our Lady of Sorrows, and in the early 17th century the church's dedication was changed from the former to the latter. The church was called Santa Maria a Mare or La Piet√† in Italian. Its surroundings became known as tal-Piet√†, and when a town later developed in the area it retained the name of Piet√†. The Augustinian convent closed down in 1652 after Pope Innocent X had ordered the closure of small convents, and on 15 October 1652 the Bishop of Malta appointed a diocesan priest to take care of the church. Bishop Joaqu√≠n Canaves granted the church the benefit of di libera collazione in 1714. The church fell under the jurisdiction of the parish of St Paul's Shipwreck of Valletta, and in 1723 Bishop Gaspare Gori-Mancini granted it the status of vice-parish after the population of the Piet√† area had grown to a few hundred people. This status was lost in 1740 and the church of St Publius in Floriana became vice-parish instead of it. By the mid-18th century, the church was poorly maintained and it was in danger of collapsing. = Present church = Cleric Giuseppe Spiteri requested permission from Bishop Paul Alph√©ran de Bussan to rebuild the church of Our Lady of Sorrows, and the request was accepted on 12 October 1757. The knight Wolfgang Philip von Guttenberg was a major benefactor for the church, and the new building featured a commemorative inscription and the von Guttenberg coat of arms. Prior to the Rising of the Priests in 1775, ringleader Gaetano Mannarino and other conspirators met in the church's sacristy to plan the rebellion. During the French occupation of Malta of 1798, some of the coats of arms on the church and the convent were defaced. The church fell under the jurisdiction of the parish of St Publius of Floriana in 1844, and later that of St Joseph of Msida in 1867. Saint George Preca, who founded the Society of Christian Doctrine, used to teach within the church in the early 20th century. On 11 June 1940, the church was used to temporarily accommodate about 15 refugees from bombed-out houses after one of the first World War II aerial bombardments of Malta. The church briefly fell under the jurisdiction of the parish of the Immaculate Conception of ƒ¶amrun, and since 1968 it has formed part of the parish of Our Lady of Fatima of Gwardamanƒ°a. The church was restored in the 1960s and 1970s. It given to the Franciscan Sisters of the Sacred Heart by Archbishop Mikiel Gonzi in 1974, but they later left Piet√†. The church is prone to flooding due to its location, and it was in a poor state by the late 1990s. Conservation and restoration works were carried out by the Ministry of Resources and Infrastructure in 2000‚Äì2001. In 2005, the church and convent were given to the Youth Fellowship community by Archbishop Joseph Mercieca. The convent is now used as a pastoral centre and for spiritual retreats. The church's fa√ßade has been restored but its interior has deteriorated, and in 2018 the Piet√† Local Council stated that there are plans for further restoration. The area around the chapel has been embellished in a project funded by the Planning Authority in 2018. The church building is listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands.  Architecture  The convent wall with the coat of arms of Gonz√°lez de Mendoza (top) and two defaced coats of arms (bottom), one of which was von Guttenberg's The small church has a simple design and its fa√ßade has some Baroque elements. It has a large rectangular doorway framed by mouldings and topped by a Latin inscription and a corbelled cornice. The fa√ßade also features a coat of arms of Paul Alph√©ran de Bussan and a small window which allows light to enter the church. A large pilaster is located on either side of the doorway, and one contains an unidentified coat of arms. Above the other pilaster there is a large bell-cot containing two bells. The fa√ßade is topped by a statue of the Virgin Mary which is flanked by statues of reclining angels. Internally, the church has a main altar and four side chapels with their own altars. Three of these are dedicated to Our Lady of Loreto, Saint Roch and Our Lady of Graces. A convent is located adjacent to the church, and the buildings are linked through the latter's sacristy. One of the convent's walls contains a coat of arms attributed to the knight Pedro Gonz√°lez de Mendoza along with the remains of two defaced coats of arms. One of these was the emblem of von Guttenberg and the other is unidentifiable.  Artworks  The church's altarpiece depicts the Virgin Mary holding the dead body of Jesus (a depiction known as a piet√†), and it was painted by Gioacchino Loretta, a follower of Mattia Preti. The chapel of Our Lady of Loreto contains an altarpiece which depicts Mary with John the Baptist and the Blessed Gerard, painted by Bartolomeo Garagona in 1613. The chapel of St Roch has a painting of the Immaculate Conception with St Joseph and St Charles Borromeo which was commissioned by the Testaferrata family in the early 18th century, and its painter is unknown although it is sometimes attributed to Carlo Zimech. The chapel of Our Lady of Graces contains a painting of Mary with baby Jesus along with John the Baptist and the saints Nicholas of Tolentino and Francis which was painted in the early 17th century. These paintings were restored by Pierre Bugeja at the behest of the Piet√† Local Council in 2015. The chapel of Our Lady of Graces also contains a number of ex-voto paintings. The church's fourth chapel contains a crucifix which is said to be miraculous, and the church contains two statues of Our Lady of Sorrows and a statue of St Joseph. The older statue of Our Lady dates back to the 18th century, while the later one was sculpted by Michael Camilleri Cauchi. A wooden relief depicting John the Baptist which was commissioned by von Guttenberg is also found within the church, and there is also a reliquary containing a nail which is said to have been touched by a Holy Nail.

If enacted, the measure would update the state's right to repair laws to include electronic vehicle data. A similar Right to repair initiative (also named Question 1) appeared on the 2012 state ballot and passed with 86% of the vote.  Summary  The measure would extend the state's right to repair laws to include telematics systems. Telematics systems contain car data that is stored outside the vehicle, and may include information that relates to navigation, gps, and mobile internet. The measure would require cars sold in Massachusetts starting with the model year 2022 to equip any cars having telematics systems with a standardized open access data platform. Independent repair shops and mechanics would, with owner permission, automatically have access to the vehicle's data to use it for diagnostics and car repair. Currently this data may only be used by manufacturer repair shops unless permission is granted.  Proponents  = Supporting arguments = Supporters of the initiative argue that it would extend consumer choice in car repair sites, increasing competition and decreasing costs of car repair. Independent mechanic advocates argue that it would help support smaller and more local repair shops to be able to compete with larger manufacturer repair chains. Telematics is also a growing part of car systems, and supporters of the initiative argue it would extend right to repair to account for technological changes. Opponents say this is a misleading characterization of the auto repair market, in which owners would still have choices for finding fixes. The proposal requires that access to information would pass through \\"an authorization process standardized across all makes and models and administered by an entity unaffiliated with the manufacturer.\\" Opponents of the measure have not identified any basis to believe that this entity will not take advantage of data security techniques in designing the authorization process or to believe that data protection measures will be insufficient to protect the data and vehicle owner.  Opponents  Opponents of the initiative argue that it would result in cyber security risk and possibly make vehicle data more vulnerable. Several TV ads attacking the initiative have connected the data security concerns as allowing easier stalking and concerns of sexual predators. Critics have cited these concerns as \\"[veering] into exaggeration and fear mongering\\".

It was focused upon territorial defence. It comprised the four Galician provinces: the Province of La Coru√±a, the Province of Lugo, the Province of Orense and Pontevedra.  History  Military regions of the Spanish Army, after 1984. The division of Spain into Captaincies General dates from 1705, when they were adjusted to the old kingdoms that constituted the Hispanic Monarchy. They were thirteen regions: Andalusia, Aragon, Burgos, Canary Islands, Castilla la Vieja, Catalonia, Extremadura, Galicia, Coast of Granada, Guip√∫zcoa, Mallorca, Navarra and Valencia. In 1898 the peninsular territory was divided into seven new military regions, as well as the General Command of Balearic Islands, Canary Islands, Ceuta and Melilla. After the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931, a government decree dissolved the military regions and replaced them with Organic Divisions. In July 1936, General Enrique Salcedo Molinuevo was the head of the VIII Organic Division. In July 1939, after the end of the Spanish Civil War the military regions were re- established. The VIII Region was assigned the VIII Army Corps with two divisions: the 81st (La Coru√±a) and the 82nd (Lugo).Decree of the Ministry of Defence, July 21, 1939. By 1944 the 81st Division was located at Lugo with the RI Zamora 8 Orense; RI Zaragoza 12 Santiago; and the RI Isabel la Cat√≥lica 29 at La Coru√±a.

Jelena's son (from the second marriage) Stefan Berislaviƒá also held the title (Despot of Serbia), from 1520 to 1535. Life Coat of arms of the Jak≈°iƒá noble family Jelena was daughter of Stefan Jak≈°iƒá (d. 1489), of the Jak≈°iƒá noble family. Her father was one the most notable Serbian nobles in the Kingdom of Hungary. In 1486, Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus (d. 1490) granted the title Despot of Serbia to ƒêorƒëe Brankoviƒá, elder son of Stefan Brankoviƒá (d. 1476), former Despot of Serbia (1458-1459). Soon after that, Jelena was married to ƒêorƒëe's younger brother Jovan Brankoviƒá. In 1493, Jovan was also granted the title, as it was customary in the Kingdom of Hungary that various senior posts should be held jointly by two incumbents. When her husband became titular despot, she became despotissa. They lived at the castle Kupinik in the Syrmia County, and had several daughters. In 1496, her brother in law ƒêorƒëe decided to relinquish all of his titles and possessions in favor his brother Jovan, Jelena's husband. In the same time, ƒêorƒëe took monastic vows, adopting the name Maksim (). Jovan remained the sole despot until 1502, when he died, without male hairs, and his widow Jelena was left with several minor daughters, trying to secure their inheritance.

Jelena and Ivani≈° had two sons and two daughters.

She died sometime after 1529. Family Coat of arms of the Brankoviƒá dynasty From her first marriage, with Jovan Brankoviƒá (d. 1502), Jelena had several daughters: * Marija, married to Ferdinand Frankopan, of the House of Frankopan * Jelena, married to Peter IV Rare≈ü, Prince of Moldavia * Ana, married to Fiodor Sanguszko, Marshal of Volhynia * Marija Magdalena, married to Iwan Wi≈õniowiecki, a noble from Volhynia From her second marriage, with Ivani≈° Berislaviƒá (d. 1514), Jelena also had several children: * Stefan Berislaviƒá (d. 1535), titular Despot of Serbia * ƒêorƒëe Berislaviƒá (d. after 1527) * two daughters (names unknown) Some researchers have suggested, after taking into account the dates of Jelena's marriages and also the dates of marriages of her daughters, that some of her daughters who are usually considered to be from her first marriage, might in fact be from her second marriage.

The case is notable for having originated 'the rule in Jones v Dunkel', an important rule in Australian civil procedure. Jones v Dunkel is the third most cited decision of the High Court.  Facts  The husband of the plaintiff, Jones, had been killed in a traffic accident on the Hume Highway. His truck had been found crashed on the side of the road, with the front of his cabin crushed in on the off-side. Found nearby that wreck was another truck, which had been driven by Hegedus, an employee of the Defendant Dunkel. Hegedus was not killed but was hurt. Hegedus' truck was also badly damaged. Hegedus had given a written statement to a police officer while in hospital, however he did not testify at trial. The defendant's counsel at the end of the plaintiff's case announced that he would not call evidence. After the trial judge concluded summarizing the plaintiff's case, a member of the jury asked the judge whether they were allowed to regard Hegedus' decision to not give evidence, as a weakness in the defendant's case.Menzies' judgement para 7 Following this, submissions were made by the parties about appropriate directions. The ultimate direction given to the jurors was as follows: > 'This is the position, the defendant having called no evidence it is a > matter of common sense that you should accept the plaintiff's evidence with > respect to the facts as being accurate. The fact that the defendant Hegedus > has not gone into the box and offered any explanation leaves you in this > position, that you can accept the facts given by the plaintiff as proved, > but the question then is whether you should find negligence against him as a > matter of inference to be drawn from those facts, and that is the question > for you, whether you think from the proved facts an inference of negligence > ought to be drawn. If you think so, the plaintiff is entitled to your > verdict. If, on the other hand, you think no such inference can be drawn > then the verdict must go against the plaintiff and in favour of the > defendant' The jury then found for the defendant that an action in negligence had not been established. An application for a new trial to the NSW Supreme Court failed. The plaintiff then appealed to the High Court.  Judgement  A majority of the High Court found that the trial judge's jury directions were a misdirection. As Justice Kitto wrote: > 'His Honour told the jury that the fact that Hegedus had not gone into the > box left them in this position, that they could accept the facts given by > the plaintiff as proved, and that the question for them then was whether > they thought that from the proved facts an inference of negligence ought to > be drawn. It was right enough to point out, in effect, that the evidence > given might be the more readily accepted because it had been left > uncontradicted, and that the omission to call Hegedus as a witness could not > properly be treated as supplying any gap which the evidence adduced for the > plaintiff left untouched. But what should have been added, and not being > added was in the circumstances as good as denied, was that any inference > favourable to the plaintiff for which there was ground in the evidence might > be more confidently drawn when a person presumably able to put the true > complexion on the facts relied on as the ground for the inference has not > been called as a witness by the defendant and the evidence provides no > sufficient explanation of his absence. The jury should at least have been > told that it would be proper for them to conclude that if Hegedus had gone > into the witness-box his evidence would not have assisted the defendants by > throwing doubt on the correctness of the inference which, as I have > explained, I consider was open on the plaintiff's evidence. In my opinion > what his Honour said on the point amounted to a misdirection.' Kitto J para > 5 For this reason a majority of the court ordered that there be a retrial.  Significance  Jones v Dunkel is a very important case for Australian rules of civil procedure. Its role has led to it being the third most cited case in the High Court's history. = 'The rule in Jones v Dunkel' = The case gave rise to what is commonly termed 'the rule in Jones v Dunkel'. One (non- judicial) phrasing of the rule is as follows: ‚Äò... the unexplained failure by a party to give evidence, to call witnesses or to tender documents or other evidence may (not must) lead to an inference that the uncalled evidence or missing material would not have assisted that party's case'. Justice Glass described the rule as operating where a witness 'would be expected to be available to one party rather than the other', for whatever reason.Glass JA 1976 11 NSWLR 191 at 201-2 For example, failing to request the testimony of a police officer would not give rise to the rule, (due to assumptions of impartiality); however a party failing to call their doctor, employee, or close relative might give rise to an adverse inference. This rule is not strict; and may be displaced if there is an adequate explanation as to why the witness was not called. Inferences that are drawn in accordance with the rule can't be used to fill gaps in evidence, or 'connect conjecture into suspicion'.J D Heydon AC, Cross on Evidence, 10th edn, 2014, LexisNexis, Sydney at [1215] Jones v Dunkel has application in criminal proceedings, but is very restricted in that context.

The ecoregion supports the near-threatened Markhor (Capra falconeri chiltanensis), known as the Screw- horned goat, the national animal of Pakistan. The forests of the ecoregion have been heavily thinned for timber.  Location and description  The northernmost sector is the smallest, lying on the southern edge of the Hindu Kush mountains, in Nuristan Province about 60 km north of Jalalabad. This subregion is bounded on the north and south by the Hindu Kush alpine meadow ecoregion, and on the west and east by the drier Baluchistan xeric woodlands. The middle sector is centered in Paktia Province, south of Kabul. It covers the mountains east of the Gardez valley. The southern sector of the ecorange is in the mountains above Quetta and Kuchlak in Pakistan. The soil in the northern area is gravel and organic matter over a clay substrate. In the south, the bedrock is limestone.  Climate  The climate of the ecoregion is Humid continental climate, warm summer (K√∂ppen climate classification (Dfb)). This climate is characterized by large seasonal temperature differentials and a warm summer (at least four months averaging over , but no month averaging over . Average precipitation in the ecoregion is 200-400 mm/year.  Flora and fauna  Only about 40% of the ecoregion is covered in vegetation, generally shrubs, herbaceous cover, and open forest. The forest type is mostly determined by altitude zones. From 2,100-2,500 meters elevation the forest is drier, with Chilgoza pine (Pinus gerardiana), Holly oak (Quercus baloot), species of the beech family (Fagaceae), and Cedar (Cedrus). Understory at this stage features Indigofera gerardiana (a legume) and Danewort (Sambucus ebulus). From 2,500-3,100 meters, the rains from the monsoon are picked up and more deciduous trees are found among the conifers. This forest may become dense, and includes Morinda spruce (Picea smithiana), Bhutan pine (Pinus wallichiana), Quercus semecarpifolia, and Himalayan cedar (Cedrus deodara). Above 3,100 meters the forest transitions to more Juniper. The lakes of the northern sectors support a wide variety of migratory and breeding birds, including various species of Rails (pochards, coots), Marsh hens, Black-necked grebe, and others.  Protected areas  About 8% of the ecoregion is officially protected. These protected areas include: * Hazarganji-Chiltan National Park * Nuristan Province National Park The park in Nuristan Province, the northernmost sector of the ecoregion, was declared a National Park of Afghanistan in July 2020. At the time, plans for facilities and support for tourism had not yet been announced.

History Queen Makea in front of the Palace, circa 1900 The palace is located on the grounds of the Taputapuatea marae, and was originally built in the 1830s as a single-story structure made of limestone and timber. It was later rebuilt as a two-story structure by Makea Takau Ariki, and served as the location of her royal court. Both the 1888 proclamation declaring the Cook Islands to be a British protectorate and the 1901 instrument of annexation by New Zealand were signed in the palace grounds. Beatrice Grimshaw gives a brief description of the palace during her visit to Rarotonga in 1907. > We walked through the blazing hot sun of the tropic afternoon, down the > palm-shaded main street of Avarua town, to the great grassy enclosure that > surrounds the palace of the queen.

Around 1100 graves were excavated and among the finds were silver brocade tabletwoven bands, embroideries fashion in gold and silver thread and luxury silk textiles, all dating to the 10th century. The embroidery, mostly worked in stem stitch, includes wool floss on wool fabric, silk floss on silk fabric, and gold thread on a decayed ground material. There are examples of appliqu√© and edging techniques used to decorate and strengthen garments. Birka has been called the \\"Silk Road of the North\\" from speculation whether the textiles represented Near or Far Eastern origins. Background The Byzantine emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus, author of De administrando imperio, wrote of the Dnieper trade route between Novgorod, Smolensk, Chernigov, Vyshegrad and Teliutza to Byzantium, confirming the existence of a trade route between the North and Mediterranean. Arab writer Ibn Khordadhbeh wrote in the 9th century about Vikings sailing along the Caspian Sea to \\"Djordjan\\". They would conduct trades using eunuch interpreters and carry their purchased goods back to Baghdad by camel caravan. And there are other Arab accounts that demonstrate Vikings had access to Arab merchandise. Ibn Fadlan describes a Northern Bulgar settlement on the Volga where he meets with the Rus in 922. According to Fadlan's description of the chieftan's funeral the body of the chieftan, attired in a brocaded caftan, was placed on a Byzantine brocade covered couch in a pavilion that was built on his ship. There is archaeological evidence for this trade in Sweden where over 60,000 Byzantine coins and Arab Dirhems have been found. There are 2500 rune stones dating between c. 1000-1100 honor men who died in \\"the √ñsterled (Eastern lands); in Gardarike (Russia), Holmgard (Nogorod), Greece, Miklagard (Byzantium), Jursalia (Jerusalem) and Sarkland (Persia).\\" Tabletwoven bands Tabletwoven bands were found at around 60 of the 170 excavated graves. The warp was woven either entirely of silk, or a combination of silk and an inner material that hasn't survived, and the weft entirely of silk. All the bands were brocaded with metal threads, either of gold or silver, and in two cases a combination. Research by Agnes Geijer identified at least 26 different patterns. There is controversy about their supposed Eastern origins. Advanced tablet-weaving was known in Nordic countries since before the Viking Age, but these materials and specific constructions are otherwise unknown outside the Birka textiles.

Highly revered by Albanian Catholics, it was demolished as a cult object during the Albanian Cultural Revolution, only to be rebuilt after the fall of communism. History A set of old walls at the site had long been venerated by Catholics as the ruins of a church to Our Lady of Good Counsel and by Muslimss as that of a Bektashi Order khanqah. Ecclesiastical historian Daniele Farlati described an active dervish khanqah () in the 18th century. The Ottoman government blocked off the walls when quarrels arose over which faith was entitled to their use, referring the matter to a commission including Jusuf Effendi Golemi and Shani Ded√´jakupeva, who held that both Catholics and Muslims could worship there. In 1917, the Catholic clergy gained Austro-Hungarian approval to build the church, provoking protests by Muslims in front of the Ministry of War building in Vienna. The church was dedicated to Our Lady of Good Counsel and completed in 1930. The Archbishop of Shkod√´r, Jak Serreqi, laid the cornerstone on March 25 of 1917, and was buried there in 1922. In 1946, after the communist takeover, over two thousand pilgrims visited, but not long after, it was turned into a ballroom and eventually would be destroyed during the Cultural Revolution. After the fall of communism, the church was rebuilt and its cornerstone was blessed by Pope John Paul II in 1993.

After failing to build a canal to secure the Jin forces' supply route during Huan Wen's campaign against Former Yan, Huan Wen was quick to blame Yuan Zhen after he returned defeated. In response, Yuan Zhen revolted in Shouchun in 369 but would die not long after. His son Yuan Qin continued the rebellion but he was defeated and executed in 371.  Career under the Jin dynasty  Not much is known about Yuan Zhen's background or early life although he originated from Chen Commandery. He appeared to have first serve as one of Yu Yi's general in the 340s. After Yu Yi's death in 345, one of his peers Gan Zan (Âπ≤Áìö) decided to revolt and kill Yu Yi's Champion General Cao Ju (ÊõπÊìö). Yuan Zhen allied himself with Jiang Bin (Ê±üËô®), Zhu Dao (Êú±Ááæ) and Mao Muzhi and together they put down the rebellion.(ÁøºÈÉ®Â∞áÂπ≤ÁìöÁ≠â‰Ωú‰∫ÇÔºåÊÆ∫ÂÜ†ËªçÂ∞áËªçÊõπÊìö„ÄÇÊú±ÁáæËàáÂÆâË•øÈï∑Âè≤Ê±üËô®„ÄÅÂª∫Ê≠¶Âè∏È¶¨ÊØõÁ©Ü‰πã„ÄÅÂ∞áËªçË¢ÅÁúüÁ≠âÂÖ±Ë™Ö‰πã„ÄÇËô®ÔºåÁµ±‰πãÂ≠ê‰πü„ÄÇ) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 97 Yuan Zhen was present during the early northern expeditions that followed Later Zhao's hasty decline in 350. He was serving as Administrator of Lujiang around this time and he captured Ran Wei's city of Hefei in 350. Later in 356, Yuan Zhen, now as Dragon-Soaring General, helped repair the imperial tombs in Luoyang after Huan Wen successfully captured the city. In 362, he was stationed in Runan after he was made General of the Household Gentlemen of the West, Chief of military affairs in Yuzhou, Sizhou, Bingzhou, and Jizhou, and Inspector of Yuzhou.(‰∫åÊúàËæõÊú™Ôºå‰ª•ËºîÂúãÂ∞áËªç„ÄÅÂê≥ÂúãÂÖßÂè≤Â∫æÂ∏åÁà≤Âåó‰∏≠ÈÉéÂ∞á„ÄÅÂæêÂÖó‰∫åÂ∑ûÂà∫Âè≤ÔºåÈéÆ‰∏ãÈÇ≥ÔºõÂâçÈãíÁõ£Ëªç„ÄÅÈæçÈ©§Â∞áËªçË¢ÅÁúûÁà≤Ë•ø‰∏≠ÈÉéÂ∞á„ÄÅÁõ£Ë≠∑Ë±´Âè∏Âπ∑ÂÜÄÂõõÂ∑ûË´∏Ëªç‰∫ã„ÄÅË±´Â∑ûÂà∫Âè≤ÔºåÈéÆÊ±ùÂçóÔºå‰∏¶ÂÅáÁØÄ„ÄÇ) Book of Jin, Volume 8 At Runan, Yuan Zhen helped defend Luoyang from the Former Yan threat. The Yan general L√º Hu (ÂëÇË≠∑) attacked Luoyang in 362, so Yuan Zhen assisted by keeping the ancient capital supplied with rice before falling back to Shouchun. Yuan Zhen's authority was further strengthened as he was appointed Commander of military affairs in Sizhou, Jizhou, and Bingzhou in 363. The following year in 364, Yan's regent Murong Ping led the attack together with Li Hong (ÊùéÊ¥™). Huan Wen ordered Yuan Zhen to defend Pengcheng while carving out a road to help the transport of supplies. Ultimately, Luoyang fell to Yan in 365, as Emperor Ai of Jin's death forced Huan Wen to withdraw.(Â§èÂõõÊúàÁî≤Áî≥ÔºåÊÖïÂÆπÊöêÈÅ£ÂÖ∂Â∞áÊùéÊ¥™‰æµË®±ÊòåÔºåÁéãÂ∏´ÊïóÁ∏æ‰∫éÊá∏Áì†ÔºåÊú±ÊñåÂ•î‰∫éÊ∑ÆÂçóÔºåÊú±ËºîÈÄÄ‰øùÂΩ≠Âüé„ÄÇÊ°ìÊ∫´ÈÅ£Ë•ø‰∏≠ÈÉéÂ∞áË¢ÅÁúû„ÄÅÊ±üÂ§èÁõ∏ÂäâÂ≤µÁ≠âÈëøÊ•äÂÑÄÈÅì‰ª•ÈÄöÈÅãÔºåÊ∫´Â∏•ËàüÂ∏´Ê¨°‰∫éÂêàËÇ•ÔºåÊÖïÂÆπÂ°µÂæ©Â±ØË®±Êòå„ÄÇ) Book of Jin, Volume 8 Yuan Zhen was one of the main benefactors in Huan Wen's expedition to conquer Former Yan in 369 together with Huan Chong, Chi Yin (ÈÉóÊÑî) and others. During the campaign, Huan Wen was faced with a recurring problem as his supply routes were held back by a drought that made the rivers too shallow for his ships to sail. Huan Wen sent Yuan Zhen to attack Qiao and Liangguo commanderies to open up the dam at Shimen and allow water to flow through the rivers. However, for unknown reasons, Yuan Zhen did capture the commanderies but did not release the water from the dam. As a result, Huan Wen's supply could not reach him, contributing to his decisive defeat at the Battle of Fangtou.(ÂàùÔºåÊ∫´‰ΩøË±´Â∑ûÂà∫Âè≤Ë¢ÅÁúüÊîªË≠ô„ÄÅÊ¢ÅÔºåÈñãÁü≥ÈñÄ‰ª•ÈÄöÊ∞¥ÈÅãÔºåÁúüÂÖãË≠ô„ÄÅÊ¢ÅËÄå‰∏çËÉΩÈñãÁü≥ÈñÄÔºåÊ∞¥ÈÅãË∑ØÂ°û„ÄÇ) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 102  Yuan Zhen's Rebellion  Huan Wen was furious and humiliated by his latest defeat. He full blamed Yuan Zhen for not securing his supply route but part of this blame also had to do with the fact that Huan Wen wanted to save face and deflect blame. Huan Wen demanded the court strip him off his office and be reduced to a commoner. Yuan Zhen called his accusations slanders and refused to accept it. Yuan Zhen sent word to the Jin court about Huan Wen's own crime but the court did not respond. Thus, Yuan Zhen decided to rebel in Shouchun in 369, offering submission to both Former Yan and Former Qin.(ÂÜ¨ÂçÅÊúàÂ∑±Â∑≥ÔºåÊ∫´Êî∂Êï£ÂçíÔºåÂ±Ø‰∫éÂ±±ÈôΩ„ÄÇË±´Â∑ûÂà∫Âè≤Ë¢ÅÁúû‰ª•Â£ΩÈôΩÂèõ„ÄÇ) Book of Jin, Volume 8 Former Yan was first to received his submission, and wanted to make Yuan Zhen Commissioner Bearing Credentials and a few other important titles. However, their envoy Wen Tong (Ê∫´Áµ±) passed away on the way to Yuan Zhen, so Yuan Zhen never received his titles. At the beginning of 370, Yuan Zhen suspected that his Interior Ministers Zhu Xian (Êú±ÊÜ≤) and Zhu Bin (Êú±Êñå) were in touch with Huan Wen, so he had them both killed.(Êò•ÔºåÊ≠£ÊúàÔºåÂ∑±‰∫•ÔºåË¢ÅÁúü‰ª•Ê¢ÅÂúãÂÖßÂè≤Ê≤õÈÉ°Êú±ÊÜ≤ÂèäÂºüÊ±ùÂçóÂÖßÂè≤ÊñåÈô∞ÈÄöÂ§ßÂè∏È¶¨Ê∫´ÔºåÊÆ∫‰πã„ÄÇ) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 102 Yuan Zhen died naturally on the 10th of April in 370.

Unlike his father, the rebellion's leadership was evenly distributed between him and Zhu Fu. Yan accepted Yuan Qin's succession, and made him Inspector of Yuzhou while Zhu Fu was made Inspector of Yangzhou. Reinforcements from Qin and Yan were sent in to support Yuan Qin but they were blocked by Huan Wen's generals Zhu Yao (Á´∫Áë§) and Huan Shiqian. Yuan Qin's forces were defeated by Zhu Yao at Wuqiu. Near the end of the year, a large force led by Huan Wen routed Yuan Qin at Shouchun.

It was the 35th episode of the third season. The cast included Nehemiah Persoff as Benito Mussolini and Harry Guardino as an Italian partisan leader. Plot The play dramatizes the final days and death of Benito Mussolini. It begins in April 1945 in Milan; a Mussolini associate, Zerbino, oversees the removal of $60 million in gold jewelry from the Italian treasury. Mussolini meets with his ministers and reviews their options. The Blackshirts have disbanded and are unavailable to escort Mussolini. Cardinal Schuster arranges a meeting to discuss terms of surrender between Mussolini and Marshal Rodolfo Graziani and partisan leaders, including Gen. Raffaele Cadorna Jr. and Luigi Longo. The partisans demand unconditional surrender, but Mussolini opts to flee for Switzerland with his gold. The partisans learn of Mussolini's plan and make plans to capture him. In Como, Mussolini is joined by his mistress, Claretta Petacci. After his path is blocked by partisan roadblocks, he attaches his group to a group of Germans led by Major Kurtz. When Kurtz betrays Mussolini to the Germans, Mussolini pays a group of Germans to allow him to hide among them in a German uniform. He is discovered in Dongo hiding among the Germans. The local partisan leader, Luigi Neri, confronts Mussolini with his crimes, and the people call for Mussolini to be hung. The partisan leaders in Milan conduct Mussolini's trial in absentia. They find him guilty of treason and sentence him to death. Mussolini watches from his cell as his ministers are to be executed by a firing squad. Before the firing squad can act, a mob attacks and kills the ministers. Alone in his cell, Mussolini speaks to God and blames Hitler for all that has happened in Italy. The Communists seek to steal Mussolini's treasures for the benefit of the party. Neri refuses to take part in the plot, and he is executed. Col. Tedesco arrives pretending to rescue Mussolini and Claretta. They drive to Villa Belmonte where Tedesco executes Mussolini. Claretta begs to be killed as well, and she is executed.

Dodurga. T√ºrk Diyanet Vakfƒ± ƒ∞slam Ansiklopedisi; 2016  History  In the Middle Ages, Dodurga (do:durga, first syllable is pronounced longer), was one of the 24 Oghuz tribes. They appear as Tutƒ±rka (Tuvtƒ±rka) in Mahmud Kashgari's Dƒ´wƒÅn LughƒÅt al-Turk and in all other similar sources. Kashgari ranked the Dodurga 16th out of the 24 tribes, Rashid al-Din Hamadani ranked them 10th, while Abulghazi Bahadur ranked them 7th. Rashid al-Din held the view that Dodurga derived from Oghuz Khagan's second son Ay Khan, whereas Abulghazi mentioned them as the son of Yildiz Khan (Oghuz Khagan's third son). They both thought that the meaning of the word Dodurga was \\"to take possession and make a land\\" (or \\"to take the land and keep it\\"). There is currently no other evidence as to the meaning of the name. Russian historian Karpov noted that most of the Dodurga arrived in Anatolia and the south of Armenia during the Seljuk's conquest of the area in the 11th century AD.Ataniyazov, S.

Biography and career  When Borinquen Gallo was 13 she moved with her family from native Rome to New York City to volunteer as missionaries; they settled down in The Bronx. Throughout her teens, she started studying arts. She earned a BFA from The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art and an MFA from Hunter College. Gallo is an Adjunct Associate Professor at Pratt Institute and works as an artist. After an initial phase during which she trained as a painter, she turned to plastic artworks. Her installations are mainly focused on questioning the relationship with the environment and, according to the artist, their objective is to sensitize people about the need for an harmonious coexistence and respect for nature. Her works are mostly realized with such recycled materials as plastic bags, caution tapes and debris. In 2016, Borinquen Gallo was selected along with Paul Jonas Ramirez by Percent for Art, a division of New York City's Department of Culture, for the commission of a public artwork for the upcoming 40th Precinct Station House in the Bronx.

His non-theatrical works were mostly landscapes and marine art.  Life and work  His father, Carlo Brioschi, was also a painter and set designer. His older brother, , also became an artist; specializing in landscapes. He studied at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Vienna with , Michael Rieser and . In 1882, he was briefly employed by the city theater in Teplitz, followed by six months in Munich, working with the stage designer, Simon Quaglio. In 1883, he was hired as a theatre painter at the Staatsoper Hannover, and received good critical reviews in the local media. After 1884, he worked at his father's studios and at the Vienna State Opera. In 1886, he succeeded him as Director of the Opera's art studios; a position he held until his death. His first project in that position involved creating new curtains (destroyed during World War II). Until the late 1890s, He personally designed the sets for the Opera's most important productions, including Otello (1888), Cavalleria Rusticana (1891), Pagliacci (1893), and The Bartered Bride (1896). His sets were critically praised for their educational value, and audiences loved the bright colors. In 1897, Gustav Mahler was appointed as Conductor and General Director. Three years later, Heinrich Lefler became his assistant, in charge of the furnishing and props department. Taken together, these additions had a tendency to restrict his independence and, increasingly, he found himself simply creating other people's designs. The final blow came in 1903, when the set decorating was assigned to Alfred Roller. After that, Brioschi was little more than a supervisor for the stage workers. This brought an end to a period when the Brioschi family set the styles and standards for Central European theatre. Many of his independent watercolors and oil paintings are in public museums and privately owned.  Sources  * * Heinrich Fuchs: Die √∂sterreichischen Maler des 19. Jahrhunderts.

Along with his brother Clarence Luther, he was a founding editor of the Journal of Comparative Neurology. He published several popular science books including the Neurological Foundations of Animal Behavior (1924), The Brain of Rats and Men (1926), and The Thinking Machine (1928). Herrick came from an English family that came to Massachusetts in 1628. Charles was born to Nathan, a Baptist pastor, and Anna Strickler in Minneapolis. Along with his brother Clarence he spent his early life collecting plants and obtained a BS in science from the University of Cincinnati in 1891. Shortly after, he married Mary Elizabeth Talbot, daughter of a retired president of Denison University. He then joined Denison University for a master's degree while his brother Clarence became a professor there but had to resign due to tuberculosis. Clarence had begun a Journal of Comparative Neurology which was managed by Charles during his brother's ill-health. In 1896 he went to Columbia University and worked for a PhD, studying the cranial nerves of bony fish and returned to Denison in 1898 to become a professor. He became a specialist on the amphibian brain and published The Brain of the Tiger Salamander in 1948. In 1956 he published Evolution of Human Nature which covered the outline of his research interests. Herrick has been characterized as a progressive psychobiologist who saw the evolution of the brain in terms of dealing with environmental challenges with an underlying belief that progress was natural and that biological studies provided support for social change in a direction that led to utopia, peace and prosperity. His students (who included Charles Manning Child and George Ellett Coghill) believed that structure and function needed to be studied together as indeed mind and body. It has been suggested that it may have been derived from a Baptist faith. Writing in 1954, Herrick wrote that \\"The test of the truth of a scientific law or principle is its predictive value, and the prediction is an act of faith. There is always a factor of faith in every scientific generalization and indeed in every fact- faith in the order of nature, faith in the reliability of the observations, and faith in the trustworthiness of the record.\\" He died at his home in Grand Rapids and is buried beside his wife in the campus of Denison University.

Bibliography  Adolph Hirsch was born in Halberstadt. He studied astronomy at the universities of Heidelberg and Vienna. He founded and directed the Observatory of Neuch√¢tel which ensured the precise determination of the time for local clock industry. He was also professor of geophysics and astronomy at the Academy of Neuch√¢tel and secretary then president of the Swiss Geodetic Commission. In 1866, the Permanent Commission of the Central European Arc Measurement met in Neuch√¢tel, and Hirsch was appointed, along with Bruhns, of Leipzig, as secretary of the session. The following year, the General Conference of the Central European Arc Measurement, meeting in Berlin, voted a motion in ten articles laying the foundations of the international organization of the metric system, and thus prepared the work which ended on May 20, 1875 with the signing of the Convention of Metre. Throughout the preparatory period Hirsch showed such great activity, such a clear-sighted mind, and identified himself so well with the common work, that he was, by a unanimous vote, chosen as secretary of the new committee in charge of high management of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures. At the same time, the International Geodetic Association was born of the Commission of the Central European Arc Measurement, and, by an understanding the good effects of which were subsequently recognized, it was believed that the two new organizations, which creation had been almost parallel, would benefit from being run by the same men. General Carlos Ib√°√±ez e Iba√±ez de Ibero, director of the Geodetic and Statistical Institute of Spain, was made chairman of both Commissions and Hirsch became the sole secretary of the International Geodetic Association. The work of the two Associations is well known: the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, in its twenty-five first years of activity, has ensured the precise unification of the metric system in all civilized countries; The Geodesic Association caused great works, coordinated scattered measurements, made them stand out from each other, and finally, gave us a more perfect knowledge of the shape and dimensions of our globe, of the distribution of the gravity, sea level, and continent at the same time that it provided, to all the staffs, the solid bases on which the charts were built. The works have grown under a skilful direction. In the year of the centenary of the metric system, the International Bureau was completing its first quarter of a century. Hirsch had the great satisfaction of seeing it in full prosperity; and if, last year before his death, his weakened health made him desire a well-earned rest and urged him to pass the secretariat of the Geodetic Association into younger hands, he found, still taking care of the International Bureau, a kind of paternal joy that made him overcome, by dint of energy, intolerable sufferings.

She is the forefront of the Extracellular Vesicles and Nanomedicine laboratory at Mayo Clinic. She is also an affiliate faculty member at University of Florida's Department of Biology and at Houston Methodist Hospital's Department of Nanomedicine. Wolfram sits as a scientific advisor and as a board member of several biotechnology companies around the world. Personal life Wolfram was born and raised in Finland. Her father is Ben Wolfram and her mother is artist Maria Wolfram. Wolfram's interest in science started at 11 years old after seeing the swab cultures of her dog's infection seeded in bacterial plates. Fascinated, she asked the veterinarian if she may have culture supplies, to which she initially refused but decided to give her in private. Wolfram then built her miniature microbiology laboratory. Her first experiment was swabbing shelves in their refrigerator. The bacterial plates were later covered with different shapes and various colors, and she thought it was cool even after it horrified her family as she announced that their fridge was crawling with bacteria. In 2018, Wolfram's friend, Rebecca, succumbed to recurring cancer. The experience further motivated her on her cancer treatment research through nanotechnology. Education In 2010, Wolfram graduated with a master's degree in Biology from the University of Helsinki. She was also a part-time researcher at the University's Institute of Biotechnology. In 2016, Wolfram earned a Ph.D. in Nanotechnology from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. Career and research Wolfram was an Amgen Scholar and she participated in a research at Karolinska Institute in 2009 regarding a novel protein that increases the migration of cancer cells. The program solidified her desire to study translational cancer. Wolfram began working as a research fellow for cancer and nanomedicine at the Houston Methodist Hospital in 2011. As she obtained her Ph.D. degree in 2016 she became a postdoctoral fellow. Wolfram worked as an Associate Research Professor at the Wenzhou Institute of Biomaterials and Engineering from 2017‚Äì2019. In 2017, she began holding affiliate faculty positions at the Houston Methodist's Department of Nanomedicine and at the University of North Florida's Department of Biology. In the same year she started as an Assistant Professor of Medicine at Mayo Clinic. She is presently the director of the Nanomedicine and Extracellular Vesicles Laboratory. Her research programs are dedicated for the treatment and detection or diagnosis of various diseases. Her research aims to produce nanomedicine with increased therapeutic properties to suppress side effects. Wolfram had come up with strategies for modulating the immune system to allow accurate drug delivery to tumors, particularly through the use of chloroquine or through the body's own nanoparticles. In her TED talk Wolfram notes that there are over 10 clinically approved nanoparticles for treating cancer. Other activities Wolfram is an advocate for increasing diversity in science, especially with underrepresented gender and racial minorities. She is also active in community outreach programs.

Originating as a steam railroad, the Denver, Lakewood and Golden, the line was opened in 1891 and had built an electrified spur leading into downtown by 1893. The company went into receivership and was acquired by the Denver & Inter-Mountain Railway in 1904, changing to simply the Intermountain in 1907 before finally settling on Denver & Intermountain Railroad (D&IM;) in 1910. The line was fully electrified at 11,000 volts alternating current in 1909, allowing direct trains to run on city streets to downtown Denver's Interurban Loop. The company was acquired by Denver Tramway the following year, becoming Route 84 in the system.

It was mainly led by two groups, (1) the Fukky≈ç, or Amami ≈åshima Nihon Fukki Ky≈çgikai (Council for the Reversion of Amami to Japan) in the Amami Islands, and (2) the Tokyo-based Amami Reng≈ç, or Zenkoku Amami Reng≈ç S≈çhonbu (All Japan Federation of Amami Islanders Associations). The reversion movement started in response to the so-called 2/2 Proclamation on February 2, 1946, in which the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP) showed its intention to remove the Amami Islands from Japanese control and to annex them to what it called the Ryukyus. The movement reached its first peak before the conclusion of the Treaty of San Francisco on September 8, 1951, demonstrating that 99.8% of the islanders wanted an immediate return to Japan. The peace treaty, however, trampled on the islanders' desire as Article 3 of the treaty had the Amami Islands (together with the Ry≈´ky≈´ Shot≈ç) separated from Japan and potentially to be placed under trusteeship. The reversion movement stayed active although the treaty triggered a heated debate on whether to call for the abrogation of Article 3 or to call for a reversion within the framework of Article 3. Nevertheless, American historian shows that the reversion movement had a significant impact not only on the Japanese government but also on the decision making process of the U.S. government. On December 25, 1953, the Amami Islands were finally returned to Japan. Background Amami has a complex relationship with its southern neighbor, Okinawa. Ethnolinguistically, the languages of Amami are closer to the languages of Okinawa than to the languages of Kyushu. Politically, however, Amami shares a much longer history with mainland Japan than with Okinawa. Fragmentary sources such as a Kamakura-period map of Japan and a set of documents created by Chikama Tokiie in 1306 suggest that Amami was within the sphere of influence of the Kamakura shogunate before the Okinawa-based Ryukyu Kingdom invaded Amami in the 15th and 16th centuries. In 1609, the Satsuma Domain conquered the Ryukyu Kingdom and put Amami under its direct control. After the abolition of the Satsuma Domain in 1871, Amami was transferred to the newly established Kagoshima Prefecture, whereas the Ryukyu Kingdom was eventually replaced by Okinawa Prefecture in 1879. The Amami Islands, the Tokara Islands, and the Upper Three Islands constituted ≈åshima District and were politically and economically integrated into Kagoshima Prefecture. Amami's two key industries, the (silk fabric) industry and the sugar industry, targeted the mainland Japanese market. During World War II, the 32nd Army of the Imperial Japanese Army was in charge of defending the islands south of 30¬∫10' north latitude (i.e., Tokara, Amami, Okinawa among others). Specifically, the 64th Independent Mixed Brigade defended the Amami Islands under the command of Major General Toshisada Takada. The Amami Islands were subject to U.S. aerial bombardments and submarine attacks but did not experience ground fighting. Since the headquarter of the 32nd Army on Okinawa Island was annihilated during the Battle of Okinawa, Takada's brigade was transferred to another army responsible for the defense of Kyushu. However, the U.S. Army superseded the Japanese military operation areas with its own operation/occupation areas: the 10th Army was in charge of islands south of 30¬∫ north latitude while the 6th Army controlled north of that line, even though the 30th parallel north was by no means a natural boundary but crossed Kuchinoshima, the northernmost of the Tokara Islands. Harboring doubts about the U.S. occupation policy, the commanding officer, Major General Toshisada Takada, used his first opportunity to contact Joseph W. Stilwell, the commander of the 10th Army, to stress Amami's position within Japan. In his letter to Stilwell, dated September 3, 1945, he requested:The English part of the Japanese-English bilingual letter, taken from Haraguchi (2017:84‚Äì85). In the process of disarmament, Takada made an objection every time the U.S. Army \\"incorrectly\\" referred to the Amami Islands as the northern Ryukyus. He insisted that the Amami Islands were not the northern Ryukyus but belonged to Kyushu and Kagoshima Prefecture. He successfully made the U.S. change the term to \\"north of Okinawa to 30¬∫ north latitude\\", \\"Oshima Gun\\" (≈åshima District of Kagoshima Prefecture), etc., although he was unable to correct the instrument of surrender he signed on Okinawa earlier on September 7, in which Amami was covered by the phrase \\"the islands in the Ryukyus\\". This episode is well known in Amami, and Toshisada Takada is still seen as Amami's local hero. Takada had his roots in Satsuma. His grandfather, Toshikane Takada, was stationed on Okinoerabu Island as an officer of the Satsuma Domain and had children with a local wife. Takada's relatives on Okinoerabu later led the reversion movement there. 1946‚Äì1950 On January 29, 1946, the SCAP issued a directive to the Japanese government that administratively separated the Amami Islands from Japan and placed them under the Okinawa-based U.S. military command. Because the SCAP directive was announced over the radio on February 2, it is known as the \\"2/2 Proclamation\\". Two days later, the U.S. military cut out interaction between Amami and mainland Japan. American anthropologist Douglas G. Haring, who conducted field research on the Amami Islands in the early 1950s, used an analogy to explain a great shock to the people of Amami: On March 14, 1946, the United States Navy Government of the Northern Ryukyu Islands was formed in Naze, the politico-economic center of the Amami Islands. The military government was transferred from the navy to the army in June. While the people of Amami had no power to prevent the occupier from imposing the label \\"Northern Ryukyu\\", they expressed resistance by translating the much-hated term as Hokubu Nansei Shot≈ç (Northern Nansei Islands) in Japanese. The U.S. military government, for example, was translated as Hokubu Nansei Shot≈ç Beikoku Kaigun Gunsei Honbu (the United States Navy Government of the Northern Nansei Islands). On October 3, the military governor renamed ≈åshima Subprefecture to the , which was again translated as Rinji Hokubu Nansei Shot≈ç Seich≈ç in Japanese. In addition to the use of the term Nansei Islands, the fact that \\"provisional\\" (rinji) and \\"government\\" (seich≈ç) were separated and placed at the opposite ends of the long phrase was seen as a sign of disaffectedness. The Provisional Government was renamed the Amami Gunto Government on November 25, 1950. When movements toward a peace treaty started in 1947, people of the Amami Islands began to voice their ardent desire to return to Japan despite increasing oppression by the U.S. military government. On September 10, the unofficial Council of the Heads of the Cities, Towns and Villages (Shich≈çsonch≈çkai) unanimously adopted a resolution that clearly stated the collective will of the people of Amami for return to Japan. Military Governor Major Fred M. Labree, however, cracked down on the reversion movement by issuing Proclamation No. 13, which abolished Proclamation No. 5, which had guaranteed the rights of free assembly, speech, publishing, beliefs, peaceful association, and labor unions. His successor, Lieutenant Colonel Henry B. Joseph, even declared on October 4: Although Joseph replaced Proclamation No. 13 with Proclamation No. 15, which clarified certain rights and liberties, he effectively banned gatherings, public statements and written materials critical of the military occupation. Because these basic rights were secured in mainland Japan by the new Constitution of Japan enacted on May 3, the oppression fueled the people's desperate desire to return to Japan. The U.S. military occupation was a fatal blow to Amami's economy. The U.S. destroyed Amami's well-functioning politico-economic connections to Kagoshima City and severed access to the mainland market on which Amami's key industries depended. Moreover, the U.S. did not incur substantial costs to rebuild Amami's economy but focused its limited resources to construct military bases on Okinawa island. Leftist journalist K≈çz≈ç Nagata speculates that the U.S. intentionally destroyed Amami's economy to create a cheap labor pool for construction work on Okinawan military bases. American historian Robert D. Eldridge, however, attributes the catastrophe to gross incompetence and negligence at the U.S. military. Using declassified documents, he shows that in 1946, the U.S. naval military government on Okinawa correctly anticipated the politico-economic chaos the separation of the Amami Islands from Kagoshima Prefecture would lead to. Similarly, the G1 and Government Sections of the SCAP in Tokyo opposed the separation, citing a large burden and the lack of qualified personnel. Despite all of these warnings within the U.S. military, the separation was enforced, causing chaos to the Amami Islands as anticipated. The food price crisis sparked public anger against the military occupation. On April 29, 1949, the military government directed a life- threatening threefold rise in prices for food distributed by it. It responded bureaucratically to the islands-wide protest, claiming that it had no power to change a directive coming from above in Okinawa. The provisional government sent a delegation to Okinawa in May, only to find the Okinawa-based military government's apathy toward Amami. The Zen ≈åshima Seikatsu Y≈çgo Ky≈çgikai (All ≈åshima Council to Protect Livelihoods) was formed on July 5, when a blank refusal of price reduction came from Okinawa, but it was banned on August 5. The U.S. Counter Intelligence Corps expanded a spy network on Amami ≈åshima to counter the protest. Municipal governments continued to distribute goods at the old prices, but this got found out by the Okinawa-based military government on January, 1950. The Okinawa-based military government mercilessly forced the provisional government to pay for the loss in revenue. On January 24, the military governor finally announced a drastic reduction of food prices, but Amami's purchasing power was not recovered. The food price crisis marked the beginning of the mass mobilization of ordinary people, which soon turned into a full-scale reversion movement. 1950‚Äì1951 International movements toward a peace treaty restarted in late 1949. Because people in the Amami Islands suffered from the military government's strong-arm tactics, the full-scale reversion movement was initiated by Amami Islanders in mainland Japan. On January 31, 1950, , an Upper House lawmaker from Tatsug≈ç on Amami ≈åshima, questioned the fate of the Amami Islands, which was followed by another question on the same topic by , also from Tatsug≈ç, on February 13. Both stressed historical, administrative, economic, and ethnic ties of the Amami Islands to Japan. Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida responded positively by saying that although the Allies had the right to make a final decision, it was all right that the Japanese people expressed their hopes and opinions. The prime minister's statements ignited mass rallies first in mainland Japan and later in the Amami Islands. On February 17, 1950, a youth association of Amami ≈åshima in Miyazaki Prefecture launched the first street demonstration. In response, Miyazaki Prefectural Assembly adopted a unanimous statement that called for the return of Amami. In Kagoshima Prefecture, Vice Governor (from Uken on Amami ≈åshima), Shigehide Iwakiri, Vice Chairman of the prefectural assembly (from Naze), and Miyanobu Takeyama, president of a publishing company (from Wadomari on Okinoerabu), took initiative in the reversion movement there. On March 28, Kagoshima Prefectural Assembly unanimously adopted a petition to the central government. In March, the newly formed Tokyo Student Association of Amami Islanders organized a 45-day signature drive in Shinbashi, , Shinjuku, and other major districts of Tokyo. The nation-wide activities were followed by the Tokyo-based Amami Reng≈ç, which was founded on December 8, 1946, as an umbrella organization of Amami Islanders' associations. On November 15, the federation, in the joint names of Shomu Nobori, President of the federation (fro Kakeroma Island), and Tadaichiro Tanimura, Head of its Tokyo Chapter (from Naze), petitioned to Douglas MacArthur, Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, requesting that the Amami Islands be reunited with Japan proper as soon as practicable. The petition stressed the differences between the Amami Islands and Okinawa, noting that the Amami Islands did not belong to the Ryukyu Shot≈ç but to ≈åshima District, Kagoshima Prefecture. Meanwhile, the reversion movement in the Amami Islands was initiated by youth associations. In response to the street rally in Miyazaki in February, the Naze City Federation of Youth Associations held a meeting on March 24, 1950, with the reversion movement as a hidden agenda. Its upper organization, the Amami Federation of Youth Associations, started mobilizing youth associations islands-wide, but the military government responded with harsh crackdown, arresting its leaders on March 27. The head of the organization was sentenced to six months' imprisonment with hard labor. Grown-ups acted more tactfully. The Social Democratic Party, led by , developed a political narrative that insisted on the compatibility of reversion with the cooperation with the U.S. On January 5, 1951, Prime Minister Yoshida took one step further from his remark last year, stating that the Ryukyu Archipelago (Ry≈´ky≈´ Rett≈ç) eventually would be restored to Japanese sovereignty because they had been Japanese territory for a long time and were not taken through invasion. On February 6, Nobori and Tanimura, together with two Okinawan representatives, attended a hearing of the Upper House, stating that 400 thousand of Amami Islanders in the Amami Islands and in mainland Japan had an ardent desire for return to Japan. They also stressed that ≈åshima District was historically and administratively distinct from Okinawa Prefecture. The hearing was set to coincide with the special negotiator for the peace treaty, John Foster Dulles's visit to Japan. Unfortunately for Amami Islanders, the Dulles‚ÄìYoshida talks made it clear that the U.S. would keep Amami separate from Japan. In the Amami Islands, the series of crackdowns generated a sense of helplessness, but in response to the reversion movement in mainland Japan, Iekuni Murayama, the founder and head of the newspaper ', floated a trial balloon by writing a carefully worded editorial on February 8, 1951, which concluded with the following sentence:English translation by Eldridge (2003:46). Murayama prepared himself for summoning by the U.S. censor but to his surprise, nothing happened to him. On February 14, the Fukky≈ç, or Amami ≈åshima Nihon Fukki Ky≈çgikai (Council for the Reversion of Amami to Japan), was formed as an umbrella organization of 29 civic, youth, and media organizations. H≈çr≈ç Izumi, Chairman of the Social Democratic Party, was elected President of the council. The fist project of the Fukky≈ç was an islands-wide signature drive, which by April 10, collected the signatures of 99.8% of all residents of the Amami and Tokara Islands over the age of fourteen. The results were forwarded to the United Nations, the Far Eastern Commission, the Allied Council for Japan, the SCAP, Foster Dulles, Prime Minister Yoshida, and the presidents of the Upper and Lower Houses of the Japanese Diet. The successful signature drive rocked mainland Japan. In parallel with the signature drive, the assemblies throughout the Amami Islands passed resolutions calling for an early return to Japan. The series of resolutions was started by the Amami Legislature (Amami Gunt≈ç Kaigi) on March 26, which was established in November 1950, and was followed by the Naze City Assembly on April 4. Masao Kanai, a former lawer, judge, lower house member and Governor of Wakayama Prefecture, exploited his social network to craft an effective strategy for reversion. The collection of signatures arrived in mainland Japan on May 13, and the news was reported nationwide. On June 2, a resolution concerning territory passed the Lower House, which requested the Allies to grant the wishes of the residents who feared separation from Japan. Former lower house member (from Tatsug≈ç) pressured the parliament to make the resolution single out the Amami Islands, but the resolution adopted in the end was a generic one covering not only Amami but also Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands. On July 10, however, the final draft of the peace treaty was reported over the radio, in which Article 3 stated that Japan would agree to the U.N. trusteeship with the United State as administering authority, of the islands south of 29¬∫ north latitude (i.e., Amami, Okinawa and others, but not Toraka). The Fukky≈ç responded quickly, organizing a mass rally in Naze on July 13. The military government ordered to call off the rally, but Hor≈ç Izumi and other organizers refused. With some ten thousand people waiting in Naze Elementary School, a meeting was held between Izumi, Governor Sanetaka Nakae, and Raymond C. Barlow, the commanding officer of the military government, where Izumi cautioned that if the rally was not allowed, the people would turn anti- American. After a one-hour negotiation, the Fukky≈ç was allowed to conditionally proceed with the rally. A second rally was held on July 19, where Governor Nakae, who earlier acted as a mediator, joined the call for the return to Japan. On August 1, Hor≈ç Izumi started a hunger strike at Takachiho Shrine in Naze, which was followed by nearly all municipalities in the Amami Islands. The hunger strikes were reported worldwide. On August 6, the reversion movement decided to send a delegation to the mainland without permission from the military government. Three of the 11 member delegation were arrested in Kagoshima on August 10. However, the incident was reported with sympathy, drawing nationwide attention to the Amami reversion movement. On August 20, all the members joined in Tokyo. In mainland Japan, the Amami Reng≈ç lobbied the SCAP and the Allies to change the boundary of the 29th parallel north. The Amami Islanders in the mainland held street rallies in Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe, Kyoto, Kagoshima, Miyazaki, and Fukuoka. A signature drive in the mainland reached one million signatures in early August. The eleven representatives from Amami joined the campaign, pressured the Diet to pass a resolution specifically targeting Amami. However, the Diet was unable to pass such a resolution because it would conflict with a treaty the Diet was soon to ratify. As a compromise, Susumu Nikaid≈ç, representing Kagoshima Prefecture, posed an \\"emergency question\\" on the reversion of Amami to Japan on August 18. 1951‚Äì1953 On September 9, 1951, the peace treaty was concluded without modifying the boundary of 29¬∫ north latitude. The Tokara Islands were returned to Japan on February 10, 1952, but the Amami Islands remained under the U.S. military occupation although the treaty indicated that Japan retained \\"residual sovereignty\\" over Amami and other islands. While the reversion movement remained active, the treaty triggered a heated debate on whether to call for the abrogation of Article 3 or to call for a reversion within the framework of Article 3. The Amami Islanders considered Article 3 entirely unacceptable. At the same time, however, an abrogation of it was virtually impossible because it required approval from all of the 49 countries that ratified the treaty. The leftist groups, who also opposed the Japanese and U.S. governments, openly called for the abrogation while moderate/conservative groups sought a more realistic approach. Witnessing growing ideological differences with in the reversion movement, Shomu Nobori, despite ill health, attended a special meeting of the Amami Reng≈ç on August 11‚Äì12, 1952, and called for unity for the sake of the larger objective. Exploiting his political connections, former parliamentarian Masao Kanai realized that the U.S. would not place Amami under a trusteeship because it would give way to U.N. intervention. He anticipated that the U.S. would return Amami to Japan in two or three years. He telegraphed Izumi in Naze and urged him to focus on an early reversion, instead of calling for the abrogation of Article 3. It took some time for Kanai's strategy to be accepted by the leaders of the reversion movement. On May 28, 1952, one month after the treaty went into effect, the reversion movement in the mainland passed a resolution absolutely opposing a trusteeship and calling for the complete return to Japan. Similarly in the Amami Islands, a mass gathering adopted a resolution calling for the abrogation of Article 3 and the complete return to Japan. The Fukky≈ç launched the second signature drive that called for the two objectives. By November it collected the signatures of 99.9% of the residents of the Amami Islands over the age of fourteen. In late September, the media reported that the U.S. ambassador to Japan, Robert D. Murphy, favorably considered the return of the Amami Islands. On September 29, however, the Mainichi Shimbun reported that Murphy referred to \\"the Amami Islands north of 27¬∫50'\\" as the area to be returned to Japan, meaning that the southernmost islands of Okinoerabu and Yoron were to be separated from the rest of the Amami Islands. The news added fuel to the reversion movement on the two islands. With the collection of signatures, representatives of the Fukky≈ç, led by Izumi, visited the mainland from November to December. Most notably, they met U.S. Ambassador Murphy and Prime Minister Yoshida. They were also given a \\"Christmas gift\\" by the Lower House on December 25, which passed a resolution that singled out Amami for the call for the return to Japan. Decoupling Amami from Okinawa was considered critically important for Amami's early return to Japan because the U.S. was highly unlikely to return heavily fortified Okinawa anytime soon. Surprisingly for the representatives of the Fukky≈ç, the mainland side had already shifted to Kanai's strategy, dropping the call for the abrogation of Article 3. In response to the concern from the mainland, the Fukky≈ç purged communists, from December 1952 to January 1953, to secure the path to the reversion. On August 8, during his short visit to Japan, Foster Dulles announced that the U.S. desired to relinquish its rights under Article 3 over the Amami Oshima Group in favor of the resumption by Japan. On August 11, the U.S. Embassy clarified that the whole ≈åshima District would be returned, without separating the southernmost two islands. The reversion groups both in the mainland and the Amami Islands were ecstatic with the news, but the initial enthusiasm soon turned to irritation and suspicion because the U.S. did not announce the date of transfer for months. In November, the Fukky≈ç even organized a mass rally and hunger strikes. On December 24 1953, the two countries finally signed the agreement returning the Amami Islands to Japan. On the following day, the U.S. military occupation came to end in the Amami Islands. Impact With a bitter memory of the U.S. military occupation, the people of the Amami Islands still occasionally oppose the label \\"Ry≈´ky≈´\\" imposed on them. For example, Amami- Oshima Island, Tokunoshima Island, the Northern part of Okinawa Island, and Iriomote Island were first added to the tentative list of nomination for World Natural Heritage properties under the name of Ry≈´ky≈´ Shot≈ç in 2003. With strong oppositions from Amami and Kagoshima Prefecture as a whole, the candidate site was renamed Amami‚ÄìRyukyu before changing to the current, more descriptive name in 2017. Even before the U.S. military occupation, the Amami Islanders identified themselves as \\"Japanese to the bone\\" (Sanetaka Nakae, Governor of Amami Gunto), but the alien military occupation fueled the nationalistic sentiment. It accelerated the education of Standard Japanese before the re-evaluation of local speeches started in the 1980s. By contrast, the Amami Islanders felt a sense of difference with regard to their southern neighbor, Okinawans, and the reversion movement strengthened the self- perception. From beginning to end, the reversion movement stressed that the Amami Islands did not belong to the Ryukyu Shot≈ç but to ≈åshima District, Kagoshima Prefecture. As the U.S. expanded military based on Okinawa, the decoupling was increasingly considered important for Amami's early return to Japan. Because the U.S. military occupation destroyed Amami's economy, numerous Amami Islanders had to leave the islands to work in Okinawa. At the time of Amami's reversion, some 70 thousand Amami Islanders stayed on Okinawa, where they faced discrimination from Okinawans, who saw Amami Islanders as potential criminals and prostitutes. On April 1, 1952, the U.S. set up the centralized Ryukyu Government on Okinawa, intensifying Okinawa's politico- economic subjugation of Amami, but when Amami returned to Japan on December 25, 1953, the Okinawan society, with support from the U.S. military, suddenly launched the \\"anti-Amami purge\\". Civil service employees from Amami were laid off, and every request from Amami to facilitate administrative transfer was rejected by the Ryukyu Government. Amami Islanders' traumatic experience on Okinawa widened the psychological gap between the two groups.

Such oaths were intended to increase personal loyalty to Hitler and prevent dissent. The Hitler oath, introduced for all members of the Wehrmacht and civil servants in 1934, was one such oath. Others were sworn by members of organisations such as the Schutzstaffel (SS), whose oath may have inspired the Hitler oath, and by the Hitler Youth.  Background  The most famous of the oaths to Hitler was the Hitler Oath introduced to the Wehrmacht (armed forces) and civil service by Adolf Hitler in August 1934. Those swearing the oath promised their loyalty to Hitler in person, rather than the state or its offices, and it was intended to increase loyalty to Hitler and to prevent dissidence. Other oaths, with similar aims, with sworn by other organisations. The oath sworn to Hitler by members of the Schutzstaffel (SS) predated that of the 1934 Wehrmacht oath and may have served as an inspiration or model for it.  SS oath  Members of the Schutzstaffel (SS), founded by the Nazi Party in 1925, swore the following oath: The oath was renewed publicly at an annual ceremony. After 30 January 1941 foreign-born members of the SS swore to Hitler only as F√ºhrer, not as \\"F√ºhrer and Chancellor\\"; Volksdeutsche members of the SS continued to swear the original oath. SS Gruppenf√ºhrers swore a supplementary oath to adhere to Heinrich Himmler's specifications for recruits even if \\"it means rejecting my own children or the children of my clan ... I swear by Adolf Hitler and by the honour of my ancestors ‚Äî so help me god\\".  Wehrmacht and civil service oath  Reichswehr soldiers swear the Hitler oath in 1934, with hands raised in the traditional schwurhand gesture. After gaining power and appointing himself head of state Hitler altered the traditional oath sworn by Wehrmacht servicemen to the state or supreme commander. The new wording of the oath, which came to be known as the Hitler oath, was to Hitler personally and was ordered to be taken by all members of the Wehrmacht. The oath was a change to that of the previous oaths which swore loyalty to the state, and not any individual, and had been sworn only by new recruits. There are some similarities between the oath and those sworn to the monarch in British and Commonwealth armies but the Nazi oath was granted more ceremony and German soldiers placed more significance upon a strict adherence to it. The oath functioned as intended, forming a moral obstacle for any considering disobeying Hitler's orders or offering resistance to his regime. Former German officers used the oath as evidence in war crime trials after the war as part of their superior orders defence.  Hitler Youth  Members of the Hitler Youth swore the following oath: The oath was sworn by those entering the organisation in a ceremony held before the \\"blood banner\\" (Blutfahne), said to have been soaked in the blood of those who died in the Munich Beer Hall Putsch of 1923. The swearing of the oath has been described by German historian and former Hitler Youth member Hermann Graml as part of the \\"cult-like\\" nature of the organisation key to attracting recruits.  Foreign volunteers  264x264px Like the German armed forces and civil servants, foreign volunteers and conscripts from nazi puppet states, and occupied countries, were required to swear an oath of personal loyalty and obedience to Adolf Hitler. The oaths of foreign legions and divisions were allowed to retain some scraps of national identity to make it seem that they had volunteer to join Hitler‚Äôs war, not as collaborators, but as loyal patriots defending their country against Bolshevism.

G√∂tze was born in Weimar where she initially trained in music with her father, the tenor Franz G√∂tze. In her later years, she had her own singing school in Leipzig as well as teaching in the conservatory there. She died in Leipzig at the age of 68 after several years of increasingly poor health. Life and career G√∂tze was born in Weimar to Franz G√∂tze (1814‚Äì1888) and Karoline G√∂tze n√©e M√ºller (1812‚Äì1847). Her father had begun his musical career as a violinist with the Weimar court orchestra and later became a tenor opera singer who sang in the first Weimar performances of Wagner's operas Tannh√§user and Lohengrin. Her mother, a former opera singer and actress, had been paralyzed and bedridden for much of G√∂tze's childhood and died when she was seven years old. She was initially educated at a local school in Weimar but also received intensive lessons from her father in piano and singing. In 1853 G√∂tze moved to Leipzig with her father when he was appointed a singing professor at the Leipzig Conservatory. Her father's friend, Franz Liszt, greatly admired her singing and encouraged her to pursue an artistic career. When she made her debuts as a concert singer in 1860 in Weimar and Jena, Liszt himself accompanied her on the piano. She was described by contemporaries as having a well-balanced contralto voice of rare depth and charm. By 1861, her intense training had taken a toll on her voice, and for a time G√∂tze turned to acting instead. She made her debut as an actress in the Weimar Court Theater in Karl von Holtei's Lenore. After her vocal health was restored in the mid-1860s, she resumed an active career as a concert and lieder singer. She made a conscious decision not to sing again on the opera stage, a decision which her friend Ida Marie Lipsius said suited her \\"reserved nature.\\" A highly regarded interpreter of the songs of Schumann, Liszt, and Mendelssohn, she made concert tours to Germany, Switzerland, England, and the Netherlands. After 1873 G√∂tze's concert performances became much less frequent as she began giving private singing lessons and took up a position as a teacher at the Dresden Conservatory. In 1875 she also opened her own singing and opera school in Dresden. Her former pupil, Molly von Kotzebue, joined her school as a teacher in 1885 after which it became known as the \\"G√∂tze-Kotzebueschen- Schule\\". G√∂tze in her later years In the autumn of 1889, G√∂tze moved her school to Leipzig while Molly von Kotzebue remained in Dresden and went her own way as a singing teacher. G√∂tze's father Franz had died in Leipzig in 1888 after a career of over thirty years as a legendary singing professor at the conservatory, providing her with an entr√©e into the musical world of the city. Her new singing school's public examinations and soir√©es soon became social events. One of the highlights was a celebration of Franz Liszt on 4 June 1902 where her students performed two musical melodramas composed by Liszt especially for her. During her time in Leipzig she published several revised versions of vocal exercises by earlier vocal pedagogues, such as Peter von Winter and Giuseppe Concone, as well as collections of her own exercises. Her much-discussed article \\"√úber den Verfall der Gesangkunst\\" (\\"On the decline of the art of singing\\") was published in Neue Zeitschrift f√ºr Musik in 1875. In it she summarized her teaching principles and lamented the tendency of talented young singers to rush into stage careers before they had put in the necessary years study and apprenticeship. In the later years of her life G√∂tze continued giving private singing lessons and writing as long as her health permitted. However, her health gradually deteriorated and she died at the age of 68 after \\"severe suffering\\". She was buried in the Neuer Johannisfriedhof cemetery in Leipzig. During her last years she was cared for by her confidante, Selma Deckner, who also helped her financially. After G√∂tze's death Deckner gave a large collection of her papers and photographs to the Leipzig History Museum. Writings Although G√∂tze was primarily known for her work as a singer and vocal pedagogue, she also had a parallel career as a writer. Her interest in writing had begun when she was eight years old and wrote a short play entitled Esther oder die Liebe zum Volke (Esther or the Love of the People). She performed it at her father's house before an enthusiastically applauding Franz Liszt. Later as a student in Leipzig she began writing reviews of the concerts that she had attended and some short plays. According to her close friend Ida Marie Lipsius, it was \\"as if a secret train pulled the child's soul to poetry\\" and provided a balance to her intense musical training. Her later writing included music criticism and essays for journals such as Signale f√ºr die musikalische Welt, Deutsche Gesangskunst, and Neue Musik-Zeitung and an outspoken reply to Schopenhauer's views on music. She also wrote a number of plays (some under the pseudonym \\"A. Weimar\\") which were successfully performed on German and Austrian stages. Her first major success as a playwright was her five-act tragedy Susanne Mountfort based on the life of the English actress Susanna Mountfort. According to a contemporary account in The Athenaeum, its premiere in Dresden was a great success with the actors and the playwright receiving numerous curtain calls. One of her last works was a completion of Schiller's unfinished fragment Demetrius. G√∂tze's version of Demetrius premiered in 1893 in Weimar and was later performed in Dresden and Leipzig. G√∂tze's dramatic works included: Title page of G√∂tze's play Demetrius * Susanne Mountfort, tragedy in five acts, premiered Dresden 5 February 1871 (1871) * Vittoria Accoramboni, tragedy in five acts (1875) * Eine Heimfahrt, drama in four acts, (1879) * Magdalena drama in four acts (1880) * Eine Diplomatin, comedy in four acts, premiered Hamburg (1880) * Nur kein Blaustrumpf, comedy in one act (1881) * Hohe Liebe, drama in four acts (1884) * Gr√§fin Osmon, drama, premiered Dresden (1884) * Die wei√üe Frau, comedy (1884) * Wera, comedy, premiered Berlin (1884) * Zwei Mal Christnacht, dramatic fairy tale in eight scenes (1886) * Schlo√ü Raveneck, drama (1886) * Alpenst√ºrme, drama in one act, premiered Hamburg (1886) * Im Bann auf Helgoland, drama (1893) * Isolde, drama in five acts (1995) * Demetrius, tragedy in five acts, premiered Weimar 1893 (1897) Students Fanny Moran- Olden, one of G√∂tze's Dresden students Ada Colley, one of G√∂tze's Leipzig students Opera and concert singers trained by G√∂tze included: * (1861‚Äì1918) was a German contralto primarily active on the stages of Cologne and later a singing teacher.

The subject of the referendum is a revision of the Algerian constitution, and it follows a series of ongoing protests known as the Hirak Movement An effort by President Abdelmadjid Tebboune to meet demands raised by the demonstrations that led to the resignation of 4-term former President Abdelaziz Bouteflika in April 2019, the revised constitution aims to reform the powers of the Algerian government. Background On 16 February 2019, after four-term former President Abdelaziz Bouteflika announced his candidacy for a fifth term as the President of Algeria, protests erupted across the country, and while they remained largely peaceful, they led the Algerian military to strongly encourage Bouteflika to resign immediately. Bouteflika named a caretaker government on 31 March, and shortly after Algerian Army Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Ahmed Gaed Salah called on him to leave office two days later, he formally relinquished power. Tensions towards Bouteflika arose in part out of public discontent with his 20-year record as president, which was often characterized by corruption and allegations of using state monopolies to finance systems of clientelism,Rasmus Alenius Boserup; Luis Martinez, eds. (2016). Algeria Modern: From opacity to complexity. CERI/Sciences Po. London: Hurst. ISBN 9781849045872. and can also be traced back to a broader pattern of frustration with the powers of the Algerian government. Additionally, Bouteflika's health in regards to his ability to govern was consistently called into question after his stroke in 2013, where his frequent hospitalization and few public appearances led to the proliferation of rumors about his death. As a result, his candidacy was considered an embarrassment by some. The presidential election was held on 12 December 2019 despite widespread public opposition, and with 58.13% of valid votes in the first round, Abdelmadjid Tebboune was declared the winner. Unrest surrounded the election, however, and various protests across the country directly before 12 December called for a boycott of the election, leading to a turnout of 8% according to the Rally for Culture and Democracy (or 39.88% as reported by the Algerian government) and some 1,200 protestors being detained by Algerian authorities. By later that December, the National Committee for the Liberation of Detainees (CNLD) estimated that 180 prisoners of conscience of the 1200 initially arrested for demonstrations around the election still remained in prison. On the eve of the first anniversary of the Hirak Movement, President Abdelmadjid Tebboune announced in a statement to the Algerian national media that February 22 would be declared the Algerian \\"National Day of Fraternity and Cohesion Between The People and Its Army For Democracy\\". In the same statement, Tebboune spoke in favor of the Hirak Movement, saying that \\"the blessed Hirak has preserved the country from a total collapse\\" and that he had \\"made a personal commitment to carry out all of the [movement's] demands.\\" On 21 and 22 February 2020, masses of demonstrators (with turnout comparable to well-established holidays like Algerian Independence Day) gathered to honor the anniversary of the Hirak Movement and the newly established national day. In an effort to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, Tebboune announced on 17 March 2020 that \\"marches and rallies, whatever their motives\\" would be prohibited. After protestors and journalists were arrested for participating in such marches, Tebboune quickly faced accusations of attempting to \\"silence Algerians,\\" and the Algerian government's actions were condemned by Amnesty International, which said in a statement that \\"when all eyes [...] are on the management of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Algerian authorities are devoting time to speeding up the prosecution and trial of activists, journalists, and supporters of the Hirak movement.\\" CNLD estimated that around 70 prisoners of conscience were imprisoned as of 2 July 2020 and that several of the imprisoned were arrested for Facebook posts. Progression On 28 December 2019, the recently inaugurated President Tebboune met with Ahmed Benbitour, the former Algerian Head of Government, with whom he discussed the \\"foundations of the new Republic.\\" On 8 January 2020, Tebboune established a \\"commission of experts\\" composed of 17 members (a majority of which were professors of constitutional law) responsible for examining the previous constitution and making any necessary revisions. Led by Ahmed Laraba, the commission was required to submit its proposals to Tebboune directly within the following two months. In a letter to Laraba on the same day, Tebboune outlined seven axes around which the commission should focus its discussion. These areas of focus included strengthening citizens' rights, combatting corruption, consolidating the balance of powers in the Algerian government, increasing the oversight powers of parliament, promoting the independence of the judiciary, furthering citizens' equality under the law, and constitutionalizing elections. Notably, Tebboune's letter calls for an \\"immutable and intangible\\" two-term limit to anyone serving as president ‚Äî a major factor in the initial Hirak Movement protests, which were spurred by former president Abdelaziz Bouteflika's announcement to run for a fifth term. The preliminary draft revision of the constitution was publicly published on 7 May 2020, but the Laraba Commission (as the \\"commission of experts\\" came to be known) was open to additional proposals from the public until 20 June. By 3 June, the commission had received an estimated 1,200 such proposals. After all public revisions were considered by the Laraba Commission, the draft was introduced to the Cabinet of Algeria (Council of Ministers). On 4 July 2020, Tebboune announced that the referendum would occur in September or October 2020. On 24 August 2020, the date for the referendum was set for 1 November, the anniversary of the start of Algeria's war of independence. The revised constitution was adopted in the Council of Ministers on 6 September, in the People's National Assembly on 10 September, and Council of the Nation on 12 September, but its implementation is currently contingent on the results of the 1 November referendum. Proposed amendments = Parliamentary reforms = If passed, the new constitution would allow the president to appoint a prime minister if the president's political party holds a majority in parliament or a head of government if an alternate party holds a parliamentary majority. In either scenario, the prime minister or head of government would act as head of the executive branch in joint with the president but, unlike the president, could be removed by the People's National Assembly through a motion of no confidence. Upon appointment, this joint head of the executive branch would have 30 days to form a government (a process in parliamentary systems that includes appointing cabinet members). If unable to form a government, they would forfeit their position, and a new incumbent would be appointed. Articles 103-110 detail the full appointment process of the prime minister or head of government by the president. Article 122 would set a maximum term limit for members of parliament at two terms, and Article 126 specifies that any members would only be afforded parliamentary immunity for acts related to the exercise of their functions. The new constitution would not allow legislation by ordinance during parliamentary recess as is possible under the current version of the Algerian constitution. = Judicial reforms = The new constitution would replace the Algerian Constitutional Council with a Constitutional Court. = Executive reforms = The new constitution would retain the two-term limit on the presidency, but adds that this limit would apply to both consecutive nonconsecutive terms and that the term of a resigning president would be considered fully completed. Bouteflika was able to remain president for four terms even after the 2016 constitutional amendment that implemented term limits because the amendment stated that it would only apply to future presidents. The initial draft provided for the possibility for the President of the Republic to appoint a vice-president, but this was removed in the final version of the constitution. = Other reforms = Under the proposed constitution, the National Independent Electoral Authority (ANIE) would be constitutionalized in an effort to promote democracy, improve election security, and combat corruption. Mention of the Hirak Movement would be included in the preamble to the constitution. Military interventions would require a two-thirds majority in parliament and would take place under the supervision of the United Nations, the African Union, and the Arab League. Referencing similar themes in the Algerian Constitution of 1989, the new constitution also reaffirms the government's commitment to the reinforcement of public rights and freedoms. Dual citizens would be allowed to hold senior government positions from which they had previously been barred from under an article in the previous Algerian constitution. Reception and criticisms Despite the proposed reforms, Tebboune and the Algerian government faced criticism that the revised constitution did not address many of the issues called into question by the Hirak Movement, especially the balance of powers. =Executive powers over parliament= If the constitution were passed, the president would still retain his ability to veto laws through two avenues: # Demanding a rereading of the law, which would then require a supermajority in parliament. # An indirect veto in the Council of the Nation, where one-third of its total members were appointed by Tebboune and a three- fourths majority is required to approve a bill. Others worry that Tebboune's parliament will quickly transform into the Bouteflika's rubber-stamp parliament ‚Äî characterized by little political discourse and an announcement of allegiance to Bouteflika himself. Parliament has historically struggled to garner a sense of respect from some Algerians, and it has faced significant corruption scandals in the past. Notably, a member of parliament alleged that seats in the assembly had been sold to some for approximately $540,000 (USD). Others argue that some aspects of the proposed constitution are not effective or efficient in practice, and that specifically, the party majority in parliament required to appoint a prime minister is not feasible in a nation with often fractured political parties and ideologies. =Executive powers over the judiciary= The executive branch would retain its power to appoint judges to the judiciary without parliamentary approval, raising questions about its objectivity and ability to foster accountability. =Other executive powers= Under the new constitution, the president would be in control of all government regulatory bodies. Critics raise concerns that this, alongside other powers in the executive branch, parliament, and judiciary, would \\"give [him] the powers of an emperor.\\" References Category:2020 in Algeria Category:2020 referendums Category:Constitutional referendums in Algeria Category:November 2020 events in Africa ","title":"2020 Algerian constitutional referendum"},{"id":"65387020","text":"Jules Miller (born 1990) is an entrepreneur, wellness leader, and the CEO and founder of The Nue Co. supplement and herbal medicine brand.

Agnes Keith, Countess of Moray kept jewels to cover her husband's expenses, Hans Eworth, Darnaway Castle Other jewels sold by Regent Moray ended up in the hands of the widows of two merchants who dealt with him. Helen Leslie, the \\"Goodwife of Kinnaird\\", was the widow of James Barroun, who had loaned money to Moray. She married James Kirkcaldy, whose brother, Moray's friend William Kirkcaldy of Grange, unexpectedly declared for Mary in 1570.David Laing, Works of John Knox, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1848), p. 322-3: Harry Potter, Edinburgh Under Siege: 1571-1573 (Stroud, 2003), p. 45. Helen, or Ellen, Achesoun, a daughter of the goldsmith John Achesoun,G. How, 'Canongate Goldsmiths and Jewellers', Burlington Magazine, 74:435 (June 1939), p. 287. was the widow of William Birnie, a merchant who had bought the lead from the roof of Elgin Cathedral in 1568 expecting a lucrative deal in scrap metal. Achesoun and Birnie had lent Moray ¬£700 Scots and taken as security some of Mary's \\"beltis and cousteris\\". The \\"couster\\", or in French a \\"cottouere\\" or \\"cotiere\\", was the gold chain that descended from a woman's belt with its terminal pendant. One of these was described in Scots as, \\"ane belt with ane cowter of gold and ceyphres (ciphers) and roissis quheit and reid inamelit (roses enamelled white and red), contenand knoppis and intermiddis (entredeux) with cleik (clasp) and pandent 44 besyd the said pandent.\\"HMC 6th Report: Earl of Moray (London, 1877), pp. 643-4 After Birnie died, Achesoun married Archibald Stewart, a future Provost of Edinburgh and friend of John Knox.

After Mary escaped from Lochleven in May 1568 and made her way to England, the jewel sales were halted. Most of the remaining pieces which Mary had left behind were kept in a coffer in Edinburgh Castle. After Moray was assassinated in January 1570, Mary wrote from Tutbury and Sheffield Castle to his widow, Agnes Keith, asking for \\"our H\\", the \\"Great H of Scotland\\" and other pieces. Agnes Keith kept these jewels. Regent Moray had taken them to England and brought them back unsold. His successor Regent Lennox wanted them, while the Earl of Huntly wrote for them for Mary, Agnes Keith did not oblige.HMC 6th Report: Moray (London, 1877), pp. 638, 653.

During the \\"Lang Siege\\" of Edinburgh Castle, the last action of the Marian Civil War, the Captain of the castle, William Kirkcaldy of Grange gave jewels to supporters of Mary as pledges for loans they gave him to pay his garrison.Michael Lynch, Edinburgh and the Reformation, (Edinburgh, 1981), pp. 138‚Äì9, 145, 147. The goldsmiths John Mosman and James Cockie valued the jewels.Bruce Lenman, 'Jacobean Goldsmith-Jewellers as Credit-Creators: The Cases of James Mossman, James Cockie and George Heriot', Scottish Historical Review, 74:198 (1995), pp. 159‚Äì177. Several documents concerning the jewels survive from this time, including a note about Mary's marriage ring, which was in the hands of Archibald Douglas.A. Francis Steuart, Seigneur Davie: A Sketch Life of David Riccio (London, 1922), p. 114 quoting NRS E35/11/4.

Hewitt, Scotland Under Morton: 1572-1580 (John Donald; Edinburgh, 1982), pp. 40-2. The English commander at the siege, William Drury recovered the jewel coffer and redeemed some jewels from lenders including Helen Leslie, Lady Newbattle and Helen Achesoun. They came to his lodging at Leith where Kirkcaldy was held.William Boyd, Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1571-4, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1905), pp. 584-5. Morton obtained the records of the loans and pledges made by Kirkcaldy, and later wrote of his pleasure at this find to the Countess of Lennox.CSP Scotland, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1905), p. 604: NRS E35/11. Kirkcaldy made a statement about the jewels for the benefit of William Drury. Amongst the papers from the castle, Kirkcaldy had written in the margins of an inventory gifts made, or to be made, to Margery Wentworth, Lady Thame, widow of John Williams, Master of the Jewels, and wife of William Drury. Kirkcaldy had blotted out some of these marginal notes, and now signed a statement that Lady Thame had refused any gifts of Mary's jewels from him back in April 1572 when she was staying at Restalrig.Robertson (1863), p. clii-cliv, the inventory is now NRS E35/9/4. Possibly a lady of the Wentworth family, possibly Margery, Lady Thame, Hans Eworth, Tate Britain Mary Fleming, who had helped make this inventory of the jewels with her husband William Maitland and Lady Seton, was ordered to return a chain or necklace of rubies and diamonds.Charles Thorpe McInnes, Accounts of the Treasurer of Scotland: 1566‚Äì1574, vol. 12 (Edinburgh, 1970), p. 355: Thomas Thomson, Collection of Inventories (Edinburgh, 1815), pp. 193‚Äì4: John Hill Burton, Register of the Privy Council, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1878), pp. 246-7 Agnes Gray, Lady Home surrendered jewels which had been her security for a loan of ¬£600 Scots.Thomson (1815), p. 195: Register of the Privy Council, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1878), p. 247.

On 3 August Morton sent a copy of Kirkcaldy's inventory to the Countess of Lennox, in the hope that she could get all the jewels still in Drury's hands and now in Berwick sent to him.CSP Scotland, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1905), p. 604. Morton wrote to Countess of Lennox again later in August, asking for a progress report. Ninian Cockburn, the bearer of his letter, had delivered some jewels from Archibald Douglas to Valentine Browne, treasurer of Berwick.CSP Scotland, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1905), p. 604. In October 1573 Morton sent money to Berwick to redeem one of the queen's garnishings, comprising a pair of headbands and a necklace of \\"roses of gold\\" set with diamonds.George R. Hewitt, Scotland Under Morton: 1572-1580 (John Donald; Edinburgh, 1982), p. 40: Accounts of the Treasurer, vol. 12 (Edinburgh, 1970), p. 364. Robert Melville was interrogated about the jewels in October.William Boyd, Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1571-4, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1905), pp. 615-23.

Helen Leslie, Lady Newbattle had Mary's buttons as security for a loan, Scottish National Portrait Gallery Morton had a prolonged negotiation with Moray's widow, Agnes Keith, now Countess of Argyll, for the return of the diamond and cabochon ruby pendant called the \\"Great H of Scotland\\" and other pieces.Thomson (1815) pp. 195‚Äì200. Unsurprisingly, Mary wrote again to the countess asking her to return the jewels to her instead. Agnes Keith claimed the jewels were security for her late husband's unpaid expenses as Regent, but she gave them to Morton in March 1575.Amy Blakeway, Regency in Sixteenth-Century Scotland (Woodbridge, 2015), p. 90. Jewels with political messages Mary Queen of Scots wrote from Sheffield Castle in 1574 and 1575 to her ally, the Archbishop of Glasgow in Paris asking him to commission jewelry for her. She wanted gold lockets with her portrait to send to her friends in Scotland. As a gift for Queen Elizabeth, Mary wanted bracelets or a pendant or gold mirror to hang from a belt. This would be decorated with her cipher or initials conjoined with Elizabeth's, and with other motifs, emblems, or inscriptions, according to the \\"device\\" made by her uncle, the Cardinal of Lorraine. She also asked for a gold belt and necklace as a present for the daughter of her chancellor, Gilles du Verger.A.

The portraits, to be distributed as keepsakes for her supporters, may have been her profile cut in cameo. Several examples exist, and one is said to have been Mary's gift to Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk.Joan Evans, A History of Jewellery: 1100-1870 (London, 1970), p. 199, pl. 92.Cameo jewel, Portland Collection, The Jewellery Editor While she was at Chatsworth in September 1578 Mary wrote to the Archbishop again, sending a \\"device\\", a description of the concept and theme for a jewel she wanted to be made in gold and enamel as a gift for her son, James VI.Maria Hayward, Stuart Style (Yale, 2020), pp. 215-6.A. Labanoff, Lettres de Marie Stewart, vol. 5 (London, 1852), p. 66. In 1570 the Countess of Atholl, and her friends, known as the \\"Witches of Atholl\\", had commissioned a jewel which referred directly to the succession to the crown of England.Julian Goodare, The Scottish Witch-Hunt in Context (Manchester, 2002), p. 58: Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 3 (London, 1903), pp. 315, 361-2, 368-70.

In September 1584 a German travel writer Lupold von Wedel saw James, who was staying at Ruthven Castle, wearing this cross on his hat ribbon in St John's Kirk in Perth.Thomson (1815), p. 308: Gottfied von B√ºlow, 'Journey Through England and Scotland made by Lupold von Wedel', Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, vol. 9 (London, 1895), p. 245 In October the valet John Gibb returned the cross to the Master of Gray, the newly appointed Master of the Royal Wardrobe.Thomson (1815), p. 314. It was probably the same diamond and ruby cross that his grandmother, Mary of Guise had pawned to John Home of Blackadder for ¬£1000 when she was Regent of Scotland, and Mary, Queen of Scots had redeemed.Accounts of Treasurer, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1915), pp. xxxi-xxxii, 237. Mary had some jewelry and precious household goods with her in England. Inventories were made at Chartley in 1586 of pieces in the care of Jean Kennedy,Alexandre Labanoff, Lettres de Marie Stuart, vol. 7 (London, 1852), pp. 242‚Äì59. and at Fotheringhay in February 1587.Alexandre Labanoff, Lettres de Marie Stuart, vol. 7 (London, 1852), pp. 254‚Äì274. She usually wore a cross of gold and pearl earrings. Another gold cross was engraved with the Mysteries of the Passion.Alexandre Labanoff, Lettres de Marie Stuart, vol. 7 (London, 1852), pp. 242. On 3 February 1603 James VI of Scotland gave James Sempill of Beltries, a son of Mary Livingston, a jewel which had belonged to Mary as a reward for his good service and faithful conduct in diplomatic negotiations in England. The jewel was a carcatt (a necklace chain) with a diamond in one piece and a ruby in another, with a tablet (a locket) set with a carbuncle of a diamond and ruby, set around with diamonds.David Masson, Register of the Privy Council: 1599‚Äì1604, vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1884), p. 533.

The Eglinton parure Earl of Eglinton discovered Mary Seton's necklace in his castle A necklace from the collection of the Earls of Eglinton is traditionally believed to have been Mary's gift to Mary Seton. The piece includes \\"S-shaped snakes in translucent dark-green enamel\\". It was divided into two in the 17th-century, one part is displayed at the National Museum of Scotland and the other, held by the Royal Collection, at Holyrood Palace.

He changed his surname to Montgomerie, and married Anne Livingstone, the childhood companion of Elizabeth of Bohemia and favourite of Anne of Denmark.William Fraser, Memorials of the Montgomeries, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1859), pp. 255-8.

In 1894 George Montgomerie, 15th Earl of Eglinton rediscovered the necklace in the muniment room at Eglinton.John Kerr, The Golf-Book of East Lothian (Edinburgh, 1896), p. 247. He sold it by auction, for the benefit of his sisters, according to his father's will. By this time the jewel had long been divided into at least two pieces, another chain with green serpents was at Duns Castle in the possesion of the Hay family.George Seton, A history of the family of Seton during eight centuries, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1896), pp. 134-5 This section of the necklace came to the Hay family when Elizabeth Seton married William Hay of Drumelzier in 1694.

A similar story is told of the Seton necklace, that the queen gave it to Mary Seton after she won a round of golf at Seton Palace. Mary certainly played golf at Seton, and in 1568 her accusers said she had played \\"pall-mall and golf\\" as usual at Seton in the days after Darnley's death.James Aikman, History of Scotland of George Buchanan, vol. 2 (Glasgow, 1827), pp. 497-8: John Hosack, Mary Queen of Scots and her accusers, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1870), p. 542: Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1563-1603, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1900), p. 558, the original has \\"palmall and goif\\" Mary Seton's golf connection was publicised around the time of the auction in Golf Magazine (March 1894), followed up by Robert Seton's 1901 Golf Illustrated article, 'Archery and Golf in Queen Mary's Time'.George Seton, A history of the family of Seton during eight centuries, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1896), p. 133 fn. 3: Monsignor Seton, Golf Illustrated, 10 (Nov. 1901).

They were heirlooms in the family of John Clerk of Penicuik. They consist of a necklace, locket and pendant. The necklace has 14 large filigree open-work \\"paternoster\\" beads which could be filled with perfumed musk.Rosalind K. Marshall, Mary, Queen of Scots: \\"In my end is my beginning\\" (Edinburgh, 2013), p. 83. The locket has tiny portraits of woman and a man, traditionally identified as Mary and James VI.

The Penicuik jewels are displayed at the National Museum of Scotland.Necklace, locket & pendant, known as Penicuik Jewels, associated with Mary, Queen of Scots, NMS H.NA 421 Mary bequeathed Geillis Mowbray jewels, money, and clothes, including a pair of gold bracelets, a crystal jewel set in gold, and a red enamelled \\"oxe\\" of gold.

The fundraiser and purchase of the Penicuik jewels by the museum and their history were described in 1923 by Walter Seton. He explains the descent of the jewels in the Clerk family. Geillis Mowbray married Sir John Smith of Barnton. Their daughter, Geillis Smith married Sir William Gray of Pittendrum, and their daughter Mary Gray married the successful merchant John Clerk,Siobhan Talbott, 'Letter-Book of John Clerk of Penicuik', Miscellany of the Scottish History Society, XV, (Woodbridge, 2014), p. 11. who bought the Penicuik estate in 1646.Walter Seton, The Penicuik jewels of Mary Queen of Scots (Edinburgh, 1923), p. 29 Geillis Mowbray's son John Smith of Grothill and Kings Cramond was Provost of Edinburgh.

It was completed in 1766 in Rococo style. Featuring a historic organ from 1709, it is a concert venue of the Gallus-Konzerte series of mostly sacred music concerts.  History  The present church was completed in 1766 in Rococo style. It is the extension of a building from 1666, with the west tower built by Johann Kersten in 1706.  Architecture  While the exterior is simple, the interior is richly decorated. It is a large hall church with a narrow choir, which looks semicircular inside and three- sided from outside. The exterior in quarry stone masonry was intended for plastering. The tower and church feature round-arched windows. The south portal shows a chronostichon from 1767. The interior is decorated with a mirrored ceiling and furnishings in uniform rococo style. Apostle medallions and stucco frames of the side windows were added around 1913. The church features an elevated chancel, a high altar, inclined side altars, pulpit and baptismal font. The altar area is separated from the nave by a curved balustrade. The high retable altar has paintings in rococo design by G. Chr. Sch√ºtz the Elder. The ceiling paintings were created in 1768 by Joh. Ignaz Heideloff. Other original furnishings include a Piet√† and confessionals. The church is a listed monument.  Organ  Dahm organ The organ was built in the 18th century by (1660‚Äì1727), an organ builder from Mainz. He created it originally in 1709 for the abbey in Frankfurt, as an instrument of 22 stops on two manuals and pedal. It was expanded in 1748 by Johann Christian K√∂hler who added a third manual of 7 stops. It was sold to Fl√∂rsheim in 1809 when the monasteries were dissolved. An 1818 notice from the government of Hesse-Nassau describes the instrument as the best and most beautiful in the whole duchy (\\"die sch√∂nste und beste Orgel im ganzen Herzogtum\\"). The organ was restored and expanded from 1959 to 1961 by Paul Ott from G√∂ttingen. The Prospect and some stops are still original, and thus the largest instruments containing parts by Dahm.  Gallus-Konzerte  The concert series was founded in 1979, with a first concert on 9 November 1980, using the hall with good acoustics and the historic organ for concerts of regional importance, with a focus on sacred music. The concerts have been organised in collaboration with the broadcaster Hessischer Rundfunk. Some of them were recorded, such as: * Gallus-Konzerte in der Barockkirche zu Fl√∂rsheim am Main, works by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Mendelssohn, Rheinberger and others, Collegium Instrumentale Alois Kottmann, Figuralchor des Hessischen Rundfunks, conducted by Alois Ickstadt.

A long-term member of the Berlin Court Opera, he performed leading roles in Europe, such as Verdi's Rigoletto and Wagner's Dutchman in Der fliegende Holl√§nder. He took part in several world premieres in Berlin.  Life and career  Born Johann Baptist Hoffmann in Garitz, Hoffmann was the fifth child of Wolfgang Melchior Hoffmann (died 1880), a proprietor of a material goods shop from Ochsenfurt and part- time trombonist in the , and Margarethe Hoffmann, n√©e Guck, a talented alto singer in the church choir. He was noticed as a boy soprano. He first worked as a salesman but decided for a singing career. August Kindermann in Munich and other singing teachers judged him unsuitable for opera singing, but he was accepted by Weinlich-Tipka in Munich. He made his operatic debut as a hunter in Kreutzer's Das Nachtlager in Granada. He got an engagement at the Graz Opera, followed by a four-year engagement at the Cologne Stadttheater from 1888, where Valentin in Gounod's Faust and the title role in Wagner's Der fliegende Holl√§nder (The Flying Dutchman) were among his successes. In 1890, the director of the then Deutsche Oper in New York wanted to engage Hoffmann but without success. In 1892 and 1893, Hoffmann refined his vocal skills with Julius Stockhausen in Frankfurt. He was a member of the Hamburg Opera from 1894 to 1897. From 1895, he made guest performances in Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands, including as Hans Sachs in Wagner's Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg at the Berlin Court Opera and soon afterwards as Lysiart in Weber's Euryanthe. The audience regarded him as a successor of Franz Betz, the first Wotan at the Bayreuth Festival. In 1897, Hoffmann almost moved to the Vienna Court Opera with Gustav Mahler, Kapellmeister at the Hamburg Opera, but instead moved to the Berlin Court Opera as first baritone, and he remained there until 1919. He took part in several world premieres there, including Chabrier's Bris√©√Øs (in German) in 1899, Lotzing's Regina the same year, d'Albert's Kain in 1900, Leoncavallo's Der Roland von Berlin in 1904, and Humperdinck's ' in 1905. In 1906, he appeared as Jochanaan in the house's first production of Salome by Richard Strauss. Hoffmann's grave His mother's death in 1908 plunged him into a deep life crisis. He wanted to give up singing after the end of his engagement in Berlin scheduled for 1910 but found new energy through an extended stay at Schloss Hornegg on Neckar. In November 1910, he appeared as the Minstrel in the German premiere of Humperdinck's opera K√∂nigskinder after Humperdinck had insisted on casting the role with Hoffmann. He extended his engagement to 1915 and again to 1919. He created roles in several world premieres in Berlin. After the end of his stage career in 1919, Hoffmann began to train young singers.

The river flows through unique waterfalls over large rounded blocks of white quartz conglomerate. These large blocks tumbled into the river from Pine Cliff () above the right bank, named after the Scots pine that overgrows its steep slopes. The gorge is picturesque because of the six high stone pillars known as the Ku≈°pergar Towers (), where a climbing area has been set up. A geological trail, the Dov≈æan Gorge forest nature trail, a mountain trail, a scenic trail, and a trail to a Partisan underground press run through the gorge. In the small settlement of ƒåadovlje is the Jamen≈°nik farm with a flax drying oven () with the year 1766 carved on it; it is an example of unique Karawanks architecture and ethnographic heritage. The gorge has been declared a natural monument of Slovenia and lies north of Tr≈æiƒç, along the road from Tr≈æiƒç to Jelendol. Natural monument The Dov≈æan Gorge was protected as a natural monument in 1988 due to its status as a unique site of plant and animal fossils in rocks from the Paleozoic. Numerous species of brachiopods and the foraminifer Schwagerina carniolica were first found and described in the gorge. The picturesque gorge was formed by the Tr≈æiƒç Bistrica River cutting through various conglomerates, limestones, sandstones, and clays. The gorge contains the largest series of barrier waterfalls in Slovenia, formed from quartz conglomerate. Pine Cliff (), which is overgrown with a Scots pine forest, is also composed of quartz conglomerate. Rock =Sandstone= Sandstone is the youngest stone represented in the gorge. It formed during the Lower Permian and is therefore about 250 million years old. During this period, which had a desert climate characterized by large temperature differences between day and night and little precipitation, large rocks under the influence of weather conditions disintegrated into small pieces or sand. However, when this area was flooded by the shallow sea, these particles, together with silt and clay, were consolidated into new rock. =Tarvisio breccia= Tarvisio breccia in the Dov≈æan Gorge Tarvisio breccia takes its name from Tarvisio, Italy, where the rock was first observed. It was later found that the Dov≈æan Gorge had large quantities of the same rock. It is slightly older than sandstone, about 260 million years old. It was formed when large areas of limestone rose above sea level. Due to strong tectonic forces, this rock was broken up and crushed. Smaller pieces accumulated in large quantities on steep banks. Due to gravity, this gravelly material repeatedly slid into the shallow sea, into which inland waters carried silt, sand, and clay. This fine material mixed with the limestone gravel to create Tarvisio breccia. =Limestone= Limestone is the only fossil-bearing rock in the Dov≈æan Gorge. The most typical fossils in the gorge are crinoids, algae, brachiopods, and fusulinids. =Quartz conglomerate= Quartz conglomerate in the Dov≈æan Gorge Flint is the strongest and oldest rock in the Dov≈æan Gorge. Like all rocks in the gorge, this is also a sedimentary rock. It was formed in a similar manner to Tarvisio breccia. Almost 300 million years ago, the Karawanks were under a shallow sea, and rivers carried gravel, sand, and clay from the land, which later formed conglomerate. The pebbles are well rounded, indicating their long journey. They are closely packed together, and the intermediate binder is crushed quartz sand.

She took an early interest in animals on family visits to the zoo. At the age of 12 she had an ear injury and had to undergo an operation. She took a keen interest in anatomy, asking the surgeon many questions. She was also influenced by a natural history teacher Seinig who showed her how to prepare skeleton specimens. She then set up a small personal museum and also learned illustration techniques from a professor Ewald. Along with her father, the sixteen year old Magdalena went to the natural history museum curator Karl August M√∂bius who sent her to Oskar Heinroth, then a volunteer. She worked for a while in taxidermy under the preparator Richard Lemm and her works were made use of in the Vogeln Mittel-Europa. In 1902 Heinroth got engaged with Magdalena with the gift of a blackcap (Sylvia atricapilla). The couple got married when Heinroth became assistant director at the zoological garden in 1904. They began to raise a number of birds, including birds that were rare in captivity, in their apartment, taking measurements and studying the growth. The couple also travelled across Europe. In the 28 years of rearing birds, the couple had made observations on 1000 birds of 286 species and were working towards a major book. The couple received a silver Leibnitz Medal in 1930.

Consecrated in 1976, it is the second church on the site, replacing the earlier St Canice's designed by Francis Petre and completed in 1888. Context The Westport parish of St Canice was established in 1867, and is the largest parish in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Wellington. The first churches in the parish, however, were not in Westport, with churches built at Brighton (now called Tiromoana), Charleston, and Addisons Flat, to service gold-mining communities. However, under the supervision of parish priest Father Thomas Walshe, the first Catholic church in Westport was opened on 17 March 1868. The church, initially called Star of the Sea, but quickly renamed St Canice's after the patron saint of Walshe's birth city of Kilkenny in Ireland, was located at the corner of Bright and Queen Streets, some north of the present St Canice's. The second St Canice's Church in Westport, designed by Francis Petre and opened in 1888 Father Walshe began fundraising for a new church in Westport in late 1878, after returning from a sabbatical in Ireland, but it was not until 1886 that the church building committee authorised the project to proceed. The new St Canice's was designed by architect Francis Petre, and was built at the corner of Brougham and Queen Streets, adjacent to St Canice's School. The church, neo-Gothic in style with overall dimensions of by , and capacity for a congregation of 400, was built from timber (kauri, rimu, t≈çtara and manoao), and opened in November 1888. The official opening and blessing, however, was in June the following year, when Archbishop Francis Redwood visited Westport. The total cost of the church was ‚Ç§2600, including furniture and fittings. The church was weakened by a magnitude 5.9 earthquake centred at Westport on 10 May 1962, and by the Inangahua earthquake in 1968. The cost of repairs and seismic strengthening were deemed prohibitive, and in May 1971 it was decided to replace the church with a new building to be designed by John Scott, who has been described as \\"the greatest church designer of this country's modern era\\". Scott's appointment was controversial at the time, as Charles Thomas, a Christchurch architect, had already done preliminary work for the new church. The parish priest at the time, Father David Monaghan, who encouraged the parish committee to engage Scott, had come to Westport from Havelock North in 1970, and was intimately familiar with Scott's Our Lady of Lourdes Church (1960), where he had been parish priest from 1968. In June 1974, the old church was finally condemned following strong gales during Mass, when some of the congregation feared that the building would collapse. The building was never used for worship again. Architecture Officially opened by Cardinal Reginald Delargey on 8 August 1976, St Canice's Church was John Scott's final new church commission. Its modern design was challenging at first to some parishioners, who preferred the more traditional style of the building that it replaced. Like all of Scott's churches, the design of St Canice's is predicated on a strong geometric concept‚Äîin this case a fan‚Äîand embodied much experimentation, and interplay of coloured light with a complex geometry. A series of four stepped triangular sections are arranged radially, rising up above the altar, and clerestory windows use Scott's typical coloured acrylic glazing, in red, green, yellow and blue. Elsewhere, stained-glass windows from the earlier church have been incorporated. Other materials favoured by Scott are also used: cast concrete, concrete block, and stained timber. Mataƒ´ tongue and groove lines the ceiling. Built by local contractors H. J. Neilson Ltd, the construction cost was about $100,000. As well as some of the stained glass, a number of other elements of the previous church were also reused, including the bell, sanctuary lamp, baptismal font, the stations of the cross, several statues, and the cross on the new church roof. New timber pews replaced the old ones, which were infested with borer. University of Auckland architectural academic and commentator Bill McKay has described St Canice's Church, along with Scott's St Mary's Church, Greenmeadows (1975), as \\"a high point in the diverse and prolific church construction of postwar New Zealand\\", but notes that \\"they have an unresolved quality‚Äîperhaps because of their complex geometrical ambition‚Äîthat gives them a somewhat loose and restless air that is expressive of social changes in the late 1960s and early '70s\\". In the 2005 New Zealand Institute of Architects Nelson‚ÄìMarlborough branch awards, St Canice's received an enduring architecture award, with the judges saying that it was a \\"spatially intricate building, combining uplifing spaces and light with an engaging scale and practical planning\\". Current status Structural assessments of St Canice's in September and November 2012, following the Christchurch earthquakes, rated the building's structural strength as being 18 per cent of the current new building standard, and that the likely mode of failure would be a slow collapse above the pulpit area. As of 2020, the building continues to be used for services.

Wind can generate surface currents on water bodies of any size. The depth and strength of the current depend on the wind strength and duration, and on friction and viscosity losses, but are limited to about 400 m depth by the mechanism, and to lesser depths where the water is shallower. The direction of flow is influenced by the Coriolis effect, and is offset to the right of the wind direction in the Northern Hemisphere, and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. A wind current can induce secondary water flow in the form of upwelling and downwelling, geostrophic flow, and western boundary currents.  Mechanism  Friction between wind and the upper surface of a body of water will drag the water surface along with the wind The surface layer will exert viscous drag on the water just below, which will transfer some of the momentum. This process continues downward, with a continuous reduction in speed of flow with increasing depth as the energy is dissipated. The inertial effect of planetary rotation causes an offset of flow direction with increasing depth to the right in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere. The mechanism of deflection is called the Coriolis effect, and the variation of flow velocity with depth is called an Ekman spiral. The effect varies with latitude, being very weak at the equator and increasing in strength with latitude. The resultant flow of water caused by this mechanism is known as Ekman transport. A steady wind blowing across a long fetch in deep water for long enough to establish a steady state flow causes the surface water to move at 45¬∞ to the wind direction. The variation in flow direction with depth has the water moving perpendicular to wind direction by about 100 to 150 m depth, and flow speed drops to about 4% of surface flow speed by the depth of about 330 to 400 m where the flow direction is opposite to wind direction, below which the effect of wind on the current is considered negligible. The net flow of water over the effective thickness of the current in these conditions is perpendicular to wind direction. Consistent prevailing winds set up persistent circulating surface currents in both hemispheres, and where the current is bounded by continental land masses, the resulting gyres are restricted in longitudinal extent. Seasonal and local winds cause smaller scale and generally transient currents, which dissipate after the driving winds die down. Real conditions often differ, as wind strength and direction vary, and the depth may not be sufficient for the full spiral to develop, so that the angle between wind direction and surface-water movement can be as small as 15¬∞. In deeper water, the angle increases and approaches 45¬∞. A stable pycnocline can inhibit transfer of kinetic energy to deeper waters, providing a depth limit for surface currents. The net inward shallow water flow in a gyre causes the surface level to gradually slope upwards towards the centre. This induces a horizontal pressure gradient which leads to a balancing geostrophic flow.

It is dedicated to Saints Constantine and Helena. The church was built in 1785, probably on the site of an earlier one. The name is an archaic term for ‚Äúprincely orchard‚Äù and refers to the ruler‚Äôs fruit trees that used to grow in the area. Its ktitors were several neighborhood tradesmen, including a furrier, a tailor and a saddle-maker. They are commemorated in the inscription above the door, written in Romanian Cyrillic and also noting that Michael Drakos Soutzos was prince of Wallachia at the time. Repairs took place in 1861, 1880 and 1919.Stoica and Ionescu-Ghinea, pp. 408-409 The shape is trefoil; the building is small (19.5 x 7‚Äì9 meters), with very thick walls. In 1880, the original frescoes were covered in oil painting by Gheorghe Ioanide. Costin Petrescu repainted after 1918, and further work was done in 1960. The paintings were restored in 1995‚Äì1997. The church building was consolidated after 1998. Original frescoes have been uncovered. These decorate the left apse of the nave, and feature Saints Theodore of Amasea, Theodora and Mercurius. Additionally, the ktitor Constantin Be»ôleaga appears together with his wife »òtefana and their child. Initially, a bell tower stood above the entrance. It was taken down after becoming deteriorated, and the bells were taken and melted during the German occupation in World War I. New bells were installed after 1918, in a wooden structure repaired in 2003. The church is listed as a historic monument by Romania's Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs.

During the 1970s Carbonell started writing songs and was among the founders of the ‚Äúnew Aragonese song‚Äù movement, along with his mentor Jos√© Antonio Labordeta. He recorded more than a dozen albums as a singer- songwriter, two of which were dedicated to the figure of French singer- songwriter Georges Brassens. Carbonell also directed and presented several TVE television programs in Aragon. He also started working as a poet and narrator, as well as a journalist for El Peri√≥dico de Arag√≥n, in which he wrote a section of interviews and television criticism under the title \\"Antena paranoica\\". As a musician, he created songs related to the Real Zaragoza football club, such as \\"Coraz√≥n de Le√≥n\\", \\"Zaragol\\" and the official anthem of the club's seventy-fifth anniversary. Carbonell often performed at the Barnasants Festival in Barcelona and in cities in France such as Pau, Toulouse, Saint Jory and Paris. He toured in three occasions to Argentina where he performed in concert halls in Buenos Aires, Rosario, La Plata as well as in Montevideo (Uruguay), Chile and Costa Rica. On September 29, 2014, he participated in a concert in Zaragoza in tribute to Jos√© Labordeta. In the fall of 2014 Carbonell also released a double compilation album entitled 1 vida & 19 canciones. In 2017 he released a new album with unreleased songs entitled El carb√≥n y la rosa.

He had a keen personal interest in medieval architecture on which he studied and wrote extensively, and was a pioneer of the scholarship of timber framing.  Early Life and Education  The Rigold family came originally from either Germany or Austria, the surname thought to be a likely variant of Reginald, and is also found as Rigault, Rigauld and Rigaud. His father was a mining engineer, and Stuart took his middle name, Eborall from his mother's maiden name. Stuart was reportedly proud of his initials S.E.R. due to his great-grandfather having been the general manager of the South Eastern Railway.https://www.britnumsoc.org/publications/Digital%20BNJ/pdfs/1981_BNJ_51_12.pdf Stuart grew up close to Rolvenden in Kent, to which he remained particularly attached. As a student at Sutton Valence he was handicapped by a stutter which he overcame in later life. In 1936, at the age of 17, Stuart went up to the University of St Andrews to read Geology together with English, French and Classics. This was, however, to be cut short by the outbreak of war. Following service at Bletchley Park, working with the Enigma outfit and becoming a Warrant Officer II,https://www.kentarchaeology.org.uk/Research/Pub/ArchCant/Vol.088%20-%201973/07/087.htm he went up to St. Peter's Hall, Oxford to read Greats, matriculating in 1946.  Employment  On coming down from Oxford in 1948 a BA (later progressing to MA), Rigold joined the Inspectorate of Ancient Monuments, which was to be the primary focus of his life's work. Here he worked for 30 years, becoming Principal Inspector for England in his final two years. In 1963 Rigold was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, serving on its council ten years later. He was also a prominent member of numerous other societies, including the Kent Archaeological Society, to whose publication, Archaeologia Cantiana he contributed a large number of articles. He played a prominent part in the Society of Medieval Archaeology, utilising his wide ranging knowledge on the editorial committee, and also in the Royal and British Numismatic Societies, the latter of which he was president from 1971 to 1975https://www.britnumsoc.org/publications/Digital%20BNJ/pdfs/1971_BNJ_40_17.pdf and gold medallist. He was familiar at both Burlington House and the Warburg Institute, where he was a highly valued contributor to discussions. Photographs by Rigold are held in the Conway Library of art and architecture at the Courtauld Institute of Art.  Personal life  Rigold Married Eleanor Pike in 1955, who survived him. The couple had no children.  Bibliography  = Biography = * Collectanea Historica. Essays in Memory of Stuart Rigold.

They are the top-ranked team of Yosuke Todoroki, Shibaman, and Tsuji; the Nakagoshi and Nakaoka, who are leading the second-year and first-year students, respectively; the Yasu-Kiyo faction led by Yasushi and Kiyoshi, who rise to prominence through their crazy fighting style. As the new generation, Fujio, together with his childhood friend Tsukasa and his minion Jamuo, has entered the Warring States period of The Full-time School. Meanwhile, in the somewhat distant city of Toarushi, the Housen Academy, the strongest skinhead army, led by its leader Sachio Ueda, is gaining strength. The Housen Four Heavenly Kings (commonly known as Ozawa Hitoshi), Odajima, Sawamura, Jinkawa, and Shida, along with the young and resourceful minion Sabakan, has assembled the strongest Housen army ever. One day, Housen's students are suddenly attacked by men who claimed to be students of Oya Koukou (Oya High School), while at the same time, a student from Oya Koukou (Oya High School) is also attacked by men who claimed to be Housen's. As a result, the two schools become hostile toward each other. The two schools, Oya Koukou (Oya High School), which is full of individualistic but overwhelmingly strong, and Housen Academy, which is organised in a monolithic fashion, clash on the bank of a river at dusk, and the summit battle of the century is about to begin!  Character  * Kazuma Kawamura as Fujio Hanaoka, the good looking boy aiming at the top of Oya Koukou (Oya High School). He grew up in Kibogaoka Danchi (a.k.a. Zetsubou Danchi) with Seiji, Shinya, Masaya, Madoka, and Shinta, forming a strong bond with each other. He is small in stature, but boasts outstanding power and speed, and was in charge of all the schools in the area when he was in junior high school. He enrolled in Oya Koukou (Oya High School) after graduating from junior high but transferred after two weeks due to his family's moving to live with his grandfather. He transferred back to Oya Koukou (Oya High School) in senior three after his family moved back to town. He has an innocent and curious personality, which enables him to make friends easily with everyone, attracting everyone to gather around her. On the other hand, he also has an appetite to compete with his enemies when he meets them. * Hokuto Yoshino as Tsukasa Takajo, a childhood friend of Fujio. Growing up in Kibogaoka Danchi and going to the in the same junior high school as Fujio, he spends most of his time with Fujio as his fighting partner. After Fujio departed Oya Koukou (Oya High School), he lost his enthusiasm and decided to limit himself, and acted cool in the factional warfare of Oya Koukou (Oya High School). He finally decided to do something after a talk with Murayama, and moved by his followers, he went to find Fujio in the village and challenged him to a man- to-man fight, which cleared all his depression. Since he is not good as forming a group, he supported his best friend Fujio to win the title of Oya Koukou (Oya High School) after he returned. * Jun Shison as Sachio Ueda, the leader of killer army of Housen Academy. He may look slender, but with his power, speed, technique, and well-judgment, he is rumored to be the most powerful fighter in the history of Housen. He is a quiet and stoic man with a calm and collected and personality, and with his strong sense of responsibility, he repeatedly asks himself if he is really worthy of being at the top. He doesn't like useless disputes, and therefore when one of his men gets into a dispute with another school, he often goes to the other side by himself to settle the situation. On the other hand, he does not hide his anger when his friends are treated unreasonably, and he will do his best to fight against any strong enemy. He lives with his mother and sister, protecting his younger sister Yui instead of their father. * Yuki Yamada as Yoshiki Murayama, the unshakable leader of Oya Koukou's part-time school. He is slender but tough, and no matter how badly he is beaten, he will resurrect like a zombie. He survived a rough beating of 100 rounds by delinquents of Oya Koukou's part-time school in the past, and then beat them all back. As a result, he unified the Oya Koukou (Oya High School) for the first time in history, which was once just a collection of delinquents, and pushed it to the top of the SWORD. Through working together with other SWORD gangs, he has grown greatly as an adult. He looks at Todoroki, the head of the Oya Koukou (Oya High School)'s full-time school, who is strong in fights but doesn't let others get to him, as if he were his old self. He is aloof and self-paced, but he can be harsh with anyone who disturbs the discipline. * G≈çki Maeda as Yosuke Todoroki, the man who used to achieve unification of Oya Koukou (Oya High School)'s full-time school almost as soon as he entered the school. He may look like an honour student, but in fact, he is a man of extreme physical strength and is practically the number one fighter in the entire Oya Koukou (Oya High School)'s full-time school. His overly calm personality has made him unable to place himself above others, and as a result, he has caused the balance of the Oya Koukou (Oya High School)'s full-time school to fall apart. * Takayuki Suzuki as Hideto Furuya, the second man of Oya Koukou's part-time school. He is much taller than Murayama and holds the record for withstanding up to 98 rounds in a traditional rough fight. In Murayama's challenge of 100 rounds of being beaten for winning the position of leader of Oya Koukou's part-time school, he is in charge of the 100th round. He got upset and hit Murayama with a chair, which is against the rules. However, the undefeatable Murayama still manage to beat him back. He so impressed by Murayama that he become Murayama's right-hand man after that, helping him with his ambitions. * Wataru Ichinose as Kotaro Seki, a fierce man with a skinhead and the physique of a professional wrestler. He is currently 25 years old and is the oldest student even in Oya Koukou's part-time school, where many students would intentionally and repeatedly fail exams to avoid graduation from the school. He is so powerful that he can toss opponents high into the air during fights. When he enters combat mode, he strikes a unique pose with his hands folded in front of his chest. He has great respect for the younger leader Murayama. When Murayama struggles to find a part-time job, he introduces Murayama to a job at his father's construction company. * Kohei Fukuyama as Jamuo. He admires Fujio and Tsukasa deeply, devoting himself to support them. He is a well-informed man, familiar with the information of not only Oya Koukou (Oya High School), but also of the surrounding delinquent high schools and the whole SWORD area. * Jin Shirasu as Seiji Kirihara, the most brilliant person in the childhood friend group of Kibogaoka Danchi (a.k.a. Zetsubou Danchi). He had been smart since childhood and was accepted to the famous Shutoku High School, where he still managed to become the top of his class. He is, in the words of Fujio, \\"a star of hope in a desperate apartment complex\\". He has a strong sense of justice and loves his friends. * Yuta Nakatsuka as Shinya Oochi, the oldest of the childhood friend group of Kibogaoka Danchi (a.k.a. Zetsubou Danchi). He is a man with a few words and always acts cool. He and his younger brother, Masaya, made a name for themselves in junior high school as unruly fighting brothers. He currently works for the construction company Sekigumi. His dream is to save up his salary and build a house to live in with his mother, who raised him and Masaya by herself. He has a secret crush on Madoka, who is younger than him but acts like a big sister. * Hayato Komori as Masaya Oochi, Shinya's younger brother. The two brothers used to have a lot of quarrels, but after Shinya found his goal and started to work diligently, Masaya followed him to Sekigumi. Currently, he is in charge of the worksite. He demands that Murayama of Oya Koukou (Oya High School), who comes to Sekigumi as a part-time worker, should speak to him in a completely respectful manner as he is a younger but more senior member of the team. In contrast to Shinya, he is a talkative and cheerful character. He and his brother are saving up to build a house to live in with their mother. He is an old acquaintance of Chiharu of Sannoh Rengokai (Hoodlum Squad), having lived in the same apartment complex for a while. * Miu Tomita as Madoka Ishii, the only girl in the childhood friend group of Kibogaoka Danchi (a.k.a. Zetsubou Danchi). Her nickname is \\"Doca\\". She has loved the feeling of winning since childhood, and she hates any unfair things. She is very strong, and in the event of a fight, she can even easily take down a man. On the advice of her parents, who were concerned about her character, she entered Seibang Girls' High School, a school for rich young ladies. At school, she hides her true characters and speaks in a refined manner. She can play clarinet and is the captain of the brass band of her school. * Masato Yano as Arata Maekawa, one of the childhood friend group of Kibogaoka Danchi (a.k.a. Zetsubou Danchi). He has always been shy and gentle. When he was a child, the other five friends were always protecting him. He overthinks things and has an aspect of keeping his problems to himself. His father was an alcoholic and rarely worked, and his mother, who worked part- time, raised him on her own. He dropped out of high school and is now unemployed. There are rumours that he is hanging out with a group of ruffians, which worries his friends. * Kanta Sato as Tettsu, one of the main members of Sannoh Rengokai (Hoodlum Squad), a part of SWORD. His family owns the \\"Yamanoyu\\" public bathhouse ion Sannoh shopping street. He formed \\"DTC\\" with his friend Dan and Chiharu. The three of them have gone on a trip looking for beautiful girls for a while. He has a thing for sweets. * Taiki Sato as Chiharu, a member of Sannoh Rengokai (Hoodlum Squad). He was a student at Oya Koukou (Oya High School), but on the first day of transferring to this new school, he got into trouble with the students there. He was saved by Yamato from Sannoh Rengokai (Hoodlum Squad), and he joined Sannoh Rengokai (Hoodlum Squad) after that, with a history of almost causing conflict between the two gangs. There was a period that he lived with Masaya, the younger brother of the Oochi brothers, at the same apartment complex.

The Columbia Unbecoming controversy was a controversy involving three professors at Columbia University in New York who some students and faculty thought were biased against Israel. At the center of the controversy was Joseph Massad, a Palestinian assistant professor who led the class Palestinian and Israeli Politics and Societies and who described Israel as a racist, settler-colonial state. For years, he was harassed by students in his class who disagreed with him. Pundits called for Columbia to fire him as they saw him unfit to teach. A group of pro-Israel students got together with The David Project and they produced the film Columbia Unbecoming. Some of the students spoke to the camera about having been intimidated by the three professors over their pro- Israel views. Others complained about an atmosphere that was negative to Israel. Screenings of the film in the autumn of 2004 led to an inquiry and to United States Representative Anthony Weiner to call for Massad to be fired for \\"anti-Semitic rantings.\\" The inquiry found no evidence for the complaints and the political motive of the students were questioned. The controversy sparked a national debate on the topic of academic freedom and its limits. Many felt that Massad was the target of a witch-hunt for his pro-Palestinian views and that the controversy was part of a larger campaign to rein in on academic freedom in the U.S. Some argued that the students' perception of bias against Israel stemmed from their unfamiliarity with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and from a strongly pro-Israel society. Others argued that some of the professors Israel criticism were anti-Semitic.  Background  Columbia University is a prestigious Ivy League university in New York where about one quarter of the undergraduate students are Jewish. Lee Bollinger, a First Amendment scholar, became Columbia's president in 2002, after having served for five years as the President of the University of Michigan. Alan Brinkley became the provost of Columbia on July 1, 2003. The three professors that would be named in Columbia Unbecoming, Joseph Massad, George Saliba, and Hamid Dabashi, all worked at Columbia's Middle East and Asian Languages and Cultures department, colloquially known as MEALAC. MEALAC was a small department with only 20 full-time professors. Saliba and Dabashi both had tenure, but not Massad who would come to stand in the center of the controversy. Tenure is very important in American academia because a professor with tenure has much stronger employment security than one without it. The student newspaper at Columbia, Columbia Daily Spectator, would cover the controversy extensively as it unfolded. As would the small, but influential conservative newspaper The New York Sun. The David Project was a Boston-based pro-Israel campus group founded by Charles Jacobs and Avi Goldwasser in 2002. They would produce the film Columbia Unbecoming.  Beginning of the controversy  Massad received his doctorate in political science from Columbia in 1998. Next year he began teaching at the university. He held one elective course called Palestinian and Israeli Politics and Societies for which he became known, as his views on Israel and Palestine differed with those of many of his students. Massad recalled that, in the spring 2001, Jewish students in his class began to tell him that he was discussed at the Jewish Theological Seminary and at Hillel and that his class upsetted Zionists. According to Massad, he didn't think much about it but he began to notice \\"cantankerous students who insisted on scoring political points during the lectures.\\" For the spring 2002, he updated the course description to ensure that students understood that the course was critical of both Zionism and Palestinian nationalism (emphasis in the original): Nevertheless, a student circulated a petition in his class to get him fired. But following a visit to Israel and the Palestinian occupied territories, she was remorseful and told him that someone \\"from the outside\\" had asked her to circulate the petition. On February 26, 2002, Daphna Berman wrote an op-ed in the Spectator, which referenced a lecture Massad had held recently titled \\"Zionism and Jewish Supremacy\\". Berman compared Massad's lecture with a swastika that recently had been found in a bathroom on campus:  The pro-Palestinian rally  Massad, in a speech at a large pro-Palestinian rally on campus on April 17, compared Israel with apartheid-era South Africa. According to him, he said: But in an article in the Spectator, Massad was quoted as saying that Israel is \\"a Jewish supremacist and racist state\\" and \\"every racist state should be threatened.\\" Massad complained to the journalist who wrote the article. She admitted to not having attended the rally, and the Spectator ran a correction on April 24, 2002. Dabashi and some other professors cancelled their classes so that they could attend the rally. He argued in an email sent to his students the day after that he was \\"morally bound to perform a public duty,\\" but apologized for the inconvenience the cancellation caused and promised that it would be made up for with an additional session. The cancellations irritated Columbia's Hillel Director Rabbi Charles Sheer and some students. In a letter to the Spectator called the cancellations \\"not kosher\\" and unacceptable that some professors didn't inform the students in advance. \\"To have students come to a class and advise them only then that the class is cancelled because the professor is about to deliver a public speech is a coercive invitation,\\" he argued. Dabashi and Saliba repudiated Sheer's claims in letters published on May 3 in the Spectator. Dabashi's reply was particularly vicious: Saliba, expressing much the same sentiment, urged Sheer: \\"Rabbi! Just preach! Do not even attempt to teach!\\"  Outside media attention  According to Massad, \\"two major pro- Israeli propagandists,\\" Martin Kramer and Daniel Pipes, began writing hit pieces about him, containing the misquotes from the Spectator article. Kramer was an American-Israeli scholar of the Middle East at Shalem College in Jerusalem and a frequent critic of Middle East studies. Pipes was a conservative pundit and founder of the think tank Middle East Forum. He had recently launched Campus Watch, a site blacklisting scholars he was ideologically opposed to. On June 20, 2002, Kramer posted an article to his website, calling for Massad's dismissal: On June 25, Daniel Pipes and Jonathan Schanzer published an article in the Sun, \\"Extremists on Campus\\", naming Massad as one such extremist, asserting that he used his class as a \\"soapbox for anti-Israeli polemics\\". On September 18, 2002, the Wall Street Journal covered Campus Watch, writing that the site listed eight professors, labeling them as enemies of America and Israel. Two of the eight listed were Massad and Dabashi. Massad claimed that the negative publicity led to him becoming the victim of an identity theft and an e-mail spam campaign and that he started receiving racist emails and death threats. In January 2003, Massad began writing columns about the Middle East for the Egyptian Al-Ahram Weekly. These columns were often attacked by Kramer and Pipes, and Ariel Beery, a freshman student at Columbia. Beery had his own column in the Spectator. He criticized both Massad's course and the opinions Massad expressed in Al-Ahram: Massad found Beery's criticism odd since he had never taken his course. From January 24 to 27, MEALAC in collaboration with the Turath undergraduate student club held a Palestinian film festival on Columbia titled \\"Dreams on a Nation\\". While the festival was well-visited, some criticized its poster which was a map of Palestine with no internal borders. \\"This vision of the Middle East endorsed by MEALAC seems to suggest that there will only be peace once Israel ceases to exist,\\" Beery wrote in an op-ed, \\"MEALAC ... has consistently focused on the Palestinian side of the issue, not legitimately addressing the Israeli-Zionist narrative.\\" Massad replied to the criticism from Pipes and Kramer in Al-Ahram on March 10:  \\"A million Mogadishus\\"  On March 26, at a teach-in protesting the recently launched U.S. invasion of Iraq, assistant professor Nicholas De Genova commented that he wished \\"a million Mogadishus\\" on the invading American troops, referencing the humiliating defeat of U.S. troops in the Battle of Mogadishu in 1993, which brought about the end of the U.S. invasion of Somalia. The comment caused a storm of outrage and Bollinger received a letter signed by 143 members of the House of Representatives and 20,000 e-mails about them. This prompted him to appoint a committee to explore the \\"limits of political expression in the campus environment.\\" Law professor Vincent Blasi would lead the committee and hence it became known as the Blasi committee. The other members of the committee were law professor Michael Dorf, business school dean R. Glenn Hubbard, engineering professor Paul Duby, English professor Kathy Eden, and university chaplain, Jewelnel Davis. According to Blasi, the committee had no mandate to investigate whether departments were \\"biased or has any particular kind of slant,\\" but it investigated whether \\"grade retaliation\\" occurred and whether students had any reason to fear expressing views opposing those of their professors. The committee would meet once a month starting in September. In another column on April 14 in the Spectator, Beery wrote: Massad, who was on a sabbatical, returned to Columbia in the fall of 2003. He held a lecture on October 2, with an unusually large crowd, which included Professor Nicholas Dirks. Massad claimed that after the lecture he was asked a series of rude and hostile questions from students and Sheer, but that he kept his composure. The David Project met with the pro-Israel student group LionPAC in October and agreed to fund Columbia Unbecoming. Most of the recording of the film was done in December that same year. On January 6, 2004, Sheer posted a letter to the Hillel site for the university, stating that the \\"principal anti-Israel voices\\" on Columbia were the faculty and academic departments. He added: He repeated the allegation that Massad had said that \\"the Zionists are the new Nazis\\": \\"Professor Massad has reversed the roles of all the players and redefined many of the historic events: the Zionists are the new Nazis; the Palestinians are oppressed victims and therefore the new Jews.\\" He urged students not to take Massad's course and announced the film project that was underway: \\"A student group, is currently working on a video that records how intimidated students feel by advocacy teaching.\\" In February, the Blasi committee met with Sheer who was very critical of MEALAC. He claimed that Massad had compared Zionism to Nazism in one of his lectures. The Blasi committee presented its findings orally to Bollinger in April 2004, after having listened to twenty people, mostly administrators. The committee believed that an investigation into supposedly biased or one-sided curricula jeopardized academic freedom, that there was no evidence of faculty abuse of students, and that there was evidence of a \\"local problem\\" in MEALAC. These findings were forwarded to the press by Bollinger, who on May 7 told the New York Daily News that \\"[t]hey [the Blasi committee] have said to me they have not found claims of bias or intimidation.\\" Thereafter, the committee dissolved. Auditors began to show up in Massad's spring class and some of them harassed him with hostile ideological questions. He permitted them to do so, but they found no signs of systematic bias against students. Instead, they found \\"a professor who was constantly harassed by outside agitators\\" as a small group of unregistered auditors frequently interrupted Massad's class, which disturbed many of the students. Articles critical of Massad and other MEALAC professors continued to appear in the Sun. On April 18, Jacob Gershman wrote that \\"Columbia has come under increasing scrutiny for its hiring of anti-Israeli professors, including historian Rashid Khalidi, the Edward Said professor of Arab studies, and Joseph Massad, an assistant professor.\\" Jonathan Calt Harris on May 4 compared Massad to a neo-Nazi and accused him of supporting terrorism against Israel, of believing in a world-wide Jewish conspiracy, and urged the university to deny him tenure. Two days later, Massad received a letter from Joel J. Levy, director of the New York chapter of the Anti-Defamation League, addressed to him, Bollinger and Brinkley. According to a student that had attended Massad's lecture on March 24, Levy wrote, the ideas expressed therein were \\"anti-Semitic.\\" Massad replied: According to Massad, he never heard back from the ADL.  Release of Columbia Unbecoming  Entrance to the Kraft Center building, where the student were interviewed. The Sun broke the news about Columbia Unbecoming on October 20, 2004, announcing that the film had been screened to Barnard College's president Judith Shapiro and Brinkley. Initially, two versions of the film existed; one 11-minute-long, and the other a bit over 20 minutes long. The film would subsequently be reedited and at least six different versions of the film was created. The film consisted of testimonies from 14The number of students varied depending on the version of the film. In the extended 37-minute version, nine students spoke to the camera including Sheer. students who felt they had been intimidated or unfairly treated by Massad, Saliba, and Habashi, over their pro-Israel views. The film also featured rabbi Sheer who had helped create it. Six of the fourteen students in the film spoke firsthand of incidents. The three that got the most attention were: * Tomy Schoenfeld, 27, who wasn't a student in Massad's class but said that he had attended an off-campus lecture of his in 2002.In some reports, the lecture is said to have taken place in the spring of 2001. At the end of the lecture, he posed a question to Massad, prefaced by saying that he was an Israeli, to which Massad replied: \\"Did you serve in the military?\\" Schoenfeld answered in the affirmative and Massad asked him: \\"How many Palestinians have you killed?\\" Schoenfeld replied: \\"What? How come it‚Äôs relevant to this discussion?\\" Massad repeated his question: \\"No, it‚Äôs relevant to the discussion, and I demand an answer. How many Palestinians have you killed?\\" Schoenfeld answered: \\"I‚Äôm not going to answer, but I‚Äôm going to ask you a question: How many members of your family celebrated on September 11, if we‚Äôre starting with stereotypes?\\" * Lindsay Shrier, 24, said that during a 45-minute-long conversation with Saliba on College Walk, he had told her that she couldn't possibly be a Semite because she had green eyes and therefore couldn't claim ancestral ties to Israel: \\"You have no claim to the land of Israel. You have no voice in this debate. You have green eyes. You're not a Semite. I have brown eyes. I am a Semite.\\" * Noah Liben, 22, said that during one exchange in Massad's class, he defended Israel and asked Massad if he understood his point. Massad \\"smirked and said that he didn't\\" and the class erupted in laughter. He also claimed that Massad, while making the argument that Zionism is a male-dominated movement, incorrectly told students that zion means \\"penis\\" in Hebrew. Zion means \\"designated area or sign post.\\"These altercations were present in the October 20 version of the film but was later cut out. Liben also described a girl in his class that had defended Israel's actions. \\"Before she could get her point across, he quickly demanded and shouted at her, 'I will not have anyone sit through this class and deny Israeli atrocities,\\" he said. The girl later identified herself as Deena Shanker. Beery also appeared in the film. He didn't air any specific grievances but said that Massad's \\"favorite description is the Palestinian as the new Jew and the Jew as the new Nazi\\" and that he called \\"the Zionists are the new Nazis.\\" In addition to the interviews, the film displayed quotes from articles written by the professors. The one that stirred the most controversy was lifted from an article called \\"For a Fistful of Dust: A Passage to Palestine\\" by Dabashi and published in Al-Ahram: \\"Half a century of systematic maiming and murdering of another people has left‚Ä¶its deep marks on the faces of the Israeli Jews, the way they talk, walk, the way they greet each other‚Ä¶. There is a vulgarity of character that is bone-deep and structural to the skeletal vertebrae of its culture.\\" According to Dabashi, the quote was taken out of context and the David Project had replaced the words \\"these people\\" with \\"Israeli Jews.\\" The David Project was criticized for only screening the film to select audiences. In particular, the professors that had to defend themselves against the allegations did not get to see it. It is unclear when the film was eventually released. In 2008, Robin Wilson and Richard Byrne wrote in The Chronicle of Higher Education that the film \\"never saw general release.\\"  Reactions to the film  On October 20, The same day the Sun wrote about the film, Massad received a threatening email from a faculty member which he immediately forwarded to Brinkley: \\"Go back to Arab land where Jew hating is condoned. You are a disgrace and a pathetic typical Arab liar.\\" The day after, United States Representative Anthony Weiner called on Columbia to fire Massad for what he characterized as \\"anti-Semitic rantings.\\" On October 22, the Sun followed suit. On October 27, after having watched the film, Bollinger issued a statement about \\"the disturbing and offensive nature of incidents described in the film\\" and emphasized the limits to the principle of academic freedom: \\"It does not, for example, extend to protecting behavior in the classroom that threatens or intimidates students who express their viewpoints.\\" Abraham Foxman, director of the ADL, and New York's mayor, Michael Bloomberg, contacted Bollinger and urged him to take the students' allegations seriously. A colleague of the accused professors at MEALAC, Dan Miron, said he heard stories similar to those presented in the film every week, adding that the atmosphere in his department had \\"anti-Jewish overtones\\". The conversation with Saliba ocurred at College Walk according to Shrier. Saliba defended himself against the accusation from Shrier after having obtained a transcript of the film on Novemer 3 in the Spectator. He wrote that he didn't remember the conversation with her but that it was inconceivable that he would have argued the way she claimed that he did. \\"The statements that she attributes to me in the transcript, marked between quotations, are blatantly false,\\" he wrote, \\"and I can say in good conscience, and categorically, that I would not have used such phrases.\\" He noted that she got high grades in his class and suggested that she might have misremembered \\"an argument I sometimes make ... that being born in a specific religion, or converting to one, is not the same as inheriting the color of one‚Äôs eyes from one's parents and thus does not produce evidence of land ownership of a specific real estate.\\" The same day, Massad declared the allegations \\"the latest salvo in a campaign of intimidation of Jewish and non-Jewish professors who criticize Israel,\\" adding that he had been the target of a three-year-long campaign whose strategy was to equate \\"criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism.\\" He wrote that he had never met Schoenfeld, and that Liben misremembered the incident he described in Columbia Unbecoming: Massad further claimed that he had a friendly rapport with Liben. In the evening, Columbia Unbecoming was screened for the first time to a packed audience of 375 students. After the film, Davis moderated a discussion to give students a chance to share their thoughts. One student who stood out was Eric Posner, 25, a major in the MEALAC department, who wore a sandwhich board reading: \\"I served in the Israeli Army. I love Massad.\\" He believed the film was about \\"a dozen students who are interested in creating a paranoia of anti- Semitism on campus.\\" On November 11, after delivering a lecture and fielding questions from the audience, Bollinger emphasized his commitment to academic freedom, but would not tolerate \\"stupid\\" behavior by faculty members. Meanwhile, in a statement to the Sun, Israeli Minister Nathan Sharansky, who had recently seen the film, told pro-Israel students at Columbia not to be ashamed because \\"you are representing the people and the state who are the champions of human rights.\\" He alleged that Jewish students preferred to distance themselves from Israel to protect their grades and future careers. On November 16, the Spectator ran an article by Jacobs and Goldwasser titled \\"In Defense of The David Project\\". They claimed that they had never heard of Massad before being invited by students to hear their concerns in October 2003 and that they were \\"troubled by certain professors who promote a biased education and deny dissenting views in class.\\" The Spectator also ran an article by Bari Weiss who wrote that the accused professors only presented one narrative and were shutting down students who questioned their views. On November 17, the Sun published a new accusation from Deena Shankar, the girl Liben had spoken about in the film. She claimed to have asked Massad during a lecture if it was true that Israel gives prior warning before launching strikes in Palestinian Arab territories. She said: \\"That provoked him to start screaming, 'If you're going to deny the atrocities being committed against the Palestinians then you could leave the class,'\\" adding that Massad also compared Israelis to Nazis in his class. She later told the New York Times that Massad \\"sometimes ridiculed her questions and during one class exchange yelled at her to get out\\" but that she stayed. On November 22, the Sun reported about an e-mail that Dabashi had received from a student who had served in the Israeli military, criticizing one of his columns in Al-Ahram. Dabashi forwarded the email to Columbia officials, Brinkley2, fearing a \\"potential attack by a militant slanderer\\" and asked for protection from campus security. Brinkley responded to him that there was \\"nothing threatening\\" about the email. In December, four Jewish students; Aharon Horwitz,Horwitz' last name was incorrectly spelled \\"Horowitz\\" in many media reports. Daniella Kahane, Bari Weiss, and Ariel Beery, formed the group Columbians for Academic Freedom (CAF). They would speak on behalf of the students claiming to have been intimidated by the professors. The members of CAF, with the exception of Weiss, had themselves featured in Columbia Unbecoming.  The ad hoc committee  On December 7, 2004, a group of approximately 50 students, faculty, and others, calling themselves the Ad Hoc Committee for the Defense of Academic Freedom at Columbia, held a press conference to protest what they considered silencing of Israel criticism. According to the Spectator, it was the first organized response to the film by its detractors. On December 8, Bollinger announced that an ad hoc committee had been appointed which would investigate any grievances the students had but it would not investigate \\"political or scholarly beliefs\\" nor review \\"review departments or curricula.\\" The five members of the committee were Lisa Anderson, Dean of the School of International and Public Affairs; Farah Jasmine Griffin, Professor of English and Comparative Literature; Jean Howard, William E. Ransford Professor of English and Vice Provost for Diversity Initiatives; Ira Katznelson, Ruggles Professor of Political Science and History; and Mark Mazower, Professor of History. In addition, Floyd Abrams, William J. Brennan Visiting Professor at the School of Journalism, would serve as an advisor. Every Monday and Friday the committee would make itself available to hear student grievances. CAF immediately complained that committee members were predisposed to the accused professors. Howard and Griffin had signed a resolution calling for divestment from Israel in October 2002 and Anderson was Massad's former PhD advisor. Weiss said that she felt scared and that she didn't trust the committee. Some students later announced that they would not participate in any meetings with the committee. Massad questioned the appointment of Abrams as advisor because of his pro-Israel politics and activism. Bollinger, however, defended the committee members: \\"Someone can take a position that I strongly disagree with and they can still be ... capable of looking into something like this objectively,\\" adding that it was important to \\"avoid a witch hunt on one hand and a whitewash on the other.\\" He also remarked that Katznelson had strongly opposed the boycott resolution. On December 20, Donna Lieberman of the New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU) defended the professors in a letter to Bollinger: \\"It is clear that this controversy would not have acquired the attention it received if it were simply about the rudeness of professors or their intolerance of other points of view.\\" She met with the students who had made the allegations and said that there was \\"clearly a political agenda\\" behind them and thought that it was wrong to accept them at face value. The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) got involved on January 10, 2004, via a letter to Bollinger that served as a reply of sorts to NYCLU's letter. FIRE argued that professors indeed could suffer threats of sanctions and recriminations for the content of their scholarship. FIRE further insinuated that some of the professors were perhaps guilty of indoctrination: \\"It is obvious that the line between education and indoctrination can sometimes be vague, but in many cases it is quite clear. There are some allegations in this case that, if proven true, would indicate that the line has clearly been crossed at Columbia.\\" In an interview published on January 19 with New York Magazine, Bollinger faulted Massad for teaching a one-sided view of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict which Massad in his statement to the ad hoc committee a few months later vehemently denied.  Columbia Unbecoming returns to campus  Columbia Unbecoming was screened a second time at Columbia campus on February 1, 2005 to a crowd of 350 students. The film had been edited since the first screening in November to conceal the identities of some students and to add extra material. After the screening, a debate, moderated by Columbia's Chaplain Jewelnel Davis, was held. During the debate, Weiss defended CAF's decision to put statements written by the professors in Al-Ahram and other publications in the film, \\"to expose the racism of these professors.\\" In an interview with the Sun ob February 7, Weiss complained that Massad in the course Topics in Asian Civilization spent a disproportionate amount of time talking about Zionism and Israel for a course about the entire Middle East. \\"In nearly all of his lectures, professor Massad found a way to denounce Israel and the West,\\" she said. A roommate of hers who took the same course by Massad later said that the course unit focused on Palestine lasted no more than two weeks. On February 11, The Forward ran an article featuring students and faculty saying that the controversy on Columbia was overblown. Biology professor Robert Pollack said that the university was not an anti-Semitic place and asked: \\"The question is, why am I not believed? Why do people pick the weak film over the strong reality of the place itself?\\" On February 18, Greg Lukianoff of FIRE wrote about the controversy in the Spectator. He asserted that none of the allegations described in the film constituted either harassment or intimidation, and cautioned against contributing to a situation in which such allegations were used as political weapons to silence the opposition. In his view, the solution was to \\"let the students and groups slug it out in the realm of classroom debate, campus activism, and public scrutiny.\\" On February 25, The Forward reported that Rashid Khalidi, a professor at MEALAC, not named in Columbia Unbecoming, had been barred by the New York City Department of Education from taking part in a 12-week program about the Middle East for public school teachers. It was speculated that the decision to ban him was a response to an article in the Sun that mentioned Khalidi's participation in the program and his previous comments about Israel being a racist state with an \\"apartheid system.\\" Wiener and the American Jewish Committee supported the decision, stating that Khalidi had a \\"record of brazen, openly biased and distorted statements about Israel.\\" Bollinger rebuked the barring as a violation of First Amendment principles. In March, a threatening email was sent to all Jewish students and faculty at MEALAC from an Israeli group calling themselves \\"United Trial Group - Peoples Rights International\\" informing them that: The right-wing Zionist Organization of America sponsored a day-long conference tited \\"The Middle East and Academic Integrity on the American Campus\\" on March 6 on Columbia. Members of CAF was present, as was Kramer, Weiner, Sharansky, and local New York politicians. There, Weiner asserted that \\"[t]here is a rise of anti-Semitism that is almost indisputable on college campuses.\\" New York City Council Speaker Gifford Miller, referencing the ad hoc committee's investigation, cautioned that we \\"will not accept a whitewash.\\" Phyllis Chesler, professor emerita at the College of Staten Island, in a speech enthusiastically received by the crowd, referred to the Palestine Solidarity Movement as \\"a group in my opinion that‚Äôs quite similar to the Ku Klux Klan, or to the Nazi party\\". One person in the audience objected to the hostile atmosphere of the conference and said that he had been shot by the Israeli army. \\"They should have shot you in the head,\\" one man shouted. \\"Much of what has been said today is not only unproductive, it is counterproductive,\\" Beery said, as he was booed. Beery said that he thought that many of the comments at the conference went too far.  The ad hoc committee's report  After having interviewed 62 students, faculty members, administrators and alumni, and read written submissions from more than 60 others, the ad hoc committee's 24-page-report was released to the press on March 31, 2005. The report found \\"no evidence of any statements made by the faculty that could reasonably be construed as anti-Semitic\\" and \\"no basis for believing that Professor Massad systematically suppressed dissenting views in his classroom.\\" Instead, it found that Massad had been the target of harassment from pro-Israel students and that outside organizations had attempted to spy on professors. Regarding the three alleged instances of intimidation from the school year 2001 to 2002, it found Shanker's and Schoenfeld's allegations against Massad \\"credible\\" and Saliba's version a \\"good deal more likely\\" than Shrier's allegation. The report also criticized Columbia's inadequate grievance procedures. = Incident with Shanker = Shanker described the alleged incident with Massad in his spring 2002 class on Palestinian and Israeli Politics and Societies as follows: The report deemed Shanker's recount \\"credible\\": The report noted that \\"the main elements of Ms. Shanker's account\\" were corroborated by two witnesses, but rejected by three participants in the class who did not recall the incident Shanker described. It further noted that the incident wasn't recorded in the teaching evaluations the committee had investigated. = Incident with Schoenfeld = Schoenfeld said that he had attended an off-campus lecture with Massad, either in the late fall 2001 or early spring 2002. He described the following interaction with him: While the committee noted that Massad \\"emphatically claims never to have met Mr. Schoenfeld,\\" it deemed Schoenfeld's recount \\"credible\\": = Incident with Shrier = The report described Shrier's recount of the alleged incident with Saliba as follows: The report argued that because the only participants in the exchange was Shrier and Saliba, and because Saliba acknowledges that the exchange took place, his version of it was \\"a good deal more likely\\": = Outside bodies and harassment of professors = Outside events, such as the September 11 attacks and the Second intifada had led to heightened tensions on campus. Massad's spring 2002 class was particularly tense, with one faculty member attempting to spy on it: While many students thought Massad was an excellent teacher, some objected to his \\"highly charged vocabulary\\": Massad allowed anyone who wanted to comment and raise questions during his lectures. This led to a small group of students being able to disrupt them: Outside the classroom, Massad was dedicated and respectful to his students: Over the two years following 2002, outside organizations became involved in the surveillance of professors in MEALAC. According to \\"credible evidence\\" someone began filming without permission during one of Saliba's spring 2004 lectures but left after being challenged. Such incidents had a negative effect on classroom debate: The report also noted the appearance of \\"auditors\\" in Massad's spring 2004 class. = Columbia's grievance procedures = The report criticized Columbia's unclear grievance procedures. Students didn't know how to file complaints about faculty and similarly, there was no place for faculty to lodge complaints about students. Another problem was that the policies on who were allowed to attend classes were unclear which allowed unregistered and disruptive auditors to interfere.  Responses to the report  = Massad's response = Massad criticized the report. In an article in the Electronic Intifada, he argued that \\"[t]he Ad Hoc Grievance Committee Report suffers from major logical flaws, undefended conclusions, inconsistencies, and clear bias in favor of the witch-hunt that has targeted me for over three years.\\" He found it objectionable that it had deemed Shanker's story \\"credible\\" when his testimony about it never having occurred was corroborated by three students, two graduate Teaching Assistants and one registered undergraduate student. That more weight was assigned to her accusation and her witnesses than to his denial and his witnesses. He furthermore denied ever having asked any student to leave his class and wrote that Shanker lied. Regarding Schoenfeld's allegation, Massad argued that the fact that neither he nor his witness could tell when or where the incident took place should have cast doubt on his allegation. Massad denied ever having met or seen Schoenfeld. = CAF responses = Horwitz repudiated the report: \\"The report is insulting, a disgrace to those of us who put our hearts and souls into making Columbia a better place.\\" Beery said the report was \\"the second strike against Columbia when it comes to students' rights.\\" He called the committee's finding that statements made were not antisemitic \\"deeply insulting\\", not because he believed it to be false but because student complaints were about intimidation, rather than racism, according to him. Weiss questioned the thoroughness of the report and said that it was compiled by a \\"committee of insiders.\\" She still asserted that the report showed that \\"professors abused their students and disregarded their rights.\\" She stood by her claim that \\"[t]hese students were intimidated because of their ideological positions, a fact that was willfully neglected in the report.\\" = Other responses = Pro-Israel advocate Alan Dershowitz, who long had criticized the MEALAC department, said that Bollinger had appointed the wrong people to the committee and that it therefore lacked credibility. An editorial in the New York Times chided the committee for not having examined \\"the quality and fairness of teaching\\" of the professors: Juan Cole slammed the editorial as \\"among the more dangerous documents threatening higher education in America to have appeared in a major newspaper since the McCarthy period.\\" He argued that the Times reference to \\"scholarly rigor\\" was just a thinly veiled call for academic censorship. NYCLU in an open letter to Bollinger dated April 6 called the report inadequate. Regarding Shankers account, NYCLU wrote: \\"Given this conflicting testimony and the absence of contemporaneous corrobation of Ms. Shanker‚Äôs account, it is unclear how or why the Committee chose to believe Ms. Shanker and disbelieve Professor Massad.\\" It questioned why the committee hadn't sought out any of the dozens of other students in the class who could have served as witnesses. NYCLU also expressed its dismay over the report's unwillingness to connect the ideological agenda of the David Project and Campus Watch with what transgressed at Columbia. The New York Daily News on April 10 called for Columbia to fire Massad. A \\"bully, propagandist and perpetrator of deeply offensive teachings about Jews,\\" it wrote. In May, twenty former students in Massad's spring 2002 class wrote to the university, claiming that the incident with Shanker never happened. Fifty faculty members of Columbia wrote an open letter to the university asserting that \\"neither faculty nor students have a right to be shielded from disagreeable or unfamiliar ideas, the production of which is integral to the mission of the university.\\" Eric Posner, an undergraduate from Israel, said that \\"[t]hese individuals are conjuring up notions of anti-Semitism to serve their narrow- minded and extremist political agenda. ... I can‚Äôt understand for the life of me why Columbia hasn‚Äôt been tougher about dismissing this as a load of garbage.\\" Posner had been working hard to counter the narrative of the film ever since it first was screened to students in November.  Aftermath  Following the spring semester, the three accused professors all took a leave of absence. Weiss called the professors leave a \\"brilliant political move\\" and she vowed that CAF's work would continue. In addition to the updated grievance procedures, another development at Columbia, phrased in the Spectator as \\"not unrelated to the controversy\\" was the creation of an Israeli Studies Chair in the MEALAC Department. Massad was awarded tenure at Columbia in 2009. The tenuring was denounced by the on-campus pro-Israel group LionPAC. In 2011, Kenneth L. Marcus, founder of the pro-Israeli Brandeis Center, filed a complaint with the office of Office of Civil Rights against Barnard College alleging that a Jewish student had been \\"steered\\" away from taking a class with Massad. The student in question wasn't eligible for Massad's class and the complaint was dismissed for lack of evidence. In 2019, the pro-Israel Lawfare Project filed a complaint on a student's behalf against Columbia alleging a \\"culture of discrimination\\" against Jewish students. The student alleged that, among other things, Massad had voiced support for the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades. The Columbia student magazine The Blue and White reported in September 2005 that Weiss and Beery was dating. She got an internship and became a journalist at Wall Street Journal following her graduation. Beery and Horwitz became business partners and founded PresenTense Group.  Views on the controversy  Several writers have opined on the Columbia Unbecoming controversy, what it was about, and the motives of the actors involved. = Fighting anti-Semitism = Weiss, who was one of the key players in the controversy, has described it as a fight against left-wing anti-Semitism. In an article in 2015 in Mosaic Magazine, titled \\"How to Fight Anti-Semitism on Campus\\". She lamented the fact that Massad had won tenure \\"despite the sustained and strong opposition of student whistleblowers, concerned alumni, and others\\". She charged that he had turned an \\"untold numbers of na√Øve students into unwitting tools of anti-Semitism.\\" That a bigot like Dabashi enjoys tenure, she wrote, \\"at a university whose biggest donors include well- known and proud supporters of Israel is a wonder and a scandal.\\" In her 2019 book, How to Fight Anti-Semitism, Weiss described the contentious atmosphere during this period as giving her \\"a front row seat to leftist anti-Semitism\\" at the university. The activism described by Weiss was alleged by Glenn Greenwald to be \\"designed to ruin the careers of Arab professors by equating their criticisms of Israel with racism, anti-Semitism, and bullying, and its central demand was that those professors (some of whom lacked tenure) be disciplined for their transgressions.\\" Weiss has called Greenwald's characterizations \\"baseless\\", saying that she \\"advocated for the rights of students to express their viewpoints in the classroom\\", adding, \\"I don't know when criticizing professors became out of bounds.\\" Marcus described the controversy as bringing to light a pattern of anti-Semitic activity at MEALAC. = An assault on academic freedom = Several authors characterized the controversy as a smear campaign. Henry A. Giroux saw it as a battle in \\"a highly organized campaign of intimidation and an all-out assault on academic freedom, critical scholarship, and the very idea of the university as a place to question and think.\\" Columbia's former provost, Jonathan R. Cole, worried about a growing effort \\"to pressure universities to monitor classroom discussion, create speech codes, and more generally, enable disgruntled students to savage professors who express ideas they find disagreeable.\\" He contended that the goal of this effort was to treat speech that some find offensive as punishable actions. According to him, the political pressure to silence Edward Said, Khalidi, Massad, and other Middle East studies professors who expressed views critical of Israel, was not unlike the political pressure to include Creationism as an alternative to Darwinism in school curricula. Ali Abunimah, co-founder of the pro-Palestinian Electronic Intifada, called the controversy a witch hunt against Massad and an attempt by the Israel lobby to silence criticism of Israel. Steven Salaita, who himself would become the target of an Israel-related controversy in 2016, saw it as an example of American anti-Arab racism. = A culture clash = Some authors have characterized the visceral reaction of the students to the perceived anti- Israel bias as a culture clash. Rashid Khalidi described it as a consequence of people meeting people with very different ideas. Massad likewise argued that students mistook established scholarship for pro-Palestinian propaganda: Stanford University historian Joel Beinin compared the situation to white students learning about Jim Crow laws: See also * Academic freedom * Columbia University * George Saliba * Joseph Massad * The David Project * Tenure  External links  * Columbia Unbecoming, Date unknown, The David Project. * Professor Massad's \\"Penis\\" Lecture at Columbia University, Date unknown, The David Project. * Bari Weiss, speaking against campus free speech * Academic Freedom and the Teaching of Palestine-Israel: The Columbia University Case, Part II * Ad Hoc Grievance Committee Report * Columbia University in ‚ÄúHate Spaces‚Äù, October 2004, FOX News.

Biography  Debono was born on 7 November 1821 in Senglea, Malta. He was the son of Michael Debono, a captain of the merchant navy, and his wife Teresa n√©e Carabott. He had a twin sister named Battistina. During his youth, Debono studied medicine and chemistry. The Debono family later emigrated to Alexandria in Egypt, and Andrea Debono worked in a hospital. Andrea and Battistina moved to Cairo after their parents died, and later to Khartoum in the Sudan in 1848, where Andrea built a corn mill and was involved in the production of building materials. Debono married Victoria, an Abyssinian, and they had three children but two of them died in infancy. In 1851, Debono began to serve the Egyptian Governor of Sudan and adopted the name of Latif Effendi. He made significant profits from the ivory trade, and he employed around 400 men as porters or boatmen. At this point he also began exploring the Nile, and he was the first European to explore the Sobat River tributary of the White Nile, reaching the cataracts beyond Gondokoro. He reached the Djiamoudj rapids in April 1853, acquiring knowledge of Lake Albert and the Semliki River. He made a journey to the mouth of the Sobat in 1854‚Äì1855 together with his wife, his son and later his agent Philippe Terranuova. At one point, their boats were grounded for six months due to the dry season and they were threatened by hostile natives. Between 1855 and 1856, Debono was the British Consular Agent in Khartoum. In 1859 he explored Gondokoro once again, publishing a book about his travels three years later. In Khartoum, Consul John Petherick accused Debono and his nephew of involvement in slave trading, and although all charges were later dropped, Debono's reputation was ruined. His health declined after he lost his nephew, and he subsequently sold his property and moved back to Cairo. Debono died there on 29 October 1871 at the age of 49.  Legacy  Andrea Debono was mentioned in the 1863 novel Five Weeks in a Balloon by Jules Verne. A street in his hometown Senglea is named after him.

The game is set in the 1930s, and players assume control of Norah (Cissy Jones), who must explore an island set in the Southern Pacific to find her husband who has gone missing after embarking on an expedition. The game does not feature a combat system, and players progress in the game by solving various puzzles. Development Call of the Sea is the debut title for Out of the Blue, an independent studio based in Madrid, Spain. The team consisted of about 12 people. According to Tatiana Delgado, the founder of Out of the Blue, the game was heavily inspired by the works of H.P. Lovecraft. However, she added that they only took inspirations from the \\"surreal\\" and \\"oneiric\\" part of his work, and asserted that the game would not be a horror game. She added that \\"Call of the Sea isn't a descent into madness but a rise to sanity\\". The game was a narrative-focused game, with the team working to ensure that the puzzles featured in the game are fully integrated with the story. The game also drew influence from other adventure games such as Firewatch, Myst, Soma, and Subnautica. The game was announced on May 7, 2020 during a digital event hosted by Xbox Game Studios.

Founded by the famous magician Jean-Eug√®ne Robert-Houdin in 1845 at No. 164 Galerie Valois as part of the Palais-Royal, it moved in 1852 to a permanent home at No. 8, Boulevard des Italiens. The theatre's later directors, before its demolition in 1924, included Robert-Houdin's proteg√© Hamilton and the illusionist and film innovator Georges M√©li√®s. When he first founded the theatre, Robert-Houdin was known primarily for his guest appearances as a magician and his clever mechanical inventions. Eager to solidify his work as a stage performer, he leased assembly rooms in the Palais-Royal and had them converted into a small but elegant proscenium theatre auditorium. In setting his stage, Robert-Houdin deliberately set himself apart from conventional stage-magic traditions; he eschewed the usual emphasis on dazzling visual confusion, replacing it with a simple drawing-room look with light furniture in the Style Louis XV. After a rocky start, his theatre gained critical respect, and boomed in popularity with the introduction of Robert-Houdin's mind-reading illusion \\"Second Sight.\\" In early 1852, Robert-Houdin transferred the theatre's directorship to his former pupil Hamilton (born Pierre Etienne Chocat), who continued its success. At the end of that year, when the lease on the Palais-Royal location ran out, Hamilton moved his operation to a boulevard theatre venue on the Boulevard des Italiens. In its new permanent location, the theatre continued to run for the next few decades, under directors including Cleverman (born Fran√ßois Lahire), Pierre Edouard Brunnet, and √âmile Voisin. A drastic refreshing of the theatre's repertoire in the mid-1870s gave it a major financial boost, with the added box-office takings allowing it to start hosting guest artists. However, the boom did not last long, and the theatre was physically run-down and in a serious financial slump by the mid-1880s. In 1888, Georges M√©li√®s took over the lease on the venue. He retained its existing staff but began a thorough revamping, aiming to restore both the theatre's architecture and its repertoire to their former quality. His first major innovation was to conclude each evening's entertainment with a spectacularly staged, lavishly advertised illusion, telling a miniature story complete with original scenery and costumed characters. M√©li√®s's restorations and innovations were a marked success. In 1896, when moving pictures were an emerging novelty, he added film projection to the theatre's repertoire, and even began making his own films to show there and sell elsewhere. Over the next fifteen years, filmmaking became a major part of his career, on top of and overlapping with his work at the theatre. A 1901 fire destroyed most of the venue, but the theatre was rebuilt the same year and continued to present performances with success. At the onset of the First World War, the theatre was closed; M√©li√®s, now severely in debt from a series of filmmaking-related troubles, was unable to keep it going, and sublet it as a full-time cinema. He shut down the venue in 1923, when he sold all his property in an attempt to pay his debts. Paris city planners demolished the theatre the following year to allow for an extension of the Boulevard Haussmann. The Palais-Royal years, 1845‚Äì1852 Portrait of Robert‚ÄêHoudin In the early 1840s, the innovative magician Jean-Eug√®ne Robert-Houdin was well-regarded, particularly for the mechanical curiosities he exhibited to audiences and sold to rich patrons. He performed with a trick automaton at the French Industrial Exposition of 1844, drawing guests including King Louis Philippe I, and winning a silver medal from the exposition judges. He was keen to expand his magical performances by opening his own venue, and a nobleman who had hired him for private parties, the Count de L'Escalopier, invested fifteen thousand francs into the project. In 1845, the theatre was launched inside the Palais- Royal. This building, once home to Cardinal Richelieu, had been converted into a lavish shopping arcade, with shops and caf√©s on the ground floor and assembly rooms above them. Robert-Houdin and de L'Escalopier leased assembly rooms at No. 164 Galerie Valois, and had carpenters knock down interior walls to create an auditorium, with a seating capacity of about two hundred. The decorations were in the Style Louis XV, with white walls and gold trim, and Robert-Houdin's proscenium stage was set up as an elegant drawing-room, complete with candelabras and drapery. Robert-Houdin's sketch of his stage Robert-Houdin set himself apart from previous magic acts in his stage setting; while some other magicians had tried to dazzle with elaborate, purely ornamental props and lighting effects, and abundant use of tables covered with cloth to the floor, Robert-Houdin hoped to impress by sticking to the relatively simple Style Louis XV and limiting the furniture to the minimum needed for his act. Folding doors on both sides of the stage allowed Robert- Houdin to bring his elaborate mechanical devices on and offstage; the door at the right led to a room looking out over the Palais-Royal's garden. He used this room as a green room when preparing in the evening, and as a workshop during the day. Robert-Houdin initially advertised the venue as the \\"Th√©√¢tre des Soir√©es Fantastiques de Robert-Houdin\\", but this name was soon abridged to \\"Th√©√¢tre Robert-Houdin\\". Ticket prices were set relatively high to make up for the auditorium's small capacity, with prices between two and five francs depending on the position of the seat. Robert-Houdin performing with an automaton on his stage The theatre opened on 3 July 1845, competing directly with the gala opening of a major Paris amphitheatre, the Hippodrome de l'√âtoile. No critics covered Robert-Houdin's first performance, and his memoirs describe it as an artistic failure wrecked by stage fright. However, Robert-Houdin persevered, and slowly began to regain his cool and win critical attention for the theatre. His performances were varied, including mechanically assisted acts like \\"The Fantastic Orange Tree\\" and trick automatons like \\"The Pastrycook of the Palais-Royal\\". Reviews in Le Charivari and L'Illustration were favourable, comparing the theatre's offerings to those of famous magicians like Bartolomeo Bosco and Philippe Talon. On 12 February 1846, Robert-Houdin added a fresh act to the repertoire: \\"Second Sight\\", adapted and expanded from earlier magicians' routines. In this act, Robert- Houdin's son √âmile, though blindfolded, contrived to answer questions about objects volunteered by audience members. \\"Second Sight\\" rocketed Robert-Houdin and his theatre to immense success and packed houses. Once the theatre had won good business, Robert-Houdin closed it for the summer of 1846 to go on tour, bringing in new tricks for the fall season, including a levitation act, \\"Ethereal Suspension\\". Over the next few years, Robert-Houdin continued the pattern of performing at his own theatre in between extended bouts of touring and tinkering. In 1851, Robert-Houdin announced publicly that he was entrusting to the theatre to a successor and former pupil, Pierre Etienne Chocat, who performed under the name Hamilton. The transferral, effected in January 1852, went smoothly, with the Theatre Robert-Houdin still doing good business under its new management. The move to the Boulevard, 1852‚Äì1888 The Boulevard des Italiens in the 1860s The lease on the Palais-Royal rooms ran out in December 1852. Rather than renewing it, Hamilton moved his operation to a building at No. 8, Boulevard des Italiens. To inaugurate the new theatre in January 1853, Jean-Eug√®ne Robert-Houdin gave the first performance, along with good wishes to his successor Hamilton. The new location turned the Th√©√¢tre Robert-Houdin into a boulevard theatre, one of the entertainment venues that flourished in Paris during and after the city's 1853‚Äì1870 urban renewal. The rebuilding of Paris during this period, led by Georges-Eug√®ne Haussmann, created a \\"boulevard culture\\" that lasted throughout the second half of the nineteenth century. Boulevard theatres were smaller than established venues like the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise, and produced more varied and experimental shows. The Boulevard des Italiens was a locus of entertainment technology during this period; numerous photographic studios operated near the Th√©√¢tre Robert-Houdin, and from 1899 onward the Path√© brothers ran a phonograph salon on the boulevard. After a performing career of eleven years, Jean-Eug√®ne Robert-Houdin moved on to writing and retirement; he died in June 1871. The Th√©atre Robert-Houdin continued, with Hamilton being replaced first by Fran√ßois Lahire, who performed as Cleverman, and then by Pierre Edouard Brunnet, whose innovations included the locked-trunk escape artist act \\"Malle des Indes\\". In the mid-1870s, the theatre's repertoire received a thorough refreshing and revamping, to considerable popular success; box-office takings were reported to have jumped up 42% between 1876 and 1878. The additional funds allowed the theatre to begin hosting a wide variety of guest artists, including mimics, marionette puppeteers, and mental calculator acts. Jehanne d'Alcy playing a disembodied head in the 1892 illusion \\"La Source enchant√©e\\" After the popularity boom of the mid-1870s, the Robert- Houdin became immersed in grave financial difficulties. By 1878, complaints were being raised that the theatre was not adequately advertising its guest artists, a problem that appears to have diminished its reputation among Parisian theatres. By the mid-1880s the theatre had fallen into a state of disrepair, and its acts were seen as falling off in quality. The theatre eventually landed under the directorship of √âmile Voisin, otherwise a manufacturer of props for magic acts. In 1887, Voisin hired St√©phanie Fa√´s, an actor who performed under the name Jehanne d'Alcy. In part because she was small and agile, d'Alcy proved a valuable performer for magic illusions, and appeared in them regularly. The M√©li√®s refurbishment, 1888‚Äì1896 Georges M√©li√®s in 1895 In July 1888, the theatre came under the directorship of Georges M√©li√®s. M√©li√®s was a rising young magician who had performed at salons, at the Galerie Vivienne, and at the Mus√©e Gr√©vin; his father was a shoe manufacturer who had retired earlier in 1888, splitting up his fortune between his three sons. While his brothers Henri and Gaston took over the shoe business, Georges M√©li√®s used his share of the money to rent the Th√©√¢tre Robert-Houdin from the site's owner, the Count de Rohan-Chabot. M√©li√®s also bought up the theatre's properties from the widow of √âmile Robert-Houdin, the magician's son, and retained the whole staff, including performers like d'Alcy, from Voisin's directorship. M√©li√®s, who had been a frequent and enthusiastic audience member at the Robert-Houdin, was keen to refurbish the aging venue and bring its acts back to the standard of quality set by Robert- Houdin himself. He designed new scenery, had the walls repainted and the draperies replaced, and worked with another magician, Duperrey, to plan a performance repertoire with original material. Though M√©li√®s continued the theatre's tradition of straightforward magic acts and trick automaton exhibits, his plan also included a major innovation: every evening's entertainment would conclude with one of his \\"grand tricks\\" (\\"grands trucs\\"), large-scale illusions that were staged lavishly and advertised to match, with detailed press announcements and separate posters. In December 1888, M√©li√®s reopened the theatre, complete with his first grand trick, \\"The Persian Stroubaika\\" (\\"La Strouba√Øka persane\\"). Under M√©li√®s's directorship, the struggling theatre returned to public prominence, and its box office flourished. In 1889 he premiered three new illusions: \\"The Mysterious Page\\" (\\"Le Page myst√©rieux\\", with d'Alcy in the title role; \\"The Flower Fairy, or Cagliostro's Mirror\\" (\\"La F√©e des fleurs ou le Miroir de Cagliostro\\"); and \\"The Enchanter Alcofrisbas\\" (\\"L'Enchanteur Alcofrisbas\\"). In all, M√©li√®s would create some thirty illusions for the theatre between 1888 and 1910. Although he played roles in the illusions he created, M√©li√®s rarely appeared \\"as himself\\" in a straightforward conjuring role, unless one of the featured magicians became suddenly unavailable and M√©li√®s needed to fill in. Illusions were accompanied by piano improvisation; he mentions nine Robert-Houdin pianists in his written recollections, including the composer Caroline Chelu. Stage and film combinations, 1896‚Äì1901 The Boulevard des Italiens in the late nineteenth century; the Th√©√¢tre Robert-Houdin is in the mid-foreground at right In April 1896, films were projected at the theatre for the first time, using a Theatrograph projector that M√©li√®s had obtained from the film pioneer Robert W. Paul. M√©li√®s would convert the projector into a makeshift camera and begin making his own films in May of that same year. Previously, performances at the theatre had often concluded with a magic lantern show, with hand- coloured slides of photographic views; with the coming of the film projector, M√©li√®s replaced these still images with moving film. M√©li√®s noted later that his first choice would have been to film inside the Robert-Houdin, but he was foiled by his camera's need for much stronger light sources, preferably natural light. According to one recollection, M√©li√®s did attempt on one occasion to film inside the theatre, setting up fifteen arc lamps and fifteen mercury-vapor lamps to make the 1897 series Comedian Paulus Singing, the first known use of artificial light in film. However, the experiment with artificial light was not repeated. In early 1897, M√©li√®s constructed a purpose-built glass studio on his family's property in Montreuil-sous-Bois, exactly reproducing the dimensions of the Robert-Houdin. With the building of the studio, he became more and more occupied with filmmaking, drastically reducing his output of new stage illusions; he premiered only four new illusions at the theatre between 1897 and 1910. Although M√©li√®s's stage output was reduced, his films were regularly projected as part of the entertainment at the Robert- Houdin. From September through December 1902, a hand-colored print of A Trip to the Moon was screened at the theatre after Saturday and Thursday matinee performances. It was presented there by M√©li√®s's colleague and fellow magician, Jules-Eug√®ne Legris, who also appeared in the film's final scenes as the leader of a parade. M√©li√®s's film version of The Vanishing Lady In addition, M√©li√®s's films were often conceived as filmed equivalents of the illusions staged at the Robert-Houdin. One of his first important films, The Vanishing Lady, has as its full French title Escomotage d'une dame chez Robert-Houdin (\\"Disappearance of a Lady at the Robert-Houdin\\"); film historian Andr√© Gaudreault argues that the same ending could be added to M√©li√®s's other titles, turning, for example, Le Bourreau turc into Le Bourreau turc chez Robert-Houdin (\\"The Turkish Executioner at the Robert-Houdin\\") or L'Omnibus des toqu√©s into L'Omnibus des toqu√©s chez Robert-Houdin (\\"The Omnibus of Loonies at the Robert-Houdin\\"). M√©li√®s himself declared: \\"My cinematographic career was connected so closely to the career of the Th√©√¢tre Robert-Houdin, that one can hardly separate them.\\" M√©li√®s's second film, Conjuring (1896), is derived from one of his magic acts at the Robert-Houdin, as is The Miracles of the Brahmin (1900) and Coppelia, the Animated Doll (also 1900). Tom Old Boot (1896) captures a performance by a small entertainer of the same name, who was playing at the Robert-Houdin at the time as a \\"nain americain\\" (\\"American dwarf\\"). The Living Playing Cards (1905) was inspired by an act performed at the Robert-Houdin by Gaston Velle, who would himself later become a director of M√©li√®s-like trick films for Path√© Fr√®res. Under M√©li√®s, the theatre's offerings included an annual revue, Passez Muscade. The 1899 edition mixed stage performances with filmed attractions, and included two topical parodies of the rival magician Buatier de Kolta, caricaturing him as a pompous magician with the similar-sounding name \\"Moiti√© de Polka\\", and spoofing his illusion \\"Le Miracle\\". (A 1908 M√©li√®s film, also titled Moiti√© de polka, may have adapted this parody, but the film is currently presumed lost.) M√©li√®s kept the Th√©√¢tre running continuously for most of the year, with an annual brief closing for summer vacation (for example, 14 July to 31 July in 1896, during which M√©li√®s took his family to the coast of Normandy and made numerous actuality films). Rebuilding after fire, 1901‚Äì1908 The Th√©√¢tre Robert- Houdin was partly destroyed by a fire on 30 January 1901. The Count de Rohan- Chabot applied for municipal approval to have it rebuilt, and authorization was granted in May‚ÄìJune 1901, though the authorities noted that the building would be affected should plans for extending the Boulevard Haussmann go through. The rebuilt theatre opened on 22 September. Charles Claudel, an artist who had painted scenery for many of M√©li√®s's films, contributed three large paintings of a sorcerer, a conjurer, and a Louis XV-era magician, as well as a ceiling mural depicting some of Robert-Houdin's famous automatons. The rebuilt interior maintained the original white-and-gold colour scheme, with drapery and upholstery in pale green. M√©li√®s was present for the grand re-opening, but later recalled that he was on crutches, from an accident he sustained while filming Blue Beard. On 6 December 1905, the theatre hosted the French Society of Magicians celebrating Robert-Houdin's hundreth birthday. Several prominent Paris magicians presented illusions, and M√©li√®s performed with one of Robert-Houdin's original automatons, \\"Antonio Diavolo\\". A 1903 guidebook reported: Harry Houdini, in his 1908 book The Unmasking of Robert- Houdin, acknowledged that the Th√©√¢tre Robert-Houdin was a \\"historic temple of magic\\". He reported that some Parisians assumed that Jean-Eug√®ne Robert-Houdin himself \\"was still alive and giving performances at the theatre which bears his name.\\" Final years, 1914‚Äì1924 Plaque commemorating the theatre's first site At the beginning of the First World War in August 1914, M√©li√®s closed and sublet the theatre. It reopened nine months later as a full-time cinema house, the Cin√©-Salon Robert-Houdin, no longer under M√©li√®s's directorship. In the ensuing years, M√©li√®s's debts grew worse, including those to Path√© regarding funds for making his last films. He sold his land, including his film studios, and shut down the Th√©atre Robert-Houdin completely in 1923. M√©li√®s destroyed his entire collection of his films, more than 500 in all, the same year. In 1924, Numbers 2 through 18 on the Boulevard des Italiens, including the Th√©√¢tre Robert-Houdin at No. 8 and the Passage de l'Op√©ra at No. 10, were demolished to make room for an extension of the Boulevard Haussmann.

She had a pressed and moulded, galvanised iron hull, and her masts, spars and sails were like those of a full-sized clipper, but sized in proportion to the hull. The voyage was tough. The crew endured heavy weather, a leaking hull, and spoiled stores; the dog died at sea. The ship and crew received the welcome due to them at Margate, but some of the British public found it difficult to credit the success of the attempt, although the voyage was ultimately proved genuine. The ship was exhibited in 1866 at The Crystal Palace, London, and in 1867 at the Exposition Universelle, Paris, where Hudson was granted an interview with Emperor Louis Napoleon. The original purpose of the voyage was to provide publicity for Oliver Roland Ingersoll's invention, Ingersoll's Improved Metallic Lifeboat. The exhibition of the ship in London and Paris was intended to consolidate that publicity and to attract orders from shipowners. However the temporary British controversy about the validity of the crossing attempt, and Hudson's consequent difficulties and debts, contributed to the rather quiet way in which this story ended. Ship =Description= The name of the ship, Red, White and Blue, was chosen as a cosmopolitan and diplomatic reference to the flags of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and others. After reaching the United Kingdom, the vessel was given the Scots nickname of Wee Craft or Wee Ship. The hull of Red, White and Blue was constructed of galvanised iron, \\"pressed and moulded to a clinker built configuration\\" by the inventor Oliver Roland Ingersoll. This Ingersoll's Improved Metallic Lifeboat was a new design for onboard lifeboats and jolly boats, the intended advantage being lightness and ease of maintenance. She was LOA of 2.38 tons, beam with a hold depth of , or from deck to keel (not that she had a deck), and was pointed at bow and stern. She was fitted out with a ship-rig at New York. The tiny rigging was in proportion to the hull, that is to say, a fraction of the size of a normal cargo ship. The sails were made to the design of D.M. Cumisky of 39 South Street, New York, and the spars were made by Arthur Bartlett of 252 South Street. This was an open boat, with no shelter apart from a canvas dodger. She had watertight compartments. That is to say, she had a watertight compartment at each end, and she contained air cylinders at the ends and at the sides, \\"with safety valves that will cause the boat to free herself of water in a few minutes.\\" In 1866 she carried \\"12 ten-gallon kegs of water, 200 lbs of bread, 5 lbs coffee, 2 lbs of tea, 10 lbs butter, 4 boxes smoked herrings, 1 dozen cans of milk, 15 lbs smoked beef, 17 lbs cheese, 4 bottles pickles, mustard, pepper, salt and sauce, 2 bottles of brandy, one bottle of whisky and one bottle of bitters.\\" Other stores carried for the 1866 voyage were: \\"2 dozen cans roast beef, 2 dozen cans roast turkey, 2 dozen cans roast chicken, 2 dozen cans mutton soup.\\" These were donated by Isaac Reckhow of Brooklyn, who also donated the dog. For the master's department she carried, \\"a boat compass, quadrant, charts, parallel rule, dividers, weather indicator, longline, glass, 7 lbs lead, American ensign and pennant, English and French ensigns, anchor and fifty fathoms of rope, but no chronometer.\\" In case of illness she carried \\"six bottles of Indian liniment, six bottles of vegetable pills, a bottle of powders, and another mixture of some marvellous character, which we are told is the never-failing smallpox cure, and has cured yellow fever and cholera,\\" and luckily the crew did not need that. The inscription, \\"Ingersoll's Improved Metallic Life Boat\\" was written along both sides of the hull. The ship's ensign was a \\"13 star flag, single ply wool bunting with hand appliqued stars.\\" The front inscription identified it as having belonged to Red, White and Blue in 1866, but the reverse inscription said that it had previously been the Civil War flag of the \\"U.S.S.S. Flambeau's Picket boat 2nd Cutter 1864, Acting Ensign J.M. Hudson.\\" The flag as used on the mizzen gaff of Red, White and Blue measured 31 in by 42 in, having had 18 in cut off its length to fit the smaller ship. =History= Red, White and Blue at The Crystal Palace, 1866 The ship was launched on 21 June 1866, after having a false keel fitted, making a total keel depth of . \\"She was launched with all her spars standing, bows on, from a dock five feet above the level of the water,\\" with Captain J.M. Hudson aboard. Surprisingly she landed neatly, she did not tip over, and Hudson did not get wet. In 1866, Red, White and Blue was believed to be the \\"smallest ship ever to cross the Atlantic.\\" After leaving Margate, the crew took the ship to The Crystal Palace where from 25 August she was exhibited during the rest of 1866. At The Crystal Palace, Hudson and Fitch attended daily to make the ship's log available, and to answer questions. The ship was exhibited at the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1867, from July of that year, however there were difficulties. \\"Fair promises were made. Steamers were to tow the boat up the Seine in triumph; but it was towed against a bridge and smashed its masts. Agents were to secure goodly numbers to visit her; but for three months scarcely any one paid for a ticket, until at length the vessel was admitted into the grounds of the Exhibition. Finally, the ruined Captain ran away to England, but cleverly contrived to carry his ship with him.\\" The ship was returned to the United States in 1873. Hudson's 249-page handwritten log of the transatlantic adventure was titled, The Log and Voyage of the Wee Ship Red-White-and Blue!! The Smallest Ship that Ever Crossed the Atlantic! The First Full Account of Her Passage And Subsequent History in Europa Also Up to Her Arrival Back in New York. Items relating to the ship and crew were sold at auction in 2011 and 2019. =Engraved presentations= The ship had an oval, engraved plaque, with the words, \\"Ingersoll Metallic Life Boat Red White and Blue. Ship rigged Sailed from New York, United States, July 9th 1866. Arrived off Hastings, England August 16th 1866. Navigators, Capt. John M. Hudson, and Mate Frank E. Fitch. Inventor and Builder Oliver Roland Ingersoll. Property of the American Boat & Oar Bazaar. 243 & 245 South and 475 & 447 Water Street New York.\\" The silver-plated ship horn was engraved also: \\"Captn John M. Hudson, ship Red White & Blue, 2 tons 38/100 register, made passage from New York to Margate in 38 days.\\" Transatlantic crossing Red, White and Blue at sea, 1866 The ship had already been exhibited at the American Institute fair of 1865, where Ingersoll was awarded a gold medal for his invention. The intention of the voyage was to publicise the new hull-invention with a record-breaking smallest-ship Atlantic crossing, then to exhibit the ship at the prestigious Paris Exposition of 1867. The log book said, \\"The object of this expedition is to be at the world's fair in Paris, to show the French they have not all complete without something notorious to give the rest a contrast.\\" In order to arrive at the Paris Exposition by its opening date of April 1867, the crew had to perform the crossing in the summer months of 1866, in order to avoid a wintry February 1867 start from New York. The ship was registered on 9 July as if she were a clipper packet: \\"a clearance in ballast, a crew list [and] a bill of health.\\" The crew which took the ship from Sandy Hook, New Jersey, to Margate, England, were Captain John M. Hudson and Mate Frank E. Fitch, along with Fanny the poodle. The Red, White and Blue left New York on 9 July 1866, and arrived at Margate on 16 August. Before the voyage, male New Yorkers were commenting: \\"The fools will never get across,\\" \\"That captain ought to be tried for murder,\\" and \\"They ought to be put in a lunatic asylum.\\" Certain American newspapers commented, \\"One more lunatic weary of breath,\\" or suggested that the ship's name should be \\"The Fool's Own.\\" However Hudson noted in his log that, \\"The poor ladies, God bless them! were all praying for us.\\" But Hudson wrote, \\"Let them all have their own opinions; I have mine.\\" Hoy Hotel, Margate, where Hudson and Fitch stayed. The steamer Silas O. Pearce towed the ship from Red Rock Point to the Sandy Hook lightship for the start of the voyage. The ship encountered and survived heavy weather during the 38-day crossing, although \\"three times she was thrown on her beam-ends.\\" The chronometer was a rusty pocket watch, which stopped. The crew lost the signal lamp, and salt water spoiled the stored food. The dog died on 19 August, after suffering fits. A leak below the mizzen mast had been discovered and repaired at the launch, but another leak appeared at sea, keeping the crew and stores wet throughout the trip. John MacGregor (1893) said that their uncomfortable journey was the fault of \\"their own and their friends‚Äô mismanagement, the stupid construction of their cabin, the foolish three-masted rig of their boat, the boastful wager of the boat's builder, and their imprudence in painting up the boat on her arrival, and tarring the ropes.\\" They had a kerosene stove, but the roll of the ship prevented its use, so the crew were rarely able to warm their food and drink. The dog was treated well with tinned beef, but Hudson complained that, \\"That cockpit of ours is a very hard place. You are crampted up just high enough to catch the hips; it cramps the knees and makes us both sore. It is the hardest place on board; the rest is bad enough.\\" During the crossing they met a green sea turtle, a whale and a shark, and spoke various ships. At Deal they refused a pilot and attempted to beat upwind towards Margate, but the wind was too much and the ship was towed into Margate harbour by the boat Jessie. The crew arrived at Margate in \\"somewhat distressed condition, but at Margate Harbour a \\"large and enthusiastic crowd\\" was there to greet them. \\"The crowd on the pier cheered them lustily, and for the next forty-eight hours the little ship was visited by thousands.\\" =Controversy= The Daily Telegraph lauded the crew's \\"pluck and endurance, even if bordering upon rashness,\\" and confirmed its belief in the success of the venture. There were some public suggestions that Red, White and Blue had not achieved the voyage alone, but had been carried for part of the west‚Äìeast journey on board William Tapscott, or had been towed. The controversy was celebrated in comic magazines such as Punch and Fun. The following verse was to be sung to the tune of Britannia's the Pride of the Ocean: Britannia's the pride of the Ocean The home of the brave and the free; But Yankees it seems have a notion That we're much greater fools than we be. Two men and a dog crossed the briny, Of course we believe it, we do; In a boat of two tons, vessel tiny And they called it the Red, White and Blue. :And they called, &c; (in chorus). In spite of the caviller's malice, In spite of the doubts on her thrown It is now at the Crystial Palace And \\"seeing is believing\\" you'll own. The dog's tale is lost, a sad thing, this! But the men with their craft remain, two. So to the Marines let us sing this New song of the Red, White and Blue. :Here's the craft of the Red, White and Blue :Here's the craft of the Red, White and Blue :So to the Marines we'll go and sing this :New song of the Red, White and Blue. (by a Metropolitan Martial). John MacGregor (1893) blamed this misunderstanding partly on the way in which the ship's log was published in re-written form, calling it a \\"mutilated paper.\\" Although he believed that the ship really had made the voyage without outside assistance, he said, > It is a very great pity that when it has been effected there should be a > failure in appreciating its marvellous accomplishment ... After examining, > probably more than any body else, the evidence in their case‚Äîthe men, the > log, the documents, and affidavits, and the boat, and its contents, also the > numerous doubts and criticisms from all quarters, both in London and Paris, > and in Dover and Margate, I have good reason to believe that the Red, White, > and Blue had no extraneous help in her voyage across that wide ocean. The > unexplained wonder is that men able and willing to perform such a deed as > this should be incapable of building and rigging their boat so as to do it > comfortably. As no foundation was discovered for this story, the rumour was ultimately discounted, after the achievement was proved genuine by sightings from other ships, the logs of those ships and of Red, White And Blue, and by the confirmation of weather conditions. On 24 December 1866, Hudson wrote to the London Daily News to confirm politely and with dignity, with evidence from his log and from witnesses, that the voyage was not fraudulent. Crew =Captain John Morley Hudson= Engraving of Hudson (L) and Fitch (R) at The Crystal Palace, 1866 The ship's captain was John Morley Hudson (Manchester 1 May 1832 ‚Äì Brooklyn 12 December 1907). He immigrated in 1847 from Manchester, England to Brooklyn, New York and settled there. On 8 August 1856 he was married by a Presbyterian minister to Sarah Ann Saward, in Brooklyn. They had three daughters: Frances Ellen \\"Fannie\\", Sarah Anne and Selina, baptised between 1865 and 1874. He became a citizen of the United States on 18 January 1877. He served as acting ensign with the United States Navy from 12 May 1864, to 15 September 1865 when he was honorably discharged. He was registered by the American Ship Masters' Association (of the Civil War era) as a shipmaster, between 14 February 1862 and 1885. He had a 17 April 1883 certificate of competence as a master and pilot of steam vessels around the US coast and the Atlantic Ocean. On 24 July 1895 he captained the steamer James Woodall in the Roloff Expedition in the Cuban War of Independence. On 9 July 1898, Hudson volunteered to rejoin the U.S. Navy as lieutenant, and on 12 July of that year he applied to the navy for the position of line officer. He was granted a pension in 1880. Regarding Red, White and Blues transatlantic adventure, Hudson described himself as the \\"captain, ... originator and promoter of the enterprise.\\" While in Paris, Hudson had a \\"personal interview\\" with Emperor Louis Napoleon. Hudson wrote and collated an undated document called, Mind- Your-Helm or Laws of Passing Vessels. After returning to England, he found himself in financial distress. His wife had had a \\"serious accident\\" in America, he could not find work to pay for passage home, and his ship had been seized for debt. A public appeal was made in the hope of assisting his voyage home. He died in 1907 of heart disease at 239 Hawthorne Street, Brooklyn, after a brief illness. =Mate Francis Edward Fitch= The mate was Francis Edward \\"Frank\\" Fitch (born 1840).

The album charted at number 32 on the UK Albums Chart. It was reissued on CD with bonus tracks on 17 November 2017 by Cherry Red Records.  Background  On the back of the success of the Breaking Glass film and album, O'Connor released her first 'proper' album Sons and Lovers, produced by Nigel Gray. Despite including the Top-Ten hit \\"D-Days\\", the album failed to chart. This came as somewhat as a surprise, with O'Connor wanting to move on from the acting success of Kate in the film. Yet the album followed the same format of Breaking Glass album and in some parts it seemed as though she was trying too hard and coming over \\"a bit melodramatic and actor-ish vocally\\". Therefore, it was with some caution that O'Connor approached Cover Plus.  Content  The album was produced by Tony Visconti, who had produced Breaking Glass, and combines several cover songs with original compositions, many of which were autobiographical. The cover artwork, by Edward Bell, is also iconic, with O'Connor moving away from the \\"peroxide punk look in favour of a more Bowie-esque style\\". There were four singles released from the album. The title track \\"(Cover Plus) We're All Grown Up\\" is seemingly a true story about being discovered playing doctors and nurses and is also about a loss of innocence. It peaked at number 41 on the UK Singles Chart. The only other single that charted was a cover of The Stranglers' \\"Hanging Around\\", which peaked at number 45 in the UK. \\"Men of Good Fortune\\" is a cover of Lou Reed and was given away with the ninth issue of Flexipop! magazine in August 1981. The last single released was \\"That's Life\\", which was written in the style of √âdith Piaf and is a song about having no regrets over a broken romance. At the time of the release of the singles and the album, A&M; Records were still promoting Breaking Glass, with \\"Will You?\\" released in May 1981 and \\"Calls the Tune\\" released in January 1982, which may have affected Cover Plus' performance. \\"Ee-I-Addio\\" is a chilling reworking of her 1979 debut single \\"Ee-I-Adio\\" about childhood domestic abuse. The title comes from the nursery rhyme \\"The Farmer in the Dell\\". The original version is also included in the extended edition of the album. \\"Not for You\\" is about refusal to make promises in a personal relationship that could affect her own ideals of freedom. \\"Animal Farm (We Will Be Happy?)\\" is a take on the eponymous book by George Orwell. \\"Runaway\\" is about O'Connor's experience of running away to Amsterdam when she was 16. Another cover on the album is \\"Do What You Gotta Do\\", written by Jimmy Webb. O'Connor switches the genders around so that it is sung from her perspective. The bonus tracks include \\"Time is Free\\", which was the B-side to the single release of \\"D-Days\\" from Sons and Lovers. Recorded a year before Cover Plus, it is more punky than the rest of this album. The next track, \\"White Room\\" was the B-side to \\"Cover Plus (We're All Grown Up)\\" and is softer and more folky, a style O'Connor would move into in later years.

It is divided into High Ousegate and Low Ousegate. History The area covered by the street lay outside the walls of Roman Eboracum, although archaeological evidence has been found of a bathhouse on the corner of Spurriergate, and temples to Hercules and the Emperor on the corner of Nessgate. Items associated with Viking Jorvik have also been found, but at this time, the area appears to have been a large open space. However, with the construction of the Ouse Bridge, Ousegate emerged as the route east from it. The street was first recorded in the 1120s, by which time the area appears to have become built up with houses, including at least one built of stone, and the churches of All Saints, Pavement and St Michael, Spurriergate. By the 14th-century, the street was known for its lorimers (makers and sellers of metalwork for bridles and other horse furniture) and spurriers. In 1694, a major fire destroyed thirty houses on the street, and as a result, other than the churches, there are no remaining pre-1700 building on the street. Low Ousegate was very narrow until 1734, when its junction with Spurriergate was widened, while in 1769, the south-east side of the street was rebuilt further back, and in the 1810s, when Ouse Bridge was reconstructed, the part of the street near the bridge were raised, all the houses on the north-west side were demolished and rebuilt, along with some on the south-east side. In the Mediaeval period, the market on Pavement often overflowed into High Ousegate, while from 1727, a herb market was held on the street. A corn exchange was built on the south side of the street in 1926, but closed in 1946. Low Ousegate was the original location of the Yorkshire Philosophical Society. The street now forms part of the city's central shopping area. High Ousegate is pedestrianised, but Low Ousegate is a key transport route, busy with bus services. Layout and architecture The view up Ousegate in 1813 Low Ousegate runs north-east from Ouse Bridge, to its junction with Spurriergate and Nessgate. The snickelway Church Lane leads off its north-west side, while steps down to King's Staith lead off the south-east side. All the buildings from 4 to 14 Low Ousegate date from the rebuilding in the 1810s, and their design may have been loosely based on drawings by Peter Atkinson. These are followed by St Michael's Church. On the south-east side, numbers 1 to 7 were also rebuilt in the 1810s, although number 7 retains some 17th-century material, including panelling. Number 11 has 17th-century origins, while 13 was built in the early 18th-century. The line of the street continues as High Ousegate, which runs up to its junction with Coppergate, Parliament Street, Pavement and Piccadilly. Several snickelways lead off its north-west side, including Popes Head Alley, while a path on its south-east side leads to Coppergate. Notable buildings on the north-west side include 5 High Ousegate, built in 1743, and 11 to 15, all dating from the early-18th century rebuilding. On the south-east side, other than All Saints Church, notable buildings include 19, 20 and 21, all likely to be early-18th century, and 23-24 High Ousegate, a four-storey building dating from 1850.
