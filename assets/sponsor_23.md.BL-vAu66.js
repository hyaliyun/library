The film was released on direct-to-DVD in the United States on July 20, 2004. Seagal plays William Lansing, a former covert agent turned survivalist, tracking a human trafficking ring and trying to rescue his pen pal, a thirteen-year-old orphan from Poland whom he has taught to use secret codes. Plot Vietnam veteran and retired CSA agent William Lansing works on a wildlife refuge in Northern Alaska, and has been exchanging letters in a pen-pal relationship with Irena Morawska, a 13-year-old orphaned girl in Warsaw, Poland that he's helping out financially. When the letters suddenly stop coming, Lansing heads to Poland to figure out the reason. He discovers that the orphanage that Irena was staying in, which is financed by honest - and unsuspecting - good intentioned Samaritans, is a front for a human trafficking syndicate run by a notorious crime boss and freelance terrorist named Faisal. The operation is worth billions and all the girls are sold and traded to the highest bidders from all over the world. Through his letters to Irena, Lansing has taught Irena how to use secret codes, which she uses to keep him updated on where Faisal is taking her to. Lansing stays on Faisal's trail, teaming up with Polish police detective Kasia Lato to rescue Irena and the other girls, and bring down Faisal's human trafficking network.

Production began in August 2003. For large portions of the movie, Seagal was dubbed over by a voice over artist. So at certain times during the movie he speaks with his own voice, but then at other times with a dubbed voice which can be detected very easily as being dubbed. The reasoning for the dubbing of Seagal and other actors in the film was that changes were made in the storyline after most of the film was already shot. Home media Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment released the DVD in Region 1 in the United States on July 20, 2004, and Region 2 in the United Kingdom on August 23, 2004. Reception Robert Pardi of TV Guide rated it 1/4 stars and wrote, \\"Seagal's declining career found him making low-rent thrillers like this awkward, European-financed mix of social causes and unconvincing kickboxing sequences\\". Beyond Hollywood called it the strangest and most unintentionally funny Seagal film, in part due to the dubbing. Carl Davis of DVD Talk rated it 2/5 stars and wrote, \\"Out of Reach isn't a bad waste of time, but it is a bad waste of talent.\\" Mitchell Hattawa of DVD Verdict called the film too confusing to understand. Daniel Bettridge of The Guardian included the film in his list of Seagal's silliest roles.

This technique can be used to study protein-DNA interactions both outside and within cells. The regulation of transcription has been studied extensively, and yet there is still much that is not known. Transcription factors and associated proteins that bind promoters, enhancers, or silencers to drive or repress transcription are fundamental to understanding the unique regulation of individual genes within the genome. Techniques like DNA footprinting help elucidate which proteins bind to these associated regions of DNA and unravel the complexities of transcriptional control. History In 1978, David Galas and Albert Schmitz developed the DNA footprinting technique to study the binding specificity of the lac repressor protein. It was originally a modification of the Maxam-Gilbert chemical sequencing technique. Method The simplest application of this technique is to assess whether a given protein binds to a region of interest within a DNA molecule. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplify and label region of interest that contains a potential protein-binding site, ideally amplicon is between 50 and 200 base pairs in length. Add protein of interest to a portion of the labeled template DNA; a portion should remain separate without protein, for later comparison. Add a cleavage agent to both portions of DNA template. The cleavage agent is a chemical or enzyme that will cut at random locations in a sequence independent manner. The reaction should occur just long enough to cut each DNA molecule in only one location. A protein that specifically binds a region within the DNA template will protect the DNA it is bound to from the cleavage agent. Run both samples side by side on a polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The portion of DNA template without protein will be cut at random locations, and thus when it is run on a gel, will produce a ladder-like distribution. The DNA template with the protein will result in ladder distribution with a break in it, the \\"footprint\\", where the DNA has been protected from the cleavage agent. Note: Maxam-Gilbert chemical DNA sequencing can be run alongside the samples on the polyacrylamide gel to allow the prediction of the exact location of ligand binding site. =Labeling= The DNA template labeled at the 3' or 5' end, depending on the location of the binding site(s). Labels that can be used are: radioactivity and fluorescence. Radioactivity has been traditionally used to label DNA fragments for footprinting analysis, as the method was originally developed from the Maxam- Gilbert chemical sequencing technique. Radioactive labeling is very sensitive and is optimal for visualizing small amounts of DNA. Fluorescence is a desirable advancement due to the hazards of using radio-chemicals. However, it has been more difficult to optimize because it is not always sensitive enough to detect the low concentrations of the target DNA strands used in DNA footprinting experiments. Electrophoretic sequencing gels or capillary electrophoresis have been successful in analyzing footprinting of fluorescent tagged fragments. =Cleavage agent= A variety of cleavage agents can be chosen. a desirable agent is one that is sequence neutral, easy to use, and is easy to control. Unfortunately no available agents meet all of these standards, so an appropriate agent can be chosen, depending on your DNA sequence and ligand of interest. The following cleavage agents are described in detail: DNase I is a large protein that functions as a double-strand endonuclease. It binds the minor groove of DNA and cleaves the phosphodiester backbone. It is a good cleavage agent for footprinting because its size makes it easily physically hindered. Thus is more likely to have its action blocked by a bound protein on a DNA sequence. In addition, the DNase I enzyme is easily controlled by adding EDTA to stop the reaction. There are however some limitations in using DNase I. The enzyme does not cut DNA randomly; its activity is affected by local DNA structure and sequence and therefore results in an uneven ladder. This can limit the precision of predicting a protein‚Äôs binding site on the DNA molecule.LeBlanc B and Moss T. (2001) DNase I Footprinting. Methods in Molecular Biology. 148: 31‚Äì8. Hydroxyl radicals are created from the Fenton reaction, which involves reducing Fe2+ with H2O2 to form free hydroxyl molecules. These hydroxyl molecules react with the DNA backbone, resulting in a break. Due to their small size, the resulting DNA footprint has high resolution. Unlike DNase I they have no sequence dependence and result in a much more evenly distributed ladder. The negative aspect of using hydroxyl radicals is that they are more time consuming to use, due to a slower reaction and digestion time.Zaychikov E, Schickor P, Denissova L, and Heumann H. (2001) Hydroxyl radical footprinting. Methods in Molecular Biology. 148: 49‚Äì61. Ultraviolet irradiation can be used to excite nucleic acids and create photoreactions, which results in damaged bases in the DNA strand. Photoreactions can include: single strand breaks, interactions between or within DNA strands, reactions with solvents, or crosslinks with proteins. The workflow for this method has an additional step, once both your protected and unprotected DNA have been treated, there is subsequent primer extension of the cleaved products. The extension will terminate upon reaching a damaged base, and thus when the PCR products are run side-by-side on a gel; the protected sample will show an additional band where the DNA was crosslinked with a bound protein. Advantages of using UV are that it reacts very quickly and can therefore capture interactions that are only momentary. Additionally it can be applied to in vivo experiments, because UV can penetrate cell membranes. A disadvantage is that the gel can be difficult to interpret, as the bound protein does not protect the DNA, it merely alters the photoreactions in the vicinity.Geiselmann J and Boccard F. (2001) Ultraviolet-laser footprinting. Methods in Molecular Biology. 148:161-73. Advanced applications =In vivo footprinting= In vivo footprinting is a technique used to analyze the protein-DNA interactions that are occurring in a cell at a given time point. DNase I can be used as a cleavage agent if the cellular membrane has been permeabilized. However the most common cleavage agent used is UV irradiation because it penetrates the cell membrane without disrupting cell state and can thus capture interactions that are sensitive to cellular changes. Once the DNA has been cleaved or damaged by UV, the cells can be lysed and DNA purified for analysis of a region of interest. Ligation-mediated PCR is an alternative method to footprint in vivo. Once a cleavage agent has been used on the genomic DNA, resulting in single strand breaks, and the DNA is isolated, a linker is added onto the break points. A region of interest is amplified between the linker and a gene-specific primer, and when run on a polyacrylamide gel, will have a footprint where a protein was bound.Dai S, Chen H, Chang C, Riggs A, Flanagan S. (2000) Ligation-mediated PCR for quantitative in vivo footprinting. Nature Biotechnology. 18:1108‚Äì1111. In vivo footprinting combined with immunoprecipitation can be used to assess protein specificity at many locations throughout the genome. The DNA bound to a protein of interest can be immunoprecipitated with an antibody to that protein, and then specific region binding can be assessed using the DNA footprinting technique. =Quantitative footprinting= The DNA footprinting technique can be modified to assess the binding strength of a protein to a region of DNA. Using varying concentrations of the protein for the footprinting experiment, the appearance of the footprint can be observed as the concentrations increase and the proteins binding affinity can then be estimated. =Detection by capillary electrophoresis= To adapt the footprinting technique to updated detection methods, the labelled DNA fragments are detected by a capillary electrophoresis device instead of being run on a polyacrylamide gel. If the DNA fragment to be analyzed is produced by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), it is straightforward to couple a fluorescent molecule such as carboxyfluorescein (FAM) to the primers. This way, the fragments produced by DNaseI digestion will contain FAM, and will be detectable by the capillary electrophoresis machine. Typically, carboxytetramethyl-rhodamine (ROX)-labelled size standards are also added to the mixture of fragments to be analyzed. Binding sites of transcription factors have been successfully identified this way. Genome-wide assays Next-generation sequencing has enabled a genome-wide approach to identify DNA footprints. Open chromatin assays such as DNase-Seq and FAIRE-Seq have proven to provide a robust regulatory landscape for many cell types. However, these assays require some downstream bioinformatics analyses in order to provide genome-wide DNA footprints. The computational tools proposed can be categorized in two classes: segmentation-based and site-centric approaches. Segmentation-based methods are based on the application of Hidden Markov models or sliding window methods to segment the genome into open/closed chromatin region. Examples of such methods are: HINT, Boyle method and Neph method. Site-centric methods, on the other hand, find footprints given the open chromatin profile around motif-predicted binding sites, i.e., regulatory regions predicted using DNA-protein sequence information (encoded in structures such as position weight matrix). Examples of these methods are CENTIPEDE and Cuellar-Partida method.

Laurieton is the largest town in the Camden Haven district. Laurieton is 365 kmNRMA Travel Planner Distance by Road north of Sydney and 42 km south of Port Macquarie. It lies between the base of North Brother Mountain and the Camden Haven River. At the , it had a population of 1,986. The Birpai (also known as Birrbay) people have lived in this area for more than 40,000 years. The largest school in the district, Camden Haven High School, is located approximately 5 km away from Laurieton's shopping and business centre. Captain James Cook named \\"the Brothers\\" on 12 May 1770 for their resemblance to mountains in his native Yorkshire. He was unwittingly mirroring the name given to them by the Birpai. The Camden Haven area was explored on foot by John Oxley in 1818 and was first settled by Europeans in the early 1820s. A convict settlement was established at nearby Port Macquarie in 1821 and the first settlers were limeburners burning oyster shells for buildings there. Some of these lived at the foot of North Brother. There was also a small garrison of soldiers to catch escaping convicts. In 1827 the area was surveyed by Armstrong and Guilding as part of an assessment for the Australian Agricultural Company.\\"People of Two Rivers Hastings-Camden Haven\\" by Hastings Writers, 2003, \\"An Historical Account of Kendall & Camden Haven Area\\", Camden Haven Learning Exchange Inc, 1983 Joseph Laurie J.P.

The Laurieton timber mill, owned by Laurie Brothers and built on the river bank, officially opened on 12 January 1876\\"Maitland Mercury\\" Tue 18 Jan 1876, p8 and a store was built opposite at the same time. The mill was operated initially by Joseph Laurie. Two years later a second timber mill was built by John Hibbard at Camden Haven Heads. However this mill was later moved to the Hastings River. Another mill, owned by John Rodger commenced operations soon after. Joseph Laurie operated two ketches from Laurieton. The \\"Mary Laurie\\" was built at Laurieton and launched on 11 Nov 1884. The \\"Annie Laurie\\" was built at Brisbane Water. By 1886 Laurieton had 4 timber mills operating in the vicinity. There were 3 steam punts with 2 more being built and a bakery had recently been established.The Sydney Mail, Sat 23 Oct 1886, p876 (p22) Captain George De Fraine was trading to Camden Haven in his ketch \\"Ethel B.T.\\" from about 1887 and later also operated a steam tug \\"Unique\\". In 1893 he entered into partnership with John Rodger. William McKay & Hugh Bibby had leased and operated Joseph Laurie's sawmill from around 1880. When Joseph Laurie sold his interests to George De Fraine in about 1896, the mill was operated as a partnership of De Fraine, McKay and Bibby until 1899 when George De Fraine took full ownership. George De Fraine also acquired the lease for the mill built by Messrs Dun and Bagan (later known as the Dun-Bagan mill) operating on land opposite Laurieton. In 1891 the Lands Department proposed changing the name of Laurieton to Camden Haven (coinciding with the change of name of the former Camden Haven to Kendall). This was extremely unpopular with Laurieton residents and the name remained unchanged. The steamship \\"Hastings\\", sailing ship \\"Isabella de Fraine\\" and steamship \\"Cobar\\" were built at Laurieton between 1901 and 1903. De Fraine oversaw his extensive business interests in the area until his death in 1907. A Catalina seaplane carrying entertainer Bob Hope was forced to make an emergency landing on Camden Haven adjacent to Laurieton on 14 August 1944. Bob Hope was returning to Sydney after entertaining troops in Guam. The local postmaster lent him money for his hotel bills after the luggage was jettisoned. An impromptu party was held, and the next day Hope and his entourage travelled by road to Newcastle and flew from there to Sydney. Bob Hope maintained contact with the residents of Laurieton for decades afterwards.

Initially used in the SP250 sports car and the Majestic Major saloon, the engine was mostly used in the Daimler 2.5 V8 (later named V8-250) saloon made with Jaguar Mark 2 unit bodies from 1962 to 1969. Approximately 20,000 of the 2.5-litre version of the engine were made for use in the SP250 and the 250 saloon, while approximately 2,000 of the 4.5-litre version were made for use in the Majestic Major saloon and its limousine variant which remained in production until 1968. Design and development Shortly after being appointed Managing Director (Chief Executive) of BSA's Automotive Division in 1956, Edward Turner was asked to design a saloon car powered by a V8 engine. Turner and his design engineer Jack Wickes began considering the initial concept of their new engine by examining the manual and spare parts list of a Cadillac V8 engine.Feedback. The Type 51 was the first Cadillac V8. Introduced in 1914, it was the standard engine for 1915 Cadillac models. It was a 90¬∞ design with an L-head (sidevalve) configuration and was water-cooled. This engine was designed under the leadership of Cadillac's chief engineer 1914-1917, Scottish-born D (D'Orsay) McCall White (1880 -), later a vice president of Cadillac.(Cadillac puts White in Vice- Presidency, Automobile Topics 13 October 1917 Volume 47) Hired by Henry Leland for his V-engine expertise from his employment as chief engineer at Napier, and previously Daimler at Coventry. Using a pushrod overhead valve system kept down design, development and production costs and allowed Turner to base the design of the cylinder head on those he developed for Triumph motorcycles including the use of hemispherical combustion chambers. Adapting the Triumph head design for use in a saloon car engine required much work in reducing friction and improving timing. Much of the development of the prototype engine was carried out by Dr. J. N. H. Tait. Tait had been involved with Donald Healey in the early post war years, working successfully on modified Riley 2¬Ω-litre Big Four engines, the final incarnation of which was used in 1953 Zethrin Rennsport prototype, delivering close to 200 bhp with surprising tractability. The two sizes of the Daimler derivative engines share similar but not identical external dimensions and design, the 4.5 litre being longer, deeper and wider. Although it is just possible to substitute one for the other, it requires a good deal of alteration of mountings, exhaust piping, etc. Limited investment in tooling for the 2.5-litre engine led to limited production capacity, with a maximum weekly output of 140 engines, and the 4.5 litre was only ever made in small quantities. This prescribed maximum output was never achieved during the production of the engine. Specifications The 90 degree V8 engine has part-hemispherical combustion chambers with two overhead valves per cylinder operated by push-rods from a single chain-driven camshaft positioned centrally high up in the vee. Aluminium alloy pistons with steel connecting rods run in a cast chrome-iron block with sand-cast high- tensile light alloy heads and crankcase housing a short stiff dynamically balanced crankshaft carried on five bearings.\\"The power unit has a cast-iron block, light alloy head and crankcase, with a short stiff dynamically balanced crankshaft carried on five bearings.\\"‚Äî. However, the source does not mention a chrome-iron block, aluminium alloy pistons, steel connecting rods, or the light alloy components being sand-cast or high-tensile The nose of the crankshaft carries a torsional vibration damper, a four or six-bladed fan, and the pulley for the triangulated thin belt drive for the dynamo and water pump. The dynamo is located between the cylinder blocks on the smaller 2.5. At the rear the drive is taken from the back of the camshaft for the distributor positioned high above the unit behind the two semi-downdraught SU carburettors. There is a separate exhaust system for each bank of cylinders. Light alloy is used for the valve covers, tappet blocks, sump and inlet manifolds. Cooling is by pump and fan with a thermostatic by-pass control. Applications The engine first publicly appeared in the Daimler Dart but, after Chrysler objected to use of that name, it was called the Daimler SP250, a fibreglass bodied sports car aimed at the American market. In December 1961 Daimler announced a marine version of their 2.5-litre V8. The 2.5-litre engine, only in length and developing @ 5,800 rpm, gave better performance than Jaguar's own 2.4-litre DOHC in-line six, and after the 1960 merger the opportunity was taken to create an up-market Daimler V8 version of the Jaguar Mark 2. Between the years 1962 and 1969 17,620 Daimler/Jaguar V8s were built. Initially called the Daimler 2.5 V8, it was later called the Daimler V8-250. The 4.5-litre engine was used in the Daimler Majestic Major DQ450, which is now rare, but was a respected high performance saloon in its day. The engine was also used in the Majestic Major's limousine derivative, the DR450. The 4.5-litre was tested in a Jaguar Mark X and there are some unauthenticated reports that this car lapped the Motor Industry Research Association's high- speed test track at but was reportedly not put into production precisely because its performance was better than the original 3.8 Mark X's. However, the more likely explanation is that there was not the production capacity for the engine, and in any event the 4.2 litre mark X gave superior acceleration. All 4.5-litre V8 models sold were automatic, which makes connection to a manual transmission difficult. =Felday-Daimler hillclimbing special= Peter Westbury, an engineer from Surrey, England, competed in hillclimbing events in cars powered by Daimler V8 engines. Between the end of the 1962 RAC Hillclimb Championship season, in which he finished seventh in a V8-powered Cooper, and the beginning of the 1963 season, Westbury built a new hillclimbing special called the Felday-Daimler powered by a 2.5-litre Daimler V8 with a SU carburettor and a Roots supercharger. Westbury won the 1963 RAC Hillclimb Championship in the Felday-Daimler, setting course records at Craigantlet in Ulster and Dyrham Park in Gloucestershire. =Glacier Grenade drag racing special= In 1970, Russ Carpenter and Tony Anderson built the \\"Glacier Grenade,\\" a rear-engined drag racing special. It was the first \\"All British\\" rear engined dragster of its type. Powered by a 2.5litre Daimler V8 it would compete in drag racing from March 1972 until 1989 when the car was outlawed from European racing. Russ began to drive the car in 1974 taking over sole driving duties after Tony's retirement from the sport in 1976 due to a spinal injury. Russ continued the car's development all the way through its racing life. In 1980 it became the first drag car under 5.5 litres, and the first all-British car to complete a quarter-mile race in less than eight seconds. By the time of its retirement, the car, using mainly stock engine parts, produced 1400 bhp and ran the standing quarter mile in 7.2 seconds at 180 mph. The car was restored and was to be displayed at Dunsfold Aerodrome in Guilford in April 2014. In 2014 Russ Carpenter was inducted into the British Drag Racing Hall of Fame for his development of this engine and influencing others to use a British engine in a largely American engine focused Motorsport. End of production Jaguar became part of the British Leyland Motor Corporation (BLMC) in 1968. BLMC chairman Sir Donald Stokes decided that the production costs of the Daimler V8 engine were too high and ordered its discontinuation. The Majestic Major was discontinued without replacement in 1968, followed by the V8-250 in 1969. By 1970 the Daimler range was reduced to the Jaguar XJ6-based Daimler Sovereign saloon and the Jaguar Mark X-based Daimler DS420 limousine, both powered by Jaguar XK6 engines.

Stennis Strike Groups during Valiant Shield 2007. Exercise Valiant Shield is one of the largest United States military war games held in the Pacific Ocean. Until 2018, there have been seven Valiant Shield exercises since 2006. According to the Navy, Valiant Shield focuses on cooperation between military branches and on the detection, tracking, and engagement of units at sea, in the air, and on land in response to a wide range of missions. The first exercise in 2006 involved 22,000 personnel, 280 aircraft, and 30 ships, including the supercarriers , , and . It was the largest military exercise to be conducted by the United States in Pacific waters since the Vietnam War, and it was also the first time observers from the People's Republic of China were allowed to view U.S. wargames. The exercise marked the first of what will become biennial exercises involving different branches of the U.S. military. Valiant Shield 2006 included Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard units. Air operations included thousands of sorties as well as in-air refuelings and parachute deployments. Aircraft from Valiant Shield deployed on missions ranging across the Pacific all the way to Alaska. Ships simulated anti-submarine warfare. Valiant Shield 2006 was the first time that three carrier strike groups had operated together in the Pacific in over ten years. Forces exercised a wide range of skills, including maritime interdiction; defense counter-air; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; and command and control. Observers Observers from China at Andersen Air Force Base on Guam Observers from the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy were invited to attend, as were naval officers from India, Singapore, Japan, Australia, South Korea, Russia, Indonesia, and Malaysia. It was the first time observers from the People's Republic of China had ever been sent to observe U.S. war games. China sent a ten-person delegation, including one high-ranking officer each from its navy, army, and air force, as well as officials from its foreign ministry. According to USA Today, Chinese military observers said that observing the exercises gave them a better understanding of U.S. weapons and tactics. Rear Admiral Zhang Leiyu, leader of the delegation, called the visit to the war games near Guam \\"a positive step in China-U.S. military ties.\\" Military ties between the United States and China have not been close ever since a communist government came to power in China. Admiral William J. Fallon, the top U.S. commander in the Pacific, said it was \\"a start\\" that China accepted his invitation to observe the large-scale exercises. Fallon indicated before the exercises began that he expected China to reciprocate. However, neither Zhang or the Xinhua report gave any indication that such an invitation was forthcoming. The exercise had implications for other world events as well, including acting as a show of force to possibly deter North Korea from test-firing its new Taepodong-2 missile.

He is a demon, one of the Fear Lords, who has clashed with Doctor Strange.  Publication history  The Dweller-in- Darkness was first mentioned in Thor #229-230 (November‚ÄìDecember, 1974), by Gerry Conway and Rich Buckler. The character is first fully revealed in Doctor Strange #30 (August, 1978), by Roger Stern and Tom Sutton. The character subsequently appears in Doctor Strange #32-33 (December 1978, February 1979), #35-37 (June‚ÄìOctober 1979), Fantastic Four Annual #23 (1990), Doctor Strange #31-33 (July‚ÄìSeptember 1991), #38-40 (January‚ÄìMarch 1992), and Adventures of the X-Men #11-12 (February‚ÄìMarch 1997). The Dweller-in-Darkness received an entry in The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Horror #1 (2005). Fictional character biography The Dweller-in-Darkness is a demon allegedly sired by Cthulhu,Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol. 4 #10. Marvel Comics from the dimension Everinnye, like the demon Nightmare. The Dweller became shunned by his people for following \\"The Way of the Shamblu\\". Like Nightmare, the Dweller feeds on the fear of living beings; fear both increases his powers and keeps him alive. In the universe which existed before the current reality, the Dweller caused a fracture in the M'Kraan Crystal in order to bring about the destruction of the universe and absorb the fear this would cause in every being that existed. Just before the crystal shattered, however, the Phoenix Force telepathically reached out to the minds of all life and united them in peace, foiling the Dweller's scheme. As the universe came to an end, the current Marvel Universe was born.Adventures of the X-Men #11-12 (February‚ÄìMarch 1997) In this new universe, when he first came to Earth, the Dweller-in-Darkness fed upon the fears created by the war between the humans of Atlantis and the Deviants of Lemuria. The Atlantean sorceress Zhered-Na discovered the existence of the Dweller and banished him with the help of Agamotto and the Atlantean god Valka. When Atlantis sank, the Dweller absorbed the fear of the inhabitants and used it to create D'Spayre and ordered him to kill Zhered-Na in revenge. D'Spayre manipulated a tribesman to kill Zhered-Na and Zhered-Na's student, Dakimh the Enchanter would battle D'Spayre over the next millennia, while D'Spayre tried to generate enough fear on Earth to free his creator. During this time the Dweller would create other beings with a similar purpose, including the demoness Spite. D'Spayre would remain his most powerful creation though. In the 20th century, the Dweller appeared in the dreams of many humans and told them that they would gain eternal life if they died. These humans would then kill themselves but turn into Shade Thralls, powerful creatures who served the Dweller, but were vulnerable to light. His plan was stopped by the gods Thor and Hercules who fought the Shade Thralls and destroyed them. He also inspired Zoltan Drago to become the first Mister Fear. The Dweller would create new Shade Thralls. These Shade Thralls were destroyed by Doctor Strange and Clea, but not before the Dweller finally freed himself from his prison. The Dweller witnessed the destruction of his Shade Thralls by Strange and Clea and determined that they were the largest threat to him on Earth. Over the next few months he tried to kill Strange using servants like the Dream-Weaver and several demons, but Strange defeated them all. Still, Strange's resolve was sapped by the Dweller's servants and he was overcome with fear. The Dweller decided that he had defeated Strange and stopped his attacks. Months later, the Dweller gathered the Fear Lords and told them about his plans to create the Great Fear: a terror which would engulf humanity. In fact, the Dweller hoped that the other Fear Lords would be destroyed during this plan by Doctor Strange. Most of the Fear Lords agreed, but the Straw Man, who was benevolent to humanity, disagreed with their plan and warned Strange. The Fear Lords destroyed the Straw Man before he could tell Strange too much, but they only killed one of the Straw Man's many bodies. The Great Fear started out as the Dweller had planned; several of the Fear Lords were destroyed by Strange and his allies, but D'Spayre told Nightmare about the Dweller's true plans. Nightmare and the Dweller fought, but during their battle they generated so much fear that humanity stopped fearing and started to despair. The two were unable to feed upon this despair, but D'Spayre was and he became more powerful than the two of them. Realizing that D'Spayre had manipulated them, the Dweller attacked him, but D'Spayre destroyed the Dweller's robotic body. His head, the only living part of the Dweller, escaped. Hawkeye and Black Widow became involved in a mission against some of the servants of the Dweller-in-Darkness on behalf of the Secret Avengers.Secret Avengers Vol. 2 #1 Powers and abilities The Dweller has the ability to generate fear in other living beings. This fear in turn sustains and empowers the Dweller, allowing him to generate even more fear. He also has other undefined mystical powers: he can create independent creatures out of fear like D'spayre and he can turn humans who die under his influence into Shade Thralls, beings made of shadow with superhuman strength. Strong light can kill or banish these thralls. The Dweller is immortal, doesn't age and even the sorceress Zhered-Na, assisted by powerful beings like Agamotto and Valka, could only banish him, not destroy him. The \\"Way of the Shamblu\\", the Dweller's chosen path in life, involved a ritual where the Dweller removed his head from his own body. His body died, but his head lived on, now as a corporeal being, whereas the other inhabitants of Everinnye are more ethereal. The Dweller's head is attached to a robotic body, which possesses superhuman strength, but it can detach and move with the tentacles near its mouth in case of emergency. Other versions =Secret Wars 2099= During the Secret Wars storyline in the Battleworld domain of 2099, Martin Hargood (the 2099 version of Baron Mordo) used Alchemax's virtual unreality laboratory to summon the Dweller-in-Darkness. Meanwhile, Miguel O'Hara called in the Avengers to defend the city from the Dweller-in-Darkness allowing the Defenders to intervene without being arrested. While Iron Man, Silver Surfer, Roman the Sub-Mariner, and Hulk confronted the Dweller-in-Darkness, the rest of both teams confronted Hargood. After Hargood was knocked out, Strange was able to reverse the effects of the portal that brought the Dweller-in-Darkness and brought it back to where it came from.Secret Wars 2099 #5  In other media  In Marvel Avengers Academy, Dweller-In-Darkness appears in the mobile game, as the second chapter boss for the Doctor Strange special event.

Early life Bosworth was born on August 11, 1867, in Marietta, Ohio, a descendant of Miles Standish and John and Priscilla Alden on his father's side and of New York's Van Zandt family, the first Dutch settlers to land in the New World, on his mother's side. Bosworth was always proud of his lineage. After his mother died, his father remarried and young Hobart took a dislike to his stepmother. Considering himself \\"ill used and cruelly treated\\", as he told an interviewer in 1914, he ran away to New York City and became a cabin boy on a ship. After his first voyage, a five-month trip that took him from New York to San Francisco, Hobart spent his wages on candy. (Sleeping it off on a bench in the park in back of Trinity Church, the young boy didn't know when dozing off that the organ music was being played by his own uncle. A Captain Roberts, who found stevedore work for young Hobart, told him of his uncle's presence in San Francisco.) He continued as a sailor as the sea was in his family's blood, eventually spending three years at sea. Bosworth in costume He once told an interviewer, \\"All my people were of the sea and my father was a naval officer\\". He spent eleven months on an old fashioned whaler plying the Arctic. Back in San Francisco, he found work at odd jobs. When not otherwise occupied becoming a semi-professional boxer and wrestler, Bosworth tried ranching in Southern California and Mexico, where he learned to become an expert horseman. Finally, his interest in the arts led him to the stage. Career Thinking he would like to become a landscape painter, a friend suggested that he work as a stage manager to raise the money to study art. Acting on his friend's advice, Bosworth obtained a job with McKee Rankin as a stage manager at the California Theatre in San Francisco. Earning some money, he undertook the study of painting. Eventually, he was pressed into duty as an actor in a small part with three lines. Though he botched the lines, he was given other small roles. Bosworth was eighteen years old, and on the cusp of a life in the theater. From left to right, Monte Blue, Miriam Cooper, and Hobart Bosworth in costume for a publicity still for the silent drama Betrayed (1917) Hobart signed on with Louis Morrison to be part of a road company for a season as both an actor and as Morrison's dresser, playing Shakespeare's Cymbeline and Measure for Measure. During his time with the company, Hobart and another writer wrote a version of Faust that Morrison used for twenty years in repertory. By 1887, he was acting at the Alcazar Theatre in San Francisco. He became proficient enough on stage to give Shakespearean canon by the time he was twenty-one years old, though he admitted that he was the worst Macbeth ever. Bosworth eventually wound up in Park City, Utah, where he worked in a mine, pushing an ore wagon in order to raise money. He escaped the pits to tour with the magician Hermann the Great as the conjurer's assistant for a tour through Mexico. For the first time in eleven years, the 21-year-old Bosworth met his father. Hobart recalled, \\"He looked at me and said, \\"Hum! I couldn't lick you now, son.\\" They never met again. He arrived back in New York in December 1888, and was hired by Augustin Daly to play \\"Charles the Wrestler\\" in As You Like It. He did so well in the role, Daly kept him on. Bosworth remained with Daly's company for ten years, in which he played mostly minor parts. Seven times while he was with the company they made foreign tours, playing in Berlin, Cologne, London, Paris and other European cities. Playing exclusively small parts eroded his confidence, and Bosworth left Daly to sign on with Julia Marlowe, who cast him in leads in Shakespearean plays. Just as Bosworth began to taste stage stardom in New York, he was stricken with tuberculosis, a disease often fatal in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Bosworth was forced to give up the stage, and he was not allowed to exert himself indoors. Though he made a rapid recovery, he returned to the stage too quickly and suffered a relapse. For the rest of his working life, he balanced his acting with periods of rest so as to keep his tuberculosis in remission. Bosworth re-established himself as a lead actor on the New York stage, appearing in the 1903 Broadway revival of Henrik Ibsen's Hedda Gabler. He also appeared that year on the Great White Way as the lead in Marta of the Lowlands. This role propelled him to Broadway stardom. However, he was forced again to give up the stage when he lost seventy pounds in ten weeks due to his illness. Bosworth moved to Tempe, Arizona, to partake of the climate to improve his health. Eventually, he got the disease under control again. While not severely handicapped, he was forced to remain in a warm climate lest he suffer a relapse. The disease robbed him of his voice as well, but there was a new medium for actors: silent films. Betty Harte and Bosworth in The Roman (1910) Bosworth moved to San Diego, and in 1908 he was contracted to make a motion picture by the Selig Polyscope Company. Shooting was to be done in the outdoors, and he did not have to use his voice, which was in poor condition. Bosworth once said, \\"I believe, after all, that it is the motion pictures that have saved my life. How could I have lived on and on, without being able to carry out any of my cherished ambitions? What would my life have meant? Here, in pictures, I am realizing my biggest hopes.\\" Signing with the Selig Polyscope Co., Hobart eventually convinced the movie company to move to Los Angeles. Bosworth is widely credited with being the star of the first movie made on the West Coast. Due to his role in pioneering the film industry in California, Bosworth often was referred to as the \\"Dean of Hollywood\\". He wrote the scenarios for the second and third pictures he acted in, and directed the third. According to his own count, he eventually wrote 112 scenarios and produced eighty-four pictures with Selig. Bosworth was attracted to Jack London's work due to his out-of- doors filming experience and the requirements of his health, which precluded acting in studios. =Hobart Bosworth Productions Company= In 1913, he started his own company, Hobart Bosworth Productions Company, to produce a series of Jack London melodramas. He produced and directed the company's first picture, playing Wolf Larsen in The Sea Wolf. London himself appeared as a sailor. The movie was released in the U.S. by The W. W. Hodkinson Corp. and States Right Independent Exchanges. D. W. Griffith also released a Jack London picture that year, Two Men of the Desert. Hobart followed up with The Sea Wolf with The Chechako. The Chechako and some other Bosworth-London pictures were distributed through Paramount Pictures. Bosworth also directed the follow-up, The Valley of the Moon, in which had a supporting actor role. He also appeared as an actor in John Barleycorn, which he co-directed with J. Charles Haydon. He produced, directed, wrote, and acted in Martin Eden and An Odyssey of the North, playing the lead in the latter, which was released by Paramount. He finished up the series by producing, directing, and playing the lead in the two-part \\"Burning Daylight\\" series, The Adventures of Burning Daylight. Both were released by Paramount. Soon Bosworth joined the Oliver Photography Company. Subsequently, Bosworth Inc. and Oliver Morosco Productions released a total of thirty-one pictures, most which starred Bosworth. The company ceased operations after producing The Sea Lion. Behind the Door, German U-boat commander Lieutenant Brandt (played by Wallace Beery) is being throttled by American Merchant Marine Captain Oscar Krug (Hobart Bosworth). The merger with Paramount ended the period in Bosworth's creative life where he was a major force in the motion picture industry, which was undergoing changes as the industry matured and solidified. He directed one other picture before the merger, The White Scar, which he also wrote and starred in for the Universal Film Manufacturing Company. After his own production company closed, Hobart wound up playing supporting roles as an actor. He divorced his first wife, Adele Farrington, in 1919. On 22 December 1920 he married Cecile Kibre, widow of G. Harold Percival, who had been art director at Ince Studio and who had died of influenza in 1918. Cecile Kibre had a son by Percival, named George, whom Hobart Bosworth later adopted as his son. Bosworth survived motion pictures' transition to sound, or \\"talkies\\". Aside from appearing in Warner Brothers' showcase, The Show of Shows (1929), his talking debut proper was in the film short A Man in Peace, for Vitaphone, while his first sound feature was Vitaphone's Ruritanian romance General Crack, starring John Barrymore. Although he appeared in small roles in A-list films, Bosworth primarily made his living as a prominently billed character actor in B-Westerns and serials churned out by Poverty Row studios. In all his roles in A and B pictures, he usually was typecast in a fatherly role, as a clergyman, judge, grandparent, etc. Death and legacy Hobart Bosworth died Dec. 30, 1943 of pneumonia in Glendale, California, aged 76. He was survived by his second wife, Cecile and his son George. He was entombed in Glendale's Forest Lawn Memorial Park with a private mausoleum. For his contributions to the film industry, Bosworth received a motion pictures star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960. The star is located at 6522 Hollywood Boulevard.

Because of its whitish appearance, hasma is often mistakenly described as \\"snow frog fat\\". The Western pharmaceutical term is Oviductus Ranae. Hasma is relatively expensive, so it is reserved for special occasions and high-end restaurants Production Hasma is produced primarily in the Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning provinces in China. Previously part of Chinese imperial cuisine, soups made with hasma are now widely available in North American cities with large Chinese populations and in Mainland China, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong, albeit at a high price. Physical characteristics Hasma is sold dried as irregular flat pieces and flakes ranging from 1‚Äì2 cm in length and 1‚Äì5 mm in thickness. Individual pieces are yellowish-white in color with a matte luster, and may be covered with off-white pellicles. When rehydrated, dried hasma can expand up to 10-15 times in size. The dried hasma is rehydrated and double-boiled with rock sugar to create a glutinous texture and opaque color. Dried or rehydrated hasma has a slight fishy smell. In its unflavored form it is sweet and slightly savory in taste with a texture that is glutinous, chewy, and light, quite similar to that of tapioca in a dessert. Preparation Hasma cooked with jujubes Hasma serves the role of providing texture to tong sui, or sweet soups, as well as increasing the perceived luxuriousness and prestige of the soup. These soups are usually flavored with rock sugar. For the uninitiated, this relatively accessible eating experience belies the exotic sounding nature of the dessert. Hasma is widely featured in dessert dishes in high class restaurants in Hong Kong. Hasma is most commonly paired in sweet soups with: *Jujubes () *Dried longan fruits () *Lotus seeds () It is also a key ingredient in making \\"Three snow soup\\" (), which consists of: *Chinese pear () *Snow fungus () Hasma can also be included in more exotic versions of shark fin soup. Health claims Hasma is taken for medicinal purposes in Traditional Chinese medicine. Hasma is prescribed to treat respiratory symptoms, but there exists scarce scientific research to support this practice. It is also a suggested remedy for stomach ulcers and used to improve the appearance of skin, and even for restored strength after childbirth.

It was the Lhasa seat of the former State Oracle who had his main residence at Nechung Monastery.Dowman (1998), p. 40. It is located immediately behind and east of the Jokhang and may be accessed from the north side of the Barkhor. History It is said that Emperor Songtsen Gampo built the first building here and it is where the great Tibetan scholar, Thonmi Sambhota, completed his work developing the Tibetan alphabet in the first half of the 7th century. The present building, first constructed during the reign of King Ralpacan (c. 806-838 CE),Vitali (1990), p. 19. is built like an Indian vihara around a courtyard, with the lhakang ('temple', literally 'residence of the deity') to the north and monks quarters on the three other sides. It was destroyed during the persecution of Buddhism under Langdarma (c. 838 to 841 CE), but rebuilt by Atisha (980-1054 CE) and became Gelugpa under Sonam Gyatso, the 3rd Dalai Lama (1543‚Äì1589).Dorje (1999), p. 88. It became the Lhasa residence of the Nechung Oracle in the 17th century, who was possessed by Pehar in his trances. Description The lhakang contains a number of fine murals ‚Äî the central image being that of Guru Rinpoche (Padmasambhava), with images of the five Nyingma Yidam-Protectors and Tseumar and Tamdrin in glass cases around the walls. On the western side of the gallery upstairs is the Gongkar Chode Branch Temple, a Sakya shrine dedicated to an image of Gonpo Pelgon Dramtso or Bramze, the Sadhu-Protector of the monastery. His image is to the right of the door and used to be flanked by images of the six-armed Mahakala, Panjara and Shridevi.Dowman (1998). pp. 48-49. The oldest extant structure is the Jambhala Lhakhang which was originally built under Ralpacan. It is quite small (7.5 x 7.2 metres), with a low ceiling. It is said to have been where Thonmi Sambhota worked on the alphabet and later became attached to Nechung. The Dhukang or Assembly Hall, a very active temple, was built in the 19th century by Nechung Khenpo Sakya Ngape, and renovated in 1986. There are frescoes portraying the protector deity Dorje Drakden, Tsongkhapa, Atisha, Padmasambhava, Shantarakshita, and King Trisong Detsen. The central image of Avalokiteshvara is new with a copper Padmasambhava to the right and a sand mandala to the left. Behind is an inner sanctum with more images and upstairs is the Tsepame Lhakang with 1,000 small images of Amitayas (or AmitƒÅbha) Buddha.Dorje (1999), pp. 88-89.

He was first elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1952 from Virginia's 6th congressional district. An attorney and a Republican, he was given strong consideration for the United States Supreme Court by President Richard M. Nixon and was later appointed as a Justice (later Senior Justice) of the Virginia Supreme Court. Early life and education Born in Radford, Montgomery County, Virginia, Poff attended the local public schools and graduated from Christiansburg High School. He then traveled to Salem, Virginia for studies at Roanoke College. After his military service below, Poff used his GI bill benefits, he earned a law degree (LL.B.) in 1948 from the University of Virginia School of Law at Charlottesville.https://history.house.gov/People/Detail?id=19773 Military service During the Second World War, Poff served as a bomber pilot with the Eighth Air Force in England; flew thirty-five successful missions over Europe; awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross; was inactivated from the service as a first lieutenant serving from February 1943 to August 1945. Legislative career Poff was first elected to Congress in 1952, defeating incumbent Democrat Clarence G. Burton. He was the first Republican to represent this part of Virginia since Reconstruction, and likely owed his victory to Dwight Eisenhower carrying the state in that year's presidential election. However, the 6th had already been moving away from its Democratic roots for some time. The Byrd Democrats in western Virginia and the Shenandoah Valley had begun splitting their tickets as early as the 1930s. He would never face another contest nearly as close as his first one, and was reelected nine times. Poff had his share of controversy during his decades in the House of Representatives. He and Joel Broyhill of Virginia were the only two Republicans, along with the rest of Virginia's entire Congressional delegation, and nearly all members from Southern states, to sign the Southern Manifesto protesting the Supreme Court's mandate in Brown v. Board of Education to desegregate public schools. A. Linwood Holton, former Governor of Virginia (1970‚Äì1974), and the commonwealth's first post-Reconstruction Republican Governor, suggests that Poff probably could not have been reelected unless he signed the manifesto. Despite that controversial decision, he was well liked by most of his constituents, most of whom had never been represented by a Republican before. This included many African Americans, who in an ABC News report on his nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court described him as having a great interest in individuals; only one person in that report described him as a racist despite his having signed the Southern Manifesto. Consistent with his signing of the Manifesto, Poff voted against the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, but voted in favor of the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. In 1971, he favored the Equal Employment Opportunity Act and supported federal aid to accelerate the desegregation process. He was the only member of the House Republican leadership who did not support President Eisenhower's proposal to increase the minimum wage and widen its coverage. According to John Dean, he was also the author of most of the 25th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States while serving on the Judiciary Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives. =Electoral history= *1952; Poff was elected to the U.S House of Representatives with 51.55% of the vote, defeating Democrat Clarence Godber Burton. *1954; Poff was re-elected with 62.31% of the vote, defeating Democrat Ernest Robertson and Social Democrat J.B. Brayman. *1956; Poff was re-elected with 62.09% of the vote, defeating Democrat John L. Whitehead and Social Democrat Brayman. *1958; Poff was re-elected with 56.74% of the vote, defeating Democrat Richard F. Pence and Social Democrat Brayman. *1960; Poff was re-elected with 82.62% of the vote, defeating Social Democrat Brayman. *1962; Poff was re-elected with 65.22% of the vote, defeating Democrat John P. Wheeler and now-Independent Brayman. *1964; Poff was re-elected with 56.24% of the vote, defeating Democrat William B. Hopkins. *1966; Poff was re-elected with 80.84% of the vote, defeating Democrat Murray A. Stoller. *1968; Poff was re-elected with 92.16% of the vote, defeating Democrat Tom Hufford. *1970; Poff was re-elected with 74.58% of the vote, defeating Democrat Roy R. White. Nomination to Supreme Court of the United States Before President Richard Nixon could formally nominate him for the U.S. Supreme Court, Poff withdrew (before nomination reached the Senate). John Dean wrote that Poff actually made that decision based on concerns that he would thus be forced to reveal to his then-12-year-old son that he had been adopted. Poff's concern was that the child would be negatively affected by that kind of information if revealed before he was old enough to understand. Nevertheless, according to The New York Times, within weeks after he withdrew from consideration that sensitive personal information was revealed in Jack Anderson's column, and he was forced to inform the child of his adoption anyway. By then, it was too late for reconsideration, and eventually Lewis Powell, another Virginian, was confirmed to the Supreme Court in Poff's place. In 1971, when under consideration for the Supreme Court, Poff said in a newspaper interview that he had supported the Southern Manifesto and opposed desegregation because he believed he would have otherwise been defeated for reelection to the U.S. House. He voiced regret over his opposition to past civil rights measures. Within a year of those comments, he resigned from the House to join the Virginia Supreme Court.Paul Vitello, \\"Ex-Supreme Court Pick Dies,\\" Laredo Morning Times, July 2, 2011, p. 11A Legislation Poff is also well known as one of the men who, as a member of the House Judiciary Committee, sponsored the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, better known as RICO. Poff had an interesting take on RICO, which has since been ignored by the Supreme Court. Poff stated in the Congressional Record that the Act should be used only against organizations, and not individuals. Supreme Court of Virginia Richard H. Poff went on to become Justice and then a Senior Justice of the Virginia Supreme Court, where he served until his retirement. He died on June 27, 2011, in a life care center in Tullahoma, Tennessee. Legacy The Richard H. Poff Federal Building in Roanoke, Virginia is named for Poff. It houses many of the primary federal offices in southwest Virginia, including the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia and the Internal Revenue Service.

The show was first broadcast to Europe on satellite and cable channel Sky Channel and later on Sky One and Sky Europe. The show was aired every weekday morning and afternoon (and in later years, at weekends), and throughout its life was home to a particularly large number of imported animated series. A separate version of The DJ Kat Show was later created for the United States where it was aired on stations affiliated with the Fox Broadcasting Company, including WNYW, Fox's flagship station. This article focuses primarily on the original European version. History The original European version was produced by John de Mol's production house John de Mol Produkties, which later became the world- famous Endemol. Linda de Mol is John de Mol's sister. All the linking material between the various cartoons was filmed in Hilversum, the Netherlands and written by Joost Timp. DJ Kat DJ Kat was a puppet with a black leather jacket who loved spinning his records. He also liked to eat junk from the trash cans. His favorite dish was a jar of peas and carrots mashed together and his favorite drink was milk in a dirty glass. In the intro of the show DJ Kat would say the following line: \\"This is the DJ Kat show and I am DJ Kat...that's my name. It's a D and a J and a Kat with a K.\\" The reason it is spelled with a K is because the Dutch spell cat with a k and Linda de Mol is Dutch. DJ Kat was originally performed by puppeteer Robert 'Robbie' Hahn. DJ Kat often claimed to be on a project for Millhouse. The Millhouse character is never shown on the show. British puppeteer Don Austen took over the character for a further 5 years (1989‚Äì95) for more than 2000 episodes on Sky One. The show picked up the PACE Satellite Award. The Linda de Mol/Steffanie Pitt/Catrina Hylton-Hull years (1986‚Äì1992) Linda de Mol was DJ Kat's side- kick when the series began in September 1986. Later she would also branch out into German TV and hosted more of Endemol's programmes, including the original Dutch version of Deal or No Deal. When Sky Channel decided to focus solely on broadcasting in the United Kingdom instead of Europe in early 1989, the production of the DJ Kat show moved from Hilversum to Blackbird Productions in London. Linda de Mol was unceremoniously dropped without much of an explanation. Her last episode (which was shot on location in Austria) was shown on Friday 3 February 1989. The next Monday, 6 February, Steffanie Pitt (aka \\"Steffie\\"), daughter of Hammer Horror star Ingrid Pitt, introduced herself as Linda's replacement. Another puppet character, a scouse mouse called 'Yummy Tickle Mouse' was also added to the programme. Steffie left on 8 September of the same year, ostensibly to join the fictional all-female band 'The Sweet Potatoes'. At this time, Robbie Hahn handed over the DJ Kat puppet to British puppeteer Don Austen (who was already employed by Sky as Wally Blubb The Walrus on their Fun Factory weekend morning show). Hahn swiftly rejoined Linda de Mol back in the Netherlands for the very similar TROS television programme De Billy Hotdog Show, the main differences being that the title character was a dog and the show broadcast only once a week. Catrina Hylton-Hull (aka \\"Treen\\"), stepdaughter of the late Rod Hull of Emu fame, after numerous auditions, made her first appearance on 11 September 1989. The DJ Kat show did sketches around this time in an attempt to save the flagging format of the series. Catrina Hylton-Hull lasted three years and proved quite popular with fans of the series initially, but with viewing figures falling Sky One came close to pulling the plug on the series. The acclaimed UK production/direction team of Patricia Mordecai, John Northover and Gale Claydon (who produced many series on ITV in the 1980s and 90s) were tasked with the job of creating a new look for the series, intended to begin in 1992. Catrina was initially contracted to continue as presenter with a \\"rotating\\" guest cast, but disagreements between her and the new production team about the direction of the new format saw her eventually opt to resign as presenter in mid-June 1992. Second incarnation (1992‚Äì1995) After Catrina Hylton-Hull left the show in 1992, the series was totally revamped, and an all-new studio set, theme tune and titles came into being. The revamped show aired for the first time on 13 July 1992 after a three-week gap (the show's cartoon line-up carried on as normal, but continuity was changed to a simple card reading \\"DJ Kat - on hols, back in ... weeks\\" at each advert break during this time). The regular co-presenters of the show's second incarnation were - initially - West End actor Simon Jermond and singer Marcelle Duprey (also known as \\"Marcie\\"), with Joe Greco as a stand-in host. Jermond left the series in July 1993 after just one year, having decided that TV presenting was not for him, and Joe Greco replaced him on a full-time basis until the series ended in 1995. Alison Way, Peter Corey, David 'Saint' Rubin and future British soap star Jacqueline Pirie were also regularly featured as \\"guest stars\\" in various guises. New \\"game\\" slots (including 'Katz Alley' and 'Joke Machine') were also introduced for viewers to phone in and compete in, with prizes up for grabs. The new format initially helped to revive the viewing figures with Don Austen, Joe Greco, and Marcelle Duprey continuing to perform through to 1995 with a now staggering output scriptwise. In September 1994, a Saturday spin-off show, 'KTV', was added to production, replacing Sky One's Fun Factory line-up. The new programme placed a greater emphasis on documentary-style features for kids and full-blown sketch parodies - most notably, the General Hospital spoof 'General Accident' and EastEnders take-off 'Arthur Square', both of which saw a then-unknown Jacqueline Pirie putting her acting talents (and flair for adopting English accents) to good use. A low-key Sunday DJ Kat Show was also eventually produced, featuring DJ Kat and usually just Joe Greco presenting. Cancellation (1995) By 1995, viewing figures had begun to fall once again, at which point series editor Michelle Kimber, writers Peter Corey and Dave Arthur, director John Northover and production team Patricia Mordecai, Michael Kerrigan and Gale Claydon reported that they all felt the series had now run its course; in August 1995 chief producers David Drewery and Paul Cole announced that they had decided against both revamping the format for a second time and re-commissioning the series, and Sky One announced that series would be cancelled at the end of the year. John Northover has since cited that the main reason for the falling viewing figures was largely due to the fact that series writers had simply run out of ideas for new scripts and had begun recycling old ones. The final episode was aired on 31 December 1995 and replaced in January 1996 by a short-lived new breakfast TV series, Boiled Egg & Soldiers, which struggled to gain a foothold. =American version= An American version of The DJ Kat Show debuted on WNYW in New York City on 28 November 1987. The series, which was set against the backdrop of a makeshift clubhouse in the basement of the television station, had the wisecracking cat puppet and his comedy assistant, Elizabeth Rose, reading viewers mail and engaging in comedy skits in between reruns of Woody Woodpecker and Looney Tunes movie cartoons. DJ Kat always wanted to be \\"the star\\" and did everything to convince \\"the boss\\" (TV station owners) that he was the \\"biggest star\\" of the TV station. Comic actor and puppeteer Jim Martin created the American version, manipulated, and voiced the \\"DJ Kat\\" character. Steve Howard was the producer who also contributed to the writing. The wrap-arounds were story- arc'd. As time went on, the cartoons were edited to allow room for more live- action. Martin and Rose would leave the series and entertainer/songwriter/scriptwriter and puppeteer Craig Marin and comic actress and mimic Carmen De La Paz would succeed The previous pair as the series' second and last hosts/performers. The DJ Kat Show was seen on Saturday mornings until Saturday 26 December 1987, shifting to a Sunday morning timeslot starting on 3 January 1988. The cartoons were dropped and the programs focused on stories that had DJ and \\"Jennifer Davis\\" (De La Paz) trying to host the show despite problems created by their stingy and mean boss \\"Mr. Midas G. Merkle\\" and other troublemakers. The DJ Kat Show would remain on WNYW until 24 December 1988. DJ and the other Flexitoon puppets would be seen in wraparound segments during the station's weekday afternoon cartoon programming from then until March 1991 (around the time the Fox Kids Network launched on weekdays).

It was first published in Canada by HarperCollins Publishers in 2001. Plot introduction Compared to Findley's other work, Spadework takes a lighter, more straightforward turn ‚Äî which does not mean it is simple-minded. The complexity lies in the everyday drama of human relationships, enhanced by the intensity of the theater atmosphere and the ambition of young actors at a crossroads that may lead to a brilliant career or mediocre success. A cut telephone wire points to failed communication and sets off a series of events that irreversibly shape the lives of the principal characters. These events force the protagonists to re-examine their sexuality and their loyalties at the face of temptation. Plot summary The novel centers on the story of a few summer months in 1998 in Stratford, Ontario against the backdrop of the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal. The novel is told by a third-person narrator, who selectively changes from the point of view of one character to another, but it is Jane Kincaid, a property maker for the Stratford Shakespeare Festival, whose perspective dominates throughout. Jane Kincaid is an immigrant from the United States, more specifically from a quintessentially southern town somewhere in Louisiana, aptly called Plantation. She left the United States to begin a new life as an artist, in essence, to escape her family (which nonetheless provides her with a modest but stable income from an inheritance)‚Äîshe even shed her birth-name Aura Lee Terry when she met her husband Griffin, an up-and-coming young Shakespearean actor. The two lead an entirely ordinary, reasonably happy suburban existence, with a seven-year-old son (Will), a dog (Rudyard) and a housekeeper/nanny (Mercy Bowman). But even in the beginning, the neat threads of this ordinary life begin to unravel around the attractive and ambitious young theater talent Griffin. His personal beauty and desirability lead Jane to suspect that other women, specifically Griffin's stage partner Zo√´ Walker, 21 and herself a stunning figure, may be after him. Much of what follows in some way hinges upon Griffin's personal attractiveness, although many other things happen that also put pressure on Jane's youthful obliviousness to the world's cruelty and proclivity to cause pain even in the moments of greatest happiness. Troy Preston, an old high-school boyfriend, serves as harbinger of this pain: he shows up out of the blue, having pilfered his talents and lost his promise, and sexually assaults Jane, ejaculating on her dress and face. A few hours later Jane hears that he has died in a car accident. While this episode haunts her throughout the narrative, she never speaks about it to anyone, not even her psychiatrist. The town is also menaced by a rape-murderer, who kills two women before he kills himself with an overdose of drugs. Furthermore, Jane receives a strangely aloof letter from her mother telling her that her sister Loretta has committed suicide. Failed communication between people intensely close to each other is at the core of the quotidian tragedies that unfold in this novel. A telephone line cut by the spade of an over-eager gardener serves as the physical manifestation or symbol for this failure to connect. This cut telephone line (which seems as anachronistic as the letter from the mother in an age of email, short messages and mobile phones) prevents two crucial phone calls: one from Griffin to his director Jonathan Crawford and one from Jesse Quinlan to his nephew Luke, the gardener who cut the phone line and his anchor in life. Jesse seeks help and when he fails to reach Luke in that crucial moment, he descends further into drugs and becomes a stranger to himself, a rapist and murderer. Griffin was to give Jonathan an answer to his ultimatum either to begin a sexual affair with him or to lose his chances for the desired break-through in his acting career. Soon after, Griffin is informed that he will not get the coveted lead roles in the next season, which devastates him and leads him to agree to another meeting with Jonathan. Finally, Griffin gives in to his ambition and Jonathan's advances which are somehow more sophisticated, as the narrator points out, than the usual sleazy proposals to enter stardom through the gate of sexual favors. Jonathan, who thinks of himself as \\"a sculptor of talent\\" (128) genuinely desires Griffin and there is an element of pedagogical eros in their relationship; the older man sincerely believes that Griffin will grow as a man and as an actor if he submits to his power: \\"I want to teach you how to accept the fact of being desired\\" (139). Griffin does submit and he does leave his family ‚Äì without explanation. Jane is the last to find out that Griffin's affair is not with a younger woman but with an older man. Jane develops her own overpowering desires that are quite independent from Griffin's escapades: when the telephone repairman, Milos Saworski, a Polish immigrant with limited command of English, enters her house, she is completely overwhelmed by what she experiences as his unearthly beauty. When Griffin leaves, her pursuit of the \\"angel-man\\" becomes more determined and she becomes a living contradiction to Jonathan's assessment of women as sexually mostly passive and incapable of such aggressive pursuit. She asks Milos, himself married and a young father of a dying infant, to model for her in the nude, a proposal which he accepts with knowing innocence and an entirely masculine submission that mirrors the scene between Jonathan and Griffin. Jane's gaze upon Milos' beauty exactly parallels Jonathan's desire for Griffin. While sexual desires unravel families and love relationships in this novel, it is the love between fathers and sons that disrupts these momentarily beautiful but cruel and ultimately destructive desires. Griffin's precocious son Will is estranged from both of his parents; Milos' baby eventually dies because of his father's inaction (his wife has kept the newborn baby out of the reach of doctors for religious reasons); Jonathan's son, twenty one and full of promise, is killed by revolutionaries in Peru. The news of this murder is brought by Jonathan's former wife in person and it leads him to see that the affair with him is just as wrong for Griffin as his own marriage had been for himself; he releases Griffin and sends him back to his family. A few months later, in April, the novel comes back to Jane, Griffin and Will, a happy family unit watching a procession of Swans released from their winter domicile indoors. With the help of her mother's money, Jane has bought the house and made it the home she desired. The novel has come full circle to the peacefulness of the beginning, but this renewed peacefulness seems less precarious because it has been tempered by essential conflict and near break-up. The novel thus ends on a surprisingly hopeful note with a vision of spring and new life.

The following is a list of surface water sports. These are sports which are performed atop a body of water. Towed water sports Environmental impact includes noise, pollutants, shoreline degradation, and disturbance and dislocation of wildlife, and the governing body, the International Waterski & Wakeboard Federation (IWWF) has been acting to reduce this impact. The IWWF also governs the related sports of barefoot skiing, cable skiing, cable wakeboard, disabled ski, racing, show ski, water skiing, and wakesurfing. =Skurfing= A skurfer Skurfing is a surface water sport in which the participant is towed on a surfboard, behind a boat, with a ski rope. It is not a professional sport and has no competitions; it is a freestyle sport with a highly individualistic style and form. =Tubing= Two tubers Tubing, also known as biscuiting, is where a large circular rubber tube is towed behind a boat at fast speeds. The general aim is to hold on as long as possible without falling off due to the boat's sharp turns; more experienced biscuiters also try to jump the boat's wake and become airborne. =Wake sports= Wake sports are sports that involves riding a wake while being towed by a motorboat, personal watercraft, close-course cable systems, ski lifts, winches or a crane,Red Bull Wake Crane Pula at speeds of between 30 and 40 mph. Kneeboarding Kneeboarding is an aquatic sport where the participant is towed kneeling on a buoyant, convex, and hydrodynamically shaped board at a planing speed, most often behind a motorboat. Wakeboarding In wakeboarding, the participant is towed standing on a small board, riding a wake produced by the towing boat, and attempts to do tricks. Events are organized by the World Wakeboarding Association. A special wakeboard boat has a wakeboard tower, which places the pull point higher above water's surface which makes it easier to jump. Wakeboarding boats have a ballast system that pumps water into tanks to increase displacement, and enlarge the wake. Wakeskating Wakeskating is an adaptation of wakeboarding that employs a similar design of board manufactured from maple or fibreglass. Unlike wakeboarding, the rider is not bound to the board in any way, similar to the skateboard, from which the name derives. Wakesurfing Wakesurfing differs from other wake sports in that the boat does not tow a rider (continuously). The rider uses a tow rope to help them get up in the wake. After doing so, they drop the rope and then ride the wake as they would when surfing. =Water skiing= Slalom water skiing Water skiing is an aquatic sport and recreational activity and is popular in many countries around the world where appropriate conditions exist - an expanse of water unaffected by wave motion. Rivers, lakes, and sheltered bays are all popular for water skiing. Standard water skis were originally made of wood but now are usually constructed out of fibreglass-based composites. They are of similar length to downhill snow skis but are somewhat wider. Instead of a rigid binding, they have rubber molded binding, in which the skier's feet are placed. Skiers are pulled along by a rope with a handle fitted at one end and attached to a powerboat at the other. Boardsports Boardsports are sports that are played with some sort of board as the primary equipment. The following aquatic boardsports are those that are not towed behind a boat: =Bodyboarding= A bodyboarding competition in Las Palmas in 2010 A bodyboard is an instrument of wave riding consisting of a small roughly rectangular piece of foam, shaped to a hydrodynamic form. The bodyboard is ridden predominantly lying down, (or 'prone'). It can also be ridden in a half-standing stance (known as 'dropknee') or can even be ridden standing up. =Flowriding= Flowriding, also known as flowboarding, is a late-20th century alternative boardsport incorporating elements of surfing, bodyboarding, skateboarding, skimboarding, snowboarding and wakeboarding. Flowriding takes place on an artificial wave machine, called the FlowRider or the FlowBarrel, created by Wave Loch. =Kite sports= A kitesurfer in the Columbia River Gorge Kiteboarding Kiteboarding, also known as kitesurfing, and sometimes as flysurfing, involves using a power kite to pull a small surfboard with bindings. Snowkiting Snowkiting, also known as kite skiing, uses kite power to glide on snow, ice or a frozen lake. =Paddleboarding= Paddleboarding is an activity in which a person paddles a long streamlined surfboard with their hands. This is done while laying or kneeling on the board. Paddleboards are raced throughout the world. Valencia region Standup paddleboarding Standup paddleboarding (SUP), also known as standup paddle surfing, is a water sport born from surfing with modern roots in Hawaii. Stand up paddle boarders stand on boards that are floating on the water, and use a paddle to propel themselves through the water. =Riverboarding= In riverboarding, also known as hydrospeed or white-water sledging, the participant lies prone on their board with fins on their feet for propulsion and steering. Skimboarding =Skimboarding= Skimboarding is a boardsport which involves riding a skimboard either on an outgoing wave, or in shallow water, where instead of going for waves the rider may attempt to ride a rail or do \\"tech\\" tricks. =Surfing= A surfer performing a late drop at a Mavericks, California surfing competition in 2010 Surfing is a recreational activity in which individuals paddle into a wave on a surfboard, jump to their feet, and are propelled across the water by the force of the wave. Surfing's appeal probably derives from an unusual confluence of elements: adrenaline, skill, and high paced maneuvering are set against a naturally unpredictable backdrop‚Äîan organic environment that is, by turns, graceful and serene, violent and formidable. =Windsurfing= Windsurfing is a sport involving travel over water on a small 2‚Äì4.7 metre board powered by wind acting on a single sail. The sail is connected to the board by a flexible joint. The sport is a hybrid between sailing and surfing. The sail board might be considered the most minimalistic version of the modern sailboat, with the major exception that steering is accomplished by the rider tilting the mast and sail or, when planing, carving the board, rather than with a rudder.  Other  =Bodysurfing= Bodysurfing in La Jolla, California Bodysurfing is the art and sport of riding a wave without the assistance of any buoyant device such as a surfboard or bodyboard. Bodysurfers typically equip themselves only with a pair of specialized swimfins that stay on during turbulent conditions and optimize propulsion. =Hydrofoil sailing= This recent development in the high-speed sailing arena has evolved most in the International Moth class of racing dinghy. These boats have a \\"T\\" shaped rudder and centreboard that generates sufficient lift to clear the hull from the water. When this happens wetted surface area drops radically and the boats accelerate up to 1.2 to 1.5 times the speed of the prevailing wind. These boats are very light (all up weight is less than 40 kg) and very fast, They hydrofoil in as little as of breeze (\\"sit on the deck breeze\\" for most dinghy classes). The top recorded speed is about 50 km/hour, and speeds of 40 km/hour are common in the class.

See the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report, below, for a description of the method. Toxicants, after they have been taken up by the organism and reached the target site, are assumed to affect one or more metabolic processes as specified in dynamic energy budget theory. Examples of such processes are the costs for maintenance, assimilation of energy from food, costs for producing somatic tissues, costs for the production of offspring, and hazards to the developing embryo. A change in a single metabolic process has particular consequences for both growth and reproduction of the organism. Therefore, the specific pattern of growth and reproduction over time provides information about the affected process. In this way, the DEBtox method can be used to explain observed effect patterns over time, as well as the links between effects on body size and reproduction. A key concept in this method is the determination of the no effect concentration. The DEBtox method is able to extract this parameter efficiently from experimental data by making use of knowledge of how effects will show up in the data if they would be present. Not all details of the DEB theory are used in this method; effects on survival as specified by the hazard model hardly uses any detail of the DEB theory, for instance, but is fully consistent with how DEB theory deals with aging as a result of the effects of free radicals.

It was first published (as Britva) in the expatriate Russian literary magazine Rul' in 1926, but a French translation did not appear until 1991, and an English one (by Dmitri Nabokov, the writer's son) not until 1995.  Plot summary  Ivanov, an exiled Russian and former military officer living in Berlin, has taken up employment as a barber; an apt position, Nabokov notes, as Ivanov's sharp facial appearance had earned him the nickname \\"Razor\\" in his earlier life. On a hot day, an unnamed character dressed largely in black enters the barber's, deserted save for Ivanov, and requests a shave. Ivanov quickly realises that the customer is a fellow Russian who, the reader gathers, tortured Ivanov during Russia's period of revolutionary upheaval. With the unnamed character sitting in the chair, his face lathered with shaving cream, Ivanov reminds him of their last encounter. Ivanov then proceeds begins to shave him, recounting their previous meeting while also strongly hinting at the effect that one slip of the razor could have. The reader half expects Ivanov to exact his revenge. But having told his story, Ivanov relents and the terrified and clean-shaven Soviet flees from the barber's.  Themes  While only four pages long in the Penguin paperback edition (1997) of Nabokov's Collected Stories, the story touches upon many of the issues woven into Nabokov's longer works - the importance of an individual's freedom of action and thought, for instance, or the value of observing the life's particular details. These issues are merged and illuminated through the prism of an even more important theme for Nabokov, that of the destruction of his Russian homeland by the Soviet Revolution. Countless numbers of his output evince a livid bitterness not only towards the revolution, but the succeeding ideology of the Communist empire - its police control, its suppression of personal freedoms, its attempts to rein in individual thought. Any character who dares support or favour Communism receives short shrift in Nabokov's work, and while not being a Communist could never be enough to guarantee a character a saintly status, it will save him or her from his withering disdain. In \\"Razor\\" this contrast shapes Nabokov's entire characterisation. Ivanov, who made an \\"epic escape\\" from the revolution, is a positive figure, while the unnamed Soviet is viewed with immediate contempt. This contrast is most obviously developed in the plot itself. The one-time brutality of the Soviet is strongly suggested by his (past) actions. Ivanov, in contrast, refuses to descend to the methods of his former torturers. Having briefly raised the possibility of torture, enough to terrify the Soviet without inflicting lasting damage, Ivanov stops there. The razor does not slit open the Soviet's throbbing carotid. Cruelty does not beget further cruelty. Ivanov's melancholic realisation is that the pain of the past loss (not only the personal pain inflicted on him but the fact that \\"his vast, noble, splendid homeland had been ruined by some dull buffoon\\") will not be eradicated by revenge - Ivanov may not gain his physical retribution but he is assured of his moral superiority. Nabokov employs a number of other techniques and themes to reinforce this contrast. For example, the characters' appearances. Ivanov's face is angular, almost harsh in its perspective: \\"nose sharp as a draftsman's triangle; chin sturdy as an elbow\\". Whereas Nabokov emphasises the roundness of the Soviet: \\"A puffy face ... with a plump mole by the right lobe of the nose.\\" Ivanov applies lather to \\"the man's cheeks, rounded chin and upper lip.\\" His eyes are \\"glittering little wheels\\". Later the Soviet's visage descends to being described as an \\"eyeless, fat face\\". Nabokov continues to express his scorn for the Soviet, indicating how he is a figure easily manipulated by others; the inability of a character to express his free will is a considerable crime for Nabokov. So not only does the reader observe that the Soviet's every emotion at the whim of Ivanov (\\"when he pressed the flat surface of the razor to the man's neck, his entire body twitched\\") but in the final paragraph, Ivanov seems to be able to control his foe physically. Petrified by the possibility of revenge being meted out, the Soviet cannot move until Ivanov commands it of him. Having done that the Russian barber \\"clapped the bowler on his head, thrust the briefcase under his arm, and swivelled him toward the door.\\" On leaving the barber's, descriptions of the Soviet further emphasise his robotic demeanour. Eyes completely shut, \\"he stepped like an automaton\\", \\"with the same mechanical gait\\" and \\"with an outstretched petrified hand\\". Each of these descriptions demonstrate the Soviet as being a non-individual, without free will, who can be manipulated and controlled by others. The political subtext of Nabokov's characterisation - communists simply follow the herd rather than think for themselves - becomes clearer. The theme of expression or rejection of individual choice Nabokov articulates in other ways. It is of course entirely deliberate that the Soviet is nameless, the name being a vital part of personal identity. Ivanov, on the other hand, has both an official name and a charismatic nickname. A more subtle but perhaps fundamental aspect to Nabokov's delineation of his characters is that while Ivanov, spiritually free, escapes the view of others, the Soviet is already trapped under the others' gaze. How their faces and appearances are revealed to others becomes a defining characteristic of their personalities. The reader is told at the very start that Razor lacks a facade, and when acquaintances tried to recall his appearance they \\"could only imagine him in profile\\". Whereas as soon as the Soviet enters the barber, \\"the newcomer's reflection appeared in all the mirrors at once, in profile, three- quarter-face, and shown the waxen bald spot in back\\". The point is more subtle but important nevertheless - the free man escapes the view of others while the man who denies that freedom is forever trapped in the gaze of other people.  Use of detail and colour  Detail and colour have a strong aesthetic effect in Nabokov's work, offering sharp reminders to both reader and character of the joy to be obtained from observation, however fleeting, of the world around them. Before the Soviet arrives, Ivanov observes \\"the glittering wheels of cars that left ribbon-like imprints on the heat-softened asphalt, resembling the ornate lacework of snakes.\\" This and others are part of a joyous, seemingly childlike vision, in which inanimate objects are often anthropomorphised. The Soviet's reflection in the mirror showed that same \\"waxen bald spot ... from which the bowler hat had ascended to snag a hat hook\\". Once again, it is Ivanov who is rewarded with this joyous skill of observation, watching the passersby and cars, and then inside noting the \\"marble surfaces aglitter with green and gold scent bottles\\". The Soviet says and sees little in the story, another contrast that emphasises where the author's affections lie. But this is not quite aestheticism for the sake of it - they are not extraneous things but are observations that shape and determine Ivanov's world. The barber notices the glittering wheels of the cars; a few minutes later he notices the Soviet's \\"minuscule eyes that glittered like the tiny wheels of a watch movement\\". The repetition of the glittering wheels motif is not a coincidence but reflects, however lightly, Ivanov's chain of thought; just as the wheels have left their impression on the asphalt, so the Soviet snake has left his imprint on Ivanov.

The car with the highest total score would be the winner. The programme launched with the concept that the presenters should interact with each other rather than present items on their own, as was then the case on Top Gear. The first series also featured a \\"headquarters\\", a racing team truck, set on a former USAF base (Mildenhall, Suffolk) at which cars were put through their paces. These concepts resurfaced in the reborn Top Gear soon after. Originally presented by Mike Brewer, James May and Jason Barlow, subsequent series also featured the rally driver Penny Mallory and the racing driver Jason Plato. During the show's run, both May and Barlow left the show to join the old format of BBC's Top Gear. Following the creation of Fifth Gear and the revival of Top Gear, Driven was cancelled by Channel 4 in 2002. Plato went on to present Fifth Gear, May joined the newly relaunched Top Gear, Brewer presented ITV's Pulling Power and Mallory could be seen on ITV4's Used Car Roadshow.

Whereas western blot uses an antibody probe to detect a protein of interest, far-western blot uses a non-antibody probe which can bind the protein of interest. Thus, whereas western blotting is used for the detection of certain proteins, far-western blotting is employed to detect protein/protein interactions.  Method  In conventional western blot, gel electrophoresis is used to separate proteins from a sample; these proteins are then transferred to a membrane in a 'blotting' step. In a western blot, specific proteins are then identified using an antibody probe. Far-western blot employs non-antibody proteins to probe the protein(s) of interest on the blot. In this way, binding partners of the probe (or the blotted) protein may be identified. The probe protein is often produced in E. coli using an expression cloning vector. The probe protein can then be visualized through the usual methods -- it may be radiolabelled; it may bear a specific affinity tag like His or FLAG for which antibodies exist; or there may be a protein specific antibody (to the probe protein). Because cell extracts are usually completely denatured by boiling in detergent before gel electrophoresis, this approach is most useful for detecting interactions that do not require the native folded structure of the protein of interest.

It is a colorless solid. It is an important member of the cyanocarbons. Synthesis and reactions TCNE is prepared by brominating malononitrile in the presence of potassium bromide to give the KBr-complex, and dehalogenating with copper. Oxidation of TCNE with hydrogen peroxide gives the corresponding epoxide, which has unusual properties. Redox chemistry TCNE is often used as an electron acceptor. Cyano groups have low energy œÄ* orbitals, and the presence of four such groups, with their œÄ systems (conjugated) to the central C=C double bond, gives rise to an electrophilic alkene.

It dates back to the seventh century and is considered to be the most important temple in the city after the Jokhang Temple. Situated in the northwestern part of the Tibetan capital, it is east of the Potala and north of the Jokhang.Dowman, Keith. 1988. The Power-Places of Central Tibet: The Pilgrim's Guide, p. 59. Routledge & Kegan Paul. London. (ppk). The site occupies an area of 4,000 square meters (almost one acre). History Ramoche is considered to be the sister temple to the Jokhang which was completed about the same time. Tradition says that it was built originally to house the much revered Jowo Rinpoche statue, carried to Lhasa via Lhagang in a wooden cart, brought to Tibet when Princess Wencheng came to Lhasa. Unlike, the Jokhang, Ramoche was originally built in Chinese style. During Mangsong Mangtsen's reign (649-676), because of a threat that the Tang Chinese might invade, Princess Wencheng is said to have had the statue of Jowo Rinpoche hidden in a secret chamber in the Jokhang. Princess Jincheng, sometime after 710 CE, had it placed in the central chapel of the Jokhang. It was replaced at Ramoche by a statue of Jowo Mikyo Dorje, a small bronze statue of the Buddha when he was eight years old, crafted by Vishvakarman, and brought to Lhasa by the Nepalese queen, Bhrikuti. It was badly damaged by the Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution.Dorje (1999), p. 92.Tibet (6th edition), p. 104. (2005) Bradley Mayhew and Michael Kohn. Lonely Planet. . The temple was badly damaged during the Mongol invasions and there is no certainty that the statue that remained in 1959 was the original one. The original temple was destroyed by fire, and the present three-storied building was constructed in 1474. Soon after it became the Assembly Hall of the Gyuto Tratsang, or Upper Tantric College of Lhasa and was home to 500 monks. There was a close connection with Yerpa which provided summer quarters for the monks.Dorje (1999), pp. 92-93. Jowo Mikyoe Dorje of the Ramoche Temple Destruction and restoration Entrance to Ramoche Temple The temple was gutted by fire and destroyed in the 1959 Lhasa uprising against Chinese occupation and the bronze statue disappeared. In 1983 the lower part of it was said to have been found in a Lhasa rubbish tip, and the upper half in Beijing.Tsering Gonkatsang and Michael Willis, \\"The Ra Mo Che Temple, Lhasa, and the Image of Mi bsKyod rDo rJe: The Narrative of Ri ‚ÄòBur sPrul sKu,\\" Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 19.1 (2009), pp 41-57 for an account of the recovery and restoration.

Thanks to the efforts of Ri ‚Äòbur sprul sku, the parts were joined in the Ramoche Temple, which was partially restored in 1986, yet still showed damage in 1993. A major restoration was undertaken in 1986 and the temple now has three stories. Near the main entrance to the building are ten pillars displaying local relics and symbols such as lotus flowers, jewellery, coiling clouds and Tibetan characters. The first floor has an atrium off which opens a scripture hall and the winding corridors of a Buddha palace. The second floor is mainly residential but has a chapel with an image of Buddha as King of the Nagas, and the third floor provides sleeping quarters reserved for the use of the Dalai Lama.Dorje (1999), p. 93.

Early life Malmkvist was born in Landskrona, Sk√•ne County, Sweden, the youngest child of Sigrid and Albert Malmkvist. She had eight siblings, and her early childhood was marked by World War 2; although Sweden was a neutral country, the risk of invasion was felt acutely in Landskrona, located only 22km from the Danish capital on the other side of √ñresund. Albert Malmkvist was called up as a soldier. Career In 1955, the 18-yar-old Malmkvist won a talent show, which resulted in her being hired as a singer by Arne Domn√©rus. Her first recording, Tweedle Dee, was released in the same year. She was signed by the record company Metronome in 1958, being touted as the new Alice Babs, and in 1959 she became a TV host, in the entertainment Stora Famnen created by Lennart Hyland. Having had some 40 hits on Swedish radio chart Svensktoppen and 20 on the German singles chart, she has altogether recorded about 600 songs (and has made recordings in ten different languages: Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Finnish, Dutch, German, English, French, Italian and Spanish) throughout the past five decades, which makes her one of the most productive and successful Swedish female singers. As an actor, Malmkvist has performed in stage plays, musicals and in films. She played Pippi Longstocking in the popular children musical production of Astrid Lindgren's Pippi Longstocking in 1980, appeared in the musical version of Some Like It Hot (see Sugar) and she played the part of Luisa in the original Swedish ‚Äì and European ‚Äì production of Maury Yeston's musical Nine in 1983. In 2002, she appeared as the Mother in Hasse Alfredson's stage play Lille Ronny at Maximteatern. Together with actor Thorsten Flinck, she recorded a popular Swedish cover of Nick Cave/Kylie Minogue's 1995 hit \\"Where the Wild Roses Grow\\". In 2008 and 2009, she played the part of Fr√§ulein Schneider in the musical Cabaret at Stockholms Stadsteater, directed by Colin Nutley. Siw Malmkvist and Lee Hazlewood in 1968 Malmkvist has been a contestant in the Swedish Melodifestivalen, which is the qualifying contest for the Eurovision Song Contest, as well as at the European event, several times. She represented Sweden at the Eurovision Song Contest 1960 in London with \\"Alla andra f√•r varann\\". In the following year Malmkvist sang \\"April, april\\" together with Gunnar Wiklund at that year's Melodifestivalen; the song won, and was performed by Barbro \\"Lill-Babs\\" Svensson as the Swedish representative at the international Contest, held in Cannes. At the Eurovision Song Contest 1969 in Madrid, Malmkvist sang the West German entry \\"Primaballerina\\", which finished in the 9th place. She performed the song \\"C'est la vie\\" together with Towa Carson and Ann-Louise Hanson, at Melodifestivalen 2004. Malmkvist was supposed to be a celebrity dancer in Let's Dance 2020 on TV4, but because of the coronavirus restrictions she could not participate.

Gurnee & Crystal Lake, Illinois Regimen alternatives The main alternatives for ovulation induction medications are: *Antiestrogen, causing an inhibition of the negative feedback of estrogen on the pituitary gland, resulting in an increase in secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone. Medications in use for this effect are mainly clomifene citrate and tamoxifen (both being selective estrogen-receptor modulators), as well as letrozole (an aromatase inhibitor. *Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), directly stimulating the ovaries. In women with anovulation, it may be an alternative after 7 - 12 attempted cycles of antiestrogens (as evidenced by clomifene citrate), since the latter ones are less expensive and more easy to control. =Antiestrogens= Hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìgonadal axis in females, with estrogen exerting mainly negative feedback on FSH secretion from the pituitary gland. Clomifene citrate Clomifene citrate (or clomid) is the medication which is most commonly used to treat anovulation. It is a selective estrogen-receptor modulator, affecting the hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìgonadal axis to respond as if there was an estrogen deficit in the body, in effect increasing the production of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). It is relatively easy and convenient to use. Clomifene appears to inhibit estrogen receptors in hypothalamus, thereby inhibiting negative feedback of estrogen on FSH production.DrugBank > Clomifene. Updated on April 19, 2011 It may also result in direct stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. It also has an effect on cervical mucus quality and uterine mucosa, which might affect sperm penetration and survival, hence its early administration during the menstrual cycle. Clomifene citrate is a very efficient ovulation inductor, and has a success rate of 67%. Nevertheless, it only has a 37% success rate in inducing pregnancy. This difference may be due to the anti-estrogenic effect which clomifene citrate has on the endometrium, cervical mucus, uterine blood flow, as well as the resulting decrease in the motility of the fallopian tubes and the maturation of the oocytes. Letrozole Letrozole has been used for ovarian stimulation by fertility doctors since 2001 because it has fewer side-effects than clomiphene and less chance of multiple gestation. A study of 150 babies following treatment with letrozole or letrozole and follicle-stimulating hormone presented at the American Society of Reproductive Medicine 2005 Conference found no difference in overall abnormalities but did find a significantly higher rate of locomotor and cardiac abnormalities among the group having taken letrozole compared to natural conception. A larger, follow- up study with 911 babies compared those born following treatment with letrozole to those born following treatment with clomiphene. That study also found no significant difference in the rate of overall abnormalities, but found that congenital cardiac anomalies was significantly higher in the clomiphene group compared to the letrozole group. Tamoxifen Tamoxifen affects estrogen receptors in a similar fashion as clomifene citrate. It is often used in the prevention and treatment of breast cancer. It can therefore also be used to treat patients that have a reaction to clomifene citrate. =Follicle-stimulating hormone= Preparations of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) mainly include those derived from the urine of menopausal women, as well as recombinant preparations. The recombinant preparations are more pure and more easily administered, but they are more expensive. The urinary preparations are equally effective and less expensive, but are not as convenient to administer as they are available in vials versus injection pens. =GnRH pump= The gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pump is used to release doses of GnRH in a pulsatile fashion. This hormone is synthesised by the hypothalamus and induces the secretion of FSH by the pituitary. GnRH must be delivered in a pulsatile fashion to imitate the random secretion of the hypothalamus in order to fool the pituitary into secreting LH and FSH. The GnRH pump is the size of a cigarette box and has a small catheter. Unlike other treatments, using the GnRH pump doesn‚Äôt usually lead to multiple pregnancies. Filicori from the University of Bologna suggests that this might be because gonadotrophins are absent when the treatment is initiated, and therefore the hormones released by the pituitary (LH and FSH) can still take part in the retro-control of gonadotrophin secretion, mimicking the natural cycle. This treatment can also be used for underweight and/or anorexic patients; it has also been used in certain cases of hyperprolactimenia. =National and regional usage= In the Nordic countries, letrozole is practically the standard initial regimen used for ovulation induction, since no formulation of clomifene is registered for use there. India banned the usage of letrozole in 2011, citing potential risks to infants. In 2012, an Indian parliamentary committee said that the drug controller office colluded with letrozole's makers to approve the drug for infertility in India. Technique Although there are many possible additional diagnostic and interventional techniques, protocols for ovulation induction generally consist of: *Determining the first day of the last menstruation, which is termed day 1. In case of amenorrhea, a period can be induced by intake of an oral progestin for 10 days. *Daily administration of the ovulation induction regimen, starting on day 3, 4, or 5, Topic last updated: Aug 01, 2017 and it is usually taken for 5 days. Topic last updated: Sep 17, 2018. *Sexual intercourse or artificial insemination by the time of ovulation. =Ultrasonography= Pregnancy rates in ovulation induction when using antiestrogens, as functions of the size of the leading follicle as measured by transvaginal ultrasonography at days 11 - 13 (bottom scale), as well as the thickness of the endometrial lining (4 different curves). During ovulation induction, it is recommended to start at a low dose and monitor the ovarian response with transvaginal ultrasound, including discernment of the number of developing follicles. Initial exam is most commonly started 4‚Äì6 days after last pill. Serial transvaginal ultrasound can reveal the size and number of developing follicles. It can also provide presumptive evidence of ovulation such as sudden collapse of the preovulatory follicle, and an increase in fluid volume in the rectouterine pouch. After ovulation, it may reveal signs of luteinization such as loss of clearly defined follicular margins and appearance of internal echoes. Supernumerary follicles A cycle with supernumerary follicles is usually defined as one where there are more than two follicles >16 mm in diameter. It is generally recommended to have such cycles cancelled because of the risk of multiple pregnancy (see also the \\"Risks and side effects\\" section below). In cancelled cycles, the woman or couple should be warned of the risks in case of supernumerary follicles, and should avoid sexual intercourse or use contraception until the next menstruation. Induction of final maturation (such as done with hCG) may need to be withheld because of increased risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome(OHSS). The starting dose of the inducing drug should be reduced in the next cycle. Alternatives to cancelling a cycle are mainly: *Aspiration of supernumerary follicles until one or two remain. *Converting the protocol to IVF treatment with embryo transfer of up to two embryos only. *Selective fetal reduction. This alternative confers a high risk of complications. *Proceeding with any multiple pregnancy without fetal reduction, with the ensuing risk of complications. This alternative is not recommended. =Lab tests= The following laboratory tests may be used to monitor induced cycles: *Serum estradiol levels, starting 4‚Äì6 days after last pill *Post-coital test 1‚Äì3 days before ovulation to check whether there are at least 5 progressive sperm per HPF *Adequacy of LH surge by urine LH surge tests 3 to 4 days after last clomifene pill *Mid-luteal progesterone, with at least 10 ng/ml 7‚Äì9 days after ovulation being regarded as adequate. =Final maturation induction= Final maturation induction and release, such as by human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG or hCG) or recombinant luteinizing hormone (rLH), results in a predictable time of ovulation, with the interval from drug administration to ovulation depending on the type of drug. This avails for sexual intercourse or intrauterine insemination (IUI) to conviently be scheduled at ovulation, the most likely time to achieve pregnancy.IVF.com > Ovulation Induction Retrieved on Mars 7, 2010 As evidenced by clomifene-induced cycles, however, triggering oocyte release has been shown to decrease pregnancy chances compared to frequent monitoring with LH surge tests. Therefore, in such cases, triggering oocyte release is best reserved for women who require IUI and in whom LH monitoring proves difficult or unreliable. It may also be used when LH monitoring hasn't shown an LH surge by cycle day 18 (where cycle day 1 is the first day of the preseding menstruation) and there is an ovarian follicle of over 20 mm in size.Clomiphene Citrate, Clomid . By Robert B. McWilliams. The Center for Reproduction and Women's Health Care, Houston, Texas. Retrieved May 2014 =Repeat cycles= Ovulation induction can be repeated every menstrual cycle. For clomifene, the dosage may be increased by 50-mg increments in subsequent cycles until ovulation is achieved.Medications for Inducing Ovulation from American Society for Reproductive Medicine. Revised 2012. However, at a dosage of 200 mg, further increments are unlikely to increase pregnancy chances. It is not recommended by the manufacturer of clomifene to use it for more than 6 consecutive cycles. In women with anovulation, 7 - 12 attempted cycles of pituitary feedback regimens (as evidenced by clomifene citrate) are recommended before switching to gonadotrophins, since the latter ones are more expensive and less easy to control. It is no longer recommended to perform an ultrasound examination to exclude any significant residual ovarian enlargement before each new treatment cycle. Risks and side effects Ultrasound and regular hormone checks mitigate risks throughout the process. However, there are still some risks with the procedure. Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) occurs in 5-10% of cases.Ovulation Induction Risks and Overview Symptoms depend on whether the case is mild, moderate, or severe, and can range from bloating and nausea, through to shortness of breathe, pleural effusion, and excessive weight gain (more than 2 pounds per day). =Multiple pregnancy= There is also the risk that more than one egg is produced, leading to twins or triplets. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome may be particularly at risk. Multiple pregnancy occurs in approximately 15-20% of cases following cycles induced with gonadotrophins such as hMG and FSH induced ovulations.Hong Kong College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists > Guidelines for use of gonadotrophins- revised . Number 1. April 2003. The risks associated with multiple pregnancy are much higher than singleton pregnancy; incidences of perinatal death are seven times higher in triplet births and five times higher in twin births than the risks associated with a singleton pregnancy. It is therefore important to adapt the treatment to each individual patient. If more than one or two ovulatory follicles are detected on ultrasonography, sexual abstinence is recommended. Alternatives *In vitro fertilization, including controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. *In vitro maturation is letting ovarian follicles mature in vitro, and this technique can potentially be an alternative both to anovulation reversal and oocyte release triggering. Rather, oocytes can mature outside the body, such as prior to IVF. Hence, no (or at least a lower dose of) gonadotropins have to be injected in the body. However, there still isn't enough evidence to prove the effectiveness and security of the technique.

Organization The Police Mobile Force was established as a strike or Anti-riot unit under the control of the Inspector-General of Police to counter incidents of civil disturbance. It is designated to take over operations of major crisis where conventional police units cannot cope. The 40,000 strong PMF is deployed in 52 Police Mobile Squadrons, each of approximately 700 men, spread amongst the 36 State Commands and Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Mission The Mobile Police have developed into a full-fledged security and anti-crime force to combat armed banditry, violent militant groups, religious insurrection, and many others. The police mobile force also provides guards at the residences of senior Police officers, both serving and retired, the Diplomatic community, their offices and senior Government officials. The PMF has also been charged with the protection of strategic economic sites such as oil installations, on and off shore flow station, Pipeline protection, and other oil related servicing companies. The Police Mobile Force conducts nationwide anti-crime patrols to combat organized crime. They have equally been involved in patrolling and maintenance of law and order operations in volatile states of the country such as Lagos, Rivers, Bayelsa, Delta, Kano, and Bauchi. Mopol have been in UN, ECOWAS, AU and Others peacekeeping operations. Uniforms and equipment The typical attire of the MOPOL consists of a black shirt/vest with olive drab or khaki trousers, also khaki green shirt, Military camouflage and canvas boots, accompanied by a black cap or beret (black/green/blue as well as an automatic rifle. As guardians of oil operations, MOPOL may carry the designation of the company name on their equipment. Criticisms The constraints besetting the Mobile Police are enormous and varied. These range from lack of adequate office and barracks accommodation to a shortage of arms and ammunition, operational vehicles, communication equipment and non payment of allowances to personnel on emergency duties as at when due. The Mobile Police have been widely reported as brutal violators of human rights, particularly during the 1990s, which has earned them the nickname \\"Kill-and-Go\\" amongst the Nigerian population (this is because they are known to gun down innocent civilians and simply walk away with impunity). The MOPOL constitute one of the primary means of political repression employed by the Nigerian state for maintaining control over the population; they were involved in such cases as the oppression and occupation of Ogoniland and MOSOP in the mid-1990s, as well as the Ijaw and Itsekiri conflicts in the latter portion of the decade. Individual human rights abuses are too widespread for reportage, however, reports by the BBC include instances of \\"killing of a soccer fan over his T-shirt, the killing of five traders who were robbed and the shooting of a popular local musician after a musical performance over money\\". As part of the Internal Security Task Force deployed in Ogoniland, police funded by Shell opened fire on unarmed protesters, \\"killing one person and wounding several others\\". The Mobile Police are also intimately connected to the security apparatus of the oil corporations operating in Nigeria, particularly the Niger Delta, as the companies are required to pay the requisite salaries and expenses of Mobile Police forces engaged in the protection of oil operations. Mobile Police are designated to the protection of company assets and, although the MOPOL are under state control, companies such as Shell have admitted to supplying arms and munitions to their MOPOL conditions. This has earned the MOPOL forces charged with guarding oil facilities titles of \\"Shell Police\\", \\"Mobil Police\\", and others.

It is used to characterize--usually humorously, but sometimes deprecatingly--the rural part of the U.S. state of Pennsylvania outside the Pittsburgh and Philadelphia metropolitan areas, more specifically applied to the local people and culture of its mountainous central Appalachian region. The term is used more generally to refer to the Appalachian region, particularly its central core, which runs from Pennsylvania to Kentucky, and its people. Explanation The word implies a similarity between the two states' mostly rural sections, a connection that exists in fact after numbers of Western Pennsylvanians left the state for Kentucky after the Whiskey Rebellion. It can be used in either a pejorative or an affectionate sense. =The \\"T\\"= Pennsyltucky is interchangeable with the slang term The T, used primarily in political circles (e.g., \\"Winning the T\\"), because of the shape of the area of Pennsylvania when excluding the Philadelphia and Pittsburgh Metro areas. \\"The T\\" is considered a more politically correct term than \\"Pennsyltucky\\" when referring to potential voters without so openly insulting them. The regions of Philadelphia in the southeast corner, Pittsburgh in the southwest area are urban manufacturing centers, with the \\"t-shaped\\" remainder of the state being much more rural; this dichotomy affects state politics and culture as well as the state economy. =Western Pennsylvania= Much of the term's history evolved from the Appalachian area of Pennsylvania, which includes most of the T and most of the Pittsburgh area. Since the early 1800s, Pittsburgh has been one of America's major cities with a distinct association to the Midwest. Its geographic proximity to Ohio and West Virginia creates an Ohio River Valley feel in contrast to the near coastal metropolis of Philadelphia surrounded by Delaware and New Jersey. The unique topography of the Pittsburgh urban area also contributes to its sometimes \\"rural\\" feel in that it is on a dissected plateau that features steep and still very wild bluffs, cliffs and hollows that although just yards from an intensely dense urban area have the mixing of deer, turkey, and other wildlife right on major city streets. Pittsburgh did not grow radially as most other major American cities but resembled a miles long \\"spider\\" of urbanity down river valleys such as the Monongahela, Allegheny, Chartiers and Beaver among others. For much of the 20th century the result was a major sprawling metropolis that just a mile on either side of the valley was as wild and natural as the most remote parts of the state. Even with today's suburban sprawl, very wild bluffs and hollows remain as a web of \\"green belts\\" throughout the Pittsburgh metro area. For these reasons notable people familiar with Western Pennsylvania also include Pittsburgh and its immediate area in the \\"Pennsyltucky\\" definition. History USS Pennsyltucky from \\"Baby Wants a Bottleship\\" The term Pennsyltucky can be traced back over a century. Many of the earlier uses appear to be humorous references to a fictitious state. For example, Pennsyltucky is the name of the ship in the 1942 Popeye cartoon \\"Baby Wants a Bottleship\\". By the 1970s, the term clearly referred to rural Pennsylvania, as evidenced by country music star Jeannie Seely's 1972 single \\"A Farm in Pennsyltucky\\" about her childhood home in northwestern Pennsylvania. Also in 1972, Richard Elman writes in his semi-autobiographical Fredi & Shirl & The Kids that the character Fredi refers to all of Appalachia as Pennsyltucky. The modern popularization of the term is commonly associated with Democratic political consultant James Carville, who worked on President Bill Clinton's first presidential campaign. Carville's original statement did not speak of \\"Pennsyltucky\\". In 1986, while working on Robert Casey, Sr.'s successful gubernatorial campaign, he said: > Between Paoli and Penn Hills, Pennsylvania is Alabama without the blacks. > They didn't film The Deer Hunter there for nothing ‚Äì the state has the > second-highest concentration of NRA members, behind Texas. This quote is often paraphrased as \\"Philadelphia in the east, Pittsburgh in the west, and Alabama in the middle\\", or alternatively, \\"Pennsylvania is Philadelphia and Pittsburgh separated by Alabama\\".

Broder is known for polemics, columns, and comments in written and audiovisual media. He wrote for the magazine Der Spiegel, as well as its online version and the daily Berlin newspaper Der Tagesspiegel. Since 2010, he has been writing for Die Welt. He is co-editor of ' (The Jewish calendar), a compilation of quotes and texts relating to German Jewish culture, published annually. Besides his numerous publications, he appears as a frequent guest on German TV talk shows. In 2010 and 2011, he produced and starred, alongside Egyptian-German writer and political scientist Hamed Abdel-Samad, in the satirical TV series ‚Äì Die Deutschland-Safari (a wordplay on \\"entweder/oder\\", German for \\"either/or\\", \\"Either Broder ‚Äì The Germany Safari\\") on ARD. Broder is especially interested in Vergangenheitsbew√§ltigung, Islam, Israel, and the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. He sees a close relationship between German criticism of Israel's policies and Antisemitism, a view criticized by, among others, the French- German columnist Alfred Grosser.  Life  Born in Katowice, Silesia, Poland, Broder moved to Cologne with his family in 1958. Both of his parents were survivors of Nazi death camps. In Cologne, he studied economics, law and psychology but failed to graduate. Together with fellow student and nascent writer , whom he had known since high school times, he founded and edited two short-lived radically liberal quarterlies (\\"PoPoPo\\" and \\"Bubu/Eiapopeyea\\"). In the late 1960s he took over the ' together with the journalist Michel Roger Lang, a then highly successful tabloid newspaper in Hamburg, along with G√ºnter Wallraff, Stefan Aust and the photographer , in order to agitate the working class of the city with a combination of leftist articles, nude photography and lonely hearts ads. In the 1970s, he wrote for the satirical magazine Pardon. From 1979 to 1981 he published, together with fellow journalist , the periodical \\"Freie J√ºdische Stimme\\" (\\"Free Jewish Voice\\"). In 1981, he left Germany to work in Israel for a while, but continued to write for high-level periodicals as Die Zeit, Profil, Die Weltwoche, and S√ºddeutsche Zeitung. In the 1980s he also hosted the television talk-show Leute, along with Elke Heidenreich, which ran on Sender Freies Berlin; one of their guests was African-American poet Rita Dove, who had just won the 1987 Pulitzer Prize and is married to Fred Viebahn, Broder's old friend from Cologne. Broder wrote a series of books which dealt with the relationship between Germans and Jews, respectively the growing German Jewish community. Together with Eike Geisel, Broder published essays, books and a documentary about the J√ºdischer Kulturbund (Jewish Cultural Union), a previously unknown chapter of Jewish German cultural life during the Third Reich. He wrote books about foreign policy with special regard to Israel, Islam and the growing German Jewish community. Ever since Operation Entebbe, Broder grew more and more critical of the German approach towards Israel, and what Broder sees as appeasement towards Islamic threats. In Broder's opinion, Anti-Zionism is in essence anti- Semitic.Wir sind alle traumatisiert (We all are traumatised): \\"Der Antizionismus ist f√ºr Nichtjuden wie f√ºr Juden nur eine Ausrede, ihren Antisemitismus sozusagen in einer politisch aseptischen Form pr√§sentieren zu k√∂nnen. Kein Mensch geht hin und sagt: Ich bin Antisemit. Es gibt keinen Antizionismus, der seinen Ursprung nicht im Antisemitismus h√§tte ...Dass in einer aufgekl√§rten Diskussion alle Positionen vertreten werden k√∂nnen, ist selbstverst√§ndlich. Kritik an Israel ist vollkommen selbstverst√§ndlich.\\" (Antizionism is for Jews and non-Jews just a pretext to present antisemitism in a political aseptical version. Nobody just comes around saying \\"I am an antisemite.\\" There is no Antizionism which doesn't have its origin in antisemitism [...] It's a matter of course that in an enlightened argument any position can be held. Criticism of Israel is a matter of course.) Broder's trademark is his polemical, blunt, and quick-witted style. He publishes hate mail and heated exchanges between him and critics on his website. The result of some of Broder's polemics were a series of lawsuits, some won and some lost by him. Many of Broder's writings for outlets such as spiegel.de and welt.de are archived at the Achse des Guten blog, which he, together with two other prominent German journalists, operates as a collaborative platform for the unfettered expression of about two dozen of his colleagues. Broder is married to a publisher, and they have a grown-up daughter. He lives in Berlin.  Awards  Broder receiving the 2007 Ludwig-B√∂rne-Preis * 1986 Preis des 5.

The two young men met when the future Frederick II was still in prison for having attempted to run off with his former companion, Hans Hermann von Katte. At the time, Fredersdorf was four years older than the heir to the throne and served in the army, being the son of a peasant.

Henderson, \\"Frederick the Great of Prussia: A Homophile Perspective\\", Gai Saber 1, no. 1 (1977), pp. 46-54. have speculated that Fredersdorf and Frederick II had a homosexual relationship, yet there is no definitive proof. Voltaire would later describe the relationship in his Memoires as, \\"This soldier, young, handsome, well made, and who played the flute, served to entertain the prisoner in more than one fashion.\\"Compton, Lewis. Homosexuality and Civilisation, Harvard University Press, 2003, p203 When Frederick moved to Rheinsberg Palace with his wife in 1736, he made Fredersdorf his valet. When he ascended to the throne in 1740, he furthermore made him his private treasurer and, within less than a month, gave him the estate of Zernikow as a present. Later he also made him director of the royal theatre. When the king moved to Sanssouci, his valet's bedroom adjoined his own, still shown today. The royal gardens director Heinrich Ludwig Manger later called the chamberlain the king's chamber lover in a book of 1789.History of Potsdam Buildings, especially under King Frederick the Second, published in 1789/90. vol. 1 (describing the royal architect Friedrich Wilhelm Diterichs' dismissal who \\"may not have flattered enough to be the king's chamber lover - German: \\"Kammerliebling\\" - of that time\\"). Fredersdorf eventually sought to marry, a move which disenchanted the king. Frederick wrote him, \\"Have your marriage ceremony today rather than tomorrow if that will contribute to your care and comfort; and if you want to keep a little page and a little scout with you as well, do so.\\" In 1753 he married Marie Elisabeth Daum (1730-1810), daughter of Gottfried Adolph Daum, a wealthy private banker and owner of a gun factory who had provided Frederick with credit secretly when he was still crown prince and who received substantial orders of weapons' production during Frederick's wars. Fredersdorf was dismissed on 9 April 1757, being accused of financial irregularities. He died, ashamed of his lost honor, within less than a year. He was buried in Zernikow. He had no children. His wife however remarried and had children with her second husband, royal chamberlain Johann Labes. Later she raised her grandson, the poet Ludwig Achim von Arnim.

She resigned from these positions late in 2006 to undergo treatment for cancer. Life and training Basrur was born in Toronto, Ontario, in 1956 to Indian immigrants. Her mother, Parvathi Basrur, was a professor of veterinary genetics and her father, Vasanth Basrur, was a radiation oncologist. She grew up in Guelph, where there were very few visible minorities at the time. After obtaining a Bachelor of Science from the University of Western Ontario in 1979, she received her doctor of medicine from the University of Toronto in 1982, after which Basrur worked as a general practitioner in Guelph for one year. She then spent a year in India and Nepal, where she became interested in public health. Upon returning to Canada, she obtained a Master of Health Science degree in 1987, specializing in community health and epidemiology, again from the University of Toronto. She then completed a post-graduate residency, becoming a specialist in community medicine, as well as an assistant professor in the Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of Toronto. Basrur lived in Scarborough, but moved to Kitchener, where she underwent treatment for hemangiopericytoma, from which she eventually died on June 2, 2008. Public career Basrur became the Medical Officer of Health for the East York Health Unit until East York was merged into the city of Toronto in 1998, when she became the first Medical Officer of Health for the new amalgamated city. She was widely hailed for her work during the 2003 Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Toronto, appearing in numerous television interviews on international networks, such as CNN.CNN transcript Basrur wrote a journal article with Barbara Yaffe and Bonnie Henry in the 2004 Canadian Journal of Public Health entitled \\"SARS: A Local Public Health Perspective\\". She said upon the release of the NACSARS report that Basrur's other accomplishments included Canada's first city program that required restaurants to post health inspection results in their windows, post-9/11 bioterrorism preparation plans, and a citywide ban on cigarette smoking in 2004. In 2004 she was appointed Chief Medical Officer of Health and Assistant Deputy Minister of Public Health in the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care. She remained in this position until her resignation on December 6, 2006, in order to undergo treatment for her cancer. Honours Basrur received a number of honours throughout her career. In 2007 she was awarded life membership in the Ontario Public Health Association (OPHA), as well as an honorary doctor of laws degree from York University. A nursing oncology fellowship was established in Basrur's name by the Registered Nurses' Foundation of Ontario, and the OPHA created an award for social justice in her honour. A major Public celebration of the life and contributions of Dr.Sheela Basrur was held on Oct 17th 2008 4:00-5:30pm at Convocation Hall, University of Toronto, where the accomplishments of the late Dr. Basrur's life were celebrated by friends, family, the public and leaders from the City of Toronto, the Province of Ontario and the Government of Canada. Upon the formation of the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion on March 8, 2008, it was announced that the headquarters would be known as the Sheela Basrur Centre. The following month, on April 10, Basrur was inducted into the Order of Ontario for her public service; Basrur's induction ceremony took place outside the normal award schedule, owing to her ongoing battle with leiomyosarcoma.

It is one of the best-preserved examples of a 16th-century Z-plan tower house in Scotland. Now surrounded by modern housing, the castle is maintained as an Ancient Monument by Historic Environment Scotland. History The castle was originally built by John Strachan around 1569‚Äì1588 according to dates inscribed on stones that make up parts of the castle, which make its construction longer than usual for such a small building. The land on which the castle was built was originally leased by the Strachan family from the Tironensian Abbey of Lindores starting in the early 16th century. In 1601 the Strachan family sold the castle to Sir William Graham of Ballunie who later sold it to Sir William Graham of Claverhouse. The castle became the property of the crown in 1689 after the death of the then current owner Viscount Dundee John Graham of Claverhouse at the battle of Killiecrankie. In 1694 the castle was given to James Douglas, 2nd Marquess of Douglas. The castle later became the property of his son the Duke of Douglas and after his death in 1761 became the subject of a legal battle for the next eight years until the courts ruled Archibald Douglas to be heir. Ownership later passed to the 13th Earl of Home through marriage who later gave the castle to the state in 1926. It is now in the care of Historic Environment Scotland. There is a legend that the castle was once home to an industrious brownie who helped the servants with their work, but that he left in disgust because of a lazy kitchen maid. Architecture Interior of Claypotts Castle The castle consists of projecting towers at opposite sides of a rectangular main block, known as a Z-plan tower house. This was a popular design in the 16th century and allowed defenders to fire along the faces of the main block from both towers, although it is unlikely that the castle would have had much of a defensive role given its domestic scale.

History Lesliganj is a historic place; it was an army camp during British rule in India and hence also called Chawni (means \\"place where force makes camp\\"). The place has been named after Matthew Leslie who was the Collector and Magistrate of Ramgarh Hill tract in the 1780s. This is the place where the martyr brothers Nilamber and Pitamber were hanged by the British. Therefore, there is a demand from some sections of people to rename it as Nilamber and Pitamber Nagar.  Location in Jharkhand  Lesliganj is a town in Palamu District in the Indian state of Jharkhand. It is located about 18 km from Daltonganj, the district headquarters and around 210 km from State capital Ranchi.

Governance and development Although Lesliganj is a very old town and has its own historic importance, it still remains underdeveloped and largely poor due to many unstable governments in the recent history of the state. Like other areas in Jharkhand, Lesliganj still remains undeveloped, partly due to neglect of the government and partly due to the naxal presence in the interior areas. Few villages are yet to receive electricity connections and those villages which have it, hardly get the supply continuously. Lesliganj caters to the day-to-day needs of the locals through the temporary bazaar which sits thrice a week i.e. on Sundays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.

Congress  Congress in 1928 and 1929 adopted what was known as the \\"Newton Bill,\\" to divide the jurisdiction of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, creating the Tenth Circuit, which sits in Denver. This was the first change in the geography of the federal courts since the present system of courts of appeals was created in 1891. The enormous Eighth Circuit had encompassed all the territory from the Mississippi (except Texas and part of Louisiana) almost to the states of the West Coast. Congressman Newton's plan resolved multiple disputes among the American Bar Association, the courts, and both Houses. Newton's solution was to divide the states along a North/South boundary, creating the Tenth Circuit as encompassing Oklahoma, Colorado, Wyoming, Utah and New Mexico, thereby leaving a somewhat unified grouping of Eighth Circuit states sharing the Mississippi/Missouri river system, from Minnesota and the Dakotas to Arkansas. The likeliest pre-Newton plan would have divided the circuit along a boundary from East to West.

Comics and then Devil's Due Publishing in 2005. Evil Ernie is currently published by Dynamite Entertainment in their purchasing of the Chaos! Comics imprint.  Ernest Fairchild  Ernest Fairchild is the root or core of Evil Ernie. Ernest Fairchild was a young boy who possessed the supernatural power to sketch scenes which would later come to pass, for instance he drew himself and his family together with a little brother and several months later his mom became pregnant with their second son. Ernie originally had an enjoyable life; but, when his father became the town pariah because his superiors at the local lumber yard forced him to lay off many workers, things started to turn sour. Mr. Fairchild began to drink heavily and killed Ernest's pet rat, Smiley, in an inebriated fit of anger. This enraged Ernest and led to him drawing a picture of a car crashing into a tree. It just so happened that his mother was driving over to a local bar to pick up her husband while he was drawing this and ended up crashing into a tree just like in Ernest's sketch. In addition to suffering numerous injuries, she had a miscarriage which caused her to slip into an abusive psychosis matching that of her husband. As his parents abused him, Ernest's powers developed further to where he could hear the thoughts of those around him and he discovered that many of his neighbors knew that he was being battered by his parents, but did nothing to help him. Either they had lost their jobs at the lumber yard and were too bitter to care or they still had their jobs, but were too afraid of losing them if they confronted his father. Ernest's parents sought to \\"cure\\" him of his abilities and brought him to Dr. Leonard Price, who had been working on a device dubbed the Dream Probe. Price, not knowing about the abuse Ernest was suffering, submitted him to his device, which sent him to the Endless Graveyard, where he met Lady Death. There, she offered to give him the love he so desperately desired if he killed everything on Earth. Once the treatment was over, Ernest pretended to be cured and went home with his parents, only to murder them the next morning along with thirty-five others before he was shot by Doctor Price, who had come to check in on him. After this time he was incarcerated in a mental asylum, under the observation of Doctor Price, who blamed himself for Ernest's murder spree and vowed to make sure it never happened again. Doctor Price lost hope for Fairchild early on, but then a doctor named Mary Young invented a process of altering one's mind known as Neurotech. Despite Price's protests, Ernest was submitted to the Neurotech device. During the treatment, Lady Death used her telepathic link with him to cause the machine to explode, killing Ernest. When a nurse placed a smiley face pin intended to be a gift upon his release next to his corpse, Lady Death used it as a conduit for her arcane energy, mutating Ernest into the powerful, undead monster that would be known as Evil Ernie.  \\"Evil\\" Ernie Fairchild  Evil Ernie hereafter, along with his partner \\"Smiley\\" (a psychotic smiley badge, which was once his pet rat) set about to cause \\"Megadeath\\", which involved launching all of the USA's nuclear weapons against the rest of the world, so that every other country would launch their own nuclear warheads. Ernie starts to accomplish this by creating an army of zombies known as \\"Dead Onez\\". Various adventures ensue, including a trip back to his past to confront his parents about their ill treatment of him, and a trip to hell to rebuke Pagan (the court jester of hell) for having Lady Death cast out into the void by Satan. The culmination of Ernie's efforts amount to him causing Megadeath by causing the rest of the world to fire on itself with nuclear warheads from various countries. Evil Ernie ends his life in a duel with Dr. Price, and in the last moment before the missiles hit, Ernie overpowers Price and mutates him into a Dead One, exclaiming: \\"Do you see it now?\\" To which Price replies \\"I see it, it's beau-\\". The final scene is one of a mushroom cloud behind the survivors, in the form of Ernie's face and maniacal grin. Hack/Slash, Santa Fe After his death in his own world, Ernie would be reborn in the universe of Tim Seeley's HACK/Slash (in which no equivalent of him appears to exist). Discovering that Lady Death does not exist in this world, a depressed Ernie takes up residence in the Fairchild Sawmill in New Jersey and begins killing strippers and mutating them into Dead Onez. Ernie would eventually encounter slasher slayer Cassie Hack and her partner Vlad, in the ensuing battle read Cassie's mind and fell in love with her, believing them to be two sides of the same coin. After Cassie is saved from him by Vlad, Ernie, wanting to impress Cassie, decides to purge the world of killers and breaks into the Clearview Mental Institution, planning to start his mission there. During his killing spree, Ernie is confronted by Cassie and Vlad and, while fighting the latter, is attacked by a recently arrived police officer. Killing the officer, Ernie discovers Cassie had accidentally been shot and, after she dies, Ernie sacrifices himself to revive her, causing him to die and be reborn elsewhere. After the Hack/Slash crossover, the newly- renewed license gained a new lease on life in the 4-issue mini-series Evil Ernie in Santa Fe. Written by Alan Grant and penciled by Tommy Castillo it featured Ernie in Santa Fe contemplating matters of fate after killing Norman Lowell, a lawyer who led Ernie against a Satanic cult performing rituals with connections to FastWay, a fast food franchise, while planning to sacrifice a child to demon Zabudel who granted wealth to their leader. All the while Ernie is chased by Dr. Price's daughter Layna who wants revenge partnered with detective Rig Dannon who's willing to catch Ernie for the million-dollar reward. Smiley Throughout the series, Ernie's companion is Smiley, a wise- cracking smiley face button usually attached to the lapel of his jacket. Smiley serves as the conduit for the arcane energy that gives Ernie his powers, as well as the comic relief of the series. Smiley claims to be Ernie's super-ego and is sometimes at odds with his friend's decisions, such as when Ernie resurrected his parents in order to confront them about their past. It's believed Smiley is the revived form of Ernest's pet rat whom his father killed in a rage, for the most part however, his personality is more easy-going and comical than Ernie's. =Chaos! Dynamite revamp= Smiley resumes the role of Ernest Fairchild; revived as Evil Ernie's lecherously volatile companion, and now taking on a much more active role in all the mayhem caused by his better half. While still supplying and charging his host with arcane energy supplied to him, Smiley himself is a powerful possessing entity who can freely move about and physically assail anyone through his more opposable mandibles. He can even overshadow people by latching onto them and manipulate their actions like a puppeteer working his abilities both on the living and the dead. Unlike in the previous continuity however Smiley was once a struggling family restaurant owner-turned successful business tycoon named Richard Smiley, who was secretly a Satanist working for the devil and representative Chaos Lord; Lucifer, who condemned his soul to be forever bound to his symbolism of power, Richard's smiley-faced buttons, when the former became a threat to the king of hell's seat of power. Powers As Ernest Fairchild, he had the ability to sketch drawings of the future. This was first demonstrated when he drew a picture of a brand-new washing machine being delivered shortly before one was delivered to his parents as a prize in a raffle they had not even entered. It seems that his ability could change the future since he once drew a picture of a future younger brother walking with him, when he heard his mother tell his father she was pregnant with a boy, only to prevent his younger brother from being born when he drew his mother's car crashing into a tree. Later on, he gained the ability to listen to the thoughts of others. As Evil Ernie, he was extremely strong and practically unstoppable, thanks to the arcane energy of Lady Death powering him. He could revive anyone he killed or were killed by his minions as loyal zombie followers in his army of undead. When resurrected in Washington D.C., he became even more powerful. He could now resurrect the corpses of anyone nearby, whether he had killed them or not, and could manipulate arcane energy into powerful blasts to destroy his enemies, though he rarely used this ability since he preferred to be more \\"hands on\\" when it came to killing. If Ernest were to ever die he can be resurrected through another person when his Smiley button jabs them on his pin, but only once upon the host individual's death as Evil can only control the dead not the living. He retained his telepathic abilities only to a small degree as they now worked specifically on the dead and few things related to the dead, which allowed him to speak to and see Lady Death after murdering someone or using astral projection to visit Hell or the Endless Graveyard while he slept. There's room for speculation on this however; as Purgatori once delved into his mind to find answers to a means of defeating his patron saint and lover, Lady Death. She found the nightmarish images within his psyche were not figments of his imagining but were in fact materialized ghouls which threatened to devour her implicating he had some kind of power to will whatever he wished into reality. Later still when Evil was separated from a still-living Ernest Fairchild as a Jungian archetype fission effect after having discovered the truth from the reanimated remains of his parents while returning home, Ernie regained his ability to read the minds of the living when resuscitated from the painful separation of his better half, openly peering into the minds of three living youths who resurrected him in order to learn their life stories. The source of Evil Ernie's power comes from the arcane energy channeled into him by Lady Death through his button, Smiley. If Ernie is separated from Smiley for too long, he begins to lose his power becoming much weaker and over time he will, eventually, revert to a corpse and die again leaving Smiley an inanimate badge as well. In the revamp of the Evil mythos, Ernest's powers remain much the same but a tad more refined. Still boasting the strength, toughness, recuperation, necromancy and arcane energy manipulation abilities retained as previous issues only using them to a much more mystical effect than just as blunt instruments; if he wishes Ernie can resume his initial living form before he was executed and can physically substitute removed limbs to replace any extremities he may've lost. He's much more liberal in the destructive/concussive effects of his energies using it for hand blasts, releasing it in AoE explosions, etc. On the physical side he can withhold it to increase his physical melee as energy enhanced strikes and can also remotely control any parts of his body to act on his behalf, he also has the innate psychic ability to peer into a person's moral alignment just as soon as he would look at them. In his eyes people appear to Ernie as differently as individual snowflakes; the corrupt appearing hellish and demonic with the particular sins they committed tattooed to their face or forehead, while the innocent retain a human appearance brandishing a smiley button like he does with a ray of light looming over them. it's also suggested that he is, on top of being human, a being of both angelic and demonic descent by another chaos lord; Mistress Hel. Reboot In October 2012, Dynamite Comics rebooted Evil Ernie. It was 6 issues; written by Jesse Blaze Snider and drawn by Jason Craig. Then two years later in October 2014 Dynamite Comics released volume 2; which was 6 issues; written by Tim Seeley & Steve Seeley and drawn by Rafael Lanhellas.http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/205795/could-it-be-dynamite-to- resurrect-evil-ernie-with-jesse-blaze-snider-and-jason-craig/ =Origin of Evil= In the newest serialization, Ernest Fairchild was a child born from tragedy. The soon-to-be youngest son in a family of four, and as his mother went into labor a malicious entity possessed his father while they were driving her to the hospital killing everybody from his mother, father to older brother in a hideous car accident; the being later is revealed to be Ernest's future compatriot Smiley. He would later be adopted to an abusive parental figure by the name of Bufford King, who would regularly accost him while his callous girlfriend, Eunice, never bothered to help him. For many years this was the making of Ernie's horrid life usually ending with him praying to Nicolas Cage and Jesus every night; first for salvation of his new caretakers, then deliverance from their unsympathetic brutality, next to punishing them for the rot in their souls until finally he found a new patron to pray to seeing as neither were listening. During his stay in the prison and before he became an inmate Ernest had the peculiar tendency of seeing the innermost aspects of a person's core being. He could see the morality of another's character often viewing both the good and evil people around him in a different light. 5 years prior Fairchild had made a bargain with one of the many chaos lords in charge of running the dark side of the universe; Satan. In exchange for the power to purge the world of sinners he would sacrifice a good number of condemned souls. He poisoned the town's water supply with arsenic in a ritualistic killing, intoxicating them all moments before he would run over the-then imprisoned Bufford's girlfriend with her own truck, unintentional but his first step to being remade, making his way to the 'Widmark Maximum Security Prison' to see his cruel foster father, his final sacrifice. Upon meeting he proceeded to attack King with a shard of glass permanently disfiguring him. Cut a couple of years to the future, Ernie is now a death row prison inmate at the same penitentiary awaiting his execution via electric chair for his murderous acts dubbed by the local media as The Lucrecia Massacre of 2006. Crowds of people attending ranged from newscasters to protesters, fanatics and civil rights activists participated in the festivities bearing witness to the event. All coming in accordance to this execution, with the dead man requesting he go out with his trademark leather jacket and infamous smiley-faced button as a last request. Attending witnesses to his final moments are his grizzled father figure sporting a Glasgow grin who was let in by the corrupt pedophiliac prison warden named Straw; who sat by drawing a sadistic glee while Ernie was regularly tormented by the other death row inmates. As well as his only friends in the joint, the kindly Doctor Thana Thomas and an empathetic pastor named Chaplain who he bonded with during his imprisonment. On the night of execution however, Ernest was reanimated by some kind of esoteric storm of sickly green magical energy which entered his cadaver bursting forth from his bowels. It burned his facial features into a gnarled lipless smile while his ordinarily inert yellow button suddenly sprang to life sporting a scowling facial expression and wicked toothy grin. Thus the jailbird-turned deadman had been revived as the devil's soul harbinger \\"Evil Ernie\\". Seeking to finish off the ritual and his vendetta towards his estranged foster parent, Evil Ernie escaped the execution chamber and led a homicidal tirade against both the prisoners and the facility staff along with any other unfortunate sinner who happened to catch his vengeful eye. Experimenting with his newfound powers he tears through the penal area slaughtering sinners in his eyes with unusually grisly and vulgar flare while also sparing the few good individuals he came upon along the way, he would soon find however that reckless expenditure of his arcane energy which animates his corpse weakens him due to his having yet to complete his end of the devil's deal. Due to this weakness he's eventually subdued and hideously maimed by his guardian leading the other inmates, but Smiley tricks Bufford into a new deal which costs him his right arm causing him to flee with the innocent doctor in tow. Meanwhile, outside the prisons borders a U.S. senator catches glimpses of Ernie's rampage at the prison after concluding business with a prostitute. Utterly horrified by this turn of events he orders a gathering of military powers at the Pentagon, then moves to the White House speaking with the President of the United States convincing him that the threat of the now-demonic revenant required the nuclear option. Back at the prison Ernest is beset twice by Uriel the archangel of destiny to try and dissuade him from his murderous recourse, every time however they were dispatched either by Smiley who was hot-wiring a nearby corpse due to his allegiances to hell and not wanting Ernie to know the truth, and again by Bufford who had attached a severed arm of Fairchild's to himself gaining a portion of his undead son's demonic powers. After having been made vulnerable by Smiley getting damaged by a stray bullet Ernie is soon killed by Bufford as he loses his connection to the arcane energy while trying to defend the host of innocent prisoners possessed by Uriel's followers, but Ernest is again resurrected with even greater power than before by an unknown force and follows up by reanimating an army of dead prisoners and bystanders who were at the prison to face his now-demonized foster father. Still losing the fight against him as the evil power worked better than the kinder zombie kid, Evil managed to pull a Hail Mary by taking control of the arm Bufford severed making him rip out and eat his own heart. Having managed to save Thana, Ernie is unaware that a nuke is dropped over the prison the two are currently occupying. Unbeknownst to him the President had been possessed by Uriel who greenlit the bombing through his proxy. Ernest is soon revived by Smiley but his only friend is incinerated in the blast, cursing Nicolas Cage just as everything was over; Ernie resigns to his fate as the devil's bounty hunter as he picks up Bufford's hat for himself and sets out to parts unknown. =Chaos! Highway to Hell= While out on a job acting as Satan's hitman in the Dakotas, Ernie had a premonition about a dark enchantress whom he'd often have visions of whenever he slept or was awake killing other sinners, ignoring Smiley's pleas of worry Ernest set about finding people affiliated with murder so he could discover the secrets to these odd visions of his. Soon making his way to a highway near Kansas State, his newest mark; Ethan Mueller who was a wanted murderer and was shot dead before he could receive any insight from his mystery woman. Sensing whoever he's searching for is somehow linked in some way to death Ernie sets his sights on finding people who broadcast an insensibly high body count. Every step of the way he's either met with or pursued by various forces seeking to impede his progress, such as Chastity Marks and Morgan Gallows; along with his Chosen. In the meantime Fairchild headed into the titular city in order to greet and make deceased, the man who put Widmark Penitentiary on the map. Disguised as a pizza delivery boy, Ernest would make his presence known to Lt. Brandon Green while getting into an altercation with his manipulative advisor; Senator Cruise. After finally having whacked his repentant nuke carrier Ernie gains the full picture of who it is that's been guiding him, it's none other Mistress Hel, Nordic Goddess of death and the Asgardian underworld. She convinces The Evil One that his employer had been cheating him the entire time; having used Ernie's vigilante crusade against sinners in his own favor in order to swell his ranks in hell and will eventually claim Ernie as his ultimate General. Hel convinces him to lead the initiation of Ragnarok by bringing about a mass exodus of dead souls; basically compelling him to incite Megadeath, in doing so both he and she will make a paradise after conflict at the end of days destroying everything. After letting loose a huge blast of his arcane energy, Ernie levels the housing area where the press had gathered to meet the good lieutenant eviscerating everybody. As Mistress Hel makes her preparations through her ward Serendipity, Ernest leaves his former partner Smiley before getting into a fight with Chastity who quickly gains the upper hand in their conflict. Until Evil Ernie conjures up some of his Dead Onez to restrain her where he deals a critical blow with her own silver sword, as the nubile vampiress makes her escape Ernest quickly catches up to her in a semi-abandoned alley. He ends up overhearing her feelings of lingering regrets about how Chastity's love for someone put him in the crosshairs of Sakaara when her oldest enemy put out a contract on her. Seeing her depth of character reflected through action and persona Ernie offers her a chance to side with him against her current handler. She complies as the two devise a clever means of royally punking the whore of Satan, Ernie using his arcane energy to hotwire the mind of one of Purgatori's renfield's piloting the transport with which Chastity took to catch up with Evil Ernie right into her Las Vegas penthouse. Making their way to the Clearview Mental Institution in St. Louise, Missouri, Ernie and Chastity wade through an enclave of the morbidly self-destructive gathered in front of the psychiatric clinic by Hel's influence. There he and his new partner meet up with Serendipity and Dr. Leonard Price moments before Ernie hooks himself into the professor's dream probe machine which instead of curbing fatalistic depression tendencies, aggravates them into full-on suicidal urges. Using this device to amplify his natural psionic abilities The Evil One projects his telepathy across the globe drudging up people's most horrible characteristics and showing those to them. Sending all of the people both innocent and guilty into a m√©lange binge sparking a wholesale self-murder in every corner around cities, countries, the globe etc. As The Chosen aligned with the blood mother to make their way into the fray, all the dead suicidal people rise from their grave to engage them. Bit by bit as people from the world start killing themselves one after the other, Ernie begins to burn himself out as the overexpenditure of his energies without Smiley to sustain and refuel him, steadily being reduced to an inanimate corpse because of this. Ernest is met by the women who'd orchestrated the events of Armageddon who use the body of Sara as a vessel to commune with her champion and consort. Her attentions are otherwise preoccupied by the arrival of another asier. While Hel is distracted by Purgatori, Vex is revealed as Niorun; Goddess of the Night, and moves to soothe Evil Ernie's psi-induced rampage by feeding him loving happy memories of what he truly desired. Only to be interrupted by Purgatori as she moves to use the device in order to conquer the world. Chastity takes Smiley and tosses him up to the window where Ernie and Purgatori sit just as she uses the probe to broadcast her own psychic mojo to the world and enthralls everyone, after the demon button re-energizes Ernie the latter uses his energy to call down a massive blast which obliterates both him and Purgatori along with the entire building complex sending them both back to hell in a blaze. In the aftermath all that can be seen left of him is the now-inert Smiley picked up by a hazmat team studying the ruined site of his climactic battle.

Duarte plays a style of Texas blues-rock that draws on elements of jazz, blues, and rock and roll. In his own words, his musical style is a combination of \\"rockin' blues\\" and \\"punk blues.\\" He is signed to Shrapnel Records. Biography Duarte was born in San Antonio, Texas, and was first inspired by music at age 8 after seeing Fiddler On The Roof on television. Duarte first began playing on his brother's guitar and then obtained his own electric guitar, a Supro, at the age of 14. In 1979, Duarte moved to Austin, Texas, and purchased a 1963 Fender Stratocaster guitar for $500 and began exploring various genres including the jazz music of John Coltrane and Miles Davis. This guitar he primarily used to learn to play, was stolen in 1993. Duarte was inspired by blues legend Stevie Ray Vaughan, and credits John Coltrane as his number-one musical idol. Duarte won a label recording contract with Silvertone Records and released Texas Sugar/Strat Magik in 1994, and was named \\"Best New Talent\\" in Guitar Player's 1995 Reader's Poll. He finished fourth in the magazine's \\"Best Blues Guitarist\\" category behind Eric Clapton, Buddy Guy and B.B. King. Duarte said once in an interview, \\"I always thought I was a better live performer anyway.\\" Though Duarte has played a limited number of US dates in recent years with the Japanese band Bluestone Company backing him, he performs primarily as a power trio billed as the Chris Duarte Group. Originally formed with long-time friends and collaborators, John Jordan on bass and Jeff Hodges on drums, the current incarnation features Dustin Sargent on bass and John McKnight on drums. Apart from his band, Duarte has performed with Julie Burrell, Diana Cantu, Bobby Mack, Tracy Conover, Indigenous, and Omar & the Howlers. Duarte's concert dates in Asheville, North Carolina; Charlotte, North Carolina; and Greenville, South Carolina; were filmed for the PBS television show, The PBS Project, and featured Steve Bailey on bass and Jeff Sipe on drums. His thirteenth and latest album, Lucky 13, is billed as a Chris Duarte Group release, featuring Dustin Sargent on the bass, and John McKnight on the drums while Duarte plays the guitar and provides vocals. Following its release in 2014, it received positive reviews for its blend of slow, loping blues with psychedelic, rock and jazz overtones.

Though its psychoactive effects and chemical makeup are contested, its cultural impact is not. Absinthe has played a notable role in the fine art movements of Impressionism, Post-impressionism, Surrealism, Modernism, Cubism and in the corresponding literary movements. The legendary drink has more recently appeared in movies, video, television, music, and contemporary literature. The modern absinthe revival has had a notable effect on its portrayal. It is often shown as an unnaturally glowing green liquid demonstrating the influence of contemporary marketing efforts. Absinthe- bottles Arts  L'Absinthe, by Edgar Degas. Toulouse-Lautrec. Still Life with Absinthe, 1887, Van Gogh Museum Angel Fern√°ndez de Soto with absinthe by Picasso. Absinthe has a widely documented role in 19th-century visual art and was frequently the subject of many genre paintings and still lifes of the day. *√âdouard Manet began his career with The Absinthe Drinker (1858), oil on canvas demonstrating that at least he was exposed to the drink and its effects. *Edgar Degas' painting L'Absinthe (1876) portrayed grim absinthe drinkers in a cafe. Degas himself never called the painting \\"L'Absinthe\\"; it was either his art dealer or a later owner who gave it the name. Years later, it set off a flurry in the London art world, and the grim realism of \\"L'Absinthe\\" (a theme popular with bohemian artists) was perceived by London art critics as a lesson against alcohol and the French in general. *Paul Verlaine was addicted to absinthe in his last (alcoholic) period. *Paul Gauguin is known for consuming large quantities of absinthe, and his bold use of flat color has also been attributed to its influence.NEJM - Hideous Absinthe: A History of the Devil in a Bottle. *Picasso depicted absinthe in various media, including the paintings Woman Drinking Absinthe (1901), Bottle of Pernod and Glass (1912), and the sculpture Absinthe Glass (1914). *Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec was notorious for his consumption of the green muse. He often painted impressionistic scenes of the brothels and night spots of 19th-century Montmartre. Lautrec was even known to carry a hollow cane filled with absinthe during long nights out in Paris.Toulouse-Lautrec: Bibliographies - Food, Drink, Recipes An example of Lautrec's work featuring absinthe is in the painting Monsieur Boileau au caf√©. *Vincent van Gogh was not a man of moderation, and drank large quantities of absintheNaralie Amgier, Studying Art With the Eye Of a Physician, The New York Times, September 11, 1990 while creating his signature painting style.

Film *In Grand Hotel (1932), starring Greta Garbo and John Barrymore, Joan Crawford orders and drinks absinthe at a Berlin bar. *In Made in Paris (1966), Ann-Margret becomes intoxicated on absinthe in a Parisian piano bar and performs a drunken song and dance routine to \\"You've Got To See Mama Ev'ry Night\\". *Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992) featured absinthe as a key ingredient in Count Dracula's seduction of Mina Harker. The scene opens with the line \\"Absinthe is the aphrodisiac of the soul. The green fairy who lives in the absinthe wants your soul, but you are safe with me\\". *Interview with the Vampire (1994) makes references to absinthe twice. First, Louis is seen drinking absinthe in a bar before he becomes a vampire. Later, Claudia tricks Lestat into drinking the blood of two dead boys. Having recognized that something is wrong, Lestat asks Claudia whether she gave the boys absinthe. Claudia replies that she gave them Laudanum, which killed them but kept their blood warm. *Total Eclipse (1995) begins with a scene in which a barman prepares absinthe for Paul Verlaine, played by David Thewlis. *From Hell (2001) is a film about Jack the Ripper where Frederick Abberline (Johnny Depp) is depicted drinking absinthe laced with Laudanum. *Moulin Rouge! (2001) contains a scene prominently featuring absinthe and the \\"green fairy\\", a hallucination supposedly caused by the drink (and, in this film's case, portrayed by Australian pop star Kylie Minogue and voiced by Ozzy Osbourne.) * In Murder by Numbers (2002), Michael Pitt and Ryan Gosling's characters ritually consume absinthe, as Pitt's character muses on the drink's historically mind-altering properties. *In Alfie (2004), Jude Law and Susan Sarandon's characters consume absinthe in one scene. *In EuroTrip (2004), characters Scott, Cooper, and Jamie drink absinthe while in a club. The drink is shown glowing an electric green, and its consumption causes hallucinations in some of these characters - one of which is a little green fairy (played by Steve Hytner). * In Van Helsing (2004), Gabriel Van Helsing and Anna Valerious share a drink from a bottle of absinthe prior to falling into a cavern. *In Blood and Chocolate (2007), Gabriel and several other Loup Garou consume absinthe in the bohemian manner at a popular Romanian bar that their pack frequents. *In Dorian Gray (2009), a glass of absinthe with an absinthe spoon and a sugar cube atop the spoon lies on the table while Dorian is having his painting done. *Get Him to the Greek (2010) features a scene where the main character Aaron Green gets highly intoxicated on 20th-century absinthe. *In the Swiss-German film Sennentuntschi (2010), the three farmers used absinthe to imagine a straw made sex doll come to life, which is based on real Alpine traditions. *In The Immigrant (2013), Bruno's \\"doves\\" get a reluctant, naive Ewa drunk on absinthe before her first performance, advising the drink will make things easier. *In Girls Trip (2017), an extended hallucination sequence takes place when the four central characters accidentally get drunk on absinthe. Video *Absinthe is featured in the video for Dance With Me by Roger Shah. Gaming *In the PC game Phantasmagoria (1995), heroine Adrienne Delaney discovers a bottle of absinthe in the wet bar of the mansion she and her husband came to occupy. As the game progresses, she will periodically see its amount draining while her husband simultaneously becomes more and more odd, implying he has been the one drinking it. * In the popular video game Max Payne, the designer drug Valkyr or simply V seems to be modelled on Absinthe. Users experience hallucinations where the predominant colour is green. Note that green is the colour of Absinthe and the liquor is also notorious for reportedly inducing sometimes fatal hallucinations. *In the game Fallout: New Vegas, Absinthe is a rare consumable item which boosts Perception instead of Strength. Literature =Classic literature= As prominent as absinthe's influence on visual art was, it is perhaps even more noteworthy in the context of 19th-century literature. Below is a short list of important authors who credited a portion of their literary success to the drink. *Baudelaire was an avid absinthe drinker. Though he never wrote specifically about absinthe he did reference it in his famous poem \\"Get Drunk\\".Absintheliquor.com *Guy de Maupassant was a naturalistic French author. He is generally considered one of the greatest French short story writers. In one famous work of prose, \\"A Queer Night in Paris\\", he describes the smells and sensations of absinthe in the streets of Paris and makes an overt reference to \\"the hour to take absinthe\\". *Ernest Dowson was an important English poet who notably wrote a poem dedicated to absinthe called \\"Absinthia Taetra\\". *Ernest Hemingway features absinthe in the short story \\"Hills Like White Elephants\\" (1927), and in For Whom the Bell Tolls (1940), disappointed with the quality of other liquor available, Robert Jordan turns to absinthe while fighting with the loyalist guerrillas. Hemingway himself was a frequent absinthe drinker and most likely procured his absinthe from Spain and Cuba after the ban.Conrad III, Barnaby; (1988). Absinthe History in a Bottle. Chronicle books. p. 137. *Alfred Jarry is notably the author of the French absurdist play, Ubu Roi. Jarry claimed to use absinthe to \\"fuse together the dream and reality, art and lifestyle\\". The drink was purported by the author to be a key part of his creative process. *Arthur Rimbaud was a young Parisian poet who was notably involved in a homosexual relationship with Paul Verlaine; they famously drank large quantities of absinthe together. Their relationship ended when Rimbaud was shot in the hand by Verlaine, who was then sentenced to prison. Later in life Rimbaud quit drinking absinthe and writing poetry and instead became involved in military exploits and gun running. He is still regarded as one of France's greatest poets. *Paul Marie Verlaine was a famous Parisian poet of the Bohemian style. Though he wrote extensively about the benefits of absinthe in his early years, he later claimed to have consorted with prostitutes and men while drinking it, and blamed the beverage for his downfalls. Even when he was on his deathbed, his friends were said to be hiding bottles for him under his pillow. *Oscar Wilde was an avid absinthe consumer and often wrote about the drink in connection with the creative process. Wilde has been quoted as saying, \\"What difference is there between a glass of absinthe and a sunset?\\"\\"Absinthe History in a bottle\\" Barnaby Conrad III (1988) and \\"After the first glass [of absinthe] you see things as you wish they were. After the second, you see things as they are not. Finally, you see things as they really are, and that is the most horrible thing in the world.\\" =Contemporary literature = *Dennis Wheatley included an absinthe session in his novel about the outbreak of the Great War in 1914, The Second Seal (1950). Wheatley was a wine merchant for many years, with a wide stock of spirits and liqueurs as well, and always put much information on the subject in his books. His hero the Duke de Richleau has been sent by British Intelligence on a mission to Vienna. He has to foil a plot by the Black Hand to disturb the peace of Europe, and so of course must concentrate his thoughts: > Instinctively he walked back across the Ring to Sachers. There he went up to > his room, sat on his bed for a while, then rang for the waiter and ordered a > double Absinthe. When it arrived, he added sugar and water and slowly drank > the opal fluid. It had no more perceptible kick in it than lime juice, or a > diluted paregoric cough mixture which it resembled in flavour, but he knew > it had hidden properties which would act like a drug in clearing and > accelerating his brain. *An absinthe hallucination may or may not have inspired a murder in The Second Glass of Absinthe (2003), a mystery novel by Michelle Black, set in 1880 Leadville, Colorado.Black, Michelle, The Second Glass of Absinthe. Macmillan. . *Asinthe lends the name to Kyell Gold's novel Green Fairy. The substance is the driving force in Dangerous Spirits, in which multiple protagonists make use of it to commune with spirits. *Gemma Doyle, the main character of Libba Bray's 2007 sequel Rebel Angels (set in 1895), drinks absinthe with her friends at a Christmas ball and experiences hallucinatory effects. *The characters in Poppy Z. Brite's short story, \\"His Mouth Will Taste of Wormwood\\", discover a crate of absinthe, the consumption of which forms the backdrop against which their transgressive antics occur. The short story can be found in Swamp Foetus. Characters in her book Lost Souls also drink absinthe. *The Absinthe Cloud (LePage/Dupuy #1, 2012) is a spy thriller by Timothy Everhart. *Absinthe figures heavily into the plot of the novel The Basic Eight (1999), by Daniel Handler, which features Bohemian characters who are drawn to absinthe by its dangerous history.Handler, Daniel; (1999). The Basic Eight. Thomas Dunne Books. . *I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell (2006) contains a story in which the author, Tucker Max, experiences absinthe for the first time. *The Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child character Aloysius Pendergast displays an affinity for absinthe in multiple novels. Music * Barbara (1930-1997) the popular French female singer wrote and composed, with Fr√©d√©ric Botton, and sang \\"l Absinthe\\", a song published in her 12th album ' (1972). This song is a love song, a bit sad and nostalgic -sadness is Barbara's trademark-, where the singer explains to a lover that drinking absinthe helps, at last to feel in love, to render love joyful, just like it helped Rimbaud and Verlaine to write their poetry (a recurrent comparison, all along the song). *Marilyn Manson has been an avid fan of absinthe since the recording of the Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death) album.\\"Go green with Marilyn: Drowned In Sound - Thurs 28 Sep 2006 absinthe news article\\".

Definition The British Arts and Humanities Research Council has stated that \\"projects that can be defined as practice-led or applied\\" are those \\"where creative practice is integral to the project or it is undertaken with the specific goal of producing a defined research output ‚Äî for example, new or improved systems, designs, artefacts, exhibitions, performances, events, products, processes, materials, devices, services, films, compositions, broadcasts, policy guidance ‚Äì that will be utilised beyond the research base.\\" In the UK, in Drama, Dance and the Performing Arts these issues have been the subject of an Arts and Humanities Research Board (now Council) -funded project at Bristol University. According to the Bristol University PARIP site, \\"practice as research (PAR) and practice-based research (PBR) ‚Äî and 'research through practice', 'research by practice', 'performance as research' ‚Äî are contested terms that resist close definition. Practice as research and practice-based research are frequently used interchangeably to suggest a relationship of research between theory and practice.\\" Dissemination and review Screen media practice research is disseminated in a variety of ways: at academic conferences (for example, the Joint Annual Conference of Media, Communications and Cultural Studies Association (MeCCSA), now incorporating the Association of Media Practice Educators (AMPE)); through academic publication; through relationships with cultural and creative industries (such as film festivals, broadcast, online communities, and creative partnerships). In the UK there was a debate on whether submissions of practice research for peer review needed to be supported by a written statement evidencing the research, or whether the artefact could stand alone as research. According to the AHRC Review of Research Assessment (September 2003), there was need for a clearer articulation of the research process ‚Äî including research methods, context and significance ‚Äî in practice-led research that was submitted to the RAE in 2003. The Arts and Humanities Research Council suggested that \\"practice-led research\\" should incorporate a scholarly apparatus that enabled other researchers to assess the value and significance of the results and that completed work should maintain a record or \\"route map\\" of the research process. Similarly the Communication, Cultural and Media Studies Panel Report on the UK's Research Assessment Exercise for 2003 valued practice that could give \\"a reflexive account of itself as research\\", but found that many practitioners did not explain the ways in which the work constituted original investigation.

The Panacea Society was a millenarian religious group in Bedford, England. Founded in 1919, it followed the teachings of the Devonshire prophetess Joanna Southcott, who died in 1814, and campaigned for Southcott's sealed box of prophecies to be opened according to her instructions. The society believed Bedford to be the original site of the Garden of Eden. History The notice placed in The Daily Telegraph by the society on the outbreak of the Second World War on 4 September 1939. The Society's inspiration was the teachings of the Devonshire prophetess Joanna Southcott (1750‚Äì1814). It was founded by Mabel Barltrop (1866-1934) in 1919 at 12 Albany Road, Bedford. A clergyman's widow, Barltrop declared herself the 'daughter of God', took the name Octavia and believed herself to be the Shiloh of Southcott's prophecies. Barltrop had originally heard of Southcott via a leaflet written by Alice Seymour. She and 12 apostles founded the Society, originally called the Community of the Holy Ghost. A central purpose of the Society was to persuade 24 Anglican bishops to open Southcott's sealed box of prophecies, and to this end, advertisements were placed in newspapers, both national and local. In the late 1920s and early 1930s the Society generated over 100,000 petitions for the box to be opened. The Society claimed to be in possession of the original box. The Panaceans also believed that the one that was opened in 1927 and found to contain a broken horse pistol and a lottery ticket, was not the genuine box. During the 1930s the membership began to dwindle as did Alice Seymour's smaller rival group. Despite this, the group continued placing adverts in newspapers calling for action from the Church of England. In the 1970s the Society rented billboards which proclaimed \\"War, disease, crime and banditry, distress of nations and perplexity will increase until the Bishops open Joanna Southcott's box.\\" Another main activity of the Panacea Society was to offer healing of all diseases, including cancer, to those who would write to its headquarters in Bedford and receive a piece of linen blessed by Octavia. They were instructed to put the linen in a jug of water, pray, and drink this \\"Water A\\" four times a day. Water A could then be diluted with additional water, producing \\"Water B,\\" which should be applied to the body as bath water or through sponges. From 1924 to 2012, some 130,000 applicants received the pieces of linen for free, and were only asked to write back and report on the results of the cure. The correspondence, coming from all over the world, is still conserved in the Bedford Panacea Museum, and has been studied in 2019 in a book by British scholar Alastair Lockhart. The Society's allotments. The members claimed Bedford to be the original site of the Garden of Eden. Premises The Society had its headquarters on Albany Road, close to the remains of Bedford Castle. Another property, an end-of- terrace house on Albany Road named The Ark, was maintained as a residence for the Messiah after the Second Coming. Although small in size, the Society was relatively wealthy, owning several properties in the Castle Road area of Bedford. By 2001, when the Society started to sell off some of its property in order to retain its status as a charity, it was reported to have assets valued at ¬£14m. Membership In the 1930s, about 70 members were said to be living in the Bedford community. In 1967, the Bedfordshire Times reported about 30 members living there.Bedfordshire Times report, October 1967 The last member of the Society, Ruth Klein (1932-2012), died in 2012, when the Society ceased to exist as a religious community. Charitable trust Whilst the religious society is no longer functioning, there still exists a charity whose main remit is to sponsor academic research into the history and development of prophetic and millenarian movements, as well as provide financial assistance to support the work of registered charities and recognised groups concerned with poverty and health in the Bedford area. The charity officially changed its name to The Panacea Charitable Trust in 2012. Panacea Museum The Founder's House at the Panacea Museum viewed from the garden. In late 2012, it was announced that the charitable trust would be opening a museum detailing the history of the society, at 9 Newnham Road, Bedford. The Panacea Museum is in ‚ÄòCastleside‚Äô, a Victorian house that was part of the community's headquarters. It tells the story of the Panacea Society and other similar religious groups. The museum also incorporates several other buildings, set within the gardens, that formed the original community's ‚Äòcampus‚Äô. The museum is open every Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday between February half term and the end of October.

The fire started from a spark from a torch that was being carried up High Street. The town's small population, the close-packed nature of the environment, and the amount of combustible building material all lead to the fire's start and spread, and the limited fire-fighting methods of the time helped transform the small torch fire into a catastrophic event.  Damage  The Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick was severely damaged by the fire. The fire progressed through Castle Street, Market Street, and High Street until it was halted by the 0.5 metre thick stone walls of the former Lord Leycester Hotel on Jury Street. If the fire had not been stopped by the church and struck the suburbs, it would have burnt all the way to the edge of town. The original estimates had the financial damage totaling around ¬£90,000‚Äì¬£120,000 and the physical damage at around 250‚Äì460 houses, but later the Book of Estimates had the damage at 157 houses totaling between ¬£40,000‚Äì¬£60,000.  Effects on architecture  The Great Fire of Warwick made builders review the way they constructed buildings. The Fire Act of 1694 established new rules and regulations on architecture. The Act stated that public streets and roads should all be made a certain regulated width. It also provided regulations for a standard house design: two storeys of 10 feet in height each with cellars and garrets. This gave the town of Warwick symmetry, uniformity, and a new flair. The fire caused an urban design revolution of sorts. The post-fire homes in Warwick also got rid of the jetted fa√ßades and the concept of timber-framed construction in which floors of buildings overhung each other. The town gave compensation to those whose property was destroyed by the street widening process just so that the Fire Act rules would be followed. The beautiful post-fire buildings are credited to Francis and William Smith. In 1695, William was appointed as the surveyor for the fire council. Although he was officially appointed just to follow the council's orders, William took some direction to oversee the rebuilding himself. William throughout his life had a lasting legacy on Warwick, twice serving as the city's mayor from 1713‚Äì1714 and 1728‚Äì1729. Francis joined his brother in the reconstruction of St. Mary's Church, but later became a successful architect, overseeing the project of the new courthouse. Francis also had a lasting impact on the town. Francis served on the Town Corporation in the 1720s and was the head of maintenance during the 1730s until he died in 1738. The Smith brothers had a lasting impact on the new and beautiful architecture of Warwick and passed on the tradition of architecture to their sons.

Like RUP, the ICONIX process is UML Use Case driven but more lightweight than RUP. ICONIX provides more requirement and design documentation than XP, and aims to avoid analysis paralysis. The ICONIX Process uses only four UML based diagrams in a four-step process that turns use case text into working code. A principal distinction of ICONIX is its use of robustness analysis, a method for bridging the gap between analysis and design. Robustness analysis reduces the ambiguity in use case descriptions, by ensuring that they are written in the context of an accompanying domain model. This process makes the use cases much easier to design, test and estimate. The ICONIX Process is described in the book Use Case Driven Object Modeling with UML: Theory and Practice. Essentially, the ICONIX Process describes the core \\"logical\\" analysis and design modeling process. However, the process can be used without much tailoring on projects that follow different project management.  Overview of the ICONIX Process  The ICONIX process is split up into four milestones. At each stage the work for the previous milestone is reviewed and updated. = Milestone 1: Requirements review = Before beginning the ICONIX process there needs to have been some requirements analysis done. From this analysis use cases can be identified, a domain model produced and some prototype GUIs made. = Milestone 2: Preliminary Design Review = Once use cases have been identified, text can be written describing how the user and system will interact. A robustness analysis is performed to find potential errors in the use case text, and the domain model is updated accordingly. The use case text is important for identifying how the users will interact with the intended system. They also provide the developer with something to show the Customer and verify that the results of the requirements analysis were correct . = Milestone 3: Detailed Design Review = During this stage of the ICONIX process the domain model and use case text from milestone 2 are used to design the system being built. A class diagram is produced from the domain model and the use case text is used to make sequence diagrams. = Milestone 4: Deployment = Unit tests are written to verify the system will match up to the use case text, and sequence diagrams. Finally code is written using the class and sequence diagrams as a guide.  References  * 1. Rosenberg, D. & Stephens, M. (2007). Use Case Driven Object Modeling with UML: Theory and Practice. Apress.

The show featured the Famous Studios/Harvey Comics character Baby Huey. 26 episodes were produced by combining old theatrical Famous Studios cartoons and new made for TV shorts. These were the first Baby Huey cartoons since the 1959 theatrical cartoon \\"Huey's Father's Day\\". Huey was voiced by Sid Raymond. The first season was produced by Carbunkle Cartoons, a company which did animation on selected episodes of The Ren and Stimpy Show for seasons one and two. Each episode usually consisted of a new 8 minute short followed by two classic Harveytoons (the first featuring Herman and Katnip and the second featuring Baby Huey) and a clip from another classic Harveytoon. The second season was produced by Film Roman, and thus had different writers and directors (Pat Ventura chief amongst them). Joe Alaskey was cast in the title role, instead of original star Sid Raymond from the first season who had originated the voice in 1949. In addition to a new Baby Huey short, each episode contained an uncredited \\"Richie Rich Gems\\" vignette, featuring Richie Rich with guest appearances by Reggie, Tiny, Pee-Wee, Freckles, Cadbury, Professor Keenbean, Gloria and Dollar. One Baby Huey television cartoon from the first season was also rebroadcast during each second-season episode. Each episode also contained a theatrical Baby Huey or Herman and Katnip cartoon from Famous Studios. Plot A large, dimwitted baby duck wreaks havoc on those who he comes in contact with as his attempts to help and or play result in hilarious consequences. Huey is often unaware of the havoc he is causing, maintaining an innocence even as a hungry fox attempts - and fails - to eat him.

The series combines elements of mystery and fantasy as it follows the adventures of private investigator Garrett. Plot introduction Garrett is a hardboiled detective living in the city of TunFaire, a melting pot of different races, mixed breeds, cultures and religions, though humans predominate. When desperate people have nowhere else to turn, they sometimes go to him for help. Plot summary In the Karentine city of TunFaire, Garrett is approached by the Tate family. Denny Tate, an old army buddy of Garrett's, has died in a accident. In his will, Denny left an enormous fortune in silver, acquired through insider trading, to a woman his family knows nothing about, Kayean Kronk. Denny's wealthy father Willard Tate tries to hire Garrett to locate Kayean, who is believed to be living in the Cantard, the battleground of a generations-old war between the kingdoms of Karenta and Venageta. Having survived his mandatory five-year service there (which many do not), Garrett wants no part of it. Then Denny's partners try to steal the silver and his writings, the latter so they can continue operating as before. For the 10% executor's fee and also to be reunited with Kayean Kronk (a teenage fling of Garrett's), Garrett reluctantly heads off to the Cantard with his half-dark elf friend and assassin Morley Dotes, who has his own agenda, and the Roze triplets. Denny's beautiful cousins, Rose and Tinnie Tate, try to tag along, but Garrett forcibly sends them back. When they arrive in Full Harbor, a major Karentine base/city, Garrett makes inquiries, but nobody wants to talk about Kayean, not even her brother. Eventually, he discovers that Kayean has loyally followed her husband when he and his brother joined a nest of vampires. A centaur named Zeck Zack, who sometimes works with the vampires, and several other parties become involved. After forcing the truth out of Zack, Garrett and his gang set out to rescue Kayean. In a desperate battle, Garrett retrieves her (as well as Rose and Tinnie Tate and Garrett's friend Saucerhead Tharpe) from the vampire lair. Morley also takes Kayean's brother-in-law prisoner. They return to TunFaire, where Garrett delivers Kayean to the Tates. Willard Tate hires TunFaire's foremost expert to cure her. Meanwhile, Morley, with Garrett and Saucerhead Tharpe along as guards, delivers the vampire he captured (currently dormant for lack of sustenance) to the kingpin of the criminal underworld of TunFaire. It turns out that the vampire was the kingpin's right-hand man, until he and his brother fled with half of the kingpin's treasure. The kingpin, expecting to see a corpse (in exchange for forgiving Morley Dotes' transgressions), is instead killed by the famished vampire. With his new riches, Garrett purchases the house he has been living in with the Dead Man, a murdered Loghyr. However, a Loghyr's spirit can linger for almost indefinitely after death, in the Dead Man's case for four centuries and counting.

The institute was founded in 1988/1989https://estinst.ee/en/about-us/estonian-institute/ as a shadow foreign office for the Estonian independence movement by Lennart Meri, later first foreign minister and first president of Estonia after their Soviet occupation. Current director of the institute is Katrin Maiste.https://estinst.ee/en/about-us/estonian-institute/ The Institute currently employs a dozen persons, who work either in the Tallinn main office or branches abroad in Finland (Helsinki, founded in 1995)https://estinst.ee/en/about-us/estonian-institute-in-finland/ and Hungary (Budapest, est. 1998);https://estinst.ee/en/about-us/estonian-institute-in- hungary/ previously, the Institute had offices in Sweden (1999-2011) and France (2001-2009). Also 3 teachers of the Estonian language and culture work outside Estonia.https://estinst.ee/en/about-us/estonian-institute/ The contributors include several prominent people of their field as authors of the texts, editors, board members, designers and creators of information technology applications. The basis of the activities of the Estonian Institute as a non-governmental institution is its constitution. The work is directed by the General Meeting and the Governing Board elected for three years. The Board elected in September 2017 includes Katrin Maiste (Chairman), Liina Luhats, and Mart Meri. As of September 2017 the non-profit organisation has 37 members. The Estonian Institute is supported from state budget via the Ministry of Culture. This is supplemented by targeted financing from various sources for specific undertakings. The teaching of Estonian language and culture is organised in close cooperation with the Ministry of Education and Research. The Estonian Institute is member of the European Union National Institutes for Culture EUNIC. The Institute‚Äôs activities rely on the principles of the code of ethics of Estonian non-governmental organisations.  History  The foundation of the Estonian Institute as civic initiative in the late 1980s derived from the practical need to establish permanent international contacts, which would no longer be controlled by the Soviet authorities. The plan compiled in summer 1988 by Lennart Meri listed the tasks of the Institute as follows: developing permanent cultural and educational foreign relations and introducing Estonia abroad. On 4 October 1988, the cultural council of the creative associations whose purpose was to restore Estonia‚Äôs independence, decided to found the Estonian Institute. The official permit was granted in April 1989, and thus for the first six months the Institute operated thanks to the work of volunteers and the support of Estonia‚Äôs friends. During its first years, the Estonian Institute partly fulfilled the role of a hotbed for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the future Estonian diplomats. The Institute‚Äôs information and culture points operated in various places in Western Europe and Scandinavia, and quite a few developed into an embassy of the Republic of Estonia in the course of restoring diplomatic relations. Soon things took their normal course and the Institute focused on conveying information about Estonia and promoting its culture. Supported by the state, it has become a serious institution to carry out cultural politics.  Activities  The aim of the Estonian Institute is to spread information about Estonian society and culture in other countries, further cultural and educational links and organise the teaching of Estonian language and culture outside Estonia. Over the years the Institute has published dozens of information booklets and periodicals about Estonia, compiled web pages, organised festivals, exhibitions, conferences and seminars, received journalists, researchers and lecturers, translators and writers, opened culture and information centres in other countries, granted scholarships, despatched lecturers of Estonian language and culture to universities abroad and supplied the study centres with relevant material. Presently, the institute's main areas of activity are publishing diverse brochures, organising cultural events abroad and maintaining several web sites, which include the online encyclopaedia Estonica and the Estonian cultural events calendar Culture.ee. The Estonian Institute also organises conferences, festivals, exhibitions and seminars about Estonian culture, replies to Estonia-related queries, and receives translators, journalists, researchers, writers, and lecturers.

Biography Quennessen was born near Paris in Boulogne- Billancourt, of Jewish French/Polish parentage, and dedicated much of her childhood to pursuing her dream of becoming an acrobat. She quickly reached a level of competence and received an award for her expertise at the age of ten. By her teens, she had given up acrobatics and enrolled in acting classes, not because she particularly wanted to get into show business, but to help her overcome social anxiety. She found that she not only overcame her shyness via acting, but she also enjoyed performing. She studied drama first briefly at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des arts et techniques du th√©√¢tre, then at the Conservatoire National d'Art Dramatique, in Paris, from 1976 to 1979, and appeared in several theater productions, notably Chers Zoiseaux, by Jean Anouilh, which premiered in 1976, and Pirandello's Nuova colonia (1977). She made her first film appearances in a pair of 1976 French films: Le Petit Marcel and Le Plein de super. Although she would continue to appear in the occasional French film and television show, in 1979 she landed one of the main roles in the American film French Postcards (Willard Huyck), working alongside the yet-to-be famous Miles Chapin, Debra Winger and Mandy Patinkin. She followed up that film by playing Princess Yasimina in John Milius's 1982 film Conan the Barbarian with Arnold Schwarzenegger in the title role. It would be her next film, Randal Kleiser's Summer Lovers, that was the peak of her career for American audiences. This story of a love triangle on the Greek island of Santorini also starred Peter Gallagher and Daryl Hannah. During the filming of the movie, in which she played Lina, an archaeologist, Val√©rie is said to have discovered several pieces of pottery at the Akrotiri site that were more than 3,500 years old. Shortly after Summer Lovers, Val√©rie Quennessen appeared in the short We Cannes, filmed during the 1982 film festival by Fran√ßois Manceaux, then gradually retired from acting, choosing to concentrate on raising her family. She and Francois Manceaux had two children, Antoine and Elsa. On March 19, 1989 she died in a car accident on the A13 highway in Saint-Ouen-des-Champs at the age of 31.

As capital of Shannan City, it \\"...exercises direct control over the affairs of 13 counties: Gongkar, Tranang, Nedong, Changye, Tso-me, Lhodrok, Nakartse, Zangri, Chutsum, Lhuntse, Tsona, Gyatsa and Nang.\\"Dorje (2009), p. 219. Tsetang has been the capital of the Yarlung region since antiquity and was the seat of the ancient emperors of Tibet and, as such, a place of great importance. In the 19th century, it is said to have comprised some 1,000 houses, a bazaar, a gompa and a fort.Das (1902), p. 228 and note. As the capital of Shannan, it is the second-largest settlement in the historical √ú-Tsang region. It lies at an elevation of above sea level and has a population of approximately 52,000 persons.Mayhew (2005), p. 153. It is only about to the northeast of the town of N√™dong and they have now essentially merged into one city.Buckley (1986), p. 153. Tsetang is situated near the flank of Mount Gongbori () where many ancient ruins are located. It is known as the cradle of Tibetan's civilization. Samye, Tibet's first monastery, is located only from Tsetang and was founded in 779 CE by King Trisong Detsen. The 14th century monastery of Tsetang, Ganden Ch√∂khorling, was originally Kagyupa but was taken over by the Gelugpas in the 18th century. It was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s but has been restored since. Ngamch√∂ is also a Gelugpa monastery and contains the bed and throne of the Dalai Lama and has a chapel devoted to medicine. The Samten Ling and Drebuling monasteries of the Sakyas still remained in 1959 but have since been destroyed and mostly built over. There is, however, the reconstructed Gelugpa Sang-ngag Zimche Nunnery, in the ruins of Samten Ling with a 1000-armed statue of Chenresig (Avalokiteshvara) said to have been made by Emperor Songtsen Gampo (605 or 617? - 649 CE).Mayhew (2005), p. 153. The town supposedly dates back to the founding of the Tsetang Gompa in 1351 which became an important centre of learning.Dowman (1988), p. 174. One of three caves in the mountainside to the east of the town is said to be the birthplace of the Tibetan people who resulted from the mating of a monkey and a beautiful cannibal ogress. About south of Tsetang is Changzhug Monastery founded during the reign of Songtsen Gampo and about further is Yumbulagang which, according to legend, was built as a palace for the first king, Nyatri Tsenpo, and was the first building in Tibet. There are several hotels and a guesthouse in Tsetang.Buckley (1986), pp. 153-156. Footnotes References * Buckley, Michael and Strauss, Robert. Tibet: a travel survival kit.

The body is covered in fur except for the undersides of the wings. Males and females are dimorphic in body mass, with females 40% heavier than males. Behavior The bat normally roosts alone on trees, hidden in the foliage, but on occasion has been seen in caves with other bats. It prefers woodland, mainly coniferous forests, but hunts over open areas or lakes. It hunts alone and its main food source is moths. The bats can cover an impressive while foraging. Hoary bats are long- distance migrants, spending the winter in Central America and the southwestern United States and the spring and summer in more northern latitudes in the United States and Canada. Reproduction The reproductive cycle of the hoary bat is not yet fully documented, but it is thought that they mate in August with birth occurring in June of the following year. It is thought that the gestation period is only 40 days and that mammalian embryonic diapause (delayed implantation) may play a role. The female bears a single pup, or sometimes twins. The young spend about a month with the mother before dispersing. Conservation While not listed as threatened or endangered, hoary bats suffer significant mortality from wind turbines. Across the United States in 2005, 40% of all bats killed by wind turbines were hoary bats--over 1000 hoary bats were killed in 2005. Most bat deaths occur during migration in the spring and fall. One common theory explaining this is that bats are attracted to the tall structure, possibly believing them to be trees that can be used for rest.

He played college football at West Virginia University. He graduated from Martinsburg High School and West Virginia University. Professional career On defense, Walker recorded five interceptions during his career, which he returned for 62 yards. His main contributions came as a punt and kickoff returner on special teams, recording a total of 145 punt returns for 1,437 yards and 167 kickoff returns for 3,779 yards and a touchdown. Walker's best season was in the strike shortened nine-game season of 1982, when he recorded three interceptions on defense and 433 kickoff return yards, assisting his team to a championship appearance in Super Bowl XVII. In 1985, he recorded an NFL record 692 punt return yards. This would stand as a record until 1996 when it was surpassed by Desmond Howard's 870 yards. Walker is best remembered for his performance on special teams in Super Bowl XVII and Super Bowl XIX. In Super Bowl XVII, Walker recorded four kickoff returns for 190 yards and a touchdown, setting Super Bowl records for most kick return yards and highest single game yards-per-return average (47.5). This included a record 98-yard kickoff return for a touchdown in the second quarter, the first kickoff ever to be returned for a touchdown in Super Bowl history. He also had a 42-yard return that set up a Dolphins field goal. His contributions helped the Dolphins maintain a lead in the game until late in the fourth quarter, despite Miami quarterback David Woodley being limited to just four completions in the entire game. In Super Bowl XIX, Walker contributed 93 kickoff return yards and 15 yards returning punts. Life after football In honor of his special teams highlights, the West Virginia Sports Writers Association gives out the Fulton Walker Award each year to the state's top high school special teams player. Walker was born and lived in Martinsburg, West Virginia, where he was the victim of a violent break-in at his home in August 2013. One of the men involved in the crime, during which Walker was beaten and assaulted, was sentenced to 18 years in prison. Walker died in Martinsburg on October 12, 2016.

Acton citizens had a significant role in the Battle of Lexington and Concord, the prelude to the American Revolution. Acton's history reflects the major events that were occurring in Massachusetts, New England, the United States, and the world. Early settlement The rivers that run through Acton were used by Native Americans as part of their annual migration patterns thousands of years ago. A Native American archaeological site was discovered in Acton in 1999 which produced evidence of habitation dating back 7000 years. This site has been named the Pine Hawk site and is one of the oldest archaeological sites in New England. Before the English colonists settled in this area, the Massachuset tribe of the Algonquins lived in eastern Massachusetts. The group who lived in the Acton area were members of the Pawtucket people. They practiced swidden agriculture where they would use a field for several years until soil fertility dropped and then move to another field. Around 1615, an epidemic killed almost 90% of the Native Americans in eastern Massachusetts. The description of the symptoms lead current historians to believe that this disease was viral hepatitis introduced by European traders and sailors.Mann, Charles C. (2005, December) \\"Native Intelligence\\". Smithsonian Magazine, p. 102. The epidemic had such a huge impact because the native residents had no resistance to European diseases. A smallpox epidemic swept through in 1633 and further devastated the region.Acton Historical Society: \\"A Brief History of Acton\\", page 53. Beacon Publishing Company, 1974. Colonial Acton The first colonial settlement in this area was Concord which was incorporated in 1635. Concord, which was the first inland settlement of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, encompassing the present day towns of Acton, Lincoln, and Carlisle. Concord sits at the junction where the Assabet and Sudbury rivers combine to form the Concord River. Concord farmers used the land which is now Acton as grazing fields for their animals. The first permanent residents of Acton settled the area in 1639; siting their residences among the pastures that ran along the Nashoba Brook flood plain. They were farmers who needed to be closer to the grazing fields for their animals. They called this section of town Concord Village. In the mid-17th century, colonists began a program of converting Native Americans to Christianity. The converted Indians were settled into towns which were known as 'Praying Indian Towns'. One of these towns (Nashobah) was located on the land around Fort Pond from Nagog Pond around both sides south to Fort Pond Hill. The eastern part of Nashobah straddles the town line between Acton and Littleton. Nashobah was also known as Newtown resulting in the present-day confusion of Newtown Road Acton and Newtown Road Littleton, both of which lead to the north slope of Fort Pond Hill. When King Philip's War (1675‚Äì1676) broke out, the Praying Indians were considered with suspicion by the colonists. In October 1675, the General Council in Boston ordered that all Praying Indians be removed from their towns and taken to Deer Island in Boston Harbor. They were released in 1677 when King Philip's War was over. Residents of the Massachusetts Bay Colony were required to attend Sunday Services and to support through taxation the colony's official religion: Congregationalism. With travel along colonial roads difficult, the Sunday attendance requirement became a burden for the residents of what would become Acton. These residents petitioned the Colony's legislature, the General Court, for the right to have their own meeting house (aka Church) and hire their own minister. With the approval of the General Court, Acton was incorporated as an independent town on July 3, 1735. Acton has held Annual Town Meetings since 1735 and the records of those Town Meetings are held at Acton's Memorial Library (). American Revolution In the period before the outbreak of hostilities with Great Britain that eventually led to the American Revolution, the relations between colonists and Great Britain grew increasingly strained. In May 1774, the British Parliament passed a law which made it illegal for colonists to hold Town Meetings and to legislate their own affairs. In defiance of this law, the Town of Acton held a series of Town Meetings where they elected a representative to the illegal Provincial Congress and began to raise a local militia unit. The Town of Acton sent a list of grievances to King George III on October 3, 1774. The anniversary of this day is celebrated in Acton as Crown Resistance Day a marker Isaac Davis Monument At the beginning of the American Revolutionary War, on April 19, 1775, a company of minutemen from Acton responded to the call to arms initiated by Paul Revere (who rode with other riders, William Dawes and Samuel Prescott, with Prescott the only one of the three who was able reach Acton itself) and fought at the North Bridge in Concord as part of the Battle of Lexington and Concord. The Acton minutemen were led by Captain Isaac Davis. When a company was needed to lead the advance on the bridge which was defended by the British regulars, Captain Davis was heard to reply, \\"I haven't a man who is afraid to go.\\" The colonists advanced on the bridge. The men from Acton were in the front lines, since they were the only company completely outfitted with bayonettes. In the exchange of musket fire that followed, Captain Isaac Davis and Private James Hayward were killed and Abner Hosmer, also of Acton, was mortally wounded. Thus, Isaac Davis was the first officer to die in the American Revolutionary War. Each year on Patriot's Day (the 3rd Monday in April), the Acton Minutemen lead a march from Acton Center to the Old North Bridge in Concord. This route is known as the 'Isaac Davis Trail' and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Since the 1960s, The Scouters of the Isaac Davis Trail have organized an annual Patriot's Day campout and march on the Isaac Davis Trail. The 1800s: Industrialization and Civil War After the Revolutionary War, Acton continued to grow in population. By the mid-19th century, Acton was an industrial center for the production of barrels (cooperage). There were also three grist mills and four saw mills in town. While several of these mills were sited on Fort Pond Brook in South Acton, several of them were sited on Nashoba Brook in the North and East Acton areas of town. The fulling mill at Mill Corner was one of the first large-scale manufacturers of woolen cloth in the country. Gun powder mills (1835-1940) were located along the Assabet River, in the southernmost part of Acton. This operation became well known as American Powder Mills, with business offices in Boston and Chicago.Acton Historical Society: \\"A Brief History of Acton\\", page 33. Beacon Publishing Company, 1974. The towns of Acton and Concord were also instrumental in the development of the modern day pencil industry. Concordian William Munroe is credited with being the first to manufacture wooden pencils in the United States in 1812. Acton resident Ebenezer Wood found Munroe's manufacturing methods painstakingly slow and set out to automate the process at his mill on in North Acton, along the old Davis Road. Wood became the first to use a circular saw to speed the cutting and a gluing process that could make 144 pencils at once. His process improvements created pencils in either hexagonal or octagonal shapes. These shapes have become standard. Wood never patented his invention and shared his improvements with others, including Eberhardt Faber of New York. Faber became the country's leading manufacturer of pencils. In the latter half of the century, industry continued to grow in Acton with the establishment of a cigar factory and a piano stool factory Acton Conversation Commission, Early American Pencils, Kiosk at Pencil Mill Site In 1843, the railroad came to Acton. The Fitchburg Railroad was routed through South and West Acton so that it could serve the mills. South Acton became a busy commerce center with the construction of the Marlborough Branch Railroad. The branch ran from South Acton through Maynard, Stow and Hudson to reach its terminus in the city of Marlborough. The increased traffic led to further commercial development in the area, such as the establishment of the Tuttle Store and the construction of Exchange Hall. The Tuttle Store was a precursor to modern day department stores. In addition to the Fitchburg Railroad, two other railroads bisected Acton: the Framingham and Lowell and the Nashua, Acton & Boston. The Framingham and Lowell was part of the Northern Division of the Old Colony Railroad which eventually became a subsidiary of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Rail Road (a.k.a. The New Haven Railroad). The Nashua, Acton & Boston ran from Concord Junction (aka West Concord) to Nashua, through Westford and Dunstable. These two railroads shared a double track right-of-way that runs along Nashoba Brook to North Acton where they diverged near the North Acton Station, which was located at the end of Harris Street. The Framingham and Lowell right-of-way is now known as the Bruce Freeman Rail Trail and is various stages of completion. In 1850, the Fugitive Slave Act was passed. In response, Acton Town Meeting passed a set of resolutions condemning the Act. The governor of Massachusetts, John C. Andrew, urged all towns to prepare their militia units for the threatening war. On April 12, 1861 the Civil War Began. > On April 15, President Lincoln issued a call for 75,000 volunteers. By 7:30 > the next morning, Captain Tuttle with his entire command of 52 men reported > to Lowell, fully equipped and ready for duty. Company E of Acton of the 6th > Massachusetts Militia was to be the first company of the first regiment of > the Union Army to arrive in Washington in response to the President's > call.Acton Historical Society: \\"A Brief History of Acton\\", page 35. Beacon > Publishing Company, 1974. In addition, the Acton reservists were among the troops at Fort Sumter when it was fired upon. In 1874, the population of the town was almost 1700. The town established its first newspaper The Acton Patriot and the residents of West Acton formed the first library The Citizen's Library. In 1890, the Memorial Library was completed and given to the town by William A. Wilde as a memorial to the Acton soldiers who fought in the Civil War. The 1900s: The Growth of Suburban Acton =1900-1950 = At the beginning on the 20th century, Acton had approximately 2120 residents. The primary business of the town was agriculture. The 20th century saw substantial growth and change in the town. In 1912, after prolonged debate, a Water District was established which provided water initially to the West Acton and South Acton villages. At this time, each of the five villages had its own fire department. On July 22, 1913, there was a very serious fire in West Acton. It destroyed houses, barns, businesses and factories. The whole village might have burned if not for the newly installed water system. After the fire, Town Meeting voted to establish a town-wide volunteer fire department. Acton had excellent roads due to a contribution from a former Acton resident - Alvin Nothrop. He had grown up in Acton before moving to Washington D.C., where he became a successful merchant. He donated money to the town of Acton to purchase a stone crusher for improving local roads. Because of this contribution, Acton had water-bound macadam highways long before its neighbors.Acton Historical Society: A Brief History of Acton, page 42. Beacon Publishing Company, 1974. With the advent of the Automobile, the railroads serving East and North Acton fell into decline. The Nashua and Acton line was completely abandoned in the mid-1920s while passenger service ceased on the Framingham and Lowell line in the 1930s with the last vestiges of service on the line occurring to North Acton lumberyards in the early 1990s. This line too, has been formally abandoned. The Framingham and Lowell line is in the process of being converted into a rail trail, with the Acton portion scheduled for 2015. The Board of Health was instituted in 1901 and its first task was to administer the smallpox vaccine to the children in the local schools. Each village in Acton had its own grade school but the town struggled with how to provide a high school education for its students. For most of the early 20th century (until 1925), Acton students were sent to Concord's high school. In 1925, Acton population was large enough to sustain its own high school, which was built on Massachusetts Avenue (rt 111) near the intersection of Main Street (rt 27). The building, which still stands, was converted into use as an elementary school and then, in 2012, was converted into residential housing. = 1950-2000 = The last half of the 20th century saw enormous growth and change in Acton. In 1950, the town had a population of 3,500 which grew to 17,000 by 1974. This was largely caused by the growth in industry in suburban areas - facilitated by the construction of Route 128. Acton did not attract a large number of industrial sites because of the limited water supply. Instead, Acton became a bedroom community with an increased housing demand due to two main factors, the Baby Boom and the Cold War. As GI-Bill educated women and men in Boston and its inner suburbs entered the employment sector they found housing in their hometowns expensive and tight leading many to look beyond State Highway 128 which was being absorbed into the Interstate system as s portion of Interstate-95. At the same time, the Cold War expansion of Fort Devens, Hanscom AFB, and Natick Labs accompanied by the growth of high technology DoD contractors spurred a large increase in college-educated professionals seeking housing within commuting distance. To meet this demand and benefit financially, a lot of Acton's farmland began to turn into housing developments. In 1954, the Town established a Planning Board which developed regulations regarding the development of subdivisions. The first large subdivision was Indian Village (built on the southern slope of Fort Pond Hill - bisected by Route 2 in 1952 - and the adjacent flatland) in West Acton in 1955. Other notable subdivisions include Patriots Hill (located between Route 2 & the town center - which was heavily expanded upon in the late 90s), Minuteman Ridge (located off Massachusetts Avenue [Route 111], Forest Glen (located near the Stow border), and The Arbors (located off of Great Road or Route 119 / 2A). Smaller subdivisions were built as individual farmers sold their orchards, chicken farms, and dairy farms to developers. Acton's increasing housing stock and willingness of farmers to sell their land continued to drive growth through the 1950s and into the 1970s. Alongside the Dod contract-fueled high technology innovation and development, commercial and non-DoD government contracts spurred a robust civilian high tech and information industry that was expanding in office parks along Rt 128/I 95 in the 1960s through 1980s and then along Interstate 495 in the late 1980s till present. Digital Equipment Corporation's establishment in the Maynard Mills made Acton an attractive place live and drove development of the apartment buildings and condominiums in town. Between 1965 and 1975, all the truck farms along 2A, which were the most commercially profitable farms in town were replaced by shopping centers and apartment buildings. Nagog Office Park (1974) further hastened the development of the Rt 2A corridor as a retail and office building location. This thriving civilian sector allowed Acton to better weather the Nixon Administration's dramatic cutting of Federal Agency presence in the Commonwealth (NASA leaving Cambridge, Boston Navy Yard closing) in revenge for the 1972 election as well as the Post-Vietnam recession that hit other DoD fed areas (Tidewater Virginia, Seattle, St Louis, and San Diego, for example). The population in the town doubled between 1950 and 1960 (from 3500 to 7000). It doubled again in the next decade. This increase made Acton look at its public schools to expand. In 1953, new schools were constructed to accommodate the growth in the student population. In 1957, Acton and Boxborough created a regional school district for grades 7 -12 (Littleton pulled out of the planned regional district halfway through the planning process). The Merriam School was constructed in 1958. Other schools quickly followed (Douglas (1966), Gates (1968), and Conant (1971)). In 1967 a building was constructed for the Junior High. In 1973 a huge addition was added to this building and it became the high school (the junior high moved to the old high school building). In the 1990, it was clear that both the Merriam and the McCarthy Towne buildings were obsolete. In 1998, the town constructed a single replacement building, called the Parker Damon Building, to house both schools. The school run separate programs but share gym and cafeteria space. The Blanchard foundation gave Acton the money to construct Blanchard Auditorium for the town's High School, the building has since been converted to the R. J. Grey Jr High School. The Auditorium, which also doubles as gym, was used to hold Town Meeting until the new (current) High School Auditorium was constructed. In the last quarter of the 20th century, conservation also became a driving factor in the development of the town. A desire to protect existing open-space combined with the need for additional recreation areas led the town to acquire and set aside over for conservation purposes. This included the development of the North Acton Recreation Area (NARA) in the late 1990s. NARA provided the town with its first outdoor beach and swim area as well as a significant space for playing fields and an outdoor amphitheater. In 2011 NARA was renamed after Nathaniel Allen, an Acton resident who was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for his actions during the Civil War. 2000s: Continued Suburban Growth  In the early 21st century Acton continued its population growth including the addition of the Canterbury Hill development, located near the borders with Carlisle & Westford, that contain over 90 houses. This was followed by the building of 153 homes on a portion of the Quail Ridge Country Club, located off Great Road (route 119 / 2A). These developments may represent a bit of a watershed in Acton's development as the availability of other open tracts is limited. In 2012 the towns of Acton and Boxborough began exploring the complete regionalization of the towns school by absorbing Boxborough's Blanchard Elementary school into the system.

Plot  Casper the Friendly Ghost is a \\"guardian ghost\\" to two female Space Police officers named Mini (who is a rather ditzy redhead) and Maxi (who is a much more intelligent African-American woman with a very short temper) who patrol the Jetsons-style Space City on their flying motorcycles in the year 2179. They are joined by the rambunctious but good-hearted Hairy Scarey, a large, shaggy, thousand year old ghost with a red nose and big bow tie who enjoys scaring people, especially villains and other troublemakers, but because he has a great deal of affection for his little pal Casper he, unlike most of their ghostly kind, tries to accept the fact that the gentle ghost does not like to scare people. Less accepting, especially toward Mini and Maxi, are their fellow officers Nerdley and Fungo, a pair of bumbling, flying patrol car-driving male chauvinists who are always trying to prove that they are superior to their female counterparts, only to have their efforts undone by their own stupidity and cowardice.  History  The show was apparently Hanna-Barbera's second attempt to cash in on the popularity of Charlie's Angels as well as the popularity of the motorcycle police drama CHiPs, the first being Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels on ABC. Twenty-six 15-minute segments shown as thirteen 30-minute episodes were produced, as well as two television specials Casper's Halloween Special and Casper's First Christmas.

An All-Ireland medallist in both codes, he later won a combined total of three All-Ireland medals with the under-21 teams. Barry-Murphy made his senior football debut during the 1973 championship. He went on to play a key role for Cork in attack and won one All-Ireland medal, four Munster medals and one National Football League medal. Barry-Murphy's eleven-year career with the Cork senior hurlers saw him win five All-Ireland medals, a record-equaling ten Munster medals and two National Hurling League medals. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on two occasions. As a member of the Munster inter-provincial team in both codes, Barry-Murphy won a combined total of five Railway Cup medals. Throughout his inter-county career he made 57 championship appearances. Barry-Murphy retired from inter-county activity on 2 April 1987. Following a successful tenure as manager of the Cork minor team, culminating in the winning of the All-Ireland title, Barry-Murphy was appointed manager of the Cork senior team in October 1995. His first tenure saw a return to success, with Cork winning one All- Ireland Championship, two Munster Championships and one National League, before stepping down as manager on 8 November 2000. Barry-Murphy subsequently enjoyed unsuccessful tenures as coach with the St. Finbarr's and Cloughduv club teams. Over a decade after stepping down as Cork manager, Barry-Murphy was appointed for a second stint as Cork manager on 7 September 2011. Once again his managerial reign saw a return to success, with Cork winning one Munster Championship. On the 26 August 2015 Barry Murphy was inducted into the GAA Hall of Fame. Early life Coming from a family of six - including brothers John, Denis, Barry and sisters Miriam and Frances - Barry-Murphy was born into a family steeped in hurling tradition. His granduncle, Dinny Barry- Murphy, was the most successful of the family. He captained Cork and won four All-Ireland titles in the 1920s and 1930s. His grandfather, Finbarr Barry- Murphy, also played with Cork while his father, John Barry-Murphy, won an All- Ireland title in the junior grade with Cork in 1940. He was educated at Colaiste an Spiorad Naoimh in Bishopstown, where he enjoyed little success at colleges level. Club career Barry-Murphy played his club hurling and football with the famous St. Finbarr's club on the south-side of Cork city. In a hugely successful career spanning two decades, he won every honour in the game. =Hurling= After a largely unsuccessful underage career with 'the Barr's', Barry-Murphy had joined the club's senior team by 1972. His career got off to an inauspicious start that year when he was sent off in a club game and received a two-month suspension. In 1974 Barry-Murphy won his first county club championship winners' medal following a 2-17 to 2-14 defeat of arch- rivals Blackrock. He later collected a Munster winners' medal before making a clean sweep by adding an All-Ireland winners' medal to his collection following a 3-8 to 1-6 defeat of the Fenians. Another clean sweep of hurling titles followed for Barry-Murphy in the 1977-78 club championship season. A 1-17 to 1-5 trouncing of north-side rivals Glen Rovers was followed by a Munster final victory over Sixmilebrisge after a replay. He subsequently added a second All-Ireland winners' medal to his collection. His goal from a rebound in that game was the deciding factor in sealing the victory over Wexford‚Äôs Rathnure. After a brief hiatus St. Finbarr's were back in the big time again in 1980. Barry-Murphy won a third county club championship winners' medal as Glen Rovers fell in the final. A third Munster title was later annexed before facing Ballyhale Shamrocks in the All-Ireland final. Not even a late goal from Barry-Murphy, however, could seal a victory over the Kilkenny outfit and 'the Barr's' lost by 1-15 to 1-11. That 1980 county club championship success was the first of three such victories-in-a-row for Barry-Murphy and St. Finbarr's. He won his final county championship in 1988 following a 3-18 to 2-14 defeat of old rivals Glen Rovers. =Gaelic football= Barry-Murphy's club football career began at under-age level in 1971 when he won a Cork Minor Football Championship winners' medal following a defeat of St. Colman's. Two years later in 1973 he added a club football under-21 championship winners' medal to his collection when 'the Barr's' defeated Bandon by 4-6 to 2-6. At senior level Barry-Murphy won his first county club championship winners' medal in 1976 following a 1-10 to 1-7 defeat of St. Michael's. Three years later in 1979 St. Finbarr's made a clean sweep of football titles. Barry-Murphy collected a second club football championship winners' medal before securing a Munster winners' medal following a defeat of Kilrush Shamrocks. A subsequent 3-9 to 0-8 defeat of St. Grellan's gave Barry-Murphy an All-Ireland winners' medal. That victory gave him the distinction of being a dual All-Ireland club medalist. The 1980-81 club championship season saw St. Finbarr's make another clean sweep of county, provincial and All-Ireland titles. They were his last major victories as a member of 'the Barr's' senior football team. Inter- county career Barry-Murphy enjoyed a hugely successful dual career with Cork. From his debut with the senior football team in 1973 to his retirement from the senior hurling team in 1986, he won every honour in the game. =Gaelic football= He first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Cork minor football team in 1971. He won his first Munster winner' medal that year before later lining out in the All-Ireland decider. Mayo provided the opposition and defeated Cork by 2-15 to 2-7. Barry-Murphy was still eligible for the minor grade again in 1972. He added a second Munster winners' medal to his collection that year before later playing in his second consecutive All-Ireland final. Tyrone were the opponents, however, Cork claimed the title by 3-11 to 2-11. After joining the Cork under-21 football team, Barry-Murphy enjoyed further success. After back-to-back defeats in the provincial deciders of 1972 and 1973, he finally secured a Munster winners' medal in 1974 following a defeat of Kerry. By this stage Barry-Murphy had joined the Cork senior football team. He was just eighteen years old when he made his senior championship debut in 1973. It was a successful year for the young player as he won his first Munster winners' medal following a 5-12 to 1-15 thrashing of arch-rivals Kerry. Barry-Murphy later lined out with Cork in an All-Ireland final against Galway and proved to be one of the stars of the game, scoring the first of his two goals after just two minutes. One of these goals, where he receives a pass, cheekily solos the ball and waits to pick a spot in the net was chosen as one of RT√â's Top 20 GAA Moments in 2005. Cork eventually defeated Galway by 3-17 to 2-13 and Barry-Murphy collected an All- Ireland winners' medal. Barry-Murphy won a second consecutive Munster winners' medal in 1974 and it appeared that Cork footballers were about to become a dominant force. Their championship ambitions came to an end in the All-Ireland semi-final with a defeat by eventual All-Ireland champions Dublin. Cork's footballers lost the next six Munster finals against a resurgent Kerry team. In spite of this lack of championship success Barry-Murphy added a National League winners' medal to his collection in 1980. He retired from inter-county football later that same year. =Hurling= Barry-Murphy's inter-county hurling career began as a member of the Cork minor hurling team in 1971. He won a Munster winners' medal in that grade that year before later playing in the All-Ireland final. A 2-11 to 1-11 defeat of Kilkenny gave Barry-Murphy an All-Ireland winners' medal. 1972 saw Cork make it three-in-a-row in Munster, with Barry-Murphy winning his second consecutive provincial winners' medal. He later lined out in a second consecutive All-Ireland decider. Kilkenny gained their revenge for the previous year's defeat by winning the game by 8-7 to 3-9. After joining the Cork under-21 hurling team, Barry-Murphy enjoyed further success. He won a Munster winners' medal in this grade in 1973 before playing in his first All-Ireland final in that grade. Wexford provided the opposition, however, Cork won by 2-10 to 4-2 and Barry-Murphy secured an All- Ireland winners' medal in that grade. Two years later in 1975 Barry-Murphy added a second Munster under-21 winners' medal to his collection before playing in his second All-Ireland final. Kilkenny, however, won the game by 5-13 to 2-19 in what was Barry-Murphy's last game in the under-21 grade. 1975 also saw Barry-Murphy make his championship debut for the Cork senior hurling team. He won his first Munster senior winners' medal that year following a 3-15 to 0-12 defeat of Limerick. Cork later looked set for an All-Ireland appearance; however, Galway secured a shock victory. The following year Barry- Murphy secured a second Munster winners' medal with another huge 4-14 to 3-5 win over Limerick. This victory allowed Cork to advance directly to the All- Ireland final where Wexford provided the opposition. Cork got off to the worst possible start in an All-Ireland final and trailed by 2-2 after six minutes. Cork battled back, however, the game hung in the balance for much of the seventy minutes. With ten minutes left Wexford were two points to the good, however, three points by Barry-Murphy, two by Pat Moylan and a kicked effort from captain Ray Cummins gave Cork a 2-21 to 4-11 victory. It was Barry- Murphy's first All-Ireland winners' medal. In 1977 Barry-Murphy won a third consecutive Munster winners' medal before lining out in a second All-Ireland final. Wexford were the opponents once again and, like the previous year, the game turned into a close, exciting affair. A Se√°nie O'Leary goal, together with some brilliant saves by goalkeeper Martin Coleman helped Cork to a 1-17 to 3-8 victory and a second All-Ireland winners' medal for Barry-Murphy. Cork dominated the championship again in 1978 with Barry-Murphy winning a fourth consecutive Munster winners' medal. This victory paved the way for Cork to take on Kilkenny in the subsequent All-Ireland final. The stakes were high as Cork were attempting to capture a first three in-a-row of championship titles since 1954. Cork were never really troubled over the course of the seventy minutes and a Barry-Murphy goal helped the team to a 1-15 to 2-8 victory over their age-old rivals. It was his third All-Ireland winners' medal. In 1979 Cork were invincible in the provincial championship once again with Barry- Murphy winning a fifth successive Munster title following a 2-15 to 0-9 defeat of Limerick. Cork's quest for a record-equaling four-in-a-row came to an end with a defeat by Galway in the All-Ireland semi-final. Cork lost their provincial crown in 1980, however, Barry-Murphy continued with his winning ways by capturing a National Hurling League winners' medal. He won a second National Hurling League title in 1981, however, Cork were defeated in the provincial championship once again. In 1982 Cork were back and Barry-Murphy, who was now captain of the team, won his sixth Munster winners' medal following a 5-31 to 3-6 trouncing of Waterford. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Cork take on Kilkenny and in spite of being underdogs Kilkenny won courtesy of two Christy Heffernan goals in a forty-second spell. In 1983 Cork‚Äôs run of provincial success continued. Barry-Murphy won a seventh Munster winners' medal before leading his team in a second All-Ireland final against Kilkenny. Kilkenny dominated the opening half while Cork came storming back with goals by Tom√°s Mulcahy and Se√°nie O'Leary. 'The Cats' eventually won by two points. 1984 was a special year in the annals of Gaelic games as it was the centenary year of the Gaelic Athletic Association. The year began well with Barry-Murphy helping his team to victory in the special Centenary Cup competition. An eight Munster winners‚Äô medal soon followed for him as Cork defeated Tipperary by 4-15 to 3-14 in a memorable Munster final. The subsequent All-Ireland final, played at Semple Stadium in Thurles, saw Cork take on Offaly for the first time ever in championship history. The centenary- year final failed to live up to expectations and Cork recorded a relatively easy 3-16 to 1-12 victory with Barry-Murphy winning his fourth All-Ireland winners' medal. Barry-Murphy added a ninth Munster winners' medal to his collection in 1985, however, Galway shocked Cork once again in an All-Ireland semi-final. By 1986 Barry-Murphy was entering the twilight of his career. That year a defeat of Clare by Cork made it five-in-a-row in Munster, with Barry- Murphy collecting a record-equaling tenth provincial winners' medal. An All- Ireland final against Galway with the men from the west being regarded as the red-hot favourites against an ageing Cork team, however, on the day a different story unfolded. Four Cork goals, one from John Fenton, two from Tom√°s Mulcahy and one from Kevin Hennessy, stymied the Galway attack and helped ‚Äòthe Rebels‚Äô to a 4-13 to 2-15 victory. It was Barry-Murphy's fifth and final All-Ireland winners' medal. On 2 April 1987, Barry-Murphy announced his retirement from inter-county hurling. The announcement, edged in black, was spread across page one of the national newspapers in a style more familiar to the death of world leaders. The first modern Gaelic games superstar had finally retired. Inter-provincial career Barry-Murphy was a regular with the Munster inter-provincial football team between 1974 and 1979. After losing out at the semi-final stage in his debut year, he went on to win four Railway Cup winners' medals in-a-row over the next four seasons. The quest for a fifth successive title ended with a defeat in the final. After leaving the inter- provincial football team Barry-Murphy was picked for three successive seasons as a member of the inter-provincial hurling team. He won a Railway Cup winners' medal in that code in his final year on the team in 1981. Soccer Barry-Murphy played soccer with his local club, Wilton. He also lined out with Cork Celtic, the losing FAI Cup finalists of 1969, and had a successful few months. Managerial career In retirement from inter-county activity Barry- Murphy became a popular analyst on The Sunday Game in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In the mid-1990s he took charge of the Cork minor hurling team. Barry- Murphy oversaw an upturn in success for the county in this grade. In his first year in charge in 1994 he guided the county to a Munster title, however, his side were later defeated by Galway in the All-Ireland final. In 1995 Barry- Murphy's side retained their Munster title. The subsequent championship decider saw Cork take on old rivals Kilkenny. On this occasion the All-Ireland title went to Barry-Murphy's team. =Cork= Barry-Murphy's success at minor level led him to being appointed manager of the Cork senior team in late 1995. The appointment of Tom Cashman and Johnny Crowley as selectors led to the managerial team being referred to as the 'dream team.' Barry-Murphy's tenure in charge of his county's senior team got off to a less than successful start. In their opening game of the Munster Championship Cork were defeated by Limerick at P√°irc U√≠ Chaoimh. Even more humiliating was the fact that it was the first time in 75 years that Cork had been beaten at home in the championship. Things improved slightly in 1997. In the Munster semi-final Cork were trailing Clare by a single point and looked capable of winning or at least securing a draw. With just a few second remaining Clare scored a goal and ended Cork's championship hopes for another year. In 1998, the defeats of the previous two seasons put Barry-Murphy and his selectors under pressure to deliver. A successful National Hurling League campaign saw Cork reach the final of that competition and defeat Waterford in the final. This success meant that the team went into the championship with great expectations, however, the Munster semi-final saw Clare defeat Cork on a score line of 0-21 to 0-14. For the sixth year in-a-row Cork had failed to make it to the All- Ireland series. 1999 was make-or-break year for Barry-Murphy. He introduced a host of new players and one of the youngest Cork teams ever took to the field in the championship. The Munster final saw Cork take on Clare, a team that had defeated them at the semi-final stage in 1997 and 1998. Clare entered the game as the red-hot favourites and as possible All-Ireland contenders, however, a younger Cork team finally triumphed and Barry-Murphy finally led his team to a senior Munster title. Cork defeated reigning All-Ireland champions Offaly by three points in the All-Ireland semi-final before reaching the championship decider with Kilkenny. The game, played in atrocious conditions, proved to be an anti-climax. Cork were victorious by a single point and Barry-Murphy had finally led his county back to the All-Ireland title. In 2000 Barry-Murphy's Cork retained their Munster title. In spite of Tipperary scoring three goals Cork outscored Tipp by 0-23 to 3-12. Once again, the experts predicted a Cork- Kilkenny final, however, Offaly were waiting in the All-Ireland semi-final and duly defeated Cork. This was Barry-Murphy's last game in charge as he resigned as manager shortly afterwards. On 6 September 2011, Barry-Murphy was re- appointed as Cork Senior Hurling Manager with a contract until the end of the 2014 campaign. Cork won their first Munster hurling title since 2006 in 2014 but lost out to Tipperary in the All-Ireland Semi-final. In October 2014, it was confirmed that Barry-Murphy would be staying on until the end of the 2016 season. In August 2015 Barry Murphy announced that he had stepped down as manager of the Cork Senior Hurling team. Tributes flowed in from GAA figures in Cork and nationwide. His four seasons in charge had seen Cork win one Munster title, reach two Allianz Hurling League Finals, two All Ireland Semi- Finals and the 2013 All Ireland Hurling Final. Personal life He currently works as a director for Southern Business Finance where his colleagues include All-Ireland winners Dinny Allen and Brian Murphy. Barry-Murphy is married to Jean Kennefick, daughter of All-Ireland-winning captain Mick Kennefick, and they have four children - Brian, Deirdre, Ann and Orla. Apart from Gaelic games he has a major interest in greyhound racing and is a director of Cork Greyhound Stadium.

He had previously served in various local and state level offices in Maryland, including as a commissioner and county councilman of Prince George's County. Hughes' 1979 gubernatorial candidacy was a long-shot, and he had a hard time recruiting a running mate; Bogley was reportedly the tenth person he asked. Even before taking office, the two clashed over abortion rights, which Hughes supported and Bogley opposed. Bogley was required to promise in writing not to contradict Hughes on any issue during their term. For his second term, Hughes chose Sen. J. Joseph Curran Jr. as his running mate and Bogley ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor in the Democratic primary with gubernatorial candidate Sen. Harry McGuirk. After leaving office as Lieutenant Governor, Bogley practiced law in Beltsville, Maryland. In September 1988, President Ronald Reagan nominated him to serve on the Merit Systems Protection Board. The 100th Congress did not act on the nomination before adjourning for the year in October. Bogley received a one-year recess appointment to the board in November 1988, good until the next congressional adjournment. When the 101st Congress convened in January 1989, the departing President Reagan renominated Bogley. His recess appointment expired in November 1989 and his nomination was withdrawn by the Bush administration in January 1990. 35 years after leaving office as Lt. Governor, Bogley filed as a candidate for Prince George's County Executive in February 2018. He finished last out of nine candidates in the June 26, 2018 Democratic primary, receiving just 0.2% of the votes cast. Bogley received his education from Duke University, the University of Maryland, College Park, and the University of Baltimore School of Law. He received his Juris Doctor degree from the University of Baltimore in 1967, and was admitted to the Maryland Bar in 1968. He married Rita Brady and has eight children.

The special features guest stars Yogi Bear, Boo-Boo, Huckleberry Hound, Snagglepuss, Quick Draw McGraw, and Augie Doggie and Doggie Daddy. It aired on NBC on December 18, 1979. The theme song (\\"Comin' Up Christmas Time\\") sung by Yogi's pals was used again a year later in Yogi's First Christmas, which contradicts the events of this special in which Yogi and Boo Boo (who, being bears are supposed to be hibernating in the winter) can be seen celebrating Christmas with the other cast members. This also marked the first and only time that this special pairs together the characters from its owners, Hanna-Barbera and Harvey Entertainment. Like many animated series created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show contained a laugh track created by the studio. Network Ten aired the special in Australia. Plot Casper and his friend Hairy Scarey are in a house about to be demolished on Christmas Eve and go out to look for a new place to move to after Christmas in California. Then Yogi and his friends get lost and arrive at Casper and Hairy's house and clean and decorate it to celebrate Christmas. Then Casper befriends Yogi and company only for Hairy to try to ruin the party with Casper and his new friends. Then Hairy has a change of heart and celebrates Christmas with Casper and his new friends and ending with Santa Claus saving the house and turning it into Hairy's Haunting Lodge.

The calibre was 13.5 inches (343 mm) and the barrels were 45 calibres long i.e. 607.5 inches (15.43 m). The guns were greatly superior and unrelated to the earlier 13.5-inch (30-calibre) Mk I to Mk IV guns used on the , and es completed between 1888 and 1896. Background The gun was developed in response to the relative failure of the British high-velocity 12-inch Mk XI and XII guns. Unlike Germany, which developed and deployed successful high- velocity 12-inch guns, Britain in this case switched to guns firing larger and heavier shells at lower velocity which could achieve similar performance in range and armour penetration but could deliver a heavier explosive charge on impact. Characteristics Q turret of the battlecruiser in June 1916 after damage at the Battle of Jutland. The turret mounted two Mark V guns. The gun was wire-wound and weighed approximately 168,000 lb (76 tonnes) (excluding the breech), and in its original form fired a 1,250 lb (567 kg) armour-piercing capped (APC) or high-explosive (HE) round a distance of 23,800 yards (21,800 m) at a 20-degree elevation.navweaps.com - 13.5-in/45 Mark V Variants Due to the excellent characteristics of the gun, it was decided to increase the weight of shell to 1,400 lb (635 kg), with an increased firing charge to achieve about the same range. The gun firing the lighter shell was designated Mark V(L) (for \\"light\\") by the Royal Navy, and the 1,400 lb version Mark V(H) (for \\"heavy\\"). =Railway guns= Three BL 13.5 inch /45 Mark V guns, named Gladiator, Piece Maker and Scene Shifter, were mounted on railway chassis during World War II for use as railway guns.Dale Clarke. \\"British Artillery 1914-19.

The weapon was a 13.5 inch gun Mark V lined down to 8 inches; the liner projected several feet beyond the 13.5 inch barrel. The concept was suggested by F. A. Lindemann, Winston Churchill's scientific advisor.Maurice-Jones, p. 240 Due to its deployment near the heavy cross-Channel guns and manning by the Royal Marine Siege Regiment, it is often erroneously assumed to have been intended as a cross- Channel gun. It was initially named Wilfred, but this was soon changed to Bruce, after Admiral Sir Bruce Fraser.Sussex History Forum post with material from RMSR War Diary The projectiles were custom-made with external rifling to match the gun's rifling, with tighter tolerances than normal; this resulted in the need for a screwdriver-type tool to ram the projectiles. The rate of fire was very low as a result; but this was not a major concern in an experimental piece. Both High Explosive and High Velocity shells were made for the gun; the High Velocity shell was a smoke shell, intended to burst at high altitude. Observations of the smoke were used to study conditions in the stratosphere. The gun was first test-fired in June 1942 at the Isle of Grain, also in Kent. The gun was deployed near St. Margaret's on 21 January 1943 and experimental firing commenced on 30 March 1943. Successful experiments with smoke shells were conducted in February 1944. The intended burst zone for the smoke shells was horizontally from the gun and altitude. These trials resulted in the need for a new barrel or liner; the replacement took about two weeks. The data from these experiments was important in the development of the Grand Slam bomb.Flower, p. 95 After further experimental firings, the weapon was taken out of service in February 1945.

This station is run primarily by volunteers, supported financially by some Regina-area sponsors and by fundraisers. It also, in part, serves as an unofficial campus radio station for the University of Regina, actively soliciting volunteer participation among the university's student body as the school does not have its own campus radio station. Until CJTR signed on, Regina was the largest market in Canada without either a campus or community radio station. An attempt in 1995 to incorporate a campus radio station at the University of Regina was abandoned for financial reasons, and as a result of that project's failure, Radius Communications incorporated and continued to pursue a community radio license. The CJTR music garage sale is a big source of money for the station - yearlong they collect donations of CDs, records, stereo equipment, music-related books, clothing, DVDs and more, and then sell them at great prices in one big sale.

The lower limbs spread drooping from the trunk; these are long, slender, sparingly branched, and the branches are four-angled, loosely covered with large spreading leaves. Since the leaves are arranged in two ranks, the slender branches resemble petioles, bearing pinnae of a compound leaf; the leaves are further often recurved, and are deep green above, and almost white beneath. The large blossoms expand in April, exhaling a rank odour reportedly resembling asafoetida when they first burst, but they become inodorous before the petals drop. The stamens are all bent inwards in bud. The fruit is a large as a small apple. The wood is white and soft.Hooker p.56  Distribution  Native to India, Nepal, southern China, Myanmar and Malaysia.

He is regarded as one of the strongest leaders of the Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico (PDP). He was also a postal administrator, legislator, and composer (Tito Puente recorded one of his songs, although, in that regard, Cole is much better known for being the brother of composer Roberto Cole). Etching of Benjam√≠n Cole by artist Osvaldo Torres at Cruzacalles using photo shown above. Ancestry Benjamin Cole's father Frank belonged to an English family that emigrated to the United States when he was just a child. As an adult, Frank traveled to Puerto Rico when the United States established a provisional government there following its invasion of the island during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War of 1898. Cole was employed in the Federal Courts in San Juan, where he served as translator and marshall. He married Isabel Maria Vazquez, daughter of a prominent attorney from the city of Ponce. The couple established their home in Mayaguez. Belisa, as she was known to her family and friends, was a music teacher who taught her children to play piano, guitar, and other instruments from an early age. She and Frank had three sons, Robert, Benjamin and Lester, divorcing after the birth of the third one. Several years after their divorce Frank retired to San Jose, California, where he lived until his death. His last name took on the Spanish pronunciation and \\"Cole\\" became . Political beginnings Benjamin Cole had an interest in politics from a very early age, starting with an inclination towards the liberal tendencies of the leaders that favored independence for the island. He was one of the youngest members of the original Partido Popular Democratico when it was founded in 1938, and since then followed the leadership of Luis Munoz Marin. In his early career as a civil servant, Cole was a postmaster general for Mayaguez, for which he won the national award of Postmaster of the Year among all his cohorts in the United States. In 1960, Cole ran for office for the first time, to a position in the House of Representatives. His use of clever slogans and phrases, early use of electronic media, as well as his strong political machinery and astute use of political tools, gave him a strong voice within the PDP and in the island's political environment, and he won handily. Cole was a very skilled and eloquent public speaker, as well as a talented, quick-thinking debater and interviewee. Cole coined a phrase to depict the PDP's esprit de corps that is still used to this day: \\"¬°Fuego Popular!\\" (\\"Popular Fire\\"), a play on words that capitalized on the PDP's traditional campaign color (red), and the fact that the strength of his political power was in fact the average citizen. Some political historians claim that Luis Negr√≥n L√≥pez's poor acceptance levels as PDP gubernatorial candidate in 1968 were a direct consequence of Cole's use of the phrase \\"¬°Ju√©game el 315!\\" (\\"Play me 315\\") to depict him as a numbers game runner or \\"bolitero\\". Cole won the election for mayor of Mayag√ºez in 1968, and was subsequently reelected in 1972, 1976, 1980, 1984 and 1988. He won these contests using the same political tactics that, in part, derailed Negr√≥n's candidacy. Cole's strongest contender for the Mayag√ºez mayoralship, Jan Garc√≠a, was depicted by Cole as a \\"fake\\", since, in Cole's view, Dr. Garcia misrepresented himself to the citizens of Mayag√ºez by using the prefix \\"Dr.\\" (most voters had assumed Dr. Garcia was a medical doctor, when in fact he had a Ph.D. in Chemistry and was also a Juris Doctor). In Cole's view, Dr. Garcia's unwillingness to clarify this misrepresented him to the general voter. In another mayoral contest, Cole is known for saying: \\"I'd say my opponent is a thief and a liar... but I don't use that kind of language!\\". Benjamin Cole was a populist, often relating to the social needs of the poor and working classes of his city. This earned him many political enemies, from inside and outside his political party. His administration was repeatedly accused of corruption, and cleared of most charges. One accusation that was not cleared,Copy of Puerto Rico Supreme Court document requesting reimbursement of public funds by the PDP on Cole's case involved a person on city payroll working at the local PDP party clubhouse, although the charges behind this were also politically skewed and only settled many years after Cole's death. Slogans and campaign strategies Cole's main campaign strategies captured the essence of him as a populist, and tried to appeal to working-class people, picturing him as their \\"working class mayor\\". He made frequent use of slang phrases and slogans, and made a point of using simple language in public while almost always speaking in the third-person while describing his accomplishments. He appealed to common sense when describing current events and explaining public administration strategies, something that political observers acknowledged as being extremely effective, while critics dismissed as demagogy. An example of his style of campaigning is evidenced by his self-made political slogans. On latter campaigns for reelection, Cole's simple campaign motto was \\"Cole sigue\\" (\\"Cole continues\\"). Cole's best known musical jingle, a march, was composed by him; its main refrain: \\"Porque Cole es el alcalde / que ha hecho m√°s por Mayag√ºez / decimos con alegria: Cole sigue en la alcaldia\\" (\\"Since Cole is the mayor / who has done the most for Mayag√ºez / we gladly say / Cole goes on at City Hall\\") was featured in his weekly campaign TV show. In one airing, the show opened with the children from his family (his own kids, nieces and nephews) singing the jingle. Cole made extensive use of electronic media for campaigning, and refused to use posters, flyers or painted signs as part of his campaign propaganda, since he felt like such use would make his city dirty. Instead, he focused on neighborhood- specific community \\"rallies\\" and meetings, loudspeaker vehicles, television, radio and media outlets. On the other hand, Cole's political organization in Mayag√ºez was perceived by many to be the strongest of any mayoral candidate in Puerto Rico. Some of his ward leaders claim (to this day) to know the political affiliation of every one of their neighbors, a tactic that could allow scientific targeting of voters by background. Cole's Mayag√ºez Cole's skill for strategy served him well in office. One of his landmark accomplishments, which guaranteed that Mayaguez would receive federal funding on a scale otherwise reserved for major cities, was his handling of the city's status under the US Census. The Census Bureau separates cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants and these are granted higher federal funding as a way to guarantee economic development. In the first census during Cole's tenure, Mayaguez came short by about 7,000 people from reaching that mark. Cole argued, successfully, that the city's population status should be increased by counting the students at the University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez campus, who at the time were about 8,000. This kind of creativity allowed the city to receive hundreds of thousands of dollars more for public projects that would not have been given if Cole had not come up with such an argument, which is viewed by some as proof of Cole's entrepreneur spirit for financing his programme.Heine One of the major benefits of this determination came in the form of federal grants which allowed for urban development, most importantly Villa Sultanita, a housing complex created to help middle-class families own a home through municipal subsidies. During his first term as Mayor of Mayaguez Cole cemented the loyalty of the mass of voters by making certain that no community, however isolated or populated, was left without electricity, running water or proper sewage systems.Heine He also established a dam system for the Yaguez River, which used to flood frequently, often destroying property in the city. This in itself dramatically improved life in the urban areas. Cole authored the law that created the Mayaguez Zoo (first and only zoo in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean) when he was a legislator. Cole put emphasis in public works, improving local roads and pressuring the state legislature for funds to maintain state roads. As well, his administration developed many local landmarks in Mayag√ºez, including the Palacio de Recreaci√≥n y Deportes (the local sports arena), the Parque de los Pr√≥ceres (Mayag√ºez's largest park), the Ciudad del Retiro, the only independent living complex for moderate income seniors in the area, two public transportation terminals, a multi-storied parking garage, the Asilo de Beneficencia (better known for being the first home of Salvador Agron) and the Plaza del Mercado, the local site for the farmer's and produce market. The Cole administrations demolished two slums (the Palmita section of Barrio Barcelona, traditionally a municipal dump since the mid-1840s, and the Rabo del Buey slum in downtown Mayag√ºez) and promoted community redevelopment of these areas. He also promoted tourism with projects such as the acquisition and reconstruction of the Teatro Yag√ºez (the local municipal theater) and the remodeling of the city's center square -the Plaza Col√≥n- and Mayag√ºez City Hall. Children from all over the Caribbean continue to come to play today in a state of the art Little League baseball stadium where many inter nation tournaments have been held. One of the achievements that made Cole proudest was the municipal hospital, which had been a bare bones facility with very little to offer other than the simplest primary care, and under his tenure became a secondary, and in some cases, like pediatrics, a tertiary care facility, with the most advanced equipment in the area. Mayag√ºez was repeatedly awarded the status of Puerto Rico's Cleanest City during Cole's tenure. Most recent development projects in Mayag√ºez have centered around \\"renovating\\" the projects developed by Cole or developing projects that Cole left in early stages of completion. Family Benjam√≠n Cole had four children with his first wife, music teacher (and long-time organist for the Roman Catholic cathedral of Mayag√ºez) Angelina Sim√≥n. His sons with Sim√≥n were all professional musicians at one time or another, while his daughter was the voice-over announcer for WIPM-TV, the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) Public television station in the city. None were involved in politics. From this marriage there are many grandchildren, several involved in music like their grandparents, most notably Henry Cole, a famous percussionist and composer. Cole's second wife was his right hand and according to many his secret weapon in a long, undefeated career in Puerto Rico's contentious political world, where even mighty figures are easily met with failure.The Last Cacique, Jorge Heine Given many ad honorem roles by her husband as advisor and co-campaigner, Nereida Falto de Cole gained a reputation for being a blunt, tenacious political operative and a capable and strict public administrator. A figure of considerable influence in her own right, Nereida was known as the operational, grass roots arm to Benjamin's political efforts. She retired from a long, distinguished career in government, where she was the first woman to head a public corporation in Puerto Rico, the now defunct CRUV for public housing. At times, political adversaries tried to gain leverage from the fact that Nereida wielded so much influence in her husband's administration and campaigns. It was public knowledge that Nereida was involved in the majority of Cole's projects from their inception, helping him devise development strategies and proving a valuable ally with the oversight of operations, which was one of her areas of expertise. Given that she was such a knowledgeable public officer and speaker on her own, some went so far as to claim that Cole was merely a front man for his wife, and that the city of Mayag√ºez was being run by a woman (at a time when sexism was prevalent in politics and public life in Puerto Rico). Cole turned this claim into a boon for his campaign, admitting that by voting for him the city was getting two excellent leaders for the price of one. Cole's public acknowledgment of his wife as his most trusted advisor was an innovation in Puerto Rican politics that had not occurred before or since. However, the couple's teamwork in the city's affairs gained the full trust of voters and supporters, and the recognition and admiration of the political leaders of both parties. In matters of economic development, she was consulted and granted deference by the presidents of her party and those of the opposition. In fact, in his study of the trajectory and success of Cole's career, Professor Jorge Heine found that one of the key elements in Cole's accomplishments was his wife's involvement in his political and public affairs. After Cole's death, many people in the city and in the Popular Party asked Mrs. Cole to run for mayor of Mayag√ºez, but she declined, preferring to work in favor of the dispossessed from the non-profit sector as well as an entrepreneur in housing management and development. From his marriage to Nereida, Cole had three other children. The oldest, Nereida Ines, was employed by Senate President Miguel Hernandez Agosto and by the commonwealth's Cultural Institute. She was admired for her radio broadcasting during political campaigns, in which she showed the same wit and mordancy her father was known for. The second daughter, Evelyn, was a precocious public speaker and political organizer,Heine tapped by Governor Rafael Hernandez Colon to run a cabinet-level state agency at the age of 21, the youngest person in Puerto Rico to occupy such a position. Long expected to follow in her father's political footsteps, Evelyn, who is also an award-winning poet and writer, retired from public life in 1988. The youngest of the three, Harold Benjamin, is a commercial airline captain who flies internationally and has never been involved in public life. None of Nereida's children reside in Puerto Rico. Cole's Legacy Some political observers have likened Cole's political campaigning style as a cross between those of George A. Smathers (in both his speaking style and way to address opponents) and Richard J. Daley. Cole's political acumen and strong populist government made him the subject of a biographical book, Benjamin Cole - the Last Cacique: Leadership and Politics in a Puerto Rican City (a book of published by the University of Pittsburgh Press in 1994). The book was written by the current Chilean ambassador to India (also a former ambassador to South Africa), and former professor at the University of Puerto Rico - Mayaguez, Jorge Heine.

The series combines elements of mystery and fantasy as it follows the adventures of private investigator Garrett. Plot introduction Garrett is a hardboiled detective living in the city of TunFaire, a melting pot of different races, cultures, religions, and species. When people have problems, they often come to Garrett for help, but trouble has a way of finding Garrett on its own, whether he likes it or not. Plot summary The novel starts with Garrett being approached at his house on Macunado St. by a young woman named Amiranda Crest. She explains that her employer is the Stormwarden Raver Styx, whose son Karl daPena has been kidnapped. They want Garrett to organize the exchange between them and the kidnappers. The Domina Willa Dount, in charge while the Stormwarden is away, explains to Garrett that they only need him as a decoy, and apparently, Garrett's work is over. But when Garrett is attacked on his way home by a band of ogres, his interest in the matter is piqued. When the kidnapper's demands rise, Garrett is brought back in to give his expertise on the matter. It soon becomes apparent to Garrett that the members of the Stormwarden's family are all involved in the affair to some extent, as is a band of ogres led by a mysterious individual named Gorgeous. The link between the ogres and the dePenas appears to be a prostitute by the name of Donni Pell, who had both Karl daPena and Gorgeous as customers. Apparently, she orchestrated the kidnapping of Karl by convincing Gorgeous and his band of ogres to help. The transfer of funds with the kidnappers goes off without a hitch, but when Amiranda Crest is murdered and Karl daPena is found after allegedly committing suicide, Amber daPena comes running to Garrett for help. With the help of Morley, the Roze boys, and Kingpin Chodo Contague's skull crackers Crask and Sadler, Garrett storms Gorgeous' hideout, capturing Gorgeous and some of his cronies. The ogres, when faced with torture, offer some information into the kidnapping, and Chodo orders Donni Pell to be found and delivered to Garrett. When the Stormwarden returns to town, she comes first to Garrett to find out just what happened to her family. Garrett then manages to orchestrate a meeting between all the guilty parties, and in a masterful display of deductive reasoning, Garrett implicates Karl daPena Jr., Karl daPena Sr., Amiranda Crest, the Domina Willa Dount, Donni Pell, Gorgeous, and others all in a convoluted kidnapping scheme gone horribly wrong. With the truth out, the situation gets ugly fast, and Garrett and company flee the scene, letting city investigators clear the mess. At the end of it all, the Dead Man, in his infinite wisdom, sheds some light on the few remaining mysteries in the case.

Raised within a cosmopolitan family with roots in the Greek War of Independence but twice driven into exile by events, Valaoritis lived in Greece, the United Kingdom, France and the United States, and as a writer and academic he played a significant role in introducing the literary idioms of each country to the rest. The quality, the international appeal, and the influence of his work led Valaoritis to be described as the most important poet of the Hellenic diaspora since Constantine Cavafy.(22 October 2010) ŒëœÜŒπŒ≠œÅœâŒºŒ± œÑŒøœÖ ¬´ŒîŒπŒ±Œ≤Œ¨Œ∂œâ¬ª œÉœÑŒøŒΩ œÄŒøŒπŒ∑œÑŒÆ ŒùŒ¨ŒΩŒø ŒíŒ±ŒªŒ±œâœÅŒØœÑŒ∑, Eleftherotypia (in Greek), Retrieved November 1, 2010  Life  = Early years = Valaoritis was born to Greek parents in Lausanne in Switzerland in 1921 but grew up in Greece where he studied classics and law at Athens University. He was also writing poetry, and in 1939 when he was barely eighteen, he saw himself published in the pages of George Katsimbalis‚Äô review Nea Grammata alongside contributions from Odysseas Elytis and George Seferis, and was immediately taken into their literary circle. It was an ominous yet heady time, those early months of the war, during which Valaoritis was witness to the seminal encounter of Seferis and Katsimbalis with Henry Miller and Lawrence Durrell, which was to resonate within both Greek and Anglo-Saxon literature for years to come. = Training years = In 1944 Valaoritis escaped from German-occupied Greece across the Aegean to Turkey and from there through the Middle East to Egypt, where he made contact with Seferis who was serving the Greek government in exile as First Secretary of the Greek Legation in Cairo. In 1944, at the instigation of Seferis, Valaoritis went to London to develop literary links between Greece and Britain. He met T. S. Eliot, W. H. Auden, Dylan Thomas and Stephen Spender, and he worked for Louis MacNeice at the BBC. As well as studying English literature at the University of London, he translated modernist Greek poets, among them Elytis and Embirikos, and contributed to Cyril Connolly's Horizon and to John Lehman's New Writing. His own first volume of collected poems, E Timoria ton Magon (Punishment of Wizards), with decorations by John Craxton, was published in London in 1947. He paved the way for Seferis' success in the English-speaking world by editing and translating, along with Durrell and Bernard Spencer, Seferis' King of Asine which was published in 1948 to enthusiastic reviews. Then in 1954 he moved to Paris where, as well as studying Mycenaean grammar at the Sorbonne, he was prominent among surrealist poets under Andr√© Breton. Valaoritis met his wife Marie Wilson, one evening at a large gathering in Paris full of Greek writers and artists. Marie Wilson was an American surrealist artist, Marie is the author of Apparitions: Paintings and Drawings by Marie Wilson. Wilson was embedded in the surrealist movement, and had a very close relationship with Andre Breton and Picasso. Nanos moved in together and lived there for six years, leading to marriage, which has now continued for forty years. They had three children together. . = Back in Greece = In 1960 Valaoritis returned to Greece, and between 1963 and 1967 he was publisher and chief editor of the Greek avant-garde literary review Pali. But when the junta came to power in 1967, he felt he had no choice but to go into voluntary exile, and in 1968 he went to America where he became professor of comparative literature and creative writing at San Francisco State University, a position he held for twenty-five years. A self-described surrealist, Valaoritis sometimes creates a sense of carnival in his work through parody, pastiche and absurdity. But the bracket can be misleading, for surrealism alone fails to convey the depths of his mind and the richness of his work. As in photographs taken of Valaoritis so in his poetry you see at once the mage and the pirate, or the detached Olympian with an outsider's bemusement yet a man who can also be intensely lyrical and sensual. Once again Nanos Valaoritis lived in Greece, where he co- edited the literary review Synteleia (End of the World) and, optimistically, its successor Nea Synteleia (New End of the World) and published a remarkable body of work, including essays, translations, anthologies and books of poetry, short stories, a novella and four novels variously in Greek, English and French. His most latest novel, the bestselling Broken Arms of the Venus de Milo (Agra, Athens 2002), is a literary and historical romp which has a basis in a true family story, for the arms of the famous Venus were lost at sea when a French naval vessel stole the statue from an ancestor of Valaoritis, a Greek who was the chief dragoman of the Ottoman navy. Valaoritis‚Äô Anthology of Modern Greek Poetry, co-edited with Thanasis Maskaleris (Talisman, New Jersey 2003) is encompassing and commanding, an invaluable contribution to the dissemination of Greek poetry throughout the English-speaking world, while Pan Daimonium, his latest volume of poetry (Philos Press, Lacey, Washington State 2005) showed him as playful, wise and enigmatic as ever.

Matty's Funday Funnies is a 1959-1961 American animated cartoon compilation television series. The original Matty's Funday Funnies was broadcast from 1959 to 1961 by the American Broadcasting Company, scheduled during Sunday afternoons (with a 1960-1961 prime-time edition during Friday evenings, rescheduled for early Saturday nights for the autumn of 1961). The show originally featured 1950s Famous Studios theatrical cartoons with characters including Casper the Friendly Ghost, Herman and Katnip, Baby Huey, Little Audrey, Buzzy the Crow and other Noveltoons, whose beginning titles were refilmed as Harveytoons because Harvey Publishing Company had bought all the rights to the films and characters from Paramount company-- and had already used Casper and others as comic book characters. \\"Matty\\" referred to Matty Mattel, the animated boy mascot character for Mattel Toy Company, the show's original sponsor. Matty Mattel and Sister Belle would introduce the cartoons and show commercials for Mattel products. The series premiered on October 11, 1959, was later renamed Matty's Funnies, and was broadcast by the network until December 30, 1961. During the autumn of 1962, the show began local syndication (with new titles omitting Mattel's original sponsorship, along with \\"Matty\\" and \\"Sister Belle\\") as Casper and Company. On January 6, 1962, the program was replaced with a new Matty's series titled Matty's Funnies with Beany and Cecil, featuring Bob Clampett's Beany and Cecil. A redesigned Matty Mattel and Sister Belle would appear as directors of the cartoons and in many intermissions along with Clampett's characters of Beany Boy, Cecil the Seasick Sea Serpent, Captain Huffenpuff, Dishonest John, Go Man Van Gogh, et al. There were only 26 half- hour shows made with this format, with the last first-broadcast episode broadcast on June 30, 1962. The series then continued being broadcast during its regular early Saturday evening time as reruns until December 29, 1962. From 1963‚Äì1965, the series was repeated on the network's Sunday morning schedule (and then broadcast in syndication) as Beany and Cecil.

It is a well-known landmark on the Royal Mile. It was built in the 17th century and closed as a church in 1952. Having stood empty for over fifty years, it was used briefly as a tourist information centre and, more recently, has been re-opened as the site of the Edinburgh World Heritage Exhibition and John Kay‚Äôs book and gift shop. Religious history The church was dedicated to Christ by the citizens of Edinburgh in 1641, and known as \\"Christ's Kirk at the Tron\\". It was built for the North-West parish, one of the four parishes of Edinburgh after the Scottish Reformation of 1560. Prior to the erection of this new church, parishioners of the North-West parish worshipped in St. Giles' Cathedral. An English traveller, visiting the Tron in 1705, recorded his impression in his diary:‚Äî\\"The Nobility generally resort to the Tron Church, which is the principally (sic) and the Lord High Commissioner has a Throne erected in it, in a very spatious Gallery, on his right hand sits the Lord Chancellor, and on his left the Lord Provost of Edenborough.\\" There were special grants of pews made by the Edinburgh Town Council to noblemen, Senators of the College of Justice, citizens of Edinburgh Old Town, Principals and Professors of the University. A full list of seat-holders has been preserved for 1650, the year of the battle of Dunbar, and for 1745, when Bonnie Prince Charlie was in Edinburgh. Upon the entrance of the Prince to Edinburgh, he intimated that ministers should have full liberty to continue their duties on the following day‚ÄîSunday‚Äîthe only requirement being that no names should be mentioned in the prayers for the royal family. The service at the Tron was taken by the Reverend Neil McVicar of St. Cuthbert's, the two Presbyterian ministers at the Tron having quietly left the city. The church was packed and he prayed as usual for King George by name and then added‚Äî\\"and as for this young man who has come among us seeking an earthly crown, we beseech Thee that he may obtain what is far better, a heavenly one!\\" When this was reported to Prince Charles, he is said to have laughed and expressed himself highly pleased at the courage and charity of the minister. Notables In 1697, Thomas Aikenhead, an 18-year-old student, became the last person in Scotland to be executed for the crime of blasphemy after a fellow student reported that he had blasphemed against God outside the Tron Kirk. Aikenhead was prosecuted for saying \\"I wish I were in that place Ezra calls hell so I could warm myself\\" as he walked by the kirk on his way back from a night of drinking with some classmates.Thomas Aikenhead The baptisms and marriages of many Edinburgh luminaries took place in the Tron, one being the marriage of the famous jurist John Lauder, Lord Fountainhall on 21 January 1669, to Janet (1652‚Äì1686), daughter of Sir Andrew Ramsay, Lord Abbotshall, 1st Baronet, and the first Lord Provost of Edinburgh, and a Senator of the College of Justice (d.1688). On 25 April 1694 Helen (d. 9 January 1714), daughter of George Ogilvy, 2nd Lord Banff (d.1668) by his spouse Agnes, daughter of Alexander 1st Lord Falconer, of Halkerstoun, married Sir Robert Lauder of Beilmouth in the Tron. Rev John Drysdale, who married Mary Adam, daughter of the famous architect William Adam, was a Minister of the Tron Kirk from 1766 to 1788 and was also twice Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, though now he is chiefly remembered for his friendship with Adam Smith, the economist. The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland met in the Tron from 1830 to 1840‚Äîthe period of the \\"Ten Years' Conflict\\". Architectural history The Tron, as it is commonly called,Butler was ordered to be built by King Charles I when he decided that St Giles' was to become the cathedral for the new see of Edinburgh. The land was purchased by the parish from Dr. William Scott, MD, for ¬£1000 Scots. It was erected between 1636 and 1647 to a design by John Mylne, Royal master mason. The design mixed Palladian and Gothic elements and was inspired by contemporary Dutch architecture.Howard, Deborah Architecture of Scotland: Reformation to Restoration, 1560‚Äì1660 Edinburgh University Press, 1995, p.192 The full Chamberlain's Accounts for this project are extant. The width of the building was reduced when both side aisles were removed in 1785 to accommodate the South Bridge and Blair Street leading to Hunter Square. In 1828 a new spire (designed by R & R DicksonDictionary of Scottish Architects: Dickson) was constructed to replace the original, destroyed in the Great Edinburgh Fire of November 1824. The Tron closed as a church in 1952 and was acquired by the City of Edinburgh Council, the congregation moving to a new church in the Moredun area of the city. It was subsequently left to decay, and the interiors were eventually gutted.McWilliam, p.174 Excavations then took place under the church, from within, in 1974, which revealed some foundations of 16th century buildings in a long-vanished close named Marlins Wynd. A debate continues as to whether the internal destruction of this famous church was warranted. Hogmanay The Tron's position as the traditional focus of Edinburgh's Hogmanay celebrations has been greatly diminished in recent years, due to the expansion of the City Council's organised Hogmanay Street Party in the city centre. However, it was announced in November 2012 that this historic venue would re-stake its claim to the city's hogmanay celebrations, with a Festival of the Extraordinary planned to include live music, film screenings and, amongst other things, a mixology masterclass. Edinburgh Festival Fringe The Tron is also used as a venue during the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, when it has been operated by Just The Tonic and Freestival as a music, comedy and cabaret venue and cafe. Edinburgh World Heritage and John Kay's Shop at the Tron A new exhibition which showcases the Old and New Towns of Edinburgh, as well as Scotland‚Äôs other five World Heritage Sites, is currently in place at the Tron Kirk. The exhibition, housed within the atmospheric 17th century former Kirk, attempts to capture the essence of the World Heritage Site in Edinburgh through the voices and opinions of local people. The story is told in a series of videos, quotes, and specially commissioned portraits from award-winning Scottish photographer Alicia Bruce. The site is also home to John Kay's Shop, a gift shop specialising in Scottish gifts and books, historic prints and maps. References * The Tron Kirk of Edinburgh, by the Reverend D.

Toymakers, as the \\"King of Toys\\", Matty was host and sponsor of TV's Matty's Funday Funnies in the 1960s. Matty was part of Mattel's advertising from 1955 to 1970 and then renewed in the 1980s, printed in Mattel warranty information. History The serrated seal logo for Mattel was designed in 1955 and based on a concept by Mattel co- founder Elliot Handler. The character of \\"Matty\\" derived his name from Mattel, which in turn was named after founders, Harold Mattson and Elliot Handler - thus the hybrid name of Matt + El (short for Elliot) yielded Mattel. This serrated seal, sometimes referred to as 'The Mattel', had a giant letter M in the center with a small boy shown waving, and wearing a crown on his head; this was Matty. Matty was featured on all Mattel products and TV commercials from 1959 through 1970 as the company's logo. He was the familiar mascot that jumped atop the giant \\"M\\" in Mattel TV commercials and shouted, \\"You can tell it's Mattel. IT'S SWELL!\\" The serrated seal with Matty seated and waving from the giant \\"M\\" was replaced with a new serrated seal design with the name Mattel printed across it in 1970, which was the company's 25th anniversary. The new serrated seal is still used today. TV Matty Mattel and his Sister Belle were the hosts of a Sunday morning cartoon show called, Matty's Funday Funnies from 1961-1963. Cartoon shorts of Casper the Friendly Ghost, Beany and Cecil and Harvey Cartoons were a big part of the show, in-between Mattel toy commercials that were duly shown. Matty, Sister Belle and Casper the ghost were the first talking dolls produced by Mattel after the introduction of Chatty Cathy, who came on the market in 1960. Matty and Sister Belle were on the market from 1961 to 1963. Casper was produced from 1961 to 1963 in crisp white terry cloth, while in 1964-65 he was made of white plush, but was essentially the same doll. In 1962 and through 1963, the show's name was changed to Matty's Funnies With Beany and Cecil, and aired exclusively the new Beany and Cecil cartoons produced by Bob Clampett. The Matty and Sister Belle characters would appear between cartoon segments and announce the upcoming Mattel Toy commercial, and again at the end of the program to show previews of next week's show. The Matty and Sister Belle characters were omitted as the shows were re-edited for Saturday mornings beginning in 1964. However, Mattel remained the sponsor. Starting in 1979, Matty appeared again as the character associated with Mattel's consumer \\"hotline\\" where he was featured on packages along with the company's 800 number. In 2008, a grown-up version of Matty was introduced as Mattel's \\"Master Toy Collector\\" and the mascot of MattyCollector.com, a website which sells action figures from the various lines which Mattel licenses or owns.

Early life Ma was born in 1896 in Zhongshan, Guangdong (then known as Xiangshan, Canton) in Qing China. Because of poverty, he was only able to finish junior high school. He self-studied in the Chinese classics to improve himself. He later became a schoolteacher in Canton but earned a lowly salary. In 1918, Ma left for the Philippines to seek his fortune in order to win the hand of his sweetheart, Ng Shih, whose parents disapproved of him because of his poverty. Ma Mon Luk Arriving penniless in Binondo, Manila, Ma decided to peddle his own version of chicken noodle soup. He soon became a familiar sight on the streets of Manila, plodding from Puente de Espa√±a (now Jones Bridge) to as far as Intramuros and Santa Cruz with a long bamboo pole (pingga) slung on his shoulders and two metal containers on each end of the pole. One vat contained his especially concocted noodles and strips of chicken meat, while the other vat stored the chicken broth heated underneath by live coals. With a pair of scissors, he would cut the noodles and meat to serve to his customers. He called his concoction \\"gupit\\", after the Tagalog word for ‚Äúcut‚Äù.Jose Victor Z. Torres, The Legend of Ma Mon Luk, Rogue, April 2017 He would finally name the dish ‚ÄúMa mi‚Äù (), literally meaning, \\"Ma‚Äôs noodles\\". Later, he would add siopao and siomai to his menu.

In addition to sending representatives to activist conferences, individual members of RC sometimes present small \\"UER\\" events or workshops, often in association with other anti-racism efforts in their local area. United to End Racism is one of a number of non-profit organizations that represent RC in public forums. Harvey Jackins, founder of the RC movement, encouraged members of RC to create such organizations to spread RC ideas and objectives along lines decided by the RC leadership; previous well known examples of this tactic include Nuclear Freeze campaigns in the 1980s and the US-based National Coalition Building Institute, founded by RC'er Cherie Brown. Jackins' son, Tim Jackins, the current world leader of RC, is also the de facto leader of UER. The organisation appears solely to exist to service activist conferences as an invited body, and only sporadically carries out other activities. It has no separate membership from RC and is managed from Personal Counselors, Inc (recently renamed \\"Re-evaluation Counseling Community Resources, Inc\\"), the office of RC in Seattle.

Location and description Peat swamp forests occur where waterlogged soils prevent dead leaves and wood from fully decomposing, which over time creates thick layer of acidic peat. The peat swamp forests on Borneo occur in the Indonesian state of Kalimantan, the Malaysian state of Sarawak and in the Belait District of Brunei on coastal lowlands, built up behind the brackish mangrove forests and bounded by the Borneo lowland rain forests on better-drained soils. There are also areas of inland river-fed peat forest at higher elevations in central Kalimantan around the Mahakam Lakes and Lake Sentarum on the Kapuas River. Borneo has a tropical monsoon climate. Recent history Over the past decade, the government of Indonesia has drained over 1 million hectares of the Borneo peat swamp forests for conversion to agricultural land under the Mega Rice Project (MRP). Between 1996 and 1998, more than 4,000 km of drainage and irrigation channels were dug, and deforestation accelerated in part through legal and illegal logging and in part through burning. The water channels, and the roads and railways built for legal forestry, opened up the region to illegal forestry. In the MRP area, forest cover dropped from 64.8% in 1991 to 45.7% in 2000, and clearance has continued since then. It appears that almost all the marketable trees have now been removed from the areas covered by the MRP. What happened was not what had been expected: the channels drained the peat forests rather than irrigating them. Where the forests had often flooded up to 2m deep in the rainy season, now their surface is dry at all times of the year. The Indonesian government has now abandoned the MRP. =Fires= Fires were used in an attempt to create agricultural lands, including large palm tree plantations to supply palm oil. The dried-out peat ignites easily and also burns underground, travelling unseen beneath the surface to break out in unexpected locations. Therefore, after drainage, fires ravaged the area, destroying remaining forest and large numbers of birds, animals, reptiles and other wildlife along with new agriculture, even damaging nature reserves such as Muara Kaman and filling the air above Borneo and beyond with dense smoke and haze and releasing enormous quantities of CO2 into the atmosphere. The destruction had a major negative impact on the livelihoods of people in the area. It caused major smog-related health problems amongst half a million people, who suffered from respiratory problems. The smog from fires killed \\"as many as a million people a year from respiratory diseases\\" according to UNEP director Klaus Toepfer. The dry years of 1997-8 and 2002-3 (see El Ni√±o) in particular saw huge fires in the drained and drying-out peat swamp forests. A study for the European Space Agency found that the peat swamp forests are a significant carbon sink for the planet, and that the fires of 1997-8 may have released up to 2.5 billion tonnes, and the 2002-3 fires between 200 million to 1 billion tonnes, of carbon into the atmosphere. Using satellite images from before and after the 1997 fires, scientists calculated (Page et al, 2002) that of the that had burned 91.5% was peatland . Using ground measurements of the burn depth of peat, they estimated that 0.19‚Äì0.23 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon were released into the atmosphere through peat combustion, with a further 0.05 Gt released from burning of the overlying vegetation. Extrapolating these estimates to Indonesia as a whole, they estimated that between 0.81 and 2.57 Gt of carbon were released to the atmosphere in 1997 as a result of burning peat and vegetation in Indonesia. This is equivalent to 13‚Äì40% of the mean annual global carbon emissions from fossil fuels, and contributed greatly to the largest annual increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration detected since records began in 1957. Indonesia is currently the world's third largest carbon emitter, to a large extent due to the destruction of its ancient peat swamp forests (Pearce 2007).

The spongy, unstable, waterlogged, anaerobic beds of peat can be up to 20 m deep with low pH (pH 2.9 ‚Äì 4) and low nutrients, and the forest floor is seasonally flooded.Yule CM (2008) Loss of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in Indo- Malayan peat swamp forests.

Peat Swamp Forest Project, UNDP/GEF Funded, in collaboration with the Pahang Forestry Department and University Kebangsaan Malaysia Patterns of forest type can be seen in circles from the centre of the swamps to their outer fringes which are made up of most of the tree families recorded in lowland dipterocarp forests although many species are only found here . Many trees have buttresses and stilt roots for support in the unstable substrate, and pneumatophores and hoop roots and knee roots to facilitate gas exchange. The trees have thick, root mats in the upper 50 cm of the peat to enable oxygen and nutrient uptake. Peat swamp forest in Gunung Mulu National Park with Nepenthes bicalcarata in the foreground The lowland peat swamps of Borneo are mostly geologically recent (<5000 years old), low-lying coastal formations above marine muds and sands Rieley JO, Sieffermann RG, Page SE (1992) The origin, development, present status and importance of the lowland peat swamp forests of Borneo. Suo 43: 241-244 but some of the lakeside peat forests of Kalimantan are up to 11,000 years old. One reason for the low nutrient conditions is that streams and rivers do not flow into these forests (if they did, nutrient rich freshwater swamps would result), water only flows out of them, so the only input of nutrients is from rainfall, marine aerosols and dust. In order to cope with the lack of nutrients, the plants invest heavily in defences against herbivores such as chemical (toxic secondary compounds) and physical defences (tough leathery leaves, spines and thorns). It is these defences that prevent the leaves from decaying and so they build up as peat. Although the cellular contents quickly leach out of the leaves when they fall, the physical structure is resistant to both bacterial and fungal decomposition and so remains intact, slowly breaking down to form peat (Yule and Gomez 2008). This is in stark contrast to the lowland dipterocarp forests where leaf decomposition is extremely rapid, resulting in very fast nutrient cycling on the forest floor. If non-endemic leaf species are placed in the peat swamp forests, they break down quite quickly, but even after one year submerged in the swamp, endemic species remain virtually unchanged (Yule and Gomez 2008). The only nutrients available for the trees are thus the ones that leach from the leaves when they fall, and these nutrients are rapidly absorbed by the thick root mat. It was previously assumed that the low pH and anaerobic conditions of the tropical peat swamps meant that bacteria and fungi could not survive, but recent studies have shown diverse and abundant communities (albeit not nearly as diverse as dry land tropical rainforests, or freshwater swamps) (Voglmayr and Yule 2006; Jackson, Liew and Yule 2008). Fauna These forests are home to wildlife including gibbons, orangutans, and crocodiles. In particular the riverbanks of the swamps are important habitats for the crab- eating macaque (Macaca fascicularis) and the silvery lutung (Presbytis cristata) and are the main habitat of Borneo's unique and endangered proboscis monkey (Nasalis larvatus) which can swim well in the rivers, and the Borneo roundleaf bat (Hipposideros doriae). There are two birds endemic to the peat forests, the Javan white-eye (Zosterops flavus) and the hook-billed bulbul (Setornis criniger) while more than 200 species of birds have been recorded in Tanjung Puting National Park in Kalimantan. Rivers of the peat swamps are home to the rare arowana fish (Scleropages formosus), otters, waterbirds, false gharials and crocodiles. Another small species of fish, are the Parosphromenus which are also extremely endangered. The parosphromenus species are small fish of extreme beauty. Preservation Attempts at preservation have been minimal in comparison to recent devastation while commercial logging of peat swamp forest in Sarawak is ongoing and planned to intensify in Brunei. One plan by the environmental NGO Borneo Orangutan Survival is to preserve the peat swamp forest of Mawas using a combination of carbon finance and debt-for-nature- swap. Peatland conservation and rehabilitation are more efficient undertakings than reducing deforestation (in terms of claiming carbon credits through REDD initiatives) due to the much larger reduced emissions achievable per unit area and the much lower opportunity costs involved.Mathai, J.(5 October 2009) Seeing REDD over deforestation. About 6% of the original peat-forest area is contained within protected areas, the largest of which are Tanjung Puting and Sabangau National Parks.

Most of the conflicts did not have a principal pattern with a standard armed structure. The Ottoman Empire and British Empire were involved in different capacities: the Ottoman Empire left the region after the Armistice of Mudros but British influence continued until Dunsterforce was pulled back in the 1920s. The conflicts involved civilians in the disputed districts of Kazakh-Shamshadin, Zanghezur, Nakhchivan and Karabakh. The use of guerrilla and semi-guerrilla operations was the main reason for the high civilian casualties, which occurred during the nation-building activities of the newly established states. The reasons behind the conflict are still far from being resolved after nearly a century. The story of this campaign has very different perceptions from Armenian and Azerbaijani viewpoints. According to Armenian historians, the First Republic of Armenia aimed to include Nakhchivan among the basic (Eastern Armenian) territories of the Erivan Governorate, as well as the eastern and southern parts of the Elisabethpol Governorate. Background American Commission to Negotiate Peace telegram describing massacres around Nakhichevan The first clashes between the Armenians and Azerbaijanis took place in Baku in February 1905. Soon the conflict spilled over to other parts of the Caucasus, and on 5 August 1905, the first conflict between the Armenian and Azerbaijani population of Shusha took place. In March 1918, ethnic and religious tensions grew and the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict in Baku began. The M√ºsavat Party and the Committee of Union and Progress parties were accused of Pan-Turkism by Bolsheviks and their allies. Armenian and Muslim militias engaged in armed confrontations, which resulted in heavy casualties. Many Muslims were expelled from Baku or went underground. Meanwhile, the arrest of Gen. Talyshinski, the commander of the Azerbaijani division, and some of its officers‚Äîall of whom arrived in Baku on 9 March‚Äîincreased anti-Soviet feelings among the city's Azerbaijani population. War proper On 30 March, the Soviets, based on the unfounded report that the Muslim crew of the ship Evelina was armed and ready to revolt against the Soviets, disarmed the crew which tried to resist., Vol. 1, pp. 282‚Äì283 This led to three days fighting,resulting in the death of up to 12,000 Azerbaijanis.

The Ottoman Empire's Enver Pasha began to move forward with the newly established Army of Islam. Major battles occurred in Yevlakh and Agdash. Dunsterville ordered the evacuation of the city on 14 September, after six weeks of occupation, and withdrew to Iran;Homa Katouzian, State and Society in Iran: The Eclipse of the Qajars and the Emergence of the Pahlavis, (I.B. Tauris, 2006), 141. most of the Armenian population escaped with British forces. The Ottoman Army of Islam and its Azerbaijani allies, led by Nuri Pasha, entered Baku on 15 September and killed between 10,000‚Äì20,000 Armenians in retaliation for the March massacre of Muslims. The capital of the Azerbaijan was finally moved from Ganja to Baku. However, after the Armistice of Mudros between the United Kingdom and the Ottoman Empire on 30 October, Turkish troops were substituted by the Triple Entente. Headed by British Gen. W. Thomson, who had declared himself the military governor of Baku, 1,000 Commonwealth soldiers arrived in Baku on 17 November 1918. By Gen. Thomson's order, martial law was implemented in Baku. Karabakh Reconciliation Commission The Armenian government tried several times to seize Shusha militarily. In 1918 a Republic of Mountainous Armenia was declared in the region. However, throughout the summer of 1918 Armenians in the mountainous Karabag region, under the leadership of Andranik Ozanian, resisted the Ottoman 3rd Army. After the Armistice the Ottoman Empire began to withdraw its forces and Armenian forces under Andranik seized Nagorno-Karabakh.Hafeez Malik \\"Central Asia: Its Strategic Importance and Future Prospects\\" page 145 Armistice of Mudros brought Gen. Andranik the chance to create a base for further expansion eastward and form a strategic corridor extending into Nakhchivan. In January 1919 Armenian troops advanced towards Shusha. They captured nine Azerbaijani villages on their way. Just before the Armistice of Mudros was signed, Andranik Ozanian was on the way from Zangezur to Shusha to take control of the main city of Karabakh. In January 1919, with Armenian troops advancing, the British military command asked Andranik back to Zangezur with the assurances that this conflict could be solved with the Paris Peace Conference. Andranik pulled back his units and the British command at Baku gave control to Khosrov bey Sultanov, a native of Karabakh and \\"ardent pan-Turkist\\", who was appointed the general-governor of Karabakh and ordered by the British to \\"squash any unrest in the region\\". Sultanov ordered attacks on Armenian villages the next day, increased the sizes of Azerbaijani garrisons in Shusha and Khankendi and drew up plans to destroy several Armenian villages to sever the link between Armenians in Karabakh and the region of Zangezur.Hovannisian.

They managed to capture the city of Nakhchivan in June 1919 and destroy the Republic of Aras, but afterwards fought combined regular Azerbaijani and Ottoman troops, which reinstated Azerbaijani control over the city in July.

In the west the Armenians still controlled large parts of territory claimed by Azerbaijan; in the east, local Azerbaijani communists were rebelling against the government; and to the north the Russian Red Army was steadily moving southward, having defeated Denikin's White Russian forces. On 27 April 1920, the government of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic received notice that the Soviet Army was about to cross the northern border and invade Azerbaijan. Faced with such a difficult situation, the government officially surrendered to the Soviets, but many generals and local Azerbaijani militias kept resisting the advance of Soviet forces and it took a while for the Soviets to stabilize the newly proclaimed Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic, headed by leading Azerbaijani Bolshevik Nariman Narimanov. While the Azerbaijani government and army were in chaos, the Armenian army and local Armenian militias used the opportunity to assert their control over parts of Azerbaijani territory, invading Shusha, Khankendi and other important cities. By the end of April, Armenian forces were controlling most of western Azerbaijan, including all of Karabakh with the surrounding areas. Other occupied areas included all of Nakhchivan and much of Kazakh-Shamshadin district. In the meantime, Armenian communists attempted a coup in Armenia, but ultimately failed. =Soviet takeover, May 1920= In 1920‚Äì21, the only \\"solution\\" to this dispute could come either by military victory‚Äîas basically happened in Anatolia, Zangezur and Nakhchivan‚Äîor by the imposition from above of a new structure by an imperial power. After the British failed to impose a settlement, the imperial arbiters turned out to be the Bolsheviks, whose 11th Army conquered Karabakh in May 1920. On 5 July 1921, the Bolsheviks' Caucasian Committee, the Kavbiuro, under the chairmanship of Joseph Stalin decided that the mountainous part of Karabakh would remain under the jurisdiction and sovereignty of Azerbaijan. In July 1923, the Nagorny (or Mountainous) Karabakh Autonomous Region (NKAO) was established within Azerbaijan, with borders that gave it an overwhelming Armenian majority of 94% of the total inhabitants. =End of hostilities, September‚ÄìNovember 1920= In late November there was yet another Soviet- backed communist uprising in Armenia. On 28 November, blaming Armenia for the invasions of ≈û…ôrur on 20 November 1920 and Karabakh the following day, the 11th Red Army under the command of Gen. Anatoliy Gekker, crossed the demarcation line between First Republic of Armenia and Soviet Azerbaijan. The second Soviet-Armenian war lasted only a week. Aftermath The Armenian national liberation movement was exhausted by the six years of permanent wars and conflicts; the Armenian army and population were incapable of any further active resistance. =Sovietization of Armenia, December 1920= On 4 December 1920, when the Red Army entered Yerevan, the government of the First Republic of Armenia effectively surrendered. On 5 December, the Armenian Revolutionary Committee (Revkom), made up of mostly Armenians from Azerbaijan, also entered the city. Finally, on 6 December, Felix Dzerzhinsky's dreaded secret police, the Cheka, entered Yerevan, thus effectively ending all existence of the First Republic of Armenia.Robert H. Hewsen. Armenia: A Historical Atlas, p. 237. The Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic was then proclaimed, under the leadership of Gevork Atarbekyan. On 18 February 1921, a national revolt against Bolsheviks started. Gen. Garegin Nzhdeh, commander Garo Sasouni and the last Prime Minister of independent Armenia Simon Vratsyan took the lead of the anti-Bolshevik rebellion and forced out the Bolsheviks from Yerevan and other places. By April, the Red Army reconquered most part of Armenia. However, Atarbekyan was dismissed and Aleksandr Miasnikyan, an Armenian high- ranking Red Army commander, replaced him. Garegin Nzhdeh left the Zangezur mountains after the Sovietization of Armenia was finalized in July 1921, leaving Azerbaijani-populated villages cleansed of their population. Persuaded by Soviet leadership, Zangezur had already been ceded by Azerbaijan to Armenia in November 1920 as a \\"symbol of friendship\\". =Treaty of Kars, 23 October 1921= The violence in Transcaucasia was finally settled in a friendship treaty between Turkey and the Soviet Union. The peace Treaty of Kars was signed in Kars by representatives of the Russian SFSR, Azerbaijan SSR, Armenian SSR, Georgian SSR and Turkey. Turkey had another agreement, the \\"Treaty on Friendship and Brotherhood\\", also called the Treaty of Moscow, signed on 16 March 1921 with Soviet Russia. By this treaty, Nakhchivan was granted the status of an autonomous region under Azerbaijan's protectorate, on the condition that the rights for protectorate would never be transferred to a third state. Turkey and Russia became guarantors of Nakhchivan's status. Turkey agreed to return Alexandropol to Armenia and Batumi to Georgia.

The series combines elements of mystery and fantasy as it follows the adventures of private investigator Garrett. Plot introduction Garrett is a hardboiled detective living in the city of TunFaire, a melting pot of different races, cultures, religions, and species. When people have problems, they often come to Garrett for help, but trouble has a way of finding Garrett on its own, whether he likes it or not. Plot summary Garrett is hired by a beautiful young woman calling herself Jill Craight to find out who has broken into her apartment and why. Immediately after, a Magister Peridont comes to Garrett to try to get him to investigate the disappearance of some famous religious relics; Garrett respectfully declines. After getting attacked by a gang called the Vampires, Garrett goes to his old friend Maya, leader of a gang herself, for advice. Maya informs Garrett that Jill was a former member of the Doom, Maya's gang, and that she is a chronic liar. Maya invites herself along to learn his trade. Garrett turns up no leads and is not even quite sure what to investigate. His one clue is some odd coins tying together Jill and the Vampires. Garrett asks Magister Peridont about the coins, then heads over to the Royal Assay office for help. After learning nothing new, Garrett heads home, where he is visited again by Magister Peridont, who informs him that Miss Craight was in fact his mistress, and now she is missing. The story gets more complicated when Garrett visits crime lord Chodo Contague, whose house gets attacked by magical forces. Chodo Contague involves his henchmen more earnestly in Garrett's case, and Garrett and Maya take their search for Jill to the Tenderloin, the red-light district of TunFaire. When they return home, they find the same magical forces that attacked Chodo's mansion trying to tear apart Garrett's home. After repelling them, he learns from the Dead Man that another dead Loghyr is behind the magical attacks. Eventually, Garrett and the Dead Man manage to tie together the Church, the missing relics, the dead Loghyr, and Jill Craight. After discovering that Jill is hiding out in a church complex, Garrett and Morley break in and kidnap her and another of her lovers, a high status member of the Orthodox church. Garrett assembles everyone of importance at his house, and he and the Dead Man uncover the motives of all the parties present. Eventually, the relics are recovered, the other dead Loghyr is disposed of, and Garrett lives to tackle another adventure.

The original fort, overlooking the Potomac River, was completed in 1809, and was begun as Fort Warburton, but renamed in 1808. During the War of 1812, the fort was destroyed by its own garrison during a British advance. The current historic fort‚Äîmaintained by the National Park Service‚Äîwas initially constructed in 1824. It is a stone structure with a good cannon shot down the Potomac River. The fort was extensively remodeled in the 1840s and 1890s. The Fort was turned over to the U.S. Department of the Interior in 1946 after its last military personnel departed. The expansive grounds of the present Fort Washington Park, with its extensive hiking/bicycle paths and river view, are a scenic venue for picnicking, fishing, and outdoor recreation. Historical re- enactments are held periodically at the Fort, and there is a small museum. In 2006, repairs were done to shore up the crumbling outer wall, in preparation for the 200th anniversary. The Fort Washington Light, located below the fort, was established in 1857. The current tower, standing 28 feet tall, was constructed in 1882. History =Native American, colonial, and early independence eras= Native Americans of the Piscataway tribe had long lived in the area where Piscataway Creek meets the Potomac River in southern Maryland and understood the defensive value of the promontory above the river there. Fort Washington, Warburton Mansion and the Old By Ways in 1798 When Governor Leonard Calvert first explored the area in 1634, he \\"found the surrounding heights covered with Indians, to the number of about five hundred, in hostile array.\\" After securing peace with the Piscataway, in 1645 an act for the defense of the province established a garrison of 100 men at the same site at the mouth of Piscataway creek. In 1661, Edward Digges, former Colonial Governor of Virginia established The Manor of Warburton on 1200 acres bounded by Piscataway Creek, the Potomac River and Swan Creek. His heirs continued to live on the property throughout the Colonial period. When George Washington built Mount Vernon, it was almost directly across the river from Warburton Manor. Washington would often visit with the Digges family, or pass through Warburton after crossing the river on his way to Upper Marlboro or Annapolis, Maryland. Through these visits, and from his vantage point at Mount Vernon, Washington became familiar with the Warburton location and came to understand its defensive advantages on the Potomac River. In 1794, as President, he directed Secretary of War Henry Knox to construct a fortification on the site, with a budget not to exceed $3,000. The money authorized was instead spent trying to construct a fort at Jones Point, on the Virginia side of the river. In 1798 Washington again urged that a fort be built at Digges Point, but no work was done. Finally, in 1805, when Congress was contemplating a second coastal fortification system, the Secretary of War directed Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Williams to evaluate Digges Point for a \\"circular battery, say of twelve cannon.\\" =1804‚Äì1814= Captain George Bomford was assigned to the work and the plans of Fort Madison at Annapolis were used for the Potomac fort. It was soon discovered that the four acres purchased from Thomas Digges was too small. Colonel Williams directed Captain Bomford to lay out the work again but on a reduced scale. The barracks was shifted to one side and one wing shortened to accommodate the new design. Work commenced on April 14, 1808 and was completed on December 1, 1809. It was anticipated that 120 artillerymen would be assigned to the post as a wartime garrison and gunboats from the Navy Yard would support the fort. Captain Bomford described the fort as \\"an enclosed work of masonry comprehending a semi elliptical face with a circular flank on the side next to the Potomac.\\" There were also quarters for two companies and a total of 15 cannon. On the bluff above the fort, a masonry tower could house one company and six additional cannons. Later, Captain Bomford reported \\"Fort Washington was really an attempt to adopt a standardized plan to an unsuitable site. It violated a fundamental rule in the art of fortifications‚Äîthe fort must suit its site.\\" Drawing of Fort Warburton (later Washington) as constructed in 1809 When completed, it was the only fortification on the Potomac River. Perpendicular earthen walls stood 14 feet above the bottom of the ditch that surrounded the river side of the fort. A tower facing the river contained six cannon. Although it mounted twelve or fifteen guns (later increased) which commanded the river below its position, the American Brigadier General William H. Winder, commanding the military district around Washington, feared that a determined naval force could nevertheless blast its way past the fort. It would then have Washington at its mercy. A survey the previous year also noted that the fort blockhouse was only able to resist musket fire, and could be destroyed by a cannon as small as a twelve-pounder.Howard, pp.151‚Äì152 Its garrison consisted of 49 men under Captain Samuel T. Dyson, of the United States Army's Corps of Artillery, and elements of the U.S. 9th and 12th Infantry Regiments. On June 18, 1812, in response to British impressment of American sailors and other grievances, the United States declared war on the United Kingdom. At the time, Britain was also at war with Napoleonic France and, with their fleet thus engaged, there was very little activity along or against the American coasts. A British squadron did make an attempt to ascend the Potomac in July 1813, but turned back after meeting some resistance from militia and encountering treacherous shoals. As concern for the security of Washington rose, Major Pierre L'Enfant was sent to evaluate the fort and reported \\"the whole original design was bad and it is impossible to make a perfect work of it by any alterations.\\" The Secretary of the Navy ordered an additional water battery of 9 guns to be built and manned by seamen under Lieutenant Decius Wadsworth. At this time, the name \\"Fort Washington\\" was gaining popularity but official correspondence often indicated Warburton, Digges Point, the Fort at Warburton, Fort Warburton and Fort Washington above the date line. =Destruction= In April, 1814, Napoleon abdicated and was exiled. This freed the British army and navy to focus on the conflict with the United States. In early August, part of a naval squadron under Captain James A. Gordon began ascending the Potomac River from the Chesapeake Bay. The Secretary of War, General John Armstrong, Jr., did not see any military value to Washington. He believed that the British movement toward the Capital was a ruse and insisted that their destination was actually Baltimore, so no effort was made to strengthen the Washington defenses. British Advance on Washington, August, 1814 When the British Army did land near Washington, General Armstrong finally took measures to protect the Capital. On August 22, 1814 Brigadier General Robert Young was ordered to move his 600 militia to the Washington-Piscataway road to defend the approach to the fort now being called Fort Washington. Commander of the Washington defenses, General William Winder, sent orders to Captain Dyson \\"to advance a guard up to the main road upon all the roads leading to the fort, and in the event of his being taken in the rear of the fort by the enemy, to blow up the fort and retire across the river.\\" Thomas Tingey, Commander of the Navy Yard, proposed placing Marines at Fort Washington but was refused by General Winder who did not consider Fort Washington tenable. On August 24, the British defeated the main militia force defending the Capital at Bladensburg and captured and set fire to the city. While the British Army was burning Washington there were only 56 men at Fort Warburton. The fort had 26 guns ranging from 50-pounder Columbiads to 6-pounder field pieces and over 3,000 pounds of cannon powder. \\"Attack on Fort Washington on Potomac, 17 August 1814.\\" Watercolor by Irwin John David Bevan Only nine guns were capable of firing down river (many of the other cannons lacked implements). On the 27th, the British fleet of 10 ships approached the fort. Captain Gordon's report states that \\"A little before sunset the squadron anchored just out of gunshot; the bomb vessels at once took up their position to cover the frigates in the projected attack at daylight next morning and began throwing shells until about 7:00pm. The garrison, to our great surprise, retreated from the fort; and a short time afterward Fort Washington was blown up.\\" The next morning the fleet paused in front of the fort, completed the destruction, then sailed to and captured the city of Alexandria, Virginia, just a few miles upriver. Captain Dyson was subsequently relieved of his command and ordered to his home in Alexandria. A court martial found him guilty of abandoning his post and destroying government property. He was dismissed from the service, but received no other punishment. The Secretary of War, General Armstrong, was forced to retire and abandon his ambition to become President because of his failure to protect the Capital. =Post-destruction to 1860= Artist's rendering of the construction of the second Fort Washington Within less than a month of its demolition, Fort Washington began to be rebuilt. The project was directed by James Monroe, acting secretary of war, who again hired Pierre Charles L'Enfant. As work progressed, however, the threat diminished. Concern about the defenses of Washington had lessened considerably by the time news arrived that a peace treaty had been signed in Ghent, Belgium, on December 24, 1814, and that American troops had handily defeated the British at the Battle of New Orleans, January 8, 1815. Even before the Treaty of Ghent, Monroe had begun to rein in L'Enfant. In November 1814 he questioned L'Enfant's removal of some of the old fort and asked for greater economy. L'Enfant was told to submit reports on the work in progress and to prepare detailed plans of the new fort for the War Department. Believing he had been insulted, L' Enfant refused to comply. On July 18, 1815, work was halted and two months later, on September 15, L'Enfant was dismissed. He was replaced by Lt. Col. Walker Armistead of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, who, within a few weeks, presented the first detailed plans of the proposed work. Drawing of Second Fort Washington when completed in 1824 Construction of the new brick fort progressed steadily under the direction of Armistead's assistant, Capt. T.W. Maurice. On October 2, 1824, the fort was declared finished, though as yet unarmed. It had cost $426,000. In the 1840s the fort underwent an extensive remodeling program to bring it up to the standards of the third generation of coastal fortifications. Work crews constructed 88 permanent gun platforms (though the first guns were not emplaced until 1846), increased the height of the east wall, rebuilt the drawbridge, strengthened the powder magazines, and added a caponier to protect the approaches from Piscataway Creek. Growing shortages in the number of personnel after the Mexican War stretched the resources of the U.S. Army. At Fort Washington, as at many other posts, the garrison was withdrawn leaving only a skeleton maintenance staff. In fact, between 1853 and 1861, only one soldier, Ordnance Sergeant Joseph Cameron, was stationed full-time at the fort. =1861 to 1865= As sectional differences increased and the country moved closer to the horror of civil war, Fort Washington found itself in a precarious position: near the Nation's Capital, across the river from the most populous slave state, and itself in a slave state with a large secessionist following. By February 1861, after South Carolina and six other states had declared their independence from the United States, the possibility loomed that Virginia would also secede, making the fort's geographic position critical. Other observers saw a threat from the southern sympathizers residing in Prince Georges County, Md., where the fort was located. Drawing of Fort Washington as it appeared during the Civil War On January 1, 1861, Secretary of the Navy Isaac Toucey issued an order for the defense of the capital. The task of putting the defenses in order fell to an Army engineer officer, Lt. George Washington Custis Lee, son of Col. Robert E. Lee. By early May 1861 both Lees would resign their commissions in the U.S. Army and offer their services to their home state, Virginia. Capt. Joseph A. Haskin, shown as a brigadier general, commander of Fort Washington during the Civil War On January 5, 1861, Ordnance Sergeant Joseph Cameron asked for troops to be sent to Fort Washington. The next day, Captain Algernon S. Taylor and 40 U.S. Marines arrived from the Navy Yard to hold the fort until trained artillery units could be sent. Taylor feared that the 40 Marines were not enough and asked for reinforcements. On January 26, 1861, a company of U.S. Army recruits relieved the Marines. On April 15, the day after Fort Sumter surrendered in Charleston harbor, the War Department sent Company D of the 1st U.S. Artillery to Fort Washington. It was commanded by Capt. Joseph A. Haskin, who had arrived in Washington from Baton Rouge, La., where he had been forced to surrender the federal arsenal and barracks to local secessionists earlier in the year. For a time Fort Washington was the only defense for the national capital, and it was vitally important, for it controlled movement on the river. Quickly, however, Maj. Gen. John G. Barnard of the Corps of Engineers directed the building of a string of 68 enclosed earthen forts and batteries to protect all approaches to Washington. By the end of the war, 20 miles of rifle pits and more than 30 miles of military roads encircled the city. Ultimately, the fort did not see any action during the war, as it was not a factor in any land campaign and the Confederate Navy never attempted to raid the city from the Potomac River. =1872 to 1889= At the end of the Civil War, federal officials took a close look at the nation's coastal defense system. They found that U.S. coastal waters were vulnerable to ships carrying 12-inch guns and of less than 24-foot draft. In short, the U.S. coastline was vulnerable to the world's major naval powers‚ÄîGreat Britain, France, Russia, Germany, Denmark, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Austria-Hungary. In 1872 the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began to prepare new defenses. Between 1873 and 1875, four 15-inch Rodman guns and a magazine were partially constructed. Work ceased in 1875 when money was no longer available. In 1887, President Cleveland found a treasury surplus. Two years earlier, a Board of Engineers, presided over by Secretary of War William C. Endicott, recommended a new system of seacoast defense that employed heavy steel breech-loading rifled guns, large mortars, rapid fire guns and underwater mines. The entire plan called for the installation of the new defenses at 27 sites along our coast and rivers. Work did not begin on the new system until Benjamin Harrison became president in 1889. The Fifty-first Congress found a solution to the treasury surplus that had plagued Cleveland during the last two years of his Administration. New public buildings, river improvements and even a pension for the Civil War veterans, that had been promised but not delivered, were among the spending bills introduced and passed by the Congress. Some of the surplus money, $1,221,000 in 1890 and $750,000 in 1891 was appropriated for coast defenses. The Endicott Board's recommendation for the defense of Washington was thirteen 10 and 12-inch guns and 150 submarine mines. They were to be placed at Fort Washington, Maryland and Sheridan Point (later Fort Hunt), Virginia at an estimated cost of 1.3 million dollars. =1890 to 1898= On January 11, 1890 a Board of Engineers was ordered to investigate and submit a project for the defense of Washington. They recommended that most of the defenses be constructed at Fort Washington. Part of their plan was for an underground mine control room to be built on the north end of the fort. Work on the new defenses began with the Mining Casemate, an underground room for firing electrically detonated mines. The following year ground was broken for Battery Decatur, named after Commodore Stephen Decatur, naval hero of the Barbary Wars and War of 1812 and a native of Maryland, but was suspended to await final design of the 10-inch disappearing carriage. Construction resumed in 1896 and the guns were mounted in early 1897. Work at Battery Emory, named for Major General William H. Emory, commenced in 1897. 12-inch Mortars at Battery Meigs Battery Humphreys was started in 1898 and named for Major General Andrew A. Humphreys. The 12-inch mortar battery, designed to direct vertical fire at the thin decks of modern warships, was named for Major General Montgomery C. Meigs and started in 1898. It originally had eight 12-inch mortars but later two mortars were removed from each pit. The three rapid-fire batteries at Fort Washington mounted two guns each: Battery White was started in 1898, Smith in 1899 and James Many in 1902. Lieutenant Colonel Peter C. Haines, president of the Engineer Board planning the defense of Washington described the purpose of the works in a letter of June 26, 1891: \\"The defensive works at Fort Washington are designed to prevent a hostile fleet from reaching positions within bombarding distance of the Capitol and the Washington Navy Yard. It is scarcely within the range of possibilities that any other than a naval attack would be made on this position. The defenses are therefore designed to resist such attack only.\\" M1895 gun at Fort Hamilton, NY, representative of the guns emplaced at Battery Decatur. In April 1898 the USS Maine exploded in Havana harbor and the United States became engaged in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Up to this time, work on the entire coastal defense system had been slow and only a few of the gun batteries were completed. Work began immediately, so that any possible attack by Spanish warships could be met. Two of the 15-inch Rodman cannon in the ravelin were dismounted and a concrete battery was built for rapid-fire guns. Electricity and telephones were installed in the batteries, and the 10-inch gun planned for firing at the experimental battery was placed on a barbette carriage near Battery Humphreys. A minefield was also laid down in the Potomac, the only time this has ever been done. The first military unit to serve the new guns at Fort Washington was Company A, 4th U.S. Artillery who were assigned to Battery Decatur on July 21, 1897. In 1901, Company A was re- designated 37th Company, Coast Artillery Corps and remained at the post until 1904. Other units stationed at Fort Washington included the 44th, 104th and 116th Companies of Coast Artillery. =1898 to 1940= M1897 Gun crew in the 1920s On July 3, 1898, the U.S. Navy destroyed the Spanish fleet at Santiago, Cuba, and for all practical purposes the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War was over. The mines were removed from the Potomac River, and later that year the 10-inch gun mounted near Battery Humphreys was moved to a new mount to test a wood and iron parapet that had been built shortly before the outbreak of war. In June 1899, what became known as the Alger test was conducted by firing one of these guns into a parapet designed by the secretary of war. The results of the test concluded that concrete provided a more effective barrier against rifled artillery than any other design then available to engineers. In July 1899 Batteries Decatur, Emory, Humphreys, and White were officially turned over to the artillery commander of the fort, which became part of the Coast Defenses of the Potomac. Although in the hands of the artillery since their construction, they had been the property of the engineers. During World War I, the guns of Battery Decatur were removed and shipped to Fort Monroe, Va., where they were then shipped to Europe for use in France. A 1935 honor guard awaits the arrival of the assistant secretary of war Fort Washington was garrisoned by the 260th Coast Artillery Regiment of the District of Columbia National Guard Coast Artillery, and a number of military units were organized at the post, including the 8th Provisional Artillery Battalion, then sent to France where they became the 53rd Artillery (Railway), Coast Artillery Corps. In 1924 the coast defense commands were renamed \\"harbor defense commands\\". After World War I several harbor defense commands were disarmed, and this included Fort Washington by 1929.Berhow, p. 211Fort Washington (Maryland) at FortWiki.com From June 1922 to June 1939, the 3rd Battalion 12th Infantry occupied Fort Washington. The fort's primary function was as a city garrison for Washington. Its soldiers participated in a variety of state occasions‚Äîparades, ceremonies, and funerals‚Äîthroughout these years. In 1939 the 3rd Battalion moved to Fort Myer near Arlington Cemetery. That same year the fort was transferred to the Department of the Interior and a Civilian Conservation Corps barracks was built. Also in 1939, the site was proposed for use as a terminal point for a bridge across the Potomac from Virginia and a parkway to be built northward along the shore. =1941 to present= Aerial photo of the facilities at Fort Washington in 1937 After the attack on Pearl Harbor, December 7, 1941, the nation quickly turned from peacetime activities to meeting the demands of wartime. Already-existing facilities were pressed into service, and Fort Washington was returned to the Department of War for use during World War II. During this period, further expansion of the post took place with the construction of additional buildings to house students and to provide support services for training military personnel. The Adjutant General School moved to the fort in January 1942. It trained Army officers in administration and personnel classification duties. The school turned out 300 trained officers every 60 days. Part of the Adjutant General's School was an Officer Candidate School that graduated 25 men in the first class and thereafter turned out 20 new officers every three months. 67th WAAC Detachment at Fort Washington On March 3, 1943, the 67th WAAC Detachment reported to Fort Washington and became part of the Adjutant General's School's Service Company. They were assigned administrative, communications and transportation functions to replace men who were needed overseas. Most of Fort Washington's women received their basic training at Daytona Beach, Florida, but a few had been trained at other centers. The workdays were long, usually 12 to 16 hours, and every Friday there was a dress parade after work. Saturday mornings began with a formal parade and inspection, but service at Fort Washington was not all work, there was some time for rest and relaxation. The base swimming pool was a popular activity during the summer and a military bus ran from the front gate to Washington. There was a dance at the club every Friday evening. Toward the end of the war, the Veterans Administration used part of the area and other buildings as public housing. In 1946 the fort once again reverted to the Department of the Interior. Many of the buildings from the interwar period were removed. Since that time it has been a public park commemorating the long history of coastal fortifications and serving as a recreational area for history buffs, naturalists, and other park visitors. Modern use The visitors center, located in the yellow house on the hill in front of the fort, contains exhibits describing Fort Washington as the guardian of the nation's capital. An audiovisual program also offers materials on the fort. There is a 3-mile trail that follows the perimeter of the park boundary. Birdwatchers frequent the park, and fishing is available along the Potomac River. Fort Washington Is open year-round. The park grounds are open from 8am to sunset. The historic fort and the visitor center are open from 9am to 4pm during winter months and 9am to 5pm during the summer months. Alcohol is prohibited in the park. Dogs are allowed but must be on a 6-foot leash and under the control of owner. One Sunday a month from April to October the park has Civil War artillery demonstrations.

The series combines elements of mystery and fantasy as it follows the adventures of private investigator Garrett. Plot introduction Garrett is a hardboiled detective living in the city of TunFaire, a melting pot of different races, cultures, religions, and species. When people have problems, they often come to Garrett for help, but trouble has a way of finding Garrett on its own, whether he likes it or not. Plot summary This Garrett novel is a traditional whodunit. Garrett is approached by his old marine sergeant, Blake Peters, who calls in an old Marine Corps debt to get Garrett to investigate the mysterious illness afflicting his current employer, General Stantnor. Garrett moves into the Stantnor mansion, to find that only a handful of individuals still inhabit the property and keep it from crumbling into ruin. As Garrett begins his investigation, an unknown individual begins murdering the few remaining members of the household. When some of the recently murdered individuals come back from the dead and attack the living house guests, Garrett calls upon his good friend Morley Dotes for backup. As the focus of Garrett's investigation switches to solving the ongoing murders, he continues to be distracted by two elusive beauties seen around the house: one is the general's daughter Jennifer, but the other can only be seen by Garrett, who suspects that she may in fact be a ghost. While Garrett escapes multiple murder attempts on his own life, other members of the household are not so lucky, and the list of potential suspects grows shorter and shorter. Morley, meanwhile, suspects the general's illness is not a result of poison but possibly of the supernatural. As the pieces start to come together, Garrett and Morley hire an exorcist by the name of Doctor Doom, and with the remaining house staff gathered, they confront the sick general in his quarters. It is revealed that the general murdered his wife, Eleanor, and the ghost that Garrett has glimpsed is in fact her. Eleanor's ghost, as revenge for her murder, has slowly been stealing the life away from the old general. Additionally, Garrett and company deduce that all the murders were in fact committed by the general's daughter, Jennifer, in an attempt to keep the family estate intact after her father's death. In the aftermath, both the general and Jennifer die, and Garrett takes as his only payment a hauntingly beautiful painting of Eleanor, to remind him of the events. He hangs it up in his study, and it becomes apparent that Eleanor's ghost has followed him and now haunts the painting.

It particularly affects the skin around the mouth and distal extremities; but may also be found on the lower abdomen, buttocks, perineum, and groin. It is strongly associated with glucagonoma, a glucagon-producing tumor of the pancreas, but is also seen in a number of other conditions including liver disease and intestinal malabsorption. Signs and symptoms =Clinical features= NME features a characteristic skin eruption of red patches with irregular borders, intact and ruptured vesicles, and crust formation. It commonly affects the limbs and skin surrounding the lips, although less commonly the abdomen, perineum, thighs, buttocks, and groin may be affected. Frequently these areas may be left dry or fissured as a result. All stages of lesion development may be observed synchronously. The initial eruption may be exacerbated by pressure or trauma to the affected areas. =Associated conditions= William Becker first described an association between NME and glucagonoma in 1942 and since then, NME has been described in as many as 70% of individuals with a glucagonoma. NME is considered part of the glucagonoma syndrome, which is associated with hyperglucagonemia, diabetes mellitus, and hypoaminoacidemia. When NME is identified in the absence of a glucagonoma, it may be considered \\"pseudoglucagonoma syndrome\\". Less common than NME with glucagonoma, pseudoglucagonoma syndrome may occur in a number of systemic disorders: * Celiac disease * Ulcerative colitis * Crohn's disease * Hepatic cirrhosis * Hepatocellular carcinoma * Lung cancer, including small cell lung cancer * Tumors that secrete insulin- or insulin-like growth factor 2 * Duodenal cancer Cause The cause of NME is unknown, although various mechanisms have been suggested. These include hyperglucagonemia, zinc deficiency, fatty acid deficiency, hypoaminoacidemia, and liver disease. Mechanism The pathogenesis is also unknown. Diagnosis =Histology= The histopathologic features of NME are nonspecific and include: * epidermal necrosis * subcorneal pustules * confluent parakeratosis, epidermal hyperplasia, and marked papillary dermal hyperplasia in a psoriasiform pattern * angioplasia of papillary dermis * suppurative folliculitis The vacuolated, pale, swollen epidermal cells and necrosis of the superficial epidermis are most characteristic.

The brigade has been in a continuous active service since 1944. The brigade was constituted on 12 July 1944 in the Army of the United States as the 205th Counter Intelligence Corps Detachment. It was allotted to the Regular Army on 6 October 1950. The unit served during World War II in Northern France, the Rhineland, Ardennes-Alsace and Central Europe. It was reorganized and redesignated as the 205th Military Intelligence Detachment on 25 June 1958. In Vietnam, the 205th took part in the Tet Offensive; the Tet 69/Counteroffensive; and the Summer-Fall Campaign of 1969. In October 1983, the Detachment was consolidated with Headquarters, 135th Military Intelligence Group and redesignated as Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment, 205th Military Intelligence Group. On 16 October 1985, the 205th MI Group was redesignated the 205th Military Intelligence Brigade. More than two thirds of the brigade deployed to Bosnia and Herzegovina with Task Force Eagle in December 1995, redeploying to Germany in November 1996. The brigade continued to provide intelligence support to V Corps, and to the ongoing Joint and Combined Operations in the Balkans, from principal operating bases in Germany and Italy. The 205th MI BDE took part of Operation Iraqi Freedom where it was involved in the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse investigations and resulting scandal, beginning in late 2003. Major General George Fay initially began the investigation, which was later finished by Lieutenant General Anthony Jones in 2004.http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/wp- content/uploads/pdf/040825fay.pdf As a result of the Fay Report, Colonel Thomas Pappas, commander of the 205th from 2003 to 2005, received an Article 15 for \\"dereliction of duty\\" in his leadership role at the Abu Ghraib prison.

It is close to the Lake District national park and the Cumbrian Pennines. It includes the areas of Bridge End, in the south west by the A66, and Cross End in the north east of the village. The market town of Appleby-in-Westmorland is about away, and the larger town of Penrith is about away. History The place-name 'Kirkby Thore' is first attested in 1179 in the 'Register of Holm Cultram', where it appears as Kirkebythore. Kirkby means 'church village' or 'village with a church', whilst Thore is an Old Norse personal name related to the god Thor.Eilert Ekwall, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names, p.280. The village is on the site of a Roman cavalry camp called Bravoniacum or Brovonacae and Roman coins, tombstones, sandals, urns, earthen vessels, and the cusp of a spear have been found in the locality. The Maiden Way Roman road led north from Bravoniacum to Epiacum (Whitley Castle), and thence to Magnae (Carvoran) on Hadrian's Wall, where it joined the Stanegate road running from west to east. A continuation from there ran east to Banna (Birdoswald) and then north to the Shrine of Cocidius (Bewcastle). It was reported in 2016 that LIDAR technology has revealed another Roman road running southwest from Kirkby Thore to the Roman fort at Low Borrowbridge near Tebay. The Anglican church of St Michael in Kirkby Thore is built of red sandstone and dates from Norman times. The village also had a Methodist chapel. The village is also home to Kirkby Thore Hall, a Grade II* medieval Manor House of particular structural interest. British Gypsum, Kirkby ThoreGypsum has been quarried or mined in the area for over 200 years. The local British Gypsum Ltd plant has produced plaster since 1910 and plasterboard since the 1960s. Currently it is more economic to use desulpho-gypsum transported by rail from Drax Power Station than to mine it locally but this depends on Drax continuing. British Gypsum has a private siding on the Settle-Carlisle Railway which passes to the north of the village. There are a number of farms in the village and surrounding area. Some are large dairy farms, others beef and/or sheep with some arable crops. Governance Kirkby Thore is in the parliamentary constituency of Penrith and the Border. Neil Hudson was elected its Conservative Member of Parliament at the 2019 General Election, replacing Rory Stewart. Before Brexit, it was in the North West England European Parliamentary Constituency. In the past the village has either been part of the constituency of Appleby or the constituency of Westmorland. An Appleby electoral ward of the same name exists. This ward stretches west to Mallerstang with a total population of 1,563. Transport and facilities The busy A66 road runs through the western edge of the village. This will be one of the last sections of the A66 to be upgraded to dual carriageway; in 2006 the Highways Agency conducted public consultation on the route for a bypass (which will connect the existing Appleby bypass to the east and the Temple Sowerby bypass (opened in part October 2007, ahead of schedule) to the west. The public consultation fell by the wayside and dualling of the A66 at Kirkby Thore is still an aspiration. The village contains a village shop with post office, a filling station (and shop) and a Bistro serving meals. Notable people Siblings Helen Skelton and Gavin Skelton grew up in a farm near the village and attended Kirkby Thore Primary School before transferring to Appleby Grammar School. Helen is now a television presenter, best known for working on Blue Peter and Countryfile, whilst Gavin is a professional footballer who has played in the Scottish Premier League with Gretna, Kilmarnock and Hamilton Academicals. During 2016 he was player-manager of Queen of the South in Dumfries. He was appointed assistant manager of Carlisle United in June 2019.

They are referred to by numerous common names, including two-legged eel, dwarf siren, and mud eel. The specific epithet intermedia denotes their intermediate size, between the greater siren, Siren lacertina, and the dwarf sirens, Pseudobranchus species.  Behavior  The lesser siren is nocturnal, spending its days hidden in the debris and mud at the bottom of slow-moving bodies of water. They feed primarily on aquatic invertebrates, including various kinds of worms, insect larvae, snails, and crustaceans. They will also eat the tadpoles and eggs of other amphibians. Reproduction occurs in the spring, with eggs being laid in shallow depressions at the bottom of calm areas of water, usually surrounded by vegetation, or among plant roots. Though little is known about their courtship, it is believed to be quite violent, as many specimens collected have scarring from healed bite marks from other sirens. About 12-300 eggs are laid at a time, and several clutches may be laid over the course of the year. Hatchlings are only about 0.4 in (1.1 cm) in length, but grow quickly. Maturity is reached in three to four years. The lesser siren is vocal, unlike most salamanders, and will emit a series of clicks when it approaches others of its species, or a short screeching sound if handled. If the habitat dries up during the summer, lesser sirens are known to endure droughts by burrowing into the mud. If the mud dries out, they are capable of excreting a substance from their skin which protects them from dehydrating, and enables them to stay buried in dry mud for months until the water returns. Their small legs enable them to move on dry land for short periods of time.  Description  Lesser sirens have elongated bodies possessing only two limbs, a pair of four-toed legs located behind the base of the head, and range in length from 7 to 27 inches (17 ‚Äì 69 cm). Juvenile specimens have red to yellow banding on their heads and stripes running along the main length of the body, although these stripes are absent in Siren i. intermedia. Adults have plainer coloration; the dorsal side is typically olive green to blue-gray or black, while the ventral is usually light grey. Spotted patterns may also be present in adults.Caudata Culture Species Entry ‚Äì Siren intermedia. Caudata.org. Retrieved on 2019-12-23. Lesser sirens are notably neotenic, and possess external gills throughout their lives.  Geographic distribution  The lesser siren is found in the United States and Mexico, primarily from Virginia to Florida, west to Texas, ranging into northeastern Mexico as far as Veracruz, and north to Illinois and southwest Michigan. Multiple specimens have recently been rediscovered in Michigan after a 60-year absence.  Taxonomy  Siren intermedia nettingi, the western lesser siren. Sources disagree on the number of subspecies within S. intermedia; most agree there are at least two: an eastern and a western variety. Many sources also include a third subspecies, the Rio Grande lesser siren, S. i. texana, but researchers disagree whether the Rio Grande variety belongs as a lesser siren, within S. intermedia, or as a greater siren, within S. lacertina, and some others even consider it to be its own species, as S. texana. *Eastern lesser siren, S. i. intermedia Goin, 1942 *Western lesser siren, S. i. nettingi Goin, 1942 *Rio Grande lesser siren, S. i. texana Goin, 1957  Conservation status  The lesser siren is quite common through most of its range, but rarely seen due to its secretive nature. Like almost all species of amphibian, their numbers are believed to be declining due to general reductions in water quality caused by agricultural pesticide and fertilizer runoff. They are frequently collected and used as bait for fishing. The species was once believed to be extirpated from Michigan, but has been recently rediscovered in limited numbers. The S. i. texana subspecies is listed as a threatened species in Texas. They are listed as Least concern on the IUCN Red List and a species with \\"Special Protection\\" in Mexico.

He has made more than a hundred origami models, from simple lion masks to complex modular origami, such as a small stellated dodecahedron. He does not specialize in what is known as \\"super complex origami\\", but rather he likes making simple, elegant animals, and modular designs such as polyhedra, as well as exploring the mathematics and geometry of origami. A book expressing both approaches is Origami for the Connoisseur (Kasahara and Takahama), which gathers modern innovations in polyhedral construction, featuring moderately difficult but accessible methods for producing the Platonic solids from single sheets, and much more. Kasahara is perhaps origami's most enthusiastic designer and collector of origami models that are variations on a cube, a number of which appear in Vol. 2 of a 2005 three volume work (presently available only in Japanese). Vol. 3 of the same work is devoted to another Kasahara interest: reverse engineering and diagramming classic Japanese origami models pictured in early works, such as zenbazuru (thousand origami cranes from the Hiden Senbazuru Orikata of 1797, one of the earliest known origami books), the origami art of folding multiple connected cranes out of a single sheet of paper. He has written many books, of which Origami Omnibus is his best known book available in English, and contains many of his models as well as outstanding classics by others.

The series combines elements of mystery and fantasy as it follows the adventures of private investigator Garrett. Plot introduction Garrett is a hardboiled detective living in the city of TunFaire, a melting pot of different races, cultures, religions, and species. When people have problems, they often come to Garrett for help, but trouble has a way of finding Garrett on its own, whether he likes it or not. Plot summary Tinnie Tate comes to visit Garrett at home and is stabbed in the middle of the street by an unknown assailant. Garrett and Saucerhead run down the would-be assassin, but before they can interrogate him, he is killed by a crossbow-wielding band of hooligans. The only clue as to the villain's motive is mention of a book. Meanwhile, a woman named Winger visits Garrett; she is also looking for a book. When a third individual, a young woman named Carla Lindo Ramada, comes by in search of a book, at least she can shed some light on the mystery. They are looking for the Book of Dreams (or Book of Shadows), a magical tome that allows the user to take on a hundred different identities. As word gets out about the power of the Book of Shadows, several parties become involved, each trying to obtain the book before the others. Among those involved are Gnorst Gnorst, head of Dwarf Town, Chodo Contague, Kingpin of TunFaire, Lubbock, a fat wannabe wizard and Winger's employer, and The Serpent, a witch partially responsible for creating the Book of Shadows. As his desire for the Book of Shadows grows, Chodo Contague turns on Garrett, and in an attempt to save their own lives, Garrett, Winger, Crask, and Sadler strike an uneasy alliance to overthrow Chodo. In a confused battle at Chodo's mansion involving all the parties, Crask and Sadler manage to take over from Chodo, and Garrett and Winger escape alive. When Garrett returns home, he finds that Carla Lindo Ramada has escaped with the Book of Shadows, which had been hidden at Garrett's home the entire time. He and Winger manage to track Carla down, take back the book, and destroy it before any more evil can be committed in its name.

It is often used by the Air Training Corps and the Army Cadet Force, but is also a regular training area for the British Army. Notable residents * Thomas Fitzherbert (1552‚Äì1640) was an English Jesuit. Fitzherbert was born at Swynnerton, his father having died whilst he was an infant, he was, even as a child, the head of an important family and the first heir born at Swynnerton. * Lord Stafford's family presence dates back several centuries. * Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807‚Äì1882) is believed to have penned his famous poem, The Village Blacksmith, in Swynnerton. Key moments in history Maria Anne Fitzherbert1788 The one real love story in the life of George IV is that which tells of his marriage with a lady who might well have been the wife of any king. This was Maria Anne Smythe, better known in her second married name as Mrs. Fitzherbert, who met the then-Prince of Wales in 1784. She had been married to Thomas Fitzherbert of Swynnerton until his death in 1781, which left her well provided for. Maria Fitzherbert's face was one which always displayed its best advantages. Her eyes were peculiarly languishing, and, as she had already been twice a widow, and was six years his senior, she had the advantage over a less experienced lover. Likewise, she was a Catholic, and so by an act of Parliament any marriage he made with her would be illegal. Yet because of all these different objections the prince was doubly drawn to her, and was willing to sacrifice even the throne if he could but win her. Maria Fitzherbert died on 27 March 1837. Although the marriage was declared invalid under English civil law, Pope Pius VII declared the marriage legal.

It is defined as all lambeosaurines closer to Lambeosaurus lambei than to Parasaurolophus walkeri, Tsintaosaurus spinorhinus, or Aralosaurus tuberiferus, which define the other three tribes. Members of this tribe possess a distinctive protruding cranial crest. Lambeosaurins walked the earth for a period of around 12 million years in the Late Cretaceous, though they were confined to regions of modern-day North America and Asia.  History of classification  The term Corythosaurini was first used by Brett-Surman in 1989, who characterized the taxon via reference to the premaxilary expansion into a hollow helmet-like cranial crest, as well as higher neural spines. The clade was formally defined via phylogenetic analysis by Evans and Reisz in 2007, and this was confirmed by multiple other analyses. In 2011, Sullivan et al. observed that by the rules of priority set by the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, the name of the tribe ought to be Lambeosaurini due to its containing the defining type genus (Lambeosaurus) of its superior taxon (Lambeosaurinae).  Anatomy  The current articulation of Lambeosaurin anatomy is given by Prieto-Marquez et al., who characterised the tribe by the following traits: * \\"Vertical groove on lateral process of premaxilla, located rostral to dorsal process of maxilla and extending ventrally from small opening between premaxillary medial and lateral processes\\" * \\"Vertical groove bounded rostrally by triangular ventral projection of lateral process of the premaxilla\\" * \\"Nasal articulation surface for frontal shaped into rostroventrally-sloping platform\\" * \\"Nasal vestibule folded into S-loop in enclosed premaxillary passages rostral to dorsal process of maxilla\\" * \\"Lateral premaxillary process extending caudodorsal to prefrontal in adults\\" Lambeosaurines are classified into Lambeosaurini and Parasaurolophini based on the similarity with these characteristics or those defining Parasaurolophini. Another method of distinguishing the tribes is by the angle of the dural peak. Lambeosaurins possess a dural peak with an angle over 120¬∞, while in parasaurolophins the angle is less than 90¬∞. The anterior semicircular canals are also taller in Parasaurolophins than Lambeosaurins.  Phylogeny  Prieto-Marquez' analysis (2013) yielded the following cladogram, which shows the relative positions of the four Lambeosaurine tribes. Nipponosaurus has historically been considered to be a member of Lambeosaurini, but its position within the tribe is debated. A 2018 analysis by Takasaki et al. disputed this placement, instead placing Nipponosaurus in a clade with Arenysaurus and Blasisaurus as a sister taxa to Lambeosaurini. An alternative phylogenetic analysis by Xing et al. (2017) produced the following cladogram, which similarly places Arenysaurus outside Lambeosaurini.

The company was founded in 1944. Parsons has more than 16,000 employees across 24 countries. History Former Parsons headquarters in Pasadena, California Parsons was founded by Ralph M. Parsons in 1944. The company delivered electronics, instrumentation, ground checkout systems design, and engineering for aircraft, missiles and rockets during the Cold War.Thumbs up for performance. // Aviation Week & Space Technology, October 14, 1957, v. 67, no. 15, p. 84. In 1974, Parsons opened the first part of its Pasadena headquarters in Pasadena. In 2004, a $29.5 million contract was given to both Parsons and Gilbert Southern/Massman Construction to redo a portion of the Escambia Bay Bridge near Pensacola, FL after Hurricane Ivan made landfall and knocked off 58 spans of the original bridge and misaligned 66 other spans. Traffic destined for the bridge was rerouted onto US 90 (exit 17 on I-10) for 2 months while construction was taking place, which caused severe traffic jams. The westbound bridge opened to traffic on October 4, 6 days ahead of schedule, while the eastbound lanes opened to traffic on November 20, 66 days after Ivan made landfall and 27 days ahead of schedule. Both contractors received $1.5 million in bonuses for the early completion. In late February 2019, Parsons announced the move of its headquarters from Pasadena, California to Centreville, Virginia. On 8 May 2019, Parsons executed an Initial Public Offering of approximately $500M on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol PSN. In December 2019, it was announced that Parsons and Leidos Holdings Inc. had earned spots on a $4 billion contract to support the cleanup of a former nuclear weapons site in southern Washington state. Founder's legacy In 1961, Parsons founded the Ralph M. Parsons Foundation. The foundation became entirely independent from the company in 1974.

Acquisitions Controversial projects =Iraqi health care centers= Parsons was awarded a contract for a $243 million project to build 150 health care centers in Iraq in March 2004. By March 2006, $186 million had been spent, with six centers complete and accepted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), 135 centers only partly complete, and one reassigned to another contractor. USACE progressively terminated the contract from September 2005 to March 2006, eventually requiring Parsons to complete a total of 20 centers with the others to be completed by other contractors. The estimated cost for the completion of the other 121 centers was $36 million. Parsons and USACE disputed the degree to which the final 20 centers were completed. A report by the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction cited problems, including \\"high turnover among government personnel... directions... given without agreement from the contractor... program managers' responsiveness to contractor communications, cost and time reporting, administration and quality assurance\\". =CBOSS Positive train control system= Parsons was contracted in 2011 to implement a custom positive train control system for Caltrain, to be completed before the December 2015 federal PTC deadline mandated by the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008. The project, called the Communications Based Overlay Signal System (CBOSS), failed to meet its 2015 delivery date and Caltrain terminated the contract as a result of \\"non-performance in 2017 after many months of delay and repeated failure by the contractor to correct performance issues.\\" After the cancellation of the Parsons contract, Caltrain approved a new contract for an off-the-shelf PTC system from Wabtec Corporation.

Classification Diagram showing crest anatomy in lambeosaurines Lambeosaurines have been traditionally split into the tribes or clades Parasaurolophini (Parasaurolophus, Charonosaurus, others (?).) and Lambeosaurini (Corythosaurus, Hypacrosaurus, Lambeosaurus, others.). Corythosaurini (synonym of Lambeosaurini, see below) and Parasaurolophini as terms entered the formal literature in Evans and Reisz's 2007 redescription of Lambeosaurus magnicristatus. Corythosaurini was defined as all taxa more closely related to Corythosaurus casuarius than to Parasaurolophus walkeri, and Parasaurolophini as all those taxa closer to P. walkeri than to C. casuarius. In this study, Charonosaurus and Parasaurolophus are parasaurolophins, and Corythosaurus, Hypacrosaurus, Lambeosaurus, Nipponosaurus, and Olorotitan are corythosaurins. However, later researchers pointed out that due to the rules of priority set forth by the ICZN, Any tribe containing Lambeosaurus is properly named Lambeosaurini, and that therefore the name \\"Corythosaurini\\" is a junior synonym, and the definition had Corythosaurus casuarius changed to Lambeosaurus lambei, and the same for Parasaurolophini.Sullivan, R., Jasinsky, S.E., Guenther, M. and Lucas, S.G.

first defined as a clade, by Forster in a 1997 abstract, as simply \\"Lambeosaurinae plus Hadrosaurinae and their most recent common ancestor.\\" In 1998, Paul Sereno defined the clade Hadrosauridae as the most inclusive possible group containing Saurolophus (a well-known hadrosaurine) and Parasaurolophus (a well-known lambeosaurine), later emending the definition to include Hadrosaurus, the type genus of the family, which ICZN rules state must be included, despite its status as a nomen dubium. According to Horner et al. (2004), Sereno's definition would place a few other well-known hadrosaurs (such as Telmatosaurus and Bactrosaurus) outside the family, which led them to define the family to include Telmatosaurus by default. The following cladogram was recovered in a 2013 phylogenetic analysis by Albert Prieto-M√°rquez, and colleagues.

It has since the mid-20th century generally been called the Hadrosaurinae, a group of largely non-crested hadrosaurs related to the crested sub-family Lambeosaurinae. However, the name Hadrosaurinae is based on the genus Hadrosaurus which was found in more recent studies to be more primitive than either lambeosaurines or other traditional \\"hadrosaurines\\", like Edmontosaurus and Saurolophus. As a result of this, the name Hadrosaurinae was dropped or restricted to Hadrosaurus alone, and the subfamily comprising the traditional \\"hadrosaurines\\" was renamed the Saurolophinae. Recent phylogenetic work by Hai Xing indicates that Hadrosaurus is placed within the monophyletic group containing all non-lambeosaurine hadrosaurids. Under this view, the traditional Hadrosaurinae is resurrected, with the Hadrosauridae being divided into two clades: Hadrosaurinae and Lambeosaurinae. Saurolophinae was first defined as a clade in a 2010 phylogenetic analysis by Prieto-M√°rquez. Traditionally, the \\"crestless\\" branch of the family Hadrosauridae had been named Hadrosaurinae. However, the use of the term Hadrosaurinae was questioned in a comprehensive study of hadrosaurid relationships by Albert Prieto-M√°rquez in 2010. Prieto-M√°rquez noted that, though the name Hadrosaurinae had been used for the clade of mostly crestless hadrosaurids by nearly all previous studies, its type species, Hadrosaurus foulkii, has almost always been excluded from the clade that bears its name, in violation of the rules for naming animals set out by the ICZN. Prieto-M√°rquez (2010) defined Hadrosaurinae as only the lineage containing H. foulkii, and used the name Saurolophinae instead for the traditional grouping. The cladogram below follows Godefroit et al. (2012) analysis. The following cladogram was recovered in the 2013 phylogenetic analysis by Prieto-M√°rquez (the relationships within Lambeosaurinae and between basal hadrosauroids aren't shown).

Guide #1636 (December 2007); Page 135 ‚Äì May 21, 2010) Alternate source: \\"'Dropouts' cartoonist Howard Post dies in NJ at 83\\", Associated Press via The Washington Post, May 24, 2010 was an American animator, cartoonist, and comic strip and comic book writer-artist. Post is known for his syndicated newspaper comic strip The Dropouts which had a 13-year run and for creating DC Comics' Anthro. Early life and career Born in New York City, Post grew up in the Coney Island and Sheepshead Bay neighborhoods of Brooklyn and then in The Bronx.Howard Post interview, \\"Country Boy from the City\\", Comic Book Artist #5 (Summer 1999) In a 1999 interview, he recalled his start in drawing and his father's influence: As a teenager, Post attended the Hastings School of Animation, in New York City. When he was age 16 or 17, his father was stricken with tuberculosis and hospitalized, making Post the primary breadwinner for a family of four. At Paramount Pictures' animation studio, Famous Studios he earned $24 a week as an in-betweener. Comic books To supplement what even then was considered a meager income, Post broke into comic books‚Äîfirst being rejected by the L.B. Cole studio on 42nd Street and then successfully selling work to artist Bernard Baily on West 43rd. Post's earliest confirmed comic book art appeared in 1945: the cover of publisher Prize Comics' Wonderland Comics #2, and the five-page \\"3-Alarm Fire!\\", starring Hopeless Henry, in Cambridge House Publishers' Gold Medal Comics #1. Credited as Howie Post, he soon began drawing for the company that would become DC Comics, including the features \\"Jimminy and the Magic Book\\" in More Fun Comics,\\"Jimminy and the Magic Book\\" at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on October 8, 2016. \\"Rodeo Rick\\" in Western Comics, \\"Presto Pete\\" in Animal Antics, \\"Chick 'n Gumbo\\" in Funny Folks, and \\"J. Rufus Lion\\" in Comic Cavalcade, among other work. During the 1950s, he drew many humorous stories for the satirical comics Crazy, Wild, and Riot, from Marvel Comics' 1950s forerunner, Atlas Comics, as well as occasional stories in that publishers horror comics, including Journey into Mystery, Uncanny Tales, and Mystery Tales. As Howie Post, he drew the three-issue run of Atlas' The Monkey and the Bear (Sept. 1953 - Jan. 1954). Harvey Comics By 1961, Post was drawing adventures of such Harvey Comics‚Äô characters as Hot Stuff the Little Devil, Spooky the Tuff Little Ghost, Wendy the Good Little Witch, and the Ghostly Trio in such comics books as Casper's Ghostland and TV Casper & Company, starring Casper the Friendly Ghost. Post was the head of Paramount Cartoon Studios, as well as a key director, succeeding Seymour Kneitel from 1964 through 1965. Anthro In the late 1960s, as Howie Post, he created, wrote and drew the prehistoric-teen comic book Anthro for DC Comics, which ran six issues (Aug. 1968 - Aug. 1969) after debuting in 'Showcase', with the last issue in the series inked by Wally Wood and Ralph Reese. The Dropouts Howard Post's The Dropouts (July 20, 1970) The Dropouts was a comic strip created by Post and was syndicated by United Features Syndicate from 1968 to 1981. Post began the strip at the same time his comic book Anthro was canceled. The premise of The Dropouts was a variation on the \\"stranded on a desert island\\" gag. The two main characters, Alf and Sandy, were indeed castaways, but the island is hardly deserted: One of the strips' running gags was how closely the natives' society resembled Western civilization.

History The Palmerston government initiated a large system of coastal fortifications and Lavernock Battery was the most northerly of a chain of defences across the Bristol Channel, protecting the access to Bristol and Cardiff. Completed in 1870, the battery was initially armed with three rifled muzzle-loading (RML) Mk III guns on disappearing carriages. An 1895 inventory reported a fourth seven-inch gun.

The car was designed by the chief engineer of Leyland Motors, J.G. Parry-Thomas and his assistant Reid Railton, and was intended to be the finest car available. It was the first British car with a straight-eight engine. The Eight was introduced to the public at the 1920 International Motor Exhibition at Olympia, London, where it was referred to as the \\"Lion of Olympia\\". Engine and transmission The engine, with cylinder block and upper crankcase cast in one piece, had a single centrally mounted overhead camshaft, hemispherical combustion chambers, and an bore. The engine was offered in one of two capacities: with a stroke, producing at 2,500 rpm or with a stroke and twin carburettors, producing at 3,500 rpm. The crankshaft ran in five bearings. Ignition was by coil and distributor rather than magneto which was the more usual British practice at the time. Transmission was through a single plate clutch to a separately mounted four speed gearbox. The rear axle was unconventional with the differential mounted ahead of the axle. The spiral bevel crown wheel and pinion arrangement had two crown wheels each attached to a half shaft allowing them to be arranged at an angle to each other to give the rear wheels a positive camber. Chassis and suspension The channel section chassis had suspension by leaf springs at the front and a mix of leaf springs and torsion bars at the rear. At the front semi-elliptical springs were used with radius arms controlling fore and aft movement of the axle. The radius arms were joined by a torsion bar across the front of the chassis to act as an anti-roll bar. At the rear the quarter-elliptical springs had their front ends mounted in a boss that was attached to a short transverse torsion bar which controlled the rotation of the boss making the suspension a hybrid arrangement. As at the front linked radius rods provided axle location and anti-roll properties. The brakes, with vacuum servo assistance, were on the rear wheels only. Coachwork Factory-made bodies were available in open tourer style with either two or five seats and chassis were also supplied to customers for their choice of coachbuilders which included Vanden Plas and Windovers. The car was very expensive, the chassis for delivery to a coachbuilder costing ¬£2,500 in 1920 reducing to ¬£1,875 in 1922 and only about 18 were made. It was the most expensive British car of its day. Today, the only example known to exist, a Leyland-Thomas, is one assembled from spares in 1929 and in the collection of the Heritage Motor Centre. Leyland-Thomas The 1924 Leyland-Thomas No. 1 After amicably leaving Leyland in 1922 J. G. Parry-Thomas moved to premises at Brooklands race track taking with him at least three chassis and a large quantity of spares. There he built the Leyland-Thomas, a racing special based on the Leyland Eight. After the death of Parry Thomas his premises were taken over by Thomson & Taylor who built the car now owned by the British Motor Industry Heritage Trust. Owners Michael Collins, the Irish politician and revolutionary leader, was travelling in a Leyland Eight when he was fatally shot in 1922.

The series combines elements of mystery and fantasy as it follows the adventures of private investigator Garrett. Plot introduction Garrett is a hardboiled detective living in the city of Tun Faire, a melting pot of different races, cultures, religions, and species. When people have problems, they often come to Garrett for help, but trouble has a way of finding Garrett on its own, whether he likes it or not. Plot summary Garrett is relaxing at the Joy House with Saucerhead and Morley Dotes, when Belinda Contague, daughter of Kingpin Chodo Contague, stumbles into the bar. She is attacked by a wizened old man who spits butterflies from his mouth and tries to kidnap Belinda in his black stagecoach. As strange as this is, Garrett moves on to his next job, tailing a religious crackpot by the name of Barking Dog Amato. This job, however, takes a backseat when Captain Westman Block comes knocking at Garrett's door. Block needs Garrett's help to solve a series of grisly murders, in which upper class young ladies are being strung up and gutted in strange, ritualistic killings. Garrett soon realizes that the attempted kidnapping of Belinda Contague is connected to the murders. Garrett and Morley then go pay the owner of the coach a visit, and in a bungled sleuthing attempt, Garrett ends up killing the serial killer. Figuring that the case is closed, Garrett finds time to spend on Barking Dog Amato, but before he can get going, Captain Block comes by to inform Garrett that there has been another murder. It seems that there is a curse associated with the murders, so that killing the murderer does not prevent the rise of a new serial killer. Even when Garrett and Block find the new killer, the curse spreads again. Meanwhile, Garrett finds out that Chodo Contague suffered a stroke during his encounter with the Serpent in Dread Brass Shadows, and Crask and Sadler are ruling the crime world in his stead. Belinda Contague, fearing Crask and Sadler, seeks out Garrett for help; Belinda is also in danger of being slain by the cursed serial killer. When Block and Garrett, along with Relway, an up-and-coming member of the Watch, find the new bearer of the curse, he escapes yet again. Ultimately, after a final plot twist, the curse is broken, and Belinda Contague overthrows Crask and Sadler and takes over as ruler of the underworld, using her father as a figurehead. Finally, as a gag gift, Morley gives Garrett an annoying talking parrot, which takes a major role in later Garrett novels.

It runs along the banks of the Hudson River next to Riverside Drive and the Henry Hudson Parkway from West 155th Street to Dyckman Street. The George Washington Bridge crosses above the park, and below the bridge is the small point of land also called Jeffrey's Hook, which is the site of the Little Red Lighthouse. The park features riverside views of the New Jersey Palisades and the George Washington Bridge. Amenities include pedestrian and greenway paths, baseball fields, basketball courts, tennis courts, volleyball courts, a soccer field and a playground.  Etymology  The name references the nearby site of Fort Washington, a fortified position that was the site of the 1776 Battle of Fort Washington during the American Revolutionary War. The fort is physically located and commemorated in Bennett Park.  Geography  Fort Washington Park covers . It is bounded on the west by the Hudson River, on the north by Dyckman Street, on the east by the Henry Hudson Parkway, and on the south by 155th Street. The park contains connections to Inwood Hill Park to the north and Fort Tryon Park and Riverside Park to the south; all are part of the Manhattan Waterfront Greenway. The Henry Hudson Parkway (NY 9A) and Amtrak's Empire Connection run through the western part of the park.  History  During the American Revolutionary War, a series of fortifications were built on the steep cliff east of the park's northeast corner, which was known by the Americans as Fort Washington. The actual site of Fort Washington is less than a mile south at Bennett Park. The area was an ancillary site of the Battle of Fort Washington, fought on November 16, 1776, in which British troops took Fort Washington after a two-hour battle. The British peacefully withdrew from Manhattan in 1783. The fortification was later demolished and the surrounding area came to be known as Washington Heights. A rock commemorating the \\"American Redout\\" (using an archaic spelling of redoubt) is located in the park near 181st Street, at a location that is hard to access. Pathway near 176th Street During the construction of Riverside Park and Riverside Drive to the south in the late 19th century, Frederick Law Olmsted devised plans for Riverside, Fort Washington, and Morningside Parks, which called for these parks to be designed around the existing landscape. Fort Washington Park was created in 1894 through city legislation. Between 1896 and 1927, most of the parcels were acquired through five incidents of eminent domain. Several plans for development within Fort Washington Park were proposed during the early 20th century, such as a plan to build a waterside annex for the West End Hotel in 1912, and a theater-and-comfort-station complex the following year. These were never built due to neighborhood opposition. Two structures were built within the park during this time: the Little Red Lighthouse and the Inspiration Point shelter. Improvements to the park in the 1910s, which entailed clearing hundreds of trees for bridle paths and walkways, resulted in a lawsuit from sculptor Gutzon Borglum. Another project in the same area concerned the presence of the New York Central Railroad's West Side Line (now the Empire Connection) within the park. In 1916, the railroad and local groups agreed on a plan to build a tunnel for the railroad under Riverside and Fort Washington Parks. Concurrently, Riverside Drive was to be extended northward through Fort Washington Park and to the Bronx. In January 1917, John D. Rockefeller Jr. purchased Fort Tryon Park adjacent to the northeast corner of Fort Washington Park. That June, he announced that Fort Tryon would be given to the city on the conditions that it be joined to the existing Fort Washington and Riverside Parks on the Hudson River, and that the city maintain that park. To preserve the views from the parks along the Hudson River, Rockefeller had purchased land on the opposite side of the Hudson, thereby preventing it from being developed; this later became Palisades Interstate Park. The city acquired of land in 1921 to connect the two park sites. In 1927, part of Fort Washington Park was given to the Port of New York Authority, which built the George Washington Bridge directly above the park. During construction, one advocacy group expressed concerns that the presence of the bridge's towers would degrade the quality of Fort Washington Park directly underneath. The bridge was opened in 1931 and the connection to Fort Tryon Park opened four years later. The Henry Hudson Parkway, running east of the park, opened in 1936. In the following years, additional land for Fort Washington Park was acquired. This included from the Port of New York Authority in 1939, the New York City Board of Estimate in 1966, and the New York City Department of Real Property in 1989. A survey in 2013 found that Fort Washington Park was larger than previously measured, making the park 160 acres in total. Several improvements were also made to Fort Washington Park. As part of the construction of a nearby psychiatric facility at 165th Street in 1994, a new footbridge to the park was built. A marina at Dyckman Street was opened the following year, and the Lily Brown Playground was renovated from 2001 to 2002. In 2014, a $3.5 million, bicycle path was opened within the park, running from Dyckman Street to a dead end at 186th Street. A connection between the new bike path and the existing Manhattan Waterfront Greenway at 180th Street would cost $22 million, since it would require the construction of additional shoreline on the river.  Structures  = Inspiration Point = Inspiration Point The Inspiration Point shelter is located in the park, close to the intersection of the Henry Hudson Parkway and 181st Street. It was designed in the Neoclassical style by Gustave Steinacher and opened in 1925. The shelter consisted of two levels: a deck with Doric columns and a wooden trellis on the upper story, and restrooms on the lower story. The shelter was popular among motorists who used it for private romantic encounters, but later fell into disuse. = Lighthouse = Closer view of the Little Red Lighthouse from the park The Little Red Lighthouse is located on a spit of land under the George Washington Bridge, called Jeffrey's Hook. The current lighthouse, which replaced a rudimentary indicator, was initially located at Sandy Hook, New Jersey, and was decommissioned at that site in 1917. The United States Lighthouse Establishment moved the lighthouse to Fort Washington Park in 1921, and it was decommissioned in 1948, having become outdated after the George Washington Bridge's construction. The United States Coast Guard initially intended to sell off the lighthouse, but decided against doing so after protests from local children. Since 1951, NYC Parks has operated the lighthouse as part of Fort Washington Park. The Little Red Lighthouse is both on the National Register of Historic Places\\"Little Red Lighthouse\\" , Washington Heights & Inwood Online, NYC Dept. of Parks & Recreation, August 2001, accessed February 27, 2012 and a designated New York City Landmark. = Dyckman Street Boat Marina = The Dyckman Street Boat Marina is located at the northern tip of the park at the end of Dyckman Street. Formerly the site of a car float across the Hudson River, which closed in 1941, the land was given to NYC Parks in 1966. Twenty-one years later, Dyckman Marine Venture proposed redeveloping the car float site with a marina, pier, and restaurant, and NYC Parks gave the organization permission to use the site. The complex was partially paid through federal government funds due to an obscure stipulation in a federal law that primarily provided funds to suburban and rural fisheries. Completed in 1995, the marina also includes a fishing pier. = Recreational facilities = Fort Washington Park contains Lily Brown Playground at 162nd Street. Built on a parcel that was acquired in 1925, the playground is located on an embankment. It is named after Lily Brown, a local resident who in the 1980s and 1990s advocated for a renovation of the playground. The playground was restored in the early 2000s. The southern end of the park also contains two baseball fields, a soccer field, five softball fields, a basketball court, and ten handball courts. The area between 155th and 165th Streets is the only portion of Fort Washington Park with active recreational facilities.

Population details as taken in the 2011 census can be found under Swynnerton It is considered part of historic Stone, and is near to other historic locations such as Eccleshall and Swynnerton. It is the site of a large training and conference centre, Yarnfield Park, originally established using three of the seven hostels built to serve the vast Second World War Swynnerton munitions factory. Of the other hostel sites, Raleigh Hall is now an industrial estate, previously having housed Ugandan Asian refugees thrown out of Uganda by Idi Amin in 1972; Drake Hall is a women's prison; Nelson Hall and Frobisher Hall have been replaced with housing estates, as has Duncan Hall, one of the three camps which formed the training centre later developed as Yarnfield Park. The General Post Office (GPO) Engineering Department Central Training School opened in Yarnfield in 1946. It occupied buildings at Howard Hall, Duncan Hall and Beatty Hall, which had all acted as transit camps for United States Air Force personnel during the Second World War. These sites were adjacent to each other in the village of Yarnfield. Many teaching staff and their families were initially housed at Raleigh Hall, some miles away. The GPO became the Post Office Corporation in October 1969, and in October 1981 Post Office telephones became British Telecom. The training centre had a further change of name in 2002 when it became part of Accenture. It remained a British Telecom training centre until the summer of 2010, after which it became a commercial conference and training centre with over 40 event spaces and 338 bedrooms, making it one of the UK's largest centres, although Openreach, which is a part of BT still has a training centre there. The centre is now privately owned and is known as Yarnfield Park Training & Conference Centre. The village has performed very well in the Staffordshire Best Kept Village competition in recent years.

As of 2017 the tourism industry in Wales has been estimated to have an annual turnover of ¬£4.8 billion. In 2005 tourism contributed to the economy of Wales supporting over 100,000 service- sector jobs, more than 8% of the country's workforce. The most popular activities undertaken by tourists in Wales were walking, shopping, hiking in the mountains and visiting historic attractions, museums and galleries. 970,000 overseas tourists visited Wales in 2015 spending ¬£410m. The main countries of origin of overseas visitors were the Republic of Ireland, the United States and Germany.

In 2004, tourists spent the most money in Gwynedd, followed by Conwy and Cardiff. Reasons Caernarfon Castle, North Wales The varied landscape of Wales attracts tourism. There are three national parks: the Brecon Beacons National Park, the Snowdonia National Park and the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park. Popular activities in the national parks include hill walking, hiking, canoeing, mountain biking, kayaking and climbing. Wales is also becoming increasingly popular for 'extreme' sports, such as surfing, hang gliding and downhill cycling (in which Wales hosts the 'Dragon Downhill Series'). The terrain of Wales has also attracted the World Rally Championship (WRC). The Wales Rally GB is held annually. The 2005 Wales Rally GB saw the first WRC stage to be set indoors, at the Millennium Stadium. In Cardiff, the regenerated Cardiff Bay area is one of the most popular destinations. Wales' history and culture also attract tourists. The Museum of Welsh Life, which focuses largely on the industrial past of Wales, is currently the most popular tourist attraction in Wales, attracting over 600,000 visitors annually. The scars of the industrial revolution and Wales' industrial heritage can still be seen on parts of the Welsh landscape today. Many other places of historical interest attract large numbers of tourists: for example the many castles, such as Caernarfon Castle and Caerphilly Castle‚Äîmost of them built to enable or to consolidate the English conquest of Wales, during the reign of the English king Edward I. Another increasingly popular reason for visiting Wales, as with the rest of the United Kingdom‚Äîespecially for those from North America‚Äîis genealogy, with many visitors coming to Wales to explore their family and ancestral roots. 1.8 million United States citizens are estimated to have Welsh ancestral roots, including former presidents, Abraham Lincoln and Thomas Jefferson. History The Chancel and Crossing of Tintern Abbey, Looking towards the East Window by J. M. W. Turner, 1794 The Wye Valley witnessed the birth of British tourism in the 18th century. The area became widely known after Observations on the River Wye by the Reverend William Gilpin was published in 1782. The first illustrated tour guide to be published in Britain, it helped travellers locate and enjoy the most picturesque places, such as Tintern Abbey. A particular attraction of the Wye Valley was its river scenery, and the many guidebooks, engravings and paintings encouraged a continuing steady stream of visitors which grew after the building of a new turnpike road up the valley in 1822 and the opening of a rail line in 1865. However, when George Borrow wrote Wild Wales in 1862 it is clear from his descriptions that the notion of tourism in more mountainous parts of Wales hardly existed except for the most intrepid traveller. Indeed, he records that many locals regarded the mountainous and wild landscapes as monstrous and ugly rather than romantic or picturesque. However, later in the 19th century the concept of mountains and valleys as both interesting and visually pleasing landscapes developed; and North Wales in particular benefited, as towns and villages such as Betws-y-Coed developed to accommodate the increasing numbers of visitors. The changing face of industrialisation in the North West of England and in the Midlands, with increasing pay rates and the provision of paid time off for industrial workers, allowed many people to enjoy an annual holiday for the first time. Many chose to visit seaside resorts such as Llandudno, Prestatyn and Rhyl in North Wales, Aberystwyth and Barmouth in Mid Wales and Barry, Tenby, Swansea and Penarth in South Wales, which among others were developed to respond to this trend. Infrastructure Wales is connected to the rest of the United Kingdom (its principal tourist market) by road, rail and domestic flights. The M4 Motorway connects South and West Wales with Southern England and London. The A55 road is the principal route linking North Wales with North West England. There are several rail links between England and Wales, and trains run to Cardiff Central, Newport and Swansea from London Paddington, and to Cardiff Central from Portsmouth, Gloucester, Birmingham New Street, Manchester Picadilly, Nottingham and Newcastle. Cardiff Central offers connections to the South Wales Valleys, the Vale of Glamorgan and West Wales, and Swansea offers connections to West Wales. There are direct services from London Euston and Birmingham to Holyhead via the North Wales Coast. Internally, there are services from Cardiff to Holyhead. Cardiff Airport has domestic and some international flights. Some budget airlines operate from Cardiff to Europe, Africa and North America. Internally, there are twice daily return flights from Cardiff to Anglesey with Highland Airways. Many daily flight operate to and from other major UK cities such as Newcastle, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Belfast. The country is also connected to Ireland by car ferry services operating daily from Welsh ports, principally Holyhead. These services are frequent and usually operated by fast ferries.

It is the largest church in the South Lanarkshire town of Lesmahagow. A Culdee settlement of Celtic monks existed prior to the 12th Century. The church was dedicated in the name of St. Machutus (St. Malo). This dedication was retained when King David I of Scotland granted \\"the Church and lands of Lesmahagow\\" to the Tironensian Order of monks who had already established Kelso Abbey at Kelso. The Priory Church was burnt in 1335 by troops under the command of John of Eltham, brother of King Edward I of England. Many people had sought sanctuary within the church at the time of the burning and are thought to have perished. Thereafter a new church was constructed and lasted until the early 19th century. The present church was constructed in 1804 on the original site. Originally built as a plain, rectangular church, an apse was constructed later in the 19th century and an organ (in the West Gallery) was built by Brindley & Foster and installed in 1889. The Chapter House was added in 1934. After serious damage by fire in 1981 the apse was restored and the entire church redecorated. The church contains some notable stained glass. The centre panel of the East Window, \\"The Descent from the Cross\\" is a copy from the centre panel of the triptych painted by Rubens for an altar in Antwerp Cathedral in 1614. The current minister (since 2003) is the Revd Aileen Robson. Recent former ministers were the Revd Sheila Mitchell 1995-2002 (now a hospital chaplain in Ayr), preceded by the Revd William Niven 1969-1994 (who died in December 2004).

They are signed to Ki/oon Records, a subsidiary of Sony Music. Biography Home Made Kazoku is a trio, consisting of members Micro, Kuro, and DJ U-Ichi. The band was originally formed in 1996 under a different name. The band was in a state of flux with regard to membership until 2001, when they settled on becoming a trio with the name Home Made Kazoku. From 2001 to 2003, the band performed in various Nagoya nightclubs. In early 2004, the band was chosen to be part of a country-wide tour known as the Japan Club Tour. During the tour, the trio gained a large portion of their Japanese fanbase, and were also signed on by the recording company, Ki/oon Records. Vocalists Micro and Kuro are originally from the United States. Micro spent a portion of his childhood in Kentucky, while Kuro stated that he lived in the U.S. until he was twelve in Chicago, Illinois.http://www.sonymusic.co.jp/Music/Info/home-made/index_pc2.html Shortly after being signed on by a recording company, the group released an album containing the song \\"Home Sweet Home (Reborn),\\" which became one of the most requested songs on Japanese radio stations for the rest of the year. In July 2004, Home Made Kazoku released their first single, Summer Time Magic. Summer Time Magic ranked 15th on the Oricon record charts for nearly 10 weeks. After a series of singles, including Thank You!!, which was used as the second ending theme for the anime Bleach, and Sh≈çnen Heart, as well as the second opening theme for the anime Eureka Seven, the band's first full-length album was released \\"Rock the World\\". \\"Rock the World\\" entered the Oricon charts. The record was in fifth place on the Oricon chart for its first week, and would stay in top 20 for the next eight weeks. Rock the World sold 191,744 copies and became the 78th best selling album of 2005. After their first album, the group went on several tours and concomitantly released several singles. They also released their second and third albums, \\"Musication\\" and \\"Familia\\". Of special note, tickets to their second tour were sold out within the span of one hour, a record in Japanese music. In January 2007, it was announced that they would perform the first ending theme to the anime Naruto: Shipp≈´den entitled Nagareboshi Shooting Star which entered the Oricon charts at 10th place. One of the member, Micro, was featured on the Abingdon Boys School song \\"Lost Reason\\" as it appeared on their self-titled album. Home Made Kazoku has performed for a promotional commercial for a product called \\"Walky Walky\\" with their song \\"Easy Walk\\". In addition, Home Made Kazoku's single, No Rain No Rainbow, is the movie theme for the second Naruto Shipp≈´den movie. In 2011, Home Made Kazoku returned to Naruto Shippuden for the third time with the song \\"FREEDOM\\", which was the 17th ending theme. The band played their first show in the US at Otakon 2010 in Baltimore, MD, and returned for Otakon 2013 alongside T.M. Revolution. Their official blog in August 2016 that the trio will go on indefinite hiatus by the end of the year. According to the comment by group member Micro, the group is taking a hiatus to \\"grow individually and take on new challenges.\\" The group's three members will then pursue solo careers. Style Home Made Kazoku usually displays a very up-beat mood in their music, sometimes described by fans as \\"feel-good music\\". The pace of the songs may vary from moderately slow and calm to moderately fast and energetic. Following a trend within Japanese pop, the group makes use of English phrases within the music. This use is rather extensive, as nearly every song contains some amount of English. Most songs utilize the language in the refrain as well as in isolated instances throughout a song. The subject matter of the music usually concerns love, family, peace, harmonious communication with others, fun, and summer festivities. Additionally, most of the music videos seem to take place in the spring or summer, hearkening back to their up-beat mood and liveliness. When asked what they want listeners to take away from hearing their music, they responded saying that no matter where you come from or the color of your skin, we are all one big family. When asked which American artist they would most like to collaborate with, the group showed interest primarily in hip-hop and pop artists. Micro would most like to work with The Black Eyed Peas, Kuro with Stevie Wonder and U-ICHI with Jay-Z.

Eventually the project was canceled in 2011 for the increased cost and the difficulty of achieving science goals. It was planned to feature a 9 m diameter dish antenna to observe in 8, 22 and 43 GHz bands, and was to be used in combination with ground radio telescopes to perform Very Long Baseline Interferometry.

Introduction \\"To this day reverence for water is deeply ingrained in Zoroastrians, and in orthodox communities offerings are regularly made to the household well or nearby stream.\\" The ape zaothra ceremony--the culminating rite of the Yasna service (which is in turn the principal act of worship)--is literally for the \\"strengthening of the waters.\\" Avestan apas (from singular ƒÅp≈ç) is grammatically feminine, and the Apas are female. The Middle Persian equivalents are ƒÅbƒÅn/ƒÄbƒÅn (alt: ƒÅvƒÅn/ƒÄvƒÅn), from which Parsi Gujarati ƒÅvƒÅ/ƒÄvƒÅ (in religious usage only) derive. The Avestan common noun ƒÅpas corresponds exactly to Vedic Sanskrit ', and both derive from the same proto-Indo-Iranian word, stem *ap- \\"water\\", cognate with the British river Avon. In both Avestan and Vedic Sanskrit texts, the waters--whether as waves or drops, or collectively as streams, pools, rivers or wells--are represented by the Apas, the group of divinities of the waters. The identification of divinity with element is complete in both cultures : in the RigVeda the divinities are wholesome to drink, in the Avesta the divinities are good to bathe in. As also in the Indian religious texts, the waters are considered a primordial element. In Zoroastrian cosmogony, the waters are the second creation, after that of the sky. Aside from Apas herself/themselves, no less than seven Zoroastrian divinities are identified with the waters: All three Ahuras (Mazda, Mithra, Apam Napat), two Amesha Spentas (Haurvatat, Armaiti) and two lesser Yazatas (Aredvi Sura Anahita and Ahurani). Abans, a crater on Ariel, one of the moons of Uranus, is named after aban. In scripture In the seven-chapter Yasna Haptanghaiti, which interrupts the sequential order of the Gathas and is linguistically as old as the Gathas themselves, the waters are revered as the Ahuranis, wives of the Ahura (Yasna 38.3). Although not otherwise named, Boyce associates this Ahura with Apam Napat (middle Persian: Burz Yazad), another divinity of waters. In Yasna 38, which is dedicated \\"to the earth and the sacred waters\\", apas/Apas is not only necessary for nourishment, but is considered the source of life (\\"you that bear forth\\", \\"mothers of our life\\"). In Yasna 2.5 and 6.11, apas/Apas is \\"Mazda-made and holy\\". In the Aban Yasht (Yasht 5), which is nominally dedicated to the waters, veneration is directed specifically at Aredvi Sura Anahita, another divinity identified with the waters, but originally representing the \\"world river\\" that encircled the earth (see In tradition, below). The merger of the two concepts \\"probably\\" came about due to prominence given to Aredvi Sura during the reign of Artaxerxes II (r. 404-358 BCE) and subsequent Achaemenid emperors. Although (according to Lommel and Boyce) Aredvi is of Indo-Iranian origin and cognate with Vedic Saraswati, during the 5th century BCE Aredvi was conflated with a Semitic divinity with similar attributes, from whom she then inherited additional properties. In other Avesta texts, the waters are implicitly associated with [Spenta] Armaiti (middle Persian Spendarmad), the Amesha Spenta of the earth (this association is properly developed in Bundahishn 3.17). In Yasna 3.1, the eminence of Aban is reinforced by additionally assigning guardianship to another Amesha Spenta Haurvatat (middle Persian: (K)hordad). In tradition According to the Bundahishn, ('Original Creation', an 11th- or 12th-century text), aban was the second of the seven creations of the material universe, the lower half of everything. In a development of a cosmogonical view already alluded to in the Vendidad (21.15), aban is the essence of a \\"great gathering place of the waters\\" (Avestan: Vourukasha, middle Persian: Varkash) upon which the world ultimately rested. The great sea was fed by a mighty river (proto- Indo-Iranian: *harahvati, Avestan: Aredvi Sura, middle Persian: Ardvisur). Two rivers, one to the east and one to the west, flowed out of it and encircled the earth (Bundahishn 11.100.2, 28.8) where they were then cleansed by Puitika (Avestan, middle Persian: Putik), the tidal sea, before flowing back into the Vourukasha. In the Zoroastrian calendar, the tenth day of the month is dedicated to the (divinity of) waters (Siroza 1.10), under whose protection that day then lies. Additionally, Aban is also the name of the eighth month of the year of the Zoroastrian calendar (Bundahishn 1a.23-24), as well as that of the Iranian calendar of 1925, which follows Zoroastrian month-naming conventions. It might be the precursor of the holy month of Sha'aban in the Hijri calendar. sha'aban meaning The Zoroastrian name-day feast of Abanagan, also known as the Aban Ardvisur Jashan by Indian Zoroastrians (see: Parsis), is celebrated on the day that the day-of-month and month-of-year dedications intersect, that is, on the tenth day of the eighth month. The celebration is accompanied by a practice of offering sweets and flowers to a river or the sea. From among the flowers associated with the yazatas, aban's is the water- lily (Bundahishn 27.24).

The series combines elements of mystery and fantasy as it follows the adventures of private investigator Garrett. Plot introduction Garrett is a hardboiled detective living in the city of TunFaire, a melting pot of different races, cultures, religions, and species. When people have problems, they often come to Garrett for help, but trouble has a way of finding Garrett on its own, whether he likes it or not. Plot summary TunFaire is in a state of unrest; with the sudden end of the war in the Cantard, returning former soldiers are at odds with the half-breeds and immigrants who have taken their places in society. Garrett, however, has his own problems to worry about - he gets knocked out, brought before a group of small-time gods known as the Godoroth, and forced into working for them. The goal: find the \\"key\\" to the one remaining temple up for grabs in TunFaire, and do so before the Shayir, the Godoroth's rivals. The Shayir find out about the Godoroth's plans. The Shayir capture Garrett and give him their side of the story. Only with the help of a renegade Shayir called Cat does Garrett manage to escape. As the civil unrest escalates into full-fledged street warfare, the Godoroth and Shayir elevate their search for Garrett, and Cat, who has her own agenda, is apparently the only one Garrett can trust. When the battle between the Godoroth and Shayir spills over into the world of the living, causing madness in the streets of TunFaire, the more powerful gods of the city decide it is time to intervene. After an epic battle between gods, Garrett hopes the trouble is over, but the Dead Man thinks there is still a missing piece or two to the puzzle. Eventually, the Dead Man deduces that there was yet another party behind the struggle between the Godoroth and Shayir. When everything settles down and is sorted out, the remaining gods go back to their own business, leaving Garrett to go back to his beer. Characters  *Garrett *The Dead Man *Dean *The Goddamn Parrot (Mr. Big) *Morley Dotes *Saucerhead Tharpe *Winger Allusions to other works One of the characters in Petty Pewter Gods, \\"Nog the Inescapable\\", appears to be a homage to \\"Chun the Unavoidable\\" from Jack Vance's short story \\"Liane the Wayfarer\\" in his Dying Earth series. In both storylines, the protagonist (Liane, Garret) has a gadget (Liane's ring, Garret's rope) that creates a pocket in space that they can hide in. In both cases they encounter a small creature (a Twk-man, a pixie) who \\"saw what they did\\". Both at the end of Liane the Wayfarer and at a critical juncture in Petty Pewter Gods, when the protagonist finally uses their gadget to hide from their nemesis (Chun, Nog), it proves useless.

Formerly Caedmon Records, its marketing tag-line was Caedmon: a Third Dimension for the Printed Page. The name changed when the label switched to CD-only production. Caedmon history Caedmon was a pioneer in the audiobook business, it was the first company to sell spoken word recordings to the public and has been called the \\"seed\\" of the audiobook industry. Caedmon was formed in New York in 1952 by college graduates Barbara Holdridge and Marianne Roney. Their first release was a collection of poems by Dylan Thomas as read by the author. The B-side contained A Child's Christmas in Wales which was added as an afterthought - the story was obscure and Thomas himself couldn't remember its title when asked what to use to fill up the LP's B-side - but this recording went on to become one of his most loved works, and launched Caedmon into a successful company. The original 1952 recording was a 2008 selection for the United States National Recording Registry, stating it is \\"credited with launching the audiobook industry in the United States\\". The company went on to record other notable writers reading their own works, such as W. H. Auden, Robert Frost, T. S. Eliot, Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein and many more. The label expanded further to encompass other types of spoken word recordings, including children's stories, speeches, plus English- and foreign-language classics. Theater performances were also staged for the label, starring either the Shakespeare Recording Society or the Theatre Recording Society, depending on the playwright. These performances included many famous actors and actresses, including Anthony Quayle, Claire Bloom, Richard Burton, Albert Finney, John Gielgud, Siobh√°n McKenna, Michael Redgrave, Vanessa Redgrave, Felix Aylmer, Paul Scofield, Alec McCowen, Donald Pleasence, Ralph Richardson, Max Adrian and Maggie Smith among others.

It was written by Franjo Markoviƒá and composed by Ivan Zajc in 1866, who later incorporated it as an aria into his opera Nikola ≈†ubiƒá Zrinski (1876) where it is sung by a male choir. It is a retelling of the Battle of Szigetv√°r of 1566, in which Nikola IV Zrinski, Ban of Croatia and captain of the assembled Croatian and Hungarian forces, took a heroic last stand against overwhelming Ottoman forces, led personally by Suleiman the Magnificent. Though the fortress fell, the defenders inflicted grievous injuries on the assaulting forces, all but crippling the victors' ability to progress past the Croatian-Hungarian border, and causing the death of the sultan himself. The choir version of the song enjoys a wide popularity in Japan where for a long time it was thought to be a Czech folk song. After the end of World War I, the American ship Heffron, evacuating Czech and Slovak soldiers from Siberia, among whom this Croat song was widely popular during the war, was damaged by a storm and was forced to settle in the Kobe harbour for 2 months for repair. During that period, the soldiers passed on the tune to the members of the oldest and the most renowned Japanese male choir of the Kwansei Gakuin University, established in 1899. Their repertoire hosts the song (which is learned not in Japanese, but in genuine Croatian) to this day, ending with it each of their public performances. (This source misspells the ship's name as Hefron.) Text U boj, u boj! Maƒç iz toka, braƒáo, nek du≈°man zna kako mremo mi!

The series combines elements of mystery and fantasy as it follows the adventures of private investigator Garrett. Plot introduction Garrett is a hardboiled detective living in the city of TunFaire, a melting pot of different races, cultures, religions, and species. When people have problems, they often come to Garrett for help, but trouble has a way of finding Garrett on its own, whether he likes it or not. Plot summary This ninth installment in the Garrett series sees Garrett visited at home by three lovely young ladies, Tinnie Tate, Giorgi Nicholas (Nicks), and Alyx Weider, daughter of Max Weider. Alyx explains that she has been sent by her father to get Garrett to investigate an apparent extortion attempt on the Weider business by The Call, a group of human rights activists headed by Marengo North English. Meanwhile, Colonel Block and Deal Relway strike a deal with Garrett: Garrett will attempt to infiltrate The Call, reporting back to Block and Relway on their activities, while Relway and Block will try to help solve the extortion attempt on the Weiders, as well as ensure the safety of the Weiders and Tates during the ordeal. In typical Garrett fashion, things start to get complicated when Garrett is attacked by a group of thugs while poking around the Weider brewery. After cleaning up and meeting with Max Weider, Max decides it may be best for Garrett to come to Ty Weider's and Giorgi Nicks' engagement party the following night. When Garrett returns home, the Dead Man concurs, pointing out that it will allow Garrett to investigate the motive of his assailants, as well as help him infiltrate the upper echelons of The Call's society. With Belinda Contague as his date for the evening, Garrett stumbles into a party that turns dark quickly. By the end of the evening, two of Max Weider's children have been murdered, Max Weider's wife has died, and multiple shapeshifters have been discovered, incapacitated, and arrested. To make matters worse, Belinda Contague gets kidnapped by Crask and Sadler as the evening is winding down. Garrett quickly hightails it to the Palms, where he has Morley hire an expert tracker, a ratgirl by the name of Pular Singe. With Pular's help, Garrett and Morley track down Crask and Sadler, freeing Belinda and dealing the mafia skull-crackers a serious blow. When Garrett returns home, he's shocked by what he finds: Dean and the Dead Man are gone! The next day, with help from Colonel Block, Garrett tracks down and arrests Crask and Sadler, who are barely alive from their wounds. With this out of the way, Garrett starts his search for information on the shapeshifters, starting by visiting his friend at the Royal Library, Miss Linda Lee. After getting nowhere fast, Garrett heads back to the Weider's estate, where he and Colonel Block manage to sort out just how and why shapeshifters infiltrated the Weider household. With Tinnie Tate in tow, Garrett heads out to the estate of Marengo North English, where he continues his search for the shapeshifters. North English, who gets injured in a surprise attack against The Call, has little to offer, but Garrett and Tinnie still manage to uncover one shapeshifter in the midst. With the help of Morley, Belinda Contague, and Marengo North English, Garrett hatches a plan to reunite all the guilty parties back at the Weider manor in an all-inclusive finale. In the end, Garrett manages to solve the intertwining mysteries of the Weider murders, the shapeshifters, and The Call, and he even unearths an embezzlement scheme that has bankrupted North English and The Call. After a little more detective work, Garrett and company manage to ferret out the last remaining shapechanger in TunFaire, ending the string of murders and impersonations and bringing a small amount of peace to the city. The Dead Man, who returned home with Dean, actually helped mastermind the finale at the Weider's estate, where he had overseen the night's events from his hiding place in a large tank of beer.

Set in over of parkland, Verulamium Park was purchased from the Earl of Verulam in 1929 by the then City Corporation. Today the park is owned and operated by St Albans City and District Council. The park is named after the Roman city of Verulamium on which it stands. The city walls and outline of the main London Gate can still be seen. Archaeological excavations were undertaken in the park during the 1930s by Sir Mortimer Wheeler and his wife Tessa, during which the 1800-year-old hypocaust and its covering mosaic floor were discovered. The Hypocaust Mosaic is on view to the public and currently protected from the elements by a purpose-built building in the park. On the outskirts of the park is Verulamium Museum, which contains hundreds of archaeological objects relating to everyday Roman life in what was a major Roman city. A pub, Ye Olde Fighting Cocks, is also located on the edge of the park. This pub has been listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the oldest such establishment in England. A main feature of the park is the ornamental lake. Construction started on this project during 1929, giving much needed work to the unemployed of St Albans during the depression. The lake is fed by the River Ver. The lake is home to a wealth of waterbirds, including mallards, swans, Canada geese, herons, great crested grebes, coots, pochards and tufted ducks. In the southeastern part of the park, the Westminster Lodge Leisure Centre and Abbey View 9-hole golf course provide a number of sports facilities, including a pool, gym, tennis, fitness classes, running track and football pitch. The park also hosts St Albans parkrun, a free weekly timed 5k event every Saturday morning at 9am. The northeastern edge of the park abuts St Albans Cathedral and St Albans School, the northwestern edge abuts St Michael's Church, and the southeastern edge abuts St Columba's College. St Albans Abbey railway station is situated just to the east of the park. The park also hosts a small children's funfair which has been coming there for 46 years. That comes around Easter with the Sun and the summer holidays. It is situated near the hypocaust.

The series combines elements of mystery and fantasy as it follows the adventures of private investigator Garrett. Plot Garrett is a detective living in the city of TunFaire. When people have problems, they come to Garrett for help, but trouble has a way of finding him. Garrett is at home when Playmate visits, with a kid, Kip Prose. Kip has made friends with creatures that cannot quite be described, but because of his relationship with these creatures, other parties are trying to kidnap Kip. Despite his protests, Garrett gets drawn into the mess. While searching Playmate's stables for clues, Garrett and company are attacked by another group of indescribable assailants. Morley, Saucerhead, and Pular Singe wake Garrett and Playmate after the scuffle, but Kip Prose is gone. Playmate and Garrett talk to Kip's family, hoping to find clues to his whereabouts. Despite some leads, Playmate and Garrett are unable to locate Kip, although they do encounter an \\"elf\\" named Casey, who assures them Kip is in no immediate danger. When Playmate goes missing, Garrett and Pular Singe track him down, with the Roze triplets tagging along. Pular tracks the scent to Casey's apartment, where there are more mysterious elves. The trail eventually takes Garrett, Pular and the Rozes into the country outside TunFaire, where they find more of the elves, their spaceships, and an unconscious Playmate, Saucerhead Tharpe and Kip Prose. Garrett decides it is time to involve the Watch, who can hopefully clean up the mess. Meanwhile, a ratman named John Stretch, Pular Singe's brother, attempts to kidnap Pular for his own purposes. While Garrett and John Stretch come to an agreement, Colonel Block and Deal Relway try to manage the situation with the remaining elves. Garrett strikes a deal between Kip Prose, Max Weider, and Willard Tate, in which the involved parties agree to manufacture \\"Three Wheels\\", a revolutionary new method of transportation for the citizens of TunFaire.

The term comes from classical music and has only since the 1970s been applied to jazz (apparently first by Patrick in 1975‚Äîsee Further Reading below), where it is still not standard. In classical music, contrafacts have been used as early as the parody mass and In Nomine of the 16th century. More recently, Cheap Imitation (1969) by John Cage was produced by systematically changing notes from the melody line of Socrate by Erik Satie using chance procedures. In jazz, a contrafact is a musical composition consisting of a new melody overlaid on a familiar harmonic structure.. Contrafact can also be explained as the use of borrowed chord progressions.\\"The Uses of Existing Music: Musical Borrowing as a Field\\". J. Peter Burkholder. Notes, Second Series, Vol. 50, No. 3 (Mar., 1994), pp. 851-870. Published by: Music Library Association. As a compositional device, it was of particular importance in the 1940s development of bop, since it allowed jazz musicians to create new pieces for performance and recording on which they could immediately improvise, without having to seek permission or pay publisher fees for copyrighted materials (while melodies can be copyrighted, the underlying harmonic structure cannot be). Contrafacts are not to be confused with musical quotations, which comprise borrowing rhythms or melodic figures from an existing composition. In spite of its usefulness, the term \\"contrafact\\" has not won wide acceptance in Western classical theory.  Examples  Well-known examples of contrafacts include the Charlie Parker/Miles Davis bop tune \\"Donna Lee,\\" which uses the chord changes of the standard \\"Back Home Again in Indiana\\" or Thelonious Monk's jazz standardYanow, Scott (2008). [ \\"Thelonious Monk\\" biography], AllMusic. \\"Evidence\\", which borrows the chord progression from Jesse Greer and Raymond Klages's song \\"Just You, Just Me\\" (1929). Examples from the classical oeuvre include Sinfonia by Luciano Berio using samples from Mahler, George Crumb borrowing Chopin's nocturnes, or Matt A. Mason's \\"Heiligenstadt Echo\\" which takes from Beethoven's Sonata in Ab major, op. 110. The Gershwin tune \\"I Got Rhythm\\" has proved especially amenable to contrafactual recomposition: the popularity of its \\"rhythm changes\\" is second only to that of the 12-bar blues as a basic harmonic structure used by jazz composers.

In the film, three high school pupils decide to hire an adult bodyguard to protect them from two bullies who endlessly harass and abuse them before developing a friendly relationship with him. The film stars Owen Wilson as the eponymous role, alongside Nate Hartley, Troy Gentile, David Dorfman, Alex Frost, Josh Peck and Leslie Mann in supporting roles. Drillbit Taylor was released by Paramount Pictures on March 21, 2008. Upon release, the film received mixed reviews, with criticism directed mainly toward the screenwriting and the direction and the mean-spirited nature, but praised the humor, Wilson's performance and the chemistry between the cast. In addition to critical failure, the film was a box office bomb grossing $50 million against budget of $40 million. Plot On the first day of high school, freshmen Wade and Ryan witness two bullies, Filkins and Ronnie, attack a geek, Emmit, by stuffing him into his locker. Wade intervenes. Filkins and Ronnie begin endlessly targeting Wade, Ryan and Emmit. Emmit also befriends the duo, much to Ryan's dismay. Wade suggests hiring a bodyguard. They place an ad on the Internet, and after a series of disturbing interviews with ex-cons and hired guns, they end up selecting Drillbit Taylor (Owen Wilson). Drillbit pretends to be a martial arts expert and mercenary, but is really a homeless beggar. His real intention of becoming their bodyguard was to rob them and use the money to buy a ticket to Canada. Drillbit tells the boys to find some common interests and become friends with Filkins and Ronnie. Ryan challenges Filkins to a rap battle, but gets carried away and ends up humiliating Filkins. As an angry Filkins, alongside Ronnie, ambushes Wade, Ryan, and Emmit, the boys try using a tactic Drillbit taught them; it ultimately fails. The boys are furious with Drillbit's teachings. But they decide to bring him to school as a substitute teacher, and in that capacity he is able to protect them. While there, Drillbit meets a teacher, Lisa Zachey (Leslie Mann), and they start a sexual relationship. One morning as his mother is driving him to school, Ronnie sees Drillbit taking a shower at the beach; his mother reveals that he is homeless. Ronnie tells Filkins and Filkins finds the boys and punches Drillbit. Later on, at Wade's house, they catch Drillbit's homeless friends stealing everything in sight, leaving the house completely empty. Drillbit confesses that his real name is Bob and he went AWOL from the U.S. Army and his name was drillbit because he hurt his pinky in high school with a drillbit. The boys fire Drillbit, who later recovers all of Wade's possessions and places them back before Wade's parents return home. Unfortunately, the boys accidentally let slip about Drillbit. Their parents take things up with the principal, who contacts the police. Filkins plays innocent and charms all the adults; Filkins continues to ridicule the boys after Drillbit's disappearance. Tensions finally burst when Filkins interrupts Wade's attempt to ask his crush, Brooke Nguyen, out. Without realizing what he was doing, Wade challenges Filkins to a fight. After Ryan insults Emmit, he refuses to help them. Wade and Ryan arrive at Filkins' house, where he is hosting a party; initially the duo knock him down, but he soon overpowers them. Ronnie shows up to help Filkins against them. Emmit, who has a change of heart, comes to their aid and for a while causes quite a lot of pain to Filkins, and almost defeats him; but Ronnie knocks him out while he is trying to break Filkins' leg. Drillbit shows up and Filkins punches him. Drillbit refuses to fight back until it is revealed Filkins is not a minor (he's 18, therefore, he's not really emancipated). Upon learning this, Drillbit quickly begins fighting to defend the freshmen. He is about to attack Ronnie, but he is spared when he reveals he's only 17. Within minutes, the police arrive and Drillbit flees for fear of prosecution. Filkins then throws a samurai sword at the boys as retaliation, but Drillbit catches it. He saves them, at the cost of half of his pinkie finger in the process. Ronnie reveals to the police that Filkins had bullied him into being his accomplice when they interview him. Filkins is arrested and shipped off to Hong Kong to be with his parents as an alternative to being sent to prison for breaking several underage drinking laws. Wade, with renewed confidence, asks Brooke out and she accepts, while Ryan finally accepts Emmit, and declares him a friend. Drillbit is taken to jail, but ends up being released within three weeks. He is reunited with Lisa and the boys and is soon employed at their school as a nurse. A post-credits scene shows a student entering the nurse's office telling Drillbit he received bruises from being beaten up. Drillbit then tells him to give the name of the student, assuring he'll be safer from then on.

Instead, Paramount Pictures had Wilson record introductions for Fox's Sunday night primetime shows such as The Simpsons, American Dad!, King of the Hill, Family Guy, and Unhitched. The character of Drillbit was also featured as a \\"Superstar\\" on the RAW page of WWE.com for a period of time. Wilson's publicist said his availability was limited due to filming Marley & Me. John Horn and Gina Piccalo of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the reason for Wilson's limited promotional schedule was due to studio executives being worried that interviewers would bring up Wilson's hospitalization for severe depression in the summer of 2007. Reception =Box office= In its opening weekend, the film grossed $10.2 million in 3,056 theaters in the United States and Canada, ranking #4 at the box office. The film has grossed $32,862,104 in the United States and $16,828,521 in other countries adding to a total worldwide gross of $49,690,625. =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 25% based on reviews from 146 critics. The site's consensus states: \\"Owen Wilson's charms can't save Drillbit Taylor, an unfunny, overly familiar bullied-teen comedy.\\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 41 out of 100 based on reviews from 31 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B on scale of A to F. =Home media= The film was released on both rated (102 minutes) and unrated (109 minutes) DVD and Blu-ray on July 1, 2008.

He specialized in scenes from the medieval history of Moscow. Vasnetsov did not receive a formal artistic education. He studied under his older brother, Viktor Vasnetsov, the famous Russian painter. From 1883, he and his brother lived and worked in Abramtsevo where he fell under the influence of Vasily Polenov. In 1898‚Äì1899, he travelled across Europe. In addition to epic landscapes of Russian nature, Apollinary Vasnetsov created his own genre of historical landscape reconstruction on the basis of historical and archaeological data. His paintings present a visual picture of medieval Moscow. He was a member of the Association of Travelling Art Exhibitions (Peredvizhniki) from 1899, and an academician from 1900. He became one of the founders and supervisors of the Union of Russian Artists.  Early life  The future painter had three elder and two younger brothers. Their only sister died at the age of four months. Their father played an important role in the upbringing and education of his sons. He taught them to love nature and to become familiar with the life of birds and animals. The death of his father in 1870 was a terrible blow for Vasnetsov.  The Caucasus and the Urals  In 1890, he made a journey across the North of the Russian Empire. Beautiful views of Siberia and the Urals were captured by Apollinary Vasnetsov in a large number of his canvasses, including: * Forest on the Slopes of Mount Blagodat, Mid-Urals (1890) * Boreal forest in the Urals (1890) * Mountain lake in the Urals (1892) * The Steppes of Orenburg (1895) * \\"Koma\\" (1895) In 1895, Vasnetsov visited the Caucasus. He was deeply impressed by the beauty of the rugged Caucasus mountains. Whilst there, he climbed the glaciers of Mt. Elbrus, visited Tiflis and lived in the Darial Gorge. He created a great number of his sketches during this period, including: * View of Elbrus from Bermomut (1895) * Red Cliffs in Kislovodsk (1896) * Elbrus before Sunrise (1897) * Darial (1897) In 1890, he made a journey across Europe, visiting France and Italy, where he studied the works of famous masters. At the beginning of 1920, the Committee of Archaeology (the predecessor of the Community for the Saving of Art Monuments) invited Apollinary Vasnetsov and some other painters (including Vikentii Trofimov) to draw the old places of Voronezh. A minor planet, 3586 Vasnetsov, discovered by Soviet astronomer Lyudmila Zhuravlyova in 1978, is named after Viktor Vasnetsov and Apollinary Vasnetsov.

First World War The 70th Brigade was first raised in September 1914, shortly after the beginning of the First World War, as part of the 23rd Division. Consisting of men volunteering for Kitchener's Army, the brigade, after initially experiencing severe difficulties in training the men, due to a shortage of weapons and equipment, was sent to reinforce the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front in August 1915, later fighting, most notably, in the battles of the Somme, Messines and Passchendaele. The brigade remained there until late 1917 when it was sent to the Italian Front, remaining there until the end of the war. In June 1918 the brigade was awarded its only Victoria Cross (VC), belonging to Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Hudson of the Sherwood Foresters. =Order of battle= The 70th Brigade was constituted as follows during the war:http://www.1914-1918.net/23div.htm * 11th (Service) Battalion, Sherwood Foresters (until September 1918) * 8th (Service) Battalion, King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry * 8th (Service) Battalion, York and Lancaster Regiment * 9th (Service) Battalion, York and Lancaster Regiment * 1/8th Battalion, Middlesex Regiment (from October 1915 until February 1916) * 70th Machine Gun Company, Machine Gun Corps (formed July 1916, moved to 23rd Battalion, Machine Gun Corps 1 April 1918) * 70th Trench Mortar Battery (formed 18 June 1916) Second World War The brigade, disbanded in March 1919, was reformed in 1939 in the Territorial Army (or TA, the British Army's part-time reserve component) as the 70th Infantry Brigade just before the end of the interwar period, originally as part of the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division, when the TA was ordered to be doubled in size, due to the increasing likelihood of another war in Europe, most likely with Germany. The brigade was formed as a second-line duplicate of the 151st Infantry Brigade and was composed of the 10th, 11th and 12th Battalions of the Durham Light Infantry (DLI), containing many former members of those battalions. The brigade, commanded by Brigadier P. Kirkup, who had commanded the 8th Battalion, DLI during the Great War, was transferred to the 23rd (Northumbrian) Division, the second-line duplicate of the 50th Division, on 2 October 1939, just under a month after the start of the Second World War.Joslen, p. 301 The 23rd Division was commanded by Major-General William Herbert and the 70th Brigade, together with the 69th Infantry Brigade, constituted the division. The brigade, serving with the 23rd Division in Northern Command, was, despite being very poorly trained and equipped, ordered to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), then serving on the border between France and Belgium, as lines of communication (LoC) troops under GHQ BEF. The brigade (now with the 1st Battalion, Tyneside Scottish in place of the 12th DLI, which was redesignated on 1 January 1940) arrived in France on 25 April 1940. Together with the rest of the BEF, the brigade was, under a month after its arrival in France, involved in the Battle of France in May 1940 and the retreat to Dunkirk from where it took part in the Dunkirk evacuation. After escaping from Dunkirk, the brigade, which had sustained some of the highest losses in the BEF (with each battalion totalling roughly 200 men), was serving in South East England under Southern Command, when the 23rd Division was disbanded in late June 1940 due to the heavy casualties it had suffered, with the 70th Brigade becoming an independent formation, with the title of 70th Independent Infantry Brigade, on 27 June 1940 and the 187th Field Ambulance, Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) under command. The brigade, reformed as a standard infantry brigade on 16 September, was sent to Iceland in October 1940 on garrison duties. The brigade remained there before being sent, in December 1941, to Scotland shortly after the United States entered the war. After serving in South Wales District and Western Command, the 70th Brigade was, on 18 May 1942, assigned to the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division. The 49th Division, another TA formation, and composed of the 146th and 147th Infantry Brigades and supporting divisional troops, had also been serving in Iceland, where they gained the nickname of \\"The Polar Bears\\". The division's General Officer Commanding (GOC) was Major- General Henry Curtis, but on 30 April 1943 he was replaced by Major-General Evelyn Barker, a distinguished veteran of the Great War.Delaforce, pp. 22‚Äì‚Äì23 Loyd carrier and 6-pounder anti-tank gun of the 11th Battalion, DLI parked alongside a knocked-out German Panther tank during Operation 'Epsom', 27 June 1944. The brigade, now commanded by Brigadier Percy Paulet King, together with the rest of the 49th Division, spent the remaining two years in the United Kingdom, training for offensive action. In January 1944 Brigadier E. C. Cooke-Collis, who had commanded the 69th Brigade (which, along with the 70th, had constituted the old 23rd Division and upon the 23rd's disbandment was sent to the 50th Division) previously, took command. The brigade landed in Normandy on 14 June, eight days after D-Day on 6 June, as part of Battle of Normandy (codenamed Operation Overlord) six days later. During Operation Martlet, the preparatory attack for Operation Epsom that took place on 25 June 1944, the brigade was heavily engaged around the village of Rauray with elements from the 12th SS Panzer and 26th SS Panzer Grenadier Regiments of the 12th SS Panzer Division. The 70th Brigade then fought a bloody battle around Rauray as Kampfgruppe Weidinger of 2nd SS Panzer Division counterattacked between 29 June and 1 July.Baverstock, pp. 47‚Äì152 For this it was given the battle honour of 'The Odon' Thereafter it fought south of Tilly-sur-Seulles, before following the 49th Division's initial drive during I Corps' drive to the River Seine in late August. On 19 August, however, the brigade was withdrawn from the front line and the following day all officers and warrant officers in the brigade was informed personally by Major-General \\"Bubbles\\" Barker, the division's GOC, that the 70th Brigade was to be disbanded to fill the increasing gap in available infantry replacements. General Sir Bernard Montgomery, commanding the 21st Army Group, arrived the day after, saying much the same.Delaforce, pp. 132‚Äì133 At this stage of the war, the British Army was suffering from a severe lack of available manpower, having used up nearly all of its manpower reserves.Baverstock, pp. 162‚Äì177 Most of the men were posted to battalions of the 50th (Northumbrian) and the 51st (Highland) Infantry Divisions. By 19 October 1944, the brigade officially ceased to exist. Its place in the 49th Division was taken by the 56th Infantry Brigade, previously an independent formation. =Order of battle= The 70th Infantry Brigade was constituted as follows during the war: * 10th Battalion, Durham Light Infantry * 11th Battalion, Durham Light Infantry * 12th Battalion, Durham Light Infantry (until 31 December 1939) * 1st Battalion, Tyneside Scottish, Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment)) (from 1 January 1940)'' During the period 27 June to 17 October 1940 the following additional unit was under command: * 187th Field Ambulance, Royal Army Medical Corps =Commanders= The following officers commanded the 70th Brigade during the war: * Brigadier P.

The series combines elements of mystery and fantasy as it follows the adventures of private investigator Garrett. Plot introduction Garrett is a hardboiled detective living in the city of TunFaire, a melting pot of different races, cultures, religions, and species. When people have problems, they often come to Garrett for help, but trouble has a way of finding Garrett on its own, whether he likes it or not. Plot summary Things seemed to be going pretty well for Garrett one morning until he finds a strange kid named Penny Dreadful hanging around his house, gets summoned to a meeting by Harvester Temisk, Chodo Contague's lawyer, and nearly has his door knocked down by an ugly thug wearing green plaid pants. Garrett meets with Temisk, who fears there are unnatural events occurring associated with Chodo Contague, who may not be as paralyzed as he appears. Garrett agrees to look into the matter that evening, at a birthday party being held by Belinda Contague for her father. At the party, when Chodo is introduced to the guests, a number of people mysteriously burst into flames, and in the confusion that follows, Belinda and Chodo somehow get separated. The whole mess seems to have some connection with the Ugly Pants Gang, who continues to harass Garrett at his home and on the streets. In addition, Garrett is getting more attention than he likes from subordinate underworld bosses who suspect that Garrett knows where Chodo Contague is hiding. Garrett can only escape the warring mafia factions for so long, and eventually he is captured, poisoned, and blackmailed by one aspiring leader named Teacher White. With the help of his friends and the psychic powers of the Dead Man, Garrett survives the worst of the ordeal. While he rests and recuperates at home, the Dead Man organizes efforts geared towards unraveling the mysteries of the Green Pants Gang, the criminal factions, and the spontaneous combustions. Compiling the efforts of Garrett's many friends, the Dead Man deduces that the Green Pants Gang is actually a religious faction from outside of TunFaire, and Chodo Contague had at one point worked with the gang to help him rise to the top of the Outfit. With some clues from the Dead Man, Garrett, Morley, and company track down and capture Harvester Temisk, who had been hiding out with Chodo Contague. More clever deductive reasoning by the Dead Man reveals a few final plot twists: Penny Dreadful is in fact Chodo Contague's daughter, Chodo was partially responsible for the previously unexplainable spontaneous combustions, and the Green Pants Gang actually knows the secret to drawing dark emotions out from within the body. With the help of Garrett and the Dead Man, Chodo's condition improves, so that he is no longer completely physically and mentally impaired. As a finale, Morley Dotes drops by Garrett's house, with none other than Mr. Big, Garrett's much-despised parrot which had gone missing for some time, perched on his shoulder.

It was founded by Nathaniel John Holmes, a telegraph engineer from Middlesex; and it passed to his son Joseph R. Holmes. The company was taken over by Albright and Wilson in 1919. Holmes' patents In 1875 Holmes obtained a British Patent for a marine audible alarm signal (B.P. 2564 of 1875); and in 1877 he bought, for ¬£80 Pound Sterling, a half-share of John Grey's Patent (B.P. 2564 of 1868) for Improvements in fog alarms. In 1876 he obtained, with J.H. Player as co-applicant, a provisional application for Improvements in self-igniting and inextinguishable signal lights for marine and other purposes; it became British Patent 4215 of 1876. Further patents were taken out by Holmes in 1885 and 1887; and his company up to 1906. Marine markers and signals In July 1873 he demonstrated his Patent Signal Light to the Liverpool shipping company P and W Maclellan and was awarded a Certificate of Merit. It was based on the use of Calcium phosphide; which they initially made themselves at Feltham, Middlesex, before moving to Barking. Up to the end of World War I the Holmes' Marine Life Protection Association sold lifebuoy lights and distress lights; and sales increased dramatically during the war.Lifebuoy. Photo: Georges Jansoone The provision of Lifebuoy lights was mandatory for British seagoing vessels under Board of Trade Regulations. Holmes' lights were sold under various Trade names: The Handyman's Light for lifebuoys; the Manwell-Holmes Marine Light distress light for merchant vessels; and a modified Handyman Light for lifebuoys for the Admiralty. They also produced a distress signal, the Deck Flare. They were all charged with calcium carbide, it produced acetylene gas when water was dripped onto it. They also included a small quantity of calcium phosphide, which in contact with water produced impure phosphine, it spontaneously ignited, thereby igniting the acetylene. The Handyman lifebuoy light had a buoyancy chamber filled with air to keep it afloat. It was attached to the lifebuoy with a long cord, and to the boat with a shorter cord. When the lifebuoy was thrown overboard, the short cord pulled away two plugs, one to let sea water in and one to let gas out. For the mast- head distress signal light and the Deck Flare the two plugs were removed by hand and the units placed in a bucket of water. Expansion under Albright and Wilson Albright and Wilson bought the company after the end of World War I, they had large stocks of produced and sales had dropped substantially.

They live on the Yurok Indian Reservation and the surrounding communities in Humboldt, Del Norte and Trinity counties in Northern California. Traditional territory of the Yurok They called themselves 'O'loolekweesh 'o'l / 'Oolekwoh (lit. \\"'o'loolekw (= \\"village\\") dwellers\\"); the Yurok distinguished between two geographical groups, the Ner'ernerh / Nert'ernerh (\\"Coast Yurok\\") and Hehlkeeklaa (\\"Klamath River people, i.e. Klamath River Yurok\\"); to distinguish themselves from the upriver (Klamath River) living Karuk (Pecheeklaa / Pecheekla' = \\"up river/upstream people, i.e. Karuk people\\") they called themselves also Pueleeklaa / Pueleekla' (\\"down river/downstream people, i.e. River Yurok\\")Yurok Language Project - Yurok dictionary. History 19th century Yurok spoons Traditionally, the Yurok lived in permanent villages along the Klamath River. Therefore they were also called by neighboring Athabascan-speaking tribes as Taa-che'-dvn-dv-ne (Upper Coquille-Tututni) (\\"Klamath River mouth People\\") or Dvn-mvsh-taa-'vn'-dv-ne (Euchre Creek Tututni) and Dvtlh-mvsh Xee-she'n (Chetco-Tolowa), both meaning \\"Klamath River People\\". Some of the villages date back to the 14th century.Pritzker 159 They fished for salmon along rivers, gathered ocean fish and shellfish, hunted game, and gathered plants. Yurok ate varied berries and meats, but whale meat was prized above others. Yuroks did not hunt whales, instead, they waited until a drift whale washed up onto the beach or place near the water and dried the flesh. Salmon is another vital source of food. The major currency of the Yurok nations was the dentalium shell (terkwterm). Alfred L. Kroeber wrote of the Yurok perception of the shell: \\"Since the direction of these sources is 'downstream' to them, they speak in their traditions of the shells living at the downstream and upstream ends of the world, where strange but enviable peoples live who suck the flesh of univalves.\\"Kroeber, Alfred L.. [catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/002494436 Handbook of the Indians of California.] Washington D.C.: Government Printing Office. 1925, pp. 22-23. The Yurok's first contact with non-Natives occurred when Spanish explorers entered their territory in 1775. Fur traders and trappers from the Hudson's Bay Company came in 1827. Following encounters with white settlers moving into their aboriginal lands during a gold rush in 1850, the Yurok were faced with disease and massacres that reduced their population by 75%. In 1855, following the Klamath and Salmon River War, the Lower Klamath River Indian Reservation was created by executive order. The Reservation boundaries included a portion of the Yurok's aboriginal territory and most of the Yurok villages. As a result, the Yurok people were not forcibly removed from their traditional homelands. = Villages = Yurok Villages ('o'loolekw - \\"village\\") were composed of individual families that lived in separate, single-family homes. The house was owned by the eldest male and in each lived several generations of men related on their father's side of the family as well as their wives, children, daughters‚Äô husbands, unmarried relatives, and adopted kin. Yurok villages also consisted of sweat houses and menstrual huts. Sweat houses were designated for men of an extended patrilineal family as a place to gather. While during their menstruation cycles, women stayed in separate under-ground huts for ten days. Additionally, inheritance of land was predominantly patrilineal. The majority of the estate was passed down to the fathers‚Äô sons. Daughters and male relatives were also expected to acquire a portion of the estate. = Social Organization = Yurok society was socially stratified, so that communities were divided between the aristocrats (syahhlew - \\"rich\\"), commoners (wa's'oyowok' / wa'soyowok' = \\"poor\\"), and slaves (ka'aal). The aristocrats were the only group allowed to perform religious duties. Furthermore, they had homes at higher elevations, wore nicer clothing, and spoke in a distinctive manner. The primary reason men became slaves was because they owed money to certain families. Nonetheless, slavery was not considered to be a significant institution. Overall, the higher a man's social ranking was, the more valuable his life was considered.  Marriage  When daughters got married, Yurok families would receive a payment from her husband. For the most part, girls were highly valued in the family. The amount of money paid by a man determined the social status of the couple. A wealthy man, who could afford to pay a large sum, increased the couple and their children's rank within the community. When married, both spouses held onto their personal properties but the bride lived with the groom's family and took his last name. Men who were unable to pay the full sum of money could pay half the cost for the bride. In doing so, the couple was considered ‚Äúhalf-married.‚Äù Half-married couples lived with the bride's family and the groom would then become a slave for them. Furthermore, their children would take on the mother's last name. In cases of divorce, either spouse could initiate their split. The most frequent reason for divorce was if the wife was infertile. If the woman wanted a divorce and to take the children with her, her family had to refund the husband for his initial payment. Demographics Estimates for the pre-contact populations of most native groups in California have varied substantially. Alfred L. Kroeber put the 1770 population of the Yurok at 2500.Kroeber 1925:883 Sherburne F. Cook initially agreed,Cook 1976:165 but later raised this estimate to 3100.Cook 1956:84 By 1870, the Yurok population had declined to 1350.Cook 1976:237 By 1910 it was reported as 668 or 700.Cook 1976:237; Kroeber 1925:883 The United States Census for the year 2000 indicates that there were 4413 Yurok living in California, combining those of one tribal descent and those with ancestors of several different tribes and groups. There were 5,793 Yurok living throughout the United States. The Yurok Indian Reservation is California's largest tribe, with 6357 members as of 2019. On November 24, 1993, the Yurok Tribe adopted a constitution that details the jurisdiction and territory of their lands. Under the Hoopa-Yurok Settlement Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100-580, qualified applicants had the option of enrolling in the Yurok Tribe. Of the 3,685 qualified applicants for the Settlement Roll, 2,955 people chose Yurok membership. 227 of those members had a mailing address on the Yurok reservation, but a majority lived within 50 miles of the reservation. The Yurok Tribe is currently the largest group of Native Americans in the state of California, with 6357 enrolled members living in or around the reservation. The Yurok reservation of 63,035 acres (25,509 ha) has an 80% poverty rate and 70% of the inhabitants do not have telephone service or electricity, according to the tribe's Web page. Language Yurok basketweaver Yurok or Saa'agoch (\\"Yurok language\\") is one of two Algic languages spoken in California, the other being Wiyot. Between twenty and one hundred people speak the Yurok language today.Hinton 32 The language is passed on through master-apprentice teams and through singing.Hinton 33 Language classes have been offered through Humboldt State University and through annual language immersion camps.\\"Yurok Language Project.\\" University of California, Berkeley, Department of Linguistics. 2011 (retrieved 1 Feb 2011) An unusual feature of the language is that certain nouns change depending upon whether there is one, two, or three of the object. For instance, one human being would be ko:ra' or ko'r, two human beings would be ni'iyel, and three human beings would be nahkseyt.Hinton 120  Contemporary  Fishing, hunting, and gathering remain important to tribal members. Basket weaving and woodcarving are important arts. A traditional hamlet of wooden plank buildings, called Sumeg, was built in 1990. The Jump Dance and Brush Dance are part of tribal ceremonies.Pritzker 161 The tribe owns and operates a casino, river jet boat tours and other tourist attractions. =Repatriation efforts= In 2010, 217 sacred artifacts were returned to the Yurok tribe by the Smithsonian Institution. The condor feathers, headdresses and deerskins had been part of the Smithonian's collection for almost 100 years and represent one of the largest Native American repatriations. The regalia will be used in Yurok ceremonies and on display at the tribe's cultural center.

It was released on VHS on November 11, 1997, by Interscope Records, and consists of a filmed concert at The Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim in Anaheim, California, on May 31, and June 1, 1997, as part of the Tragic Kingdom World Tour. It was later released on DVD on November 25, 2003, as part of No Doubt's box set album Boom Box, and as a stand-alone DVD on June 13, 2006. A LaserDisc version was also released in Hong Kong. Background No Doubt released their eponymous debut studio album in 1992, one year after being signed to Interscope Records. The album was commercially unsuccessful, selling 30,000 copies. Interscope did not trust that the band would fund a second album, and paired them with producer Matthew Wilder. Keyboardist Eric Stefani was distressed by the band's lack of success, and the fact that he had to give up creative control to someone outside the band; he soon left the band in late 1994 to pursue an animation career on the animated sitcom The Simpsons. No Doubt released and recorded their second studio album, The Beacon Street Collection, independently. Despite its limited availability, it sold over 100,000 copies within a year of its release, and convinced Interscope that they would fund a successful third album. No Doubt's third studio album, Tragic Kingdom, was released on October 10, 1995, and spawned seven singles, including \\"Just a Girl\\", \\"Spiderwebs\\", \\"Excuse Me Mr.\\", \\"Sunday Morning\\", and \\"Don't Speak\\", the latter of which reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay for 16 weeks, a record at the time which was later broken by the Goo Goo Dolls' \\"Iris\\". The album sold 16 million copies worldwide. Because of the success of Tragic Kingdom, No Doubt decided to embark on a tour in support of the album. Tour No Doubt embarked on the Tragic Kingdom World Tour, beginning in 1997, two years after the release of Tragic Kingdom. They expected to tour for two months, but the tour ended up lasting two and a half years. The band chose Project X, headed by Luc Lafortune and Michael Keeling, to design the stage for the series of concerts. The band suggested decorating the stage like a clearing in a forest. Project X created three anthropomorphic trees with glowing oranges, as a reference to the music video of \\"Don't Speak\\". The show included clear and mylar confetti designed to look like rain. Lighting design was difficult because there were only four rehearsals, so the show was arranged to be flexible to allow for what Lafortune referred to as \\"a very kinetic performance.\\" Bonus material Several \\"extras\\" and easter eggs were included on the 2006 DVD release of Live in the Tragic Kingdom, including a three-song video clip of a concert in The Hague, the Netherlands, during the Tragic Kingdom World Tour, an alternative version of \\"Don't Speak\\", a photo gallery, and trailers for No Doubt's two previous DVD releases, The Videos 1992‚Äì2003 and Rock Steady Live. Critical reception Because Live in the Tragic Kingdom was not one of No Doubt's studio albums, it lacked much attention from critics. However, Tracie Cooper of AllMovie enjoyed the mix of songs between fan favorites, lesser-known songs, and covers. A Rotten Tomatoes review noted lead singer Gwen Stefani's \\"danc[ing], bounc[ing], and sing[ing] ... to the infectious pop-punk-ska of her bandmates\\" and said \\"it's impossible not to feel like dancing (or smiling, at least).\\" Track listing Charts { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" Chart (1997) ! scope=\\"col\\" Peak position - ! scope=\\"row\\" US Top Music Videos (Billboard)  5 } References External links * Official No Doubt website * Category:1997 live albums Category:1997 video albums Category:Interscope Records live albums Category:Interscope Records video albums Category:Live video albums Category:No Doubt video albums ","title":"Live in the Tragic Kingdom"},{"id":"5640509","text":"The Con is a 1998 television movie starring William H.

VAK was the abbreviation for Vertikalstartendes Aufkl√§rungs- und Kampfflugzeug (Vertical Take-off Reconnaissance and Strike Aircraft). Designed and built by the Vereinigte Flugtechnische Werke (VFW), it was developed with the purpose of eventually serving as a replacement for the Italian Fiat G.91 then in service with the German Air Force. Operationally, it was intended to have been armed with nuclear weapons as a deterrent against aggression from the Soviet Union and, in the event of a major war breaking out, to survive the first wave of attacks by deploying to dispersed locations, rather than conventional airfields, and to retaliate against targets behind enemy lines. The VAK 191B suffered from a protracted development cycle, spanning ten years between inception and flight, in part due to changing requirements, partnerships changing, and the difficulty inherently associated in the development of VTOL-capable aircraft. Ultimately, during the late 1960s, VFW took the decision to demote the development programme from targeting the type's production and instead only to test-fly a limited number of prototypes, using the VAK 191B effectively as a technology demonstrator and experimental aircraft to support the company's other activities and future programmes. On 10 September 1971, the first prototype conducted the type's maiden flight. A total of 91 flights were performed prior to the retirement of all three prototypes in 1975. These aircraft have been preserved and two are now on public display in museums. Design and development =Background= During the 1950s, rapid advances in the field of jet propulsion, particularly in terms of increased thrust and compact engine units, had contributed to an increased belief in the technical viability of vertical takeoff/landing (VTOL) aircraft, particularly within Western Europe and the United States.Hirschel, Prem and Madelung 2012, p. 451. During 1950s and 1960s, multiple programmes in Britain, France, and the United States were initiated; likewise, aviation companies inside West Germany were keen not to be left out of this emerging technology. Shortly after 1957, the year in which the post-Second World War ban upon West Germany operating and developing combat aircraft was lifted, German aviation firms Dornier Flugzeugwerke, Heinkel, and Messerschmitt, having also been allowed to resume their own activities that same year, received an official request from the German Federal Government that urged them to perform investigative work on the topic of VTOL aircraft and to produce concept designs.Hirschel, Prem and Madelung 2012, pp. 451‚Äì452. As such, multiple companies commenced work on their own conceptual designs for VTOL-capable interceptor aircraft; in order for these designs to be operationally relevant and viable, it was recognised that it would be necessary for the flight performance to equal that of conventional interceptors of the era, such as the contemporary Lockheed F-104G Starfighter.Hirschel, Prem and Madelung 2012, p. 452. Over time, two separate and distinct requirements emerged, one calling for a VTOL-capable successor to the F-104G interceptor while the other sought a VTOL successor to the Italian Fiat G.91 ground-attack fighter. According to aerospace publication Flight International, this call for a Fiat G.91 replacement, which came under a NATO requirement, known as NBMR-3, was a crucial trigger and greatly influenced the development programme that would lead to the VAK 191B.Flight International 1972, p. 502. In conjunction with these requirements being on offer, Germany's Federal Ministry of Defence (BMVg) championed for the merger of the competing companies; it deliberately withheld the issuing of a development contract in order to incentivise companies to undertake such activities.Hirschel, Prem and Madelung 2012, pp. 583‚Äì584. As such, during September 1961, a new German aircraft company, known as Vereinigte Flugtechnische Werke (VFW), was formed as joint venture between Focke-Wulf and Weser-Flugzeugbau, to develop its own VTOL strike aircraft.Flight International 1972, pp. 502, 504. Initially, Italian aircraft manufacturer Fiat was also a participating company in VFW, however, Italy later chose to withdraw from the joint development agreement with Germany during 1967. Despite this decision, Fiat remained as a major sub- contractor for the venture, being responsible for the production of various structural elements such as wings, tailplanes and some of the fuselage. =Concept and definition= Rotating nozzle detail The VAK 191B was similar in concept to the British Harrier Jump Jet, but was designed for a supersonic dash capability (Mach number 1.2‚Äì1.4) at medium to high altitudes. It was judged that having a single engine would create too much drag, but the two lift engines were dead weight in cruise, and the small cruise engine gave a poor thrust to weight ratio. The VAK 191B had been provided with relatively small and highly loaded wings. By contrast, the Harrier possessed a significantly higher thrust-to-weight ratio, it was effective as a dogfighter, and had larger wings which were put to good use when performing rolling short takeoffs. The choice of lift/propulsion system was an obvious critical element of the aircraft's design. According to Flight International, there were several options available in the field of vectored thrust propulsion during its development, these being the twin-nozzle Rolls-Royce/MAN Turbo RB153 and the four-nozzle Bristol Siddeley BS.94 engines.Flight International 1972, pp. 502‚Äì503. Ultimately, VFW's design team decided to adopt the Rolls-Royce/MAN Turbo RB.193-12 engine to provide both lift and cruise, which was augmented by a pair of Rolls-Royce vertical lift engines. In practice, this arrangement meant during vertical hover, all of the lifting thrust could either be generated by the propulsion engine, or entirely produced by the two lift engines, or some combination thereof; analysis determined that the optimum thrust-generation configuration would be a 50‚Äì50 split between both engine types.Flight International 1972, p. 503. During mid-1963, the in-development aircraft received its design designation of VAK 191B. Reportedly, the initials in this designation stood for Vertikalstartendes Aufkl√§rungs-und Kampfflugzeug (in English: vertical take-off reconnaissance and fighter aircraft), the numbers were to indicate its role as a successor to the Fiat G.91, while the B suffix was to show that the aircraft was the second of the four designs to be studied for this purpose. The rate of progress on the programme was noticeably slow; ten years passed between its inception and the first prototype performing its maiden flight on 10 September 1971. The slow progression can be viewed as a natural result of specification changes, such as a revised operational requirement that called for the aircraft to possess greater manoeuvrability issued during 1965. =Scaling-back and termination= Even prior to the first flight of the type, the programme had been heavily affected by political changes. Amongst these were the effective irrelevance of the original NBRM-3 requirement and the decreasing importance of the strike mission as a result of a German government decision to abandon the nuclear role, a divergence of opinion between partner countries, the withdrawal of the Italian government from participation during August 1967, and a growing awareness of the programme's escalating costs. At one stage, the Italian government had agreed to take on 40 per cent of the programme's development costs, thus their departure meant that a substantial amount of funding was lost for the venture. The emergence of a new German/American \\"Advanced Vertical Strike\\" (AVS) programme also played a role in diminishing the type's perceived value; the prospective aircraft which was on offer from the Americans via a cooperative venture with Germany had somewhat eclipsed the VAK 191B in the eyes of the German Air Force and served to effectively undermine support for the programme. Finally, during 1968, officials at VFW decided that the VAK 191B should be reclassified as an experimental programme, and that the resultant aircraft should principally function only as technology demonstrators instead. The initial programme had called for the construction of three single-seater and three two-seater aircraft; however, amid escalating costs, this intended test batch was first converted to become six single-seat aircraft, and was later on cut down to only involve three single-seat aircraft following Italy's withdrawal.Flight International 1972, p. 504. During April 1969, the first prototype was rolled out at VFW's facility in Bremen, and was later displayed at that year's Hanover Air Show. Over the course of the following 17 months, it went through a flight-qualification programme, during which some issues were discovered, most of these associated with the hydraulic system. During February 1971, trials commenced using the cruise engine for the first time. The first hovering flight performed by the VAK 191B was conducted at Bremen on 20 September 1971. A total of three VAK 191B aircraft were flown in the flight test program, which was conducted between 1970 and 1975, during which a total of 91 flights were performed. The first transition from vertical flight to horizontal and vice versa was achieved on 26 October 1972 in Munich.

Background Dr. Ley attended Harvard College from 1941-1943, and returned there after World War II, where he received his M.D. degree, cum laude, in 1946. In 1951, he earned a Master of Public Health degree from the Harvard School of Public Health. From 1951 until 1958, he worked with the Army Medical Service Graduate School in rickettsial disease research, the Office of the Surgeon General, and as an epidemiologist in Korea and Vietnam. In 1958, he accepted a position as Professor of Bacteriology and Chairman of the Department of Bacteriology, Hygiene, and Preventive Medicine at George Washington University. In 1963, he was appointed Associate Professor of Epidemiology and Microbiology at the Harvard School of Public Health, and became chairman of the Department in 1964. FDA In September 1966, Ley took a leave of absence from his position to become director of the Bureau of Medicine of the Food and Drug Administration and on July 1, 1968, he was appointed Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration by President Lyndon B. Johnson.About FDA/Commissioner's Page (Page Last Updated: 06/04/2009) Herbert Ley Jr., M.D. 7/1/1968 - 12/12/1969 Biography. Food and Drug Administration Retrieved August 25, 2013.(June 07, 1968).

Ley served as FDA commissioner for only a year and a half; he was ousted in December 1969. His three years at the FDA came during the time when the FDA grew from an insignificant agency to the key agency protecting consumers; during that time 300 drugs were removed from the market. After he left, Ley stated that he had \\"constant, tremendous, sometimes unmerciful pressure\\" from the drug industry and that the drug company lobbyists, combined with the politicians who worked on behalf of their patrons, could bring ‚Äútremendous pressure‚Äù to bear on him and his staff, to try preventing FDA restrictions on their drugs. Ley complained that his agency faced budget shortfalls and lacked support from the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare and Congress; Ley was on the master list of Nixon political opponents. An example of the clashes the FDA had with pressure groups, involved the drug company Upjohn and their patented drug Panalba. Panalba was a combination of tetracycline, an inexpensive and effective generic drug, with novobiocin, a more toxic antibacterial with a different spectrum of activity. Although Upjohn had been marketing the drug for 7 years, they had not done any of the required studies on the efficacy of it and so the FDA under Ley moved to decertify it. Ley met tremendous opposition from Upjohn. The highest profile issue that Ley had to confront was sodium cyclamate. An artificial sweetener, it was originally brought to market as a flavoring ingredient in drugs, but in 1958, it was designated GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) and its uses expanded, first into table sugars, then into many foods. By 1969 there were $1 billion in annual sales of cyclamate. However, by that time some animal studies had shown that very high doses of cyclamates, at levels of humans ingesting 350 cans of diet soda per day, led to higher rates of bladder cancer in rats. Amidst the growth of the environmental movement and its concern with chemicals, pressure mounted on the government to restrict the use of cyclamate. In October 1969, Department of Health, Education & Welfare Secretary Robert Finch bypassed Ley and the FDA, and removed the GRAS designation from cyclamate, banning its use in general purpose foods but keeping it available for restricted use in dietary products with additional labeling. In October 1970, a year after Ley left, the FDA banned cyclamate completely from all food and drug products in the United States. Dr. Ley was ousted from his Commissioner post on December 12, 1969, and was replaced by Charles C. Edwards.(December 12, 1969). DR. LEY LEAVING U.S. SERVICE TODAY; Ousted F.D.A.

The story is about a reporter sent to the fictional African state of Ishmaelia by accident. Plot In a case of mistaken identity, a naive young columnist for The Daily Beast is sent to cover a war in Ishmaelia. A confused editor, Mr. Salter (Denholm Elliott), acting on the orders of his much feared 'boss', Lord Copper (Donald Pleasence), tells William Boot (Michael Maloney) to cover the ongoing war as the correspondent for the Beast. Boot normally writes about British country life, but is too timid, and worried about losing his job for good, to say otherwise when he is ordered overseas. Boot is soon up to his neck in intrigue. All the foreign journalists are confined to the capital of Ishmaelia, and they are not allowed to leave unless permission has been given by the Minister of Propaganda. The journalists stick together, drinking and trying to pass time, but they watch each other jealously for signs that someone may have a story to send home. However, Lord Hitchcock, the correspondent for the Daily Brute, is noticeably absent, and this sends the reporters on an insane quest into the desert in the hope of finding the sought-after 'scoop'. The story is full of bizarre characters: an insane Swedish diplomat who goes berserk when he drinks too much absinthe, the mysterious Mr. Baldwin (Herbert Lom), and a German woman who claims she somehow or other lost her husband. The hapless William Boot appears to be completely out of his depth in the middle of all this chaos and confusion.

The book was released on May 8, 2007.  Summary  =Journal #28= Bobby and Courtney arrive on Third Earth only to find that it has changed quite noticeably. Patrick, the local Traveler, arrives and takes them to the library to find out about their friend Mark, whom they believe is on First Earth. Startlingly, information pertaining to Mark originates from both First Earth and Second Earth. Both sources tell of him disappearing. In the flume, on First Earth November 1, 1937, Courtney and Bobby run into a dado (a type of android) in ragged clothing. Bobby tells Courtney to escape while he fights it off. Soon the dado backs into the tunnel and into an oncoming train. The dado is torn in half. Bobby takes the pieces to the flume and sends it back to Quillan. Then Bobby goes to First Earth to find Mark but he knows that Ibara needs him so he goes there and leaves Courtney behind. =Ibara= Bobby is in Ibara, the next territory he must save from Saint Dane's plans. Though the people there live simply, by growing or fishing for their food and living in grass huts, there are signs of advanced civilization, including artificial lights and other technological advances. No one, whether out of ignorance or desire to conceal, can explain these anachronisms. Bobby meets the Jakills, a group of teens outside of the main social group, who are determined to discover the truth of Ibara's unusual character. Leading them is Siry, Remudi's son. Bobby agrees to join the Jakills after proving his skills against a group of Flighters (humanoids that attack Ibara relentlessly). Together the Jakills and Bobby steal a ship and set off to find the truth. They eventually land in a city known as Rubity, a city far away from Rayne. Bobby, Siry, and a few of the Jakills explore Rubity. After a while, Bobby discovers that Ibara is a manifest future version of Veelox/an island on the territory Veelox and that Rubity is Rubic City, 300 years after Bobby failed to stop Saint Dane from causing chaos there. The Flighters attack them as they find this out, however, and only Bobby and Siry make it back to the ship, which they find is burning. They believe that most of the Jakills are killed, apparently leaving only Bobby and Siry alive. They escape from the enraged Flighters, only to meet Saint Dane in the now abandoned Lifelight pyramid. Aja Killian's journal is interrupted by Saint Dane. Bobby then finds out that the Jakills' name comes from Aja Killian [aJAKILLian] and that Flighters were the people who didn't leave Lifelight [liFeLIGHTERS]. Saint Dane reveals that he is bringing an army of tens of thousands of dados to Ibara to make Veelox's second turning point a disaster. Bobby and Siry barely escape on Skimmers, which are high speed boats from Cloral, brought by Saint Dane. The two of them get back to Ibara and tell the ruling Tribunal what has happened. The Tribunal then reveals that the ship that the Jakills stole was one of ten ships that they were going to use to repopulate Veelox. After sending them out early, the ships are destroyed by Flighters, and the threat of the impending army looms on the horizon. Bobby and Siry travel to Veelox to obtain maps of Ibara from Aja Killian. They then go to Zadaa to borrow a dygo, then to Denduron in order to unearth the explosive tak. When they leave, the Traveler Alder goes with them. Bobby then goes to Quillan alone in order to get the black dado-killing rods for extra protection. After a gigantic battle with archers firing tak at the dados, it appears that the battle is won. When a second wave of dados arrive, Bobby throws almost all the tak they have left in a tunnel and lures the army over it. As he is about to detonate the tak, Saint Dane catches up with Bobby and has a fight with him, in which he reveals that there is a \\"King of the territories\\", and that he wants to be it. When Bobby asks who the king is now, Saint Dane merely says, \\"And now you see the truth...\\" Siry arrives in time to prevent Bobby from being killed, and Bobby blows up the tak bomb. The dado army is destroyed but as they begin to celebrate, Bobby decides that the time has come to go after Saint Dane. Bobby goes with Siry and Alder to take the various things they had taken from the other territories back to their places of origin. After they leave, Bobby destroys the flume with a tak arrow, trapping both himself and Saint Dane on Ibara. Bobby hopes that this means Halla is safe. In the final chapter, however, Saint Dane and his accomplice Nevva Winter speak on top of the Lifelight pyramid. By unearthing the tak, Bobby has doomed Denduron. Just as Saint Dane had said long ago, Denduron would be the first territory to fall. It is revealed that Saint Dane has more power in realizing the future of Halla than thought, and that Telleo is actually Nevva Winter in disguise.  Trivia  It is said that Dewey Todd went to manage a hotel in Hollywood, CA. This is a reference to the Tower of Terror film where a person named Dewey Todd is a bellhop who manages the elevator. In the movie and the book, the elevator was struck by lightning and neither of them survive, just as the relationship between Gunny and Dodger developed.

Most people understand that trauma exposure is a popular occupational hazard for military members. Psychiatric screenings, before and during their enlistment, and treatments after being exposed to warfare, death, destruction, and torture have been extremely beneficial for military personnel and their dependents. Psychiatric and mental health nurses treat individuals diagnosed with conditions like schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, and depression. They are also trained in behavioral therapy which allows these nurses to teach patients and their loved ones how to deal with, react to, and overcome challenges that go along with different psychiatric disorders. Nurses in the psychiatric and mental health field can assess, examine, and treat patients with mental illness. Nurses with proper training are able to identify and understand the needs and help-seeking behaviors of military members and, with military cultural competence and knowledge about stress injuries, including psychological damage, they are able to deliver patient-centered care to patients with military culture experiences. Emergency Psychiatry Process  Duties and responsibilities  * Prevention of mental illness through mental health promotion activities, interventions when emotional and mental health problems arise, and stabilization of individuals at their highest level of functioning * Provide specialized care to emotionally distressed individuals both as inpatients and outpatients and provide consultations within the general community * Conduct patient counseling, crisis intervention, medication management, milieu and group therapy, and critical incident stress debriefings (CISD) * Serve as an expert educator, adviser, and consultant on mental health issues to department chiefs and staff as well as the patients and their families * Coordinate outpatient psychiatric care within the behavioral health care service line * Conduct medical research on diseases of military importance * Conduct, supervise and participate in graduate medical education and training of other medical personnel * Facilitating social and emotional needs * Supervising medication schedules * Evaluating patient progress * Maintaining a safe environment = Unique duty positions = * Psychiatric Clinical Staff or Head Nurse * Head nurse in an alcohol and drug treatment program * Advanced practice positions such as a Psychiatric and Mental Health Nurse Practitioner * Clinical section chief * Instructor * Program director * Member of medical company combat stress control or medical detachment = Requirements = \\"Join the Army Nurse Corps\\" picture, circa June 1943  Active duty  * Bachelor's of Science in Nursing degree from an accredited nursing program * Between 21 and 42 years of age * Current, valid and unrestricted nursing license * U.S. citizenship  Army reserve  * Minimum of a Bachelor's or associate degree in Nursing or diploma in nursing from an accredited nursing school * At least one year of experience in psychiatric nursing * Between 21 and 42 years of age * Current, valid and unrestricted nursing license * U.S. citizenship or permanent residency = Training =  Active duty  In the U.S. Army, the case diversity nurses experience in caring for Soldiers and their families far exceeds the medical care environment of the private sector. Army Nurse Corps officers have access to the most sophisticated and up-to-date technology, the opportunity to consult with experts in both the military and private sector, plus exceptional professional growth opportunities, which may include but are not limited to paid continuing education, clinical specialization, and residencies.  Army reserve  The Army Reserve Nurse Corps begins with the Army Medical Department Basic Officer Leaders Course (BOLC), a three-week program that will expose nurses to the variety of mental and physical challenges they will face as a member of the United States Army's health care team. Candidates learn about the Army's approach to health care firsthand, train with other professionals, and attending lectures, conferences, and demonstrations that cover everything from U.S. Army customs to crisis management. Some candidates even have the opportunity to participate in a hands-on medical simulation of an in-theater field medical unit. After completing BOLC, nurses will then begin serving with a Reserve unit a minimum of two days each month, and participate in annual training for at least two weeks each year. During this time, duties may include attending professional seminars and military or nursing education courses provided by the U.S. Army as well as the opportunity to work in a wide range of health care environments, whether it be in a modern hospital, working with skilled professionals in a variety of clinical situations or supervising paraprofessionals in a field medical unit.  Walter Reed National Military Medical Center  Walter Reed National Military Medical Center logo The Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, formerly known as the Walter Reed Army Medical Center and was open from May 1909 to August 2011 then realigned with the National Naval Medical Center, is located in Washington, D.C. and serves more than 150,000 active and retired military personnel from all branches, admitting 16,000 patients a year. As a provider of specialized care and a referral center for the North Atlantic Regional Medical Command, WRNMMC offers a broad range of clinical and educational opportunities as well as focusing on integrated patient care, teaching, and research opportunities. = Research = Early research began in the 1950s with the electrophysiology of neurons in the visual system provided the groundwork for Dr. David Hubel's 1981 Nobel Prize in Medicine. This standard of excellence has been kept with years of research innovations leading to over multiple patents for scientific contributions and numerous publications in high-impact journals such as Science, Nature, the New England Journal of Medicine, and the Journal of the American Medical Association.  The United States Army Medical Research Unit - Europe  The United States Army Medical Research Unit - Europe (USAMRU-E), a subordinate command of the Walter Reed National Military Center, is currently located in Heidelberg, Germany. USAMRU-E conducts applied psychological research to protect, optimize, and enhance psychological resilience for military members while also studying factors that can impact current stressors on the unit as well as the individual and their family. USAMRU-E focuses on command-directed behavioral health assessments and the development and validation of resilience training for the deployment cycle and the professional military education system. At USAMRU-E, individuals are exposed to a wide range of stressors that can negatively impact their behavioral health and well-being. Approximately 20% of those exposed report significant behavioral health problems upon returning from a combat deployment. = The National Capital Consortium Psychiatry Residency Program = The National Capital Consortium (NCC) Psychiatry Residency Program, which began in 1996, is unique and innovative graduate medical education program in psychiatry for military medical professionals. For over sixty years, neuropsychiatry investigators at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research have worked to understand, prevent, and treat the poorly understood and untreated threats to military members health and performance that just \\"in their head.\\" Three military medical institutions, WRNMMC, Fort Belvoir Community Hospital (FBCH), and the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), are involved with this integrated psychiatry residency program while keeping the tradition of excellence in graduate medical education alive. NCC psychiatry residents consistently score among the highest in the nation on standard training examinations and a large number of graduates have gone on to become national and world leaders in psychiatry.  Program overview  The National Capital Military Psychiatry Residency is a four-year program designed to prepare military physicians and nurses for the practice of general psychiatry in the military and in community settings upon discharge from the military. The program's mission is to train military physicians and nurses to become effective psychiatrists and psychiatric nurses in the variety of future roles they will fill, from military medical operations to multi-disciplinary mental health settings to primary care and other medical-surgical settings. Those who enroll in the psychiatric residency program apply their techniques of social science and psychiatric research to understand and address the many global and day-to-day pressures of military life affecting \\"mental health\\" and \\"psychological resilience.\\" Military psychiatry, psychotherapy, and psychopharmacology are particularly strong areas of emphasis of the program. Faculty members include nationally known leaders in a number of areas of psychiatry, including psychopharmacology, psychoanalysis, neuropsychiatry, child and adolescent psychiatry, consultation-liaison psychiatry, and military psychiatry. Combined residency training opportunities are also offered by the program. Army residents may apply for a 3+2 child psychiatry fellowship, and if accepted, may complete both general and child and adolescent psychiatry training in a total of five years. There is also a five-year combined internal medicine and psychiatry training program offered by the NCC Psychiatry and Internal Medicine Residency Programs. Graduates of this combined program complete requirements necessary for graduation from both residencies and for board certification in both general psychiatry and internal medicine. They also use traditional methods of individual and small-group interview, standard and specialized psychological tests and surveys, and objective measures such as the rates of suicide, re- enlistment, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), to make wide-ranging assessments of slider and military family health and to recommend changes to organization, training, and leadership.

As Director of Organization of the Teachers Guild from 1953, he was a main strategist in the creation of the United Federation of Teachers in 1960 and the winning of collective bargaining in 1961. During that time he mentored several UFT staff people, including Burke Probitsky and Robert Lieberman and elected leaders. Among them was one he was particularly close to: a junior high school teacher named Albert Shanker. Shanker often paid tribute to Selden, saying that all he knew about union organizing he had learned from Selden. Selden left UFT in 1968 upon winning election as president of the American Federation of Teachers. (In AFT, unlike its rival, the National Education Association, staff members are eligible to run for elective office. Most UFT, AFT, and other large AFT affiliates are headed by former staff people.) With the merger of the AFT and NEA affiliates in New York State in 1972, AFT became a major national union. Selden's new prominence as head of a major union, and his opposition to the Vietnam War, landed him on the master list of Nixon political opponents. The New York merger also meant that AFT had grown large enough for George Meany, president of the AFL-CIO, to judge that the teachers' union deserved a seat on the Big Labor's all-powerful executive council. AFL- CIO rules then required a council member to hold \\"a unique constitutional office\\" in his own union. In the AFT only the president and the secretary- treasurer held such offices. Shanker, now head of AFT's New York City local, the United Federation of Teachers, was one of two dozen AFT vice presidents; he held, that is, a constitutionally non-unique position. But he wanted that AFL-CIO Council seat; and Meany, a hawk on Vietnam who had denied the dovish George McGovern labor's endorsement two years earlier, would not give the seat to the equally dovish Selden. Shanker, equally a hawk, had the AFT executive council create the position of \\"executive vice president\\" and elect him, Shanker, to the position. Though the AFT constitution said nothing about an executive vice president, Meany wanted Shanker and Meany persuaded the AFL-CIO Council to add Shanker to its ranks. Sensitive to criticism of the two power plays‚ÄîMeany's and his own‚ÄîShanker challenged his erstwhile friend and mentor Selden for the AFT presidency in 1974. He lined up nearly all the other AFT vice presidents in support of his candidacy. At the AFT's annual convention that year, in Toronto, Shanker buried Selden, winning almost 80 percent of the delegates' votes. Selden retreated to Michigan where he remained active for several years in various union posts, including a spell as executive director of a local American Association of University Professors chapter. He died in Kalamazoo, Michigan, of heart failure, a complication of a stroke he suffered two years prior. References *Selden, David. Teacher Rebellion.

The show first aired in late 2004. Beginning in 2005, 24 Hour Fitness partnered with cyclist Lance Armstrong co-sponsored the Discovery Channel Pro Cycling Team. That same year, 24 Hour Fitness opened its first Lance Armstrong Signature Club. 24 Hour Fitness cut their ties with Armstrong in 2012 after the his doping scandal. =2009‚Äìpresent: Acquisition and other operations= 24 Hour Fitness formerly had some 15 clubs in Singapore and China.

Its former affiliate and spinoff California Wow Xperience (CalWowX), a California Fitness offshoot, formerly had member swap agreements with both 24 Hour, then only California Fitness, and at its height ran gyms located in Bangkok, Chiang Mai and Pattaya in Thailand, including one female-only club. In August 2012, the owner of 24 Hour Fitness put the 416 location gym chain on the auction block with a price tag reported to have been close to $2 billion. After being courted by various interests for over six months, ultimately in January 2012, the board of directors took 24 Hour Fitness off the market. Offers reportedly fell short of the asking price.

He was President of Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa; and the second president of Baldwin-Wallace College, Berea, Ohio. Education Storms was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan in 1860. He graduated the public schools of Ann Arbor and then attended the University of Michigan, earning his A.B. in 1883, and his master's degree in 1884. Early career Storms immediately entered the ministry, in the Detroit conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1884, and apprenticing until his ordination in 1886. During this time, he served in numerous pastorates in Franklin, Michigan, Hudson, Michigan, Harper Avenue Methodist Episcopal Church and Gass Avenue Methodist Episcopal Church in Detroit. He then served in churches in Madison, Wisconsin, and Des Moines, Iowa. College Administrator Storms' reputation grew, and he was given the post of President of the Iowa State College, (now, Iowa State University) in 1903. During this period, Storms was awarded honorary doctorates from Lawrence University in 1903 and Drake University in 1905. Storms' skills as an administrator would blossom during this period. Return to Ministry After seven years at Iowa State, Storms returned to the ministry. He served as pastor of the Central Avenue Methodist Church in Indianapolis, Indiana until 1915. He was instrumental in the Indianapolis Conference, and his skills did not go unnoticed. He was called to serve as the Second President of Baldwin- Wallace College in 1918. Return to Academia When Storms arrived at Baldwin-Wallace, the fledgling college was in much disarray. The first president of the college, Arthur Louis Breslich was ousted by the student body for what appeared to be pro-German sentiments during the First World War. His fifteen years at Baldwin- Wallace were marked with phenomenal growth. To his credit, the College might have failed without his dillegence. Storms oversaw the growth of enrollments, endowments, programs, and faculty during the postbellum period. He was the last college president to teach regular classes on top of his busy schedule as president.

Part of the Portuguese security forces, the mission of the PSP is to defend Republican democracy, safeguarding internal security and the rights of its citizens. Despite many other functions, the force is generally known for policing urban areas with uniformed police officers, while rural areas are normally policed by National Republican Guard (GNR), a gendarmerie force. PSP is focused in the preventive policing, only investigating minor crimes. Investigation of serious crimes falls under the Judicial Police responsibility, which is a separate agency. History A traditional lantern sign which identifies a PSP station A map of the municipalities policed by the PSP in Mainland Portugal. The Azores and Madeira are entirely policed by PSP, while most of municipalities on the Mainland are patrolled by the GNR. Like most of Europe, until the Middle Ages the defense of public order was the responsible of local communities, under the authority of feudal lords and courts. In Portugal, there are few references to the administration of justice until the second half of the 15th century. With the reign of King Afonso V (under the regency of Infante Pedro) came the first ordinances and penal codes, known as the Ordena√ß√µes Afonsinas. These ordinances were reissued during the reign of King John I in 1514, after various changes under Manuel I. Some of the early judicial measures came from the early nobles. Afonso Henriques ordered the incarceration of women who lived with elements of the clergy, while in the era of Afonso II, under the influence of Visigothic codes and Roman law, resulted in the appearance of the first general laws. Similarly, Afonso III punished anyone who assaulted and robbed the home of another. King Pedro I, the Just, decreed that anyone who falsified coins, gold or silver objects would have their hands and feet amputated. However, criminals were provided shelters by which to flee justice: the churches, monasteries and \\"privileged\\" lands. These privileged lands became areas of thieves and criminals, which resulted in King John extinguishing these areas. This was also something that King Fernando did with bairros, and only churches and convents became sanctuaries. The first corps of police agents, the Quadrilheiros, was created by Fernando I, on 12 September 1383, consisting of 20 members, who were recruited by force from the strongest physical men, to serve Lisbon. These men were subject to the town council for three years, and required to swear fealty and carry a weapon (a staff), which they would display at their homes, representing a symbol of their authority to arrest and direct criminals to the Corregedores (magistrates). Since these men never received payment for their services, and since these activities were dangerous, most chose to escape the responsibility. For most, these services were intolerable, with little prestige, at various times resulting in bruises and wounds in the execution of their tasks. Owing to this, by 1418, these constables were not required to circle the town. Later, Afonso V provided the Quadrilheiros, on 10 June 1460, with several social and economic privileges. However, these would disappear over time. Even as Afonso V put into action other laws, regulations, advisories and ordinances, many were ineffective. King Sebastian promulgated laws on 31 January 1559, 17 January 1570, 12 July and 13 August 1571, to reinforce the laws of Fernando I, Edward and Afonso V. In order to compensate the diminishing benefits of their service, the Quadrilheiros were exempt from paying taxes or military service. Sebastian also ordered that Lisbon be divided into barrios, and that each should be administered by an official of justice, with discretionary powers. On 12 March 1603, King Philip II ordered new regulations for the Quadrilheiros in order to reinforce their authority. The Lisbon council, on 30 January 1617, determined that Quadrilheiros should have a label over their doors to identify them, and that the King should confer on them special privileges, such as sitting at the council table. King John IV of Portugal provided a new charter, and a decree on 29 November 1644, forced them (under terrible sanctions) to serve the public, working in the day and evenings. By the first half of the 18th century, little had improved. There continued to be a lack of policing, resulting in leis in 1701, 1702 and 1714. As new circuits were created to blanket the city, many of the criminals were aware that the laws transformed the situation into forgettable enclaves. The Quadrilheiros continued to be a poor class, due to their limitations, resulting in poor public order. After the 1755 Lisbon earthquake new laws and resolutions were established to maintain public order and reduce anarchy. Sebasti√£o Jos√© de Carvalho e Melo, the Marquess of Pombal, found it necessary to create an organism to centralize all laws. By law, on 25 June 1760, he created the Intend√™ncia da Pol√≠cia da Corte e do Reino (Police Quartermaster of the Court and the Kingdom), and the position of Intendente-Geral da Pol√≠cia da Corte e do Reino (Quartermaster- General), with unlimited jurisdiction. The first Quartermaster-General was In√°cio Ferreira Souto, at the same time that the term pol√≠cia (police) was commonly used, and the Quadrilheiros were relegated to the evenings. However, this foundation did little resolve criminal issues, and locks on doors, grades on windows and blunderbusses beside the bed continued to be important. The Intendente-Geral was preoccupied with pursuing those who spoke badly of the King, Government or Pombal himself. Between 1760 and 1780, chaos persisted. By decree, on 18 January 1780, Queen Maria I of Portugal named the old Criminal Judge for the Bairro do Castelo de S. Jorge, Diogo In√°cio de Pina Manique, Intendente-Geral. Instructed in laws at the University of Coimbra, he became a powerful chief: he began by expunging the police services of criminal elements, and took advantage of all laws to arrest all criminals or suspects in the Alfama, Mouraria, Bairro Alto and Madragoa, reorganizing the services and bringing a level of respectability to the department. Around the same time, the Guarda Real de Polcia (Police Royal Guar') was founded on 25 December 1801, a militarized corps of cavalry. While correctional \\"houses\\" were established, the Pol√≠cia Sanit√°ria (Sanitary Police) was established to curb prostitution. The Casa Pia de Lisboa was founded to collect abandoned children. As the Police Royal Guard was overwhelmed with customs supervision, the Guarda das Barreiras was created, later to be replaced by the Guarda das Alf√¢ndegas (Customs Guard). In 1808 the General Loison, at the behest of the Quartermaster-General of the Royal Guard Police, established a Pol√≠cia Secreta (Secret Police). In 1823, the Liberal government established the Guarda Nacional (National Guard) and on 23 June 1824, a new secret police was reestablished, the Pol√≠cia Preventiva (Preventative Police force). On 21 August 1826 the Guarda Real de Pol√≠cia was discontinued. On 8 November 1833, the position of Intendente-Geral was discontinued with Jos√© Ant√≥nio Maria de Sousa e Azevedo. All the services of the police, from this period, were transferred to the prefects (later civil governors), of which the Prefect of the Province of Estremadura, Bento Pereira do Carmo, stands out. The police prerogatives of this position remained temporary and territorial, influenced by prefects, general administrators and later civil governors. On 18 April 1835, the kingdom was divided into 17 administrative districts, with a civil governor for each district, and divided into municipalities, civil parishes and ecclesiastical parishes. The civil governors were responsible for public security. During a period of political confusion caused by the Liberal Wars, the Guarda Real de Pol√≠cia was substituted by the Guarda Municipal (Municipal Guard), currently represented by the GNR, then created by Pereira do Carmo. In this entanglement of police institutions, many times contradictory, the Guarda Nacional was dissolved in 1846. Yet, the inconsistency of public security resulted in the 22 February 1838 law, that created a corps to maintain public security in each of the administrative districts of the country. Until this period, the laws, decrees and dispatches that were published provided better results in thefts and murders. The guards and judges, however, felt they were betrayed by threats and reprisals, which resulted in a demoralization of the profession. In order to remedy this situation, King Luis ordered the publication of a law that founded a corps of civil police (2 July 1867). With the formation of the Corpo de Pol√≠cia Civil, the foundations were laid for creation of the Public Security Police. Roles and responsibilities Two police officers in a mobile police station Two PSP constables on foot patrol in Funchal on the island of Madeira The PSP has the following police roles and responsibilities: * Preventive Police: includes the prevention of general or organised crime and protection from terrorism guaranteeing the security of people and goods (to the level of petty crime), in areas that are not specifically reserved for the Pol√≠cia Judici√°ria (PJ) * Public Order: this includes the responsibility for intervention and special operations * Administrative Police: this is the administrative arm of the security forces, including the responsibility for acts emanating from the competent authority and some matters of licensing * Exclusive powers: responsible for weapons control, ammunition and explosives, outside the authority of the armed and security forces, as well as guaranteeing the security for personnel of domestic and foreign entities, and other citizens subject to threat of person * Special powers: responsible for airport security and the protection of diplomatic missions both locally and internationally * Special Programs: responsible for educational programs, such as the Safe School, security of the elderly, trade insurance, spring insurance, domestic violence and the Integrated Policing of Proximity Program (PIPP) Organisation The Public Security Police is headed by a National Director, who is under the dependency of the Minister of Internal Administration. Its internal organization includes the following components: * National Directorate, including: # National Director # Inspector General # Deputy National Director for operations and security # Deputy National Director for human resources # Deputy National Director for logistics and finance * Educational police establishments, including: # Higher Institute of Police Science and Internal Security (ISCPSI, Instituto Superior de Ci√™ncias Policiais e Seguran√ßa Interna) - university level police officer academy # Practical School of Police (EPP, Escola Pr√°tica de Pol√≠cia) - constable training school * Special Police Unit, which includes as its sub-units: # Intervention Corps (CI, Corpo de Interven√ß√£o) - riot sub- unit # Personal Security Corps (CSP, Corpo de Seguran√ßa Pessoal) - bodyguard sub-unit # Special Operations Group (GOE, Grupo de Opera√ß√µes Especiais) - special operations and anti-terrorist sub-unit # Centre for Inactivation of Explosives and Underground Security (CIEXSS, Centro de Inativa√ß√£o de Explosivos e Seguran√ßa em Subsolo) - bomb disposal and underground security sub-unit # Canine Technical Operational Group (GOC, Grupo Operacional Cinot√©cnico) - police dog sub-unit * Police territorial commands, including # Metropolitan commands (CoMet, comandos metropolitanos): Lisbon and Porto # Regional commands (CR, comandos regionais): Azores and Madeira # District commands (CD, comandos distritais): Faro, Beja, √âvora, Portalegre, Set√∫bal, Santar√©m, Leiria, Castelo Branco, Coimbra, Aveiro, Viseu, Guarda, Braga, Viana do Castelo, Vila Real and Bragan√ßa. The regional and district commands have the territorial jurisdiction over, respectively, the corresponding autonomous regions and districts. Despite their designations, the territorial jurisdictions of the metropolitan commands are not the metropolitan areas of Lisbon and Porto but are instead the districts of Lisbon and Porto. The squad (esquadra in Portuguese) is the traditional basic police sub-unit of the PSP, each being usually headed by a Sub-Commissioner. Most of the squads are responsible for the generic territorial preventive policing of a given area of responsibility, which can be a neighborhood of a large city or an entire small city. Each of these squads occupy a police station and because of that, by metonymy, the police stations are usually referred to as esquadras in Portugal. Besides the previous, there are also specialized squads (transit, criminal investigation, intervention, airport security, tourism support, etc.). The minor territorial commands (district commands of Beja, Bragan√ßa, Castelo Branco, √âvora, Guarda, Portalegre and Viana do Castelo) are directly sub-divided in squads. They usually include two or more territorial generic squads, a transit squad, a criminal investigation squad and an intervention and inspection squad. In the major territorial commands (metropolitan commands, regional commands and district commands of Aveiro, Braga Coimbra, Faro, Leiria, Santar√©m, Set√∫bal, Vila Real and Viseu) there is however an intermediate level of sub-unit between them and the squad, this being the division. These commands are thus organized in two or more divisions, each of which includes several squads. The divisions can be generic (named \\"police divisions\\" and being responsible for a given area of responsibility) or specialized (transit, criminal investigation, airport security, installations security or public transportation security). The municipal police of Lisbon and Porto are also manned by PSP members, who retain all their police powers. However, they are not under the operational command of the PSP, but are instead under the direct control of the municipal governments of Lisbon and Porto. These two police forces are thus different from the rest of the municipal police forces of the country, which are made of municipal employees who have very limited police powers. Personnel As of 2019, the entry level salary for a police officer in the PSP is 789 euros a month.Catarina Demony and Victoria Waldersee (November 21, 2019), Portuguese police march for better pay Reuters. PSP police personnel is divided into three categories: officers, chiefs and agents. The access to the category of agent requires the conclusion of a technical course in the Practical School of Police (EPP) at Torres Novas. The access to the category of chief is made through the promotion from the category of agent, after the conclusion of a specific course also at the EPP. The access to the officer category requires the previous graduation in the Higher Institute of Police Sciences and Internal Security (ISCPSI), a university-level police academy. The various categories, ranks, insignia and respective main functions are: * Police Officers :* 50px Chief Superintendent: National Director of the PSP, :* 50px Chief Superintendent: Deputy National Director or Inspector General of the PSP :* 50px Chief Superintendent: commanding officer of a metropolitan / regional command :* 50px Superintendent: commanding officer of a district command or second-in-command of a metropolitan / regional command :* 50px Intendent: division commander in a metropolitan / regional command or second-in-command of a district command :* 50px Sub-Intendent: division commander in a district command or second-in- command of a division commanded by an intendent :* 50px Commissioner: second- in-command of a division commanded by a sub-intendent :* 50px Sub- Commissioner: commanding officer of a police squad (police station) * Police Chiefs :* 50px Principal Chief: auxiliary of a unit commanding officer :* 50px Chief: supervisor of staff and leader of police teams * Police Agents :* 50px Principal Agent: a senior principal agent may perform the same functions as a chief, others perform the same functions as an agent :* 50px Agent: functions of police constable * ISCPSI Students: :* 50px Officer Candidate: student of the 5th year of the Training Course for Police Officers (CFOP) :* 50px Cadet: student of the 4th year of the CFOP :* 50px Cadet: student of the 3rd year of the CFOP :* 50px Cadet: student of the 2nd year of the CFOP :* 50px Cadet: student of the 1st year of the CFOP Vehicles =Models= Since 2004, the Skoda Octavia has been the principal model of patrol car used by the Public Security Police. However, a number of other models are also in service, including Nissan Leaf, Renault Megane and Toyota Avensis. A single apprehended Audi R8 is used as a special pursuit car. Older models of patrol cars are also still in service, like Volkswagen Polo saloon, Mitsubishi Carisma and Fiat Tempra. Ground speed radar equipped Volkswagen Sharan minivans are used for traffic enforcement, while some Toyota Hilux pickup trucks and Land Rover jeeps are used for patrolling non urban and mountainous areas. A number vans are also in service, including newer Mercedes-Benz Metris and Sprinter (with flip down wire shield across the windscreen) and older Volkswagen Transporter, Iveco and Ford Transit. The Special Police Unit uses a number of special vehicles, including Iveco water cannons and Cougar armored vehicles. =Vehicle appearance= PSP vehicles have some lack of uniform appearance due to the successive introduction of new liveries which however are usually only applied to new vehicles, with the existing ones keeping the original old ones. The most recent livery for the PSP vehicles was introduced in 2014. The basic version of this livery consists in a white body with diagonal blue stripes, the wording \\"POL√çCIA\\" (police) in blue sans-serif lettering in the sides, rear and bonnet and a logo with the national colors on the front side panels. For the traffic patrol vehicles there is a variant, which intermediates red stripes with the blue ones and has the wording \\"TR√ÇNSITO\\" (transit) on the rear side panels. Another variant of the livery is its negative version (blue, with the stripes and wording in white) to be applied in vans and special vehicles. The three variants have been applied to most of the vehicles acquired after 2014. However, other vehicles carry older or not standard liveries, namely the 2004 livery (similar to the 2014 livery, but with the wording \\"POLICIA\\" in serif letters - which are inclined in the sides - and the PSP coat of arms instead of the national colors logo), the 1991 livery (blue body with doors, trunk and bonnet in white and crossed by red stripes), the 1979 livery (blue body with white front doors), the all blue body (used by most of the vans and special vehicles) and several special police programs (Safe School, Tourism support, etc.) liveries.

An uncommon species, it is typically lumped together under the name \\"mako\\" with its better-known relative, the shortfin mako shark (I. oxyrinchus). The longfin mako is a pelagic species found in moderately deep water, having been reported to a depth of . Growing to a maximum length of , the slimmer build and long, broad pectoral fins of this shark suggest that it is a slower and less active swimmer than the shortfin mako. Longfin mako sharks are predators that feed on small schooling bony fishes and cephalopods. Whether this shark is capable of elevating its body temperature above that of the surrounding water like the other members of its family is uncertain, though it possesses the requisite physiological adaptations. Reproduction in this species is aplacental viviparous, meaning the embryos hatch from eggs inside the uterus. In the later stages of development, the unborn young are fed nonviable eggs by the mother (oophagy). The litter size is typically two, but may be as many as eight. The longfin mako is of limited commercial value, as its meat and fins are of lower quality than those of other pelagic sharks; however, it is caught unintentionally in low numbers across its range. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this species as endangered due to its rarity, low reproductive rate, and continuing bycatch mortality. In 2019, alongside the shortfin mako, the IUCN listed the longfin mako as \\"Endangered\\".https://www.foxnews.com/science/worlds-fastest-shark- endangered-17-other-species-almost-extinct-conservationists- sayhttps://oceanforsharks.com/2019/03/23/the-iucn-announced-conservation- status-update-on-58-elasmobranch-species-including-the-shortfin- makohttps://www.iucnssg.org/press.html Taxonomy and phylogeny The original description of the longfin mako was published in 1966 by Cuban marine scientist Dar√≠o Guitart-Manday, in the scientific journal Poeyana, based on three adult specimens from the Caribbean Sea. An earlier synonym of this species may be Lamiostoma belyaevi, described by Gl√ºckman in 1964. However, the type specimen designated by Gl√ºckman consists of a set of fossil teeth that could not be confirmed as belonging to the longfin mako, thus the name paucus took precedence over belyaevi, despite being published later. The specific epithet paucus is Latin for \\"few\\", referring to the rarity of this species relative to the shortfin mako. The sister species relationship between the longfin and shortfin makos has been confirmed by several phylogenetic studies based on mitochondrial DNA. In turn, the closest relative of the two mako sharks is the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias). Fossil teeth belonging to the longfin mako have been recovered from the Muddy Creek marl of the Grange Burn formation, south of Hamilton, Australia, and from Mizumani Group in Gifu Prefecture, Japan. Both deposits date to the Middle Miocene Epoch (15‚Äì11 million years ago (mya)). The oligo-miocene fossil shark tooth taxon Isurus retroflexus may be the ancestor to or even conspecific with the Longfin Mako. Distribution and habitat Widely scattered records suggest that the longfin mako shark has a worldwide distribution in tropical and warm- temperate oceans; the extent of its range is difficult to determine due to confusion with the shortfin mako. In the Atlantic Ocean, it is known from the Gulf Stream off the East Coast of the United States, the Caribbean, and southern Brazil in the west, and from the Iberian Peninsula to Ghana in the east, possibly including the Mediterranean Sea and Cape Verde. In the Indian Ocean, it has been reported from the Mozambique Channel. In the Pacific Ocean, it occurs off Japan and Taiwan, northeastern Australia, a number of islands in the Central Pacific northeast of Micronesia, and southern California. An inhabitant of the open ocean, the longfin mako generally remains in the upper mesopelagic zone during the day and ascends into the epipelagic zone at night. Off Cuba, it is most frequently caught at a depth of and is rare at depths above . Off New South Wales, most catches occur at a depth of , in areas with a surface temperature around . Description The longfin mako is the larger of the two makos and the second-largest species in its family (after the great white), reaching upwards of in length and weighing over ; females grow larger than males.Wilson, T. and Ford, T. Biological Profiles: Longfin Mako. Florida Museum of Natural History Ichthyology Department. Retrieved on December 25, 2008. The largest reported longfin mako was a female caught off Pompano Beach, Florida, in February 1984.Martin, R.A. Biology of the Longfin Mako (Isurus paucus). ReefQuest Centre for Shark Research. Retrieved on December 25, 2008. This species has a slim, fusiform shape with a long, pointed snout and large eyes that lack nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids). Twelve to 13 tooth rows occur on either side of the upper jaw and 11‚Äì13 tooth rows are on either side of the lower jaw. The teeth are large and knife-shaped, without serrations or secondary cusps; the outermost teeth in the lower jaw protrude prominently from the mouth. The gill slits are long and extend onto the top of head. The pectoral fins are as long or longer than the head, with a nearly straight front margin and broad tips. The first dorsal fin is large with a rounded apex, and is placed behind the pectoral fins. The second dorsal and anal fins are tiny. The caudal peduncle is expanded laterally into strong keels. The caudal fin is crescent-shaped, with a small notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The dermal denticles are elliptical, longer than wide, with three to seven horizontal ridges leading to a toothed posterior margin. The coloration is dark blue to grayish black above and white below. The unpaired fins are dark except for a white rear margin on the anal fin; the pectoral and pelvic fins are dark above and white below with sharp gray posterior margins. In adults and large juveniles, the area beneath the snout, around the jaw, and the origin of the pectoral fins have dusky mottling.

The longfin mako's slender body and long, broad pectoral fins evoke the oceanic whitetip shark (Carcharhinus longimanus) and the blue shark (Prionace glauca), both slow-cruising sharks of upper oceanic waters. This morphological similarity suggests that the longfin mako is less active than the shortfin mako, one of the fastest and most energetic sharks. Like the other members of its family, this species possesses blood vessel countercurrent exchange systems called the rete mirabilia (Latin for \\"wonderful net\\", singular rete mirabile) in its trunk musculature and around its eyes and brain. This system enables other mackerel sharks to conserve metabolic heat and maintain a higher body temperature than their environments, though whether the longfin mako is capable of the same is uncertain. The longfin mako has large eyes and is attracted to cyalume sticks (chemical lights), implying that it is a visual hunter. Its diet consists mainly of small, schooling bony fishes and squids. In October 1972, a female with the broken bill from a swordfish (Xiphius gladias) lodged in her abdomen was caught in the northeastern Indian Ocean; whether the shark was preying on swordfish as the shortfin mako does, or encountered the swordfish in some other aggressive context is not known. Adult longfin makos have no natural predators except for killer whales, while young individuals may fall prey to larger sharks. As in other mackerel sharks, the longfin mako is aplacental viviparous and typically gives birth to two pups at a time (one inside each uterus), though a female pregnant with eight well-developed embryos was caught in the Mona Passage near Puerto Rico in January 1983. The developing embryos are oophagous; once they deplete their supply of yolk, they sustain themselves by consuming large quantities of nonviable eggs ovulated by their mother. No evidence of sibling cannibalism is seen, as in the sand tiger shark (Carcharias taurus). The pups measure long at birth, relatively larger than the young of the shortfin mako, and have proportionally longer heads and pectoral fins than the adults. Capture records off Florida suggest that during the winter, females swim into shallow coastal waters to give birth. Male and female sharks reach sexual maturity at lengths around and , respectively. Human interactions The longfin mako is caught as bycatch on pelagic longlines No attacks on humans have been attributed to the longfin mako shark. Nevertheless, its large size and teeth make it potentially dangerous. This shark is caught, generally in low numbers, as bycatch on longlines intended for tuna, swordfish, and other pelagic sharks, as well as in anchored gillnets and on hook-and-line. The meat is marketed fresh, frozen, or dried and salted, though it is considered to be of poor quality due to its mushy texture. The fins are also considered to be of lower quality for use in shark fin soup, though are valuable enough that captured sharks are often finned at sea. The carcasses may be processed into animal feed and fish meal, while the skin, cartilage, and jaws are also of value. The most significant longfin mako catches are by Japanese tropical longline fisheries, and those sharks occasionally enter Tokyo fish markets. From 1987 to 1994, United States fisheries reported catches (discarded, as this species is worthless on the North American market) of 2‚Äì12 tons per year. Since 1999, retention of this species has been prohibited by the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service Fishery Management Plan for Atlantic sharks. Longfin makos were once significant in the Cuban longline fishery, comprising one-sixth of the shark landings from 1971 to 1972; more recent data from this fishery are not available. The IUCN has assessed this species as \\"Vulnerable\\" due to its uncommonness, low reproductive rate, and susceptibility to shark fishing gear. It has also been listed under Annex I of the Convention on Migratory Species Migratory Shark Memorandum of Understanding.Memorandum of Understanding ‚Äì Migratory Sharks. Convention on Migratory Species. Downloaded on February 14, 2012. In the North Atlantic, stocks of the shortfin mako have declined 40% or more since the late 1980s, and concerns exist that populations of the longfin mako are following the same trend. In 2019, along with its relative the shortfin mako, the IUCN listed the longfin mako as \\"Endangered\\" due to continuing declines alongside 58 elasmobranch species.

From 1972-1980, he served four 2-year terms as a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. He was a commissioner of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission from 1988-1995\\\\. He served as a member of several public panels, including the President's Commission on Campus Unrest that investigated the fatal shootings of unarmed student protesters by soldiers and police in 1970 at Kent State and Jackson State Universities.  Early life and career  Rhodes' father was an African- American who served as a US soldier in the Philippines during World War II. Rhodes' mother, a woman of Filipino/Chinese descent, met his father there in 1945 and married him. The couple settled in Pittsburgh. Rhodes attended Pittsburgh public schools. From 1965-1969 Rhodes was an undergraduate at the California Institute of Technology, and he received a B.S. in history in 1969. Rhodes served two terms as the president of the student body. Photo of Lee DuBridge shaking hands with Joe Rhodes, 1967. He was in residence at Harvard University from 1969‚Äì1972 as a junior fellow of the Harvard Society of Fellows, where he researched racism in Victorian England. Rhodes then held a number of teaching positions at the University of Massachusetts, California State College and the University of Pittsburgh. He was also employed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 1967, and served as a staff researcher for the Ford Foundation 1969-1970.  Policy work  After 1968 Rhodes served on a number of national commissions studying such diverse subjects as the causes of campus unrest and the need for new structures in higher education. He was a consultant to the Office of the Secretary, Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, 1968‚Äì1971. He was a member of the More Effective School Personnel Utilization (MESPU) Panel in the Office of Education from 1969-1970, and a consultant to the President Nixon's Counsel from 1969‚Äì1970. He was a member of President Nixon's Committee on Voluntary Service, 1969. He also served on the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare Secretary's Committee on New Structures in Higher Education (The Newman Committee) (1969‚Äì1972), and he was on the Advisory Panel of the National Endowment for the Humanities, 1971. Rhodes' service on the President's Commission on Campus Unrest in 1970 brought him to nationwide attention. This Commission was established specifically to investigate two incidents in 1970 in which unarmed student protesters were shot and killed by soldiers and policemen, one at Kent State University in Ohio and a second at Jackson State University in Mississippi. Rhodes was the youngest and least known member of the committee, and its only current student; his selection for the commission is attributed to his longstanding relationship with John Ehrlichman, who was a prominent member of then President Richard Nixon's staff. Shortly after his appointment, Rhodes gave a controversial interview to Robert Reinhold of The New York Times in which he said \\"If the President's and Vice-President's statements are killing people, I want to know that\\" and that California Governor Ronald Reagan was \\"bent on killing people for his political gain.\\" The following day, Vice-President Spiro Agnew called publicly for Rhodes to resign. Rhodes refused, and was a signatory to the Commission's \\"Scranton Report\\" in September, 1970.  Political career  Rhodes was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, 24th Legislative District (Allegheny County), in 1972, and was reelected to the House for three successive terms. In 1977 he sponsored an amendment (Act 41) to the Juvenile Justice Act that prohibited incarceration of juveniles in adult jails and that diverted status offenders from the juvenile justice system. Status offenders are those whose crimes derive from the offender's juvenile status instead of from the criminal act itself; one example would be violation of a juvenile curfew that bans juveniles from public places during certain hours of the night. Linda Rhodes has been quoted as saying that Rhodes \\"...considered passage of Act 41 as his greatest achievement during his three-terms as a lawmaker.\\" Rhodes did not run for a fifth term as a Representative. He sought the Democratic party nomination for United States Senate in 1980, but lost substantially in the April, 1980 primary election to former Pittsburgh mayor Peter F. Flaherty. Arlen Specter defeated Flaherty in the November, 1980 general election.  Later career  Rhodes then worked as a planner for the Westinghouse Corporation in Pittsburgh for seven years. In 1987 he was appointed by Pennsylvania Governor Robert P. Casey as the Deputy Commissioner of Commerce. In 1988 he was confirmed by the Pennsylvania Senate as a commissioner of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, and served until 1995. He then worked as a consultant for corporations and for the leadership of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. He was cited by Time Magazine as one of 200 new leaders in America and received the Americans for Democratic Action National Youth Award in 1971. He was named on the master list of Nixon political opponents during his service to the Nixon administration, and included this as an award on his resume.  Personal life  Rhodes had been married to Linda Rhodes, who served from 1987‚Äì1994 as the Pennsylvania Commonwealth's Secretary of Aging. The couple had two children.

The series was written by Jaston Williams, Joe Sears, and Ed Howard. The plays are at once an affectionate comment on small-town, Southern life and attitudes but also a withering satire of same. Of the four plays, Greater Tuna is the darkest in time, as it follows the news of the death (and possible murder) of Judge Buckner. The plays are notable in that two men play the entire cast of over twenty eccentric characters of both genders and various ages. Greater Tuna debuted in Austin, Texas, in the fall of 1981, and had its off-Broadway premiere in 1982. St. Vincent Summer Theatre produced the play in 2000,http://svst.org/timeline/ and No Name Players produced it in 2002. Charles H. Duggan produced national tours of \\"Greater Tuna\\", \\"A Tuna Christmas\\" and \\"Red, White & Tuna\\" for twenty-six years. Williams and Sears regularly tour the country to perform all four plays, with Howard directing. An HBO Special of Greater Tuna, produced by Embassy Television and Norman Lear, was aired in 1984. Due to modern videography techniques, the various characters portrayed by Sears and Williams were able to be seen en masse for the first time. However, due to copyright conflicts between Embassy Television and the original copyright claimants (Joe Sears, Jaston Williams & Ed Howard) the broadcast was limited to only 3 months in 1984. It has never been broadcast again. Rare VHS taped copies have been sold on eBay in excess of $100. Sears and Williams did command performances of both Greater Tuna and A Tuna Christmas at the White House for President George H. W. Bush and Barbara Bush. According to the play's official web site, by 1985, Greater Tuna was the most-produced play in the United States.

It was directed by Michael Curtiz and produced by Samuel Bischoff, with Hal B. Wallis as executive producer, from a screenplay by Michael Jacoby and Rowland Leigh, from a story by Michael Jacoby based on the 1854 poem \\"The Charge of the Light Brigade\\" by Alfred, Lord Tennyson. The music score was composed by Max Steiner, his first for Warner Bros., and the cinematography was by Sol Polito. Scenes were shot at the following California locations: Lone Pine, Sherwood Lake, Lasky Mesa, Chatsworth and Sonora. The Sierra Nevada mountains were used for the Khyber Pass scenes.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/2098/The-Charge-of-the-Light- Brigade/notes.html The film's script is very loosely based on the famous Charge of the Light Brigade that occurred during the Crimean War (1853‚Äì56). Additionally, the storyline includes an event similar to the Siege of Cawnpore during the Indian Rebellion of 1857. This was the second of eight films in which Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland costar. A later film was made in 1968 under the same name, The Charge of the Light Brigade and stars Trevor Howard and Vanessa Redgrave. Plot In 1854, Major Geoffrey Vickers (Errol Flynn) and his brother, Captain Perry Vickers (Patric Knowles), are stationed in India, with the 27th Lancers of the British Army. It is during the period of East India Company dominance over the Indian subcontinent. Perry has secretly betrayed Geoffrey by stealing the love of his fianc√©e Elsa (Olivia de Havilland). During an official visit to local tributary rajah, Surat Khan (C. Henry Gordon), Geoffrey saves the rajah's life while hunting, for which the rajah promises eternal gratitude. Later, Maj. Vickers is stationed at the British garrison of (fictional) Chukoti, along with British military families, within the part the North-Western Frontier controlled by Surat Khan. A British miscalculation leads to premature withdrawal of troops to (fictional) Lohora, unnecessarily exposing Chukoti. Faced with an overwhelming siege, the British commander, Col. Campbell (Donald Crisp), surrenders Chukoti to Surat Khan, who then massacres the inhabitants, including British families. Surat Khan allies his forces with Imperial Russia, whom the British are fighting in the Crimean War, but spares Maj. Vickers and Elsa as they flee the slaughter. This repays his debt to Geoffrey. The love triangle and the quest for vengeance resolve at the Battle of Balaclava. Aware that Surat Khan is inspecting Russian positions opposite the 27th Lancers, Maj. Vickers secretly replaces written orders by Sir Charles Macefield (Henry Stephenson) to the commander of the Light Brigade, Sir Benjamin Warrenton (Nigel Bruce), to withdraw from the Balaclava Heights. Vickers instead orders the famous suicidal attack so the lancers can avenge the Chukoti massacre. Before the charge, Maj. Vickers reminds troops of the Chukoti Massacre and directs their anger: \\"Our objective is Surit Khan\\"! Although the 27th Lancers lose nearly all their 600 strength, they successfully breach Russian artillery positions. There, Vickers finds and kills Surat Khan with a lance, at the cost of his own life. Later, it emerges that Maj. Vickers wrote a letter to Sir Charles Macefield explaining his actions, which he forced Perry to deliver under threat of court martial, sparing his brother almost certain death during the 27th's charge. After receiving Maj. Vickers' explanation of why he defied orders and the charge happened, Macefield takes responsibility and burns the letter to protect Vickers and to honor him for his conspicuous gallantry in avenging the Chukoti Massacre. Cast Production =Development= The charge had been previously portrayed in a British film, The Jaws of Death (1930). Warner Bros. was inspired to make the film after Lives of a Bengal Lancer (1935) had been released to great popularity, ushering in a series of British Empire adventure tales. Michel Jacoby had developed a story based on the famous charge but, although Warners bought Jacoby's script, the final script was closer to Lives of a Bengal Lancer.Tony Thomas, Rudy Behlmer * Clifford McCarty, The Films of Errol Flynn, Citadel Press, 1969 p 45-50 An original working title for the film was The Charge of the 600. Warner Bros. wanted an all-British cast. Errol Flynn (Tasmanian, but often considered Irish) had made such a strong impression in Captain Blood, he was removed from supporting Fredric March in Anthony Adverse to play the lead in Charge of the Light Brigade.Chaplin's Big Business: Goldwyn's Leading Lady: A New Romantic Hero Bain, Greville. The Times of India (1861-current) [New Delhi, India] 07 Mar 1936: 9. Ian Hunter was connected to the film early on. Anita Louise was announced as the female lead. Patric Knowles had just joined Warner Bros. at the recommendation of Irving Asher in London, the same man who recommended Errol Flynn. He was given the crucial supporting role of Flynn's brother. The film provides an early, important supporting role for David Niven. Edward G. Robinson tested for the role as the lead villain Surat Khan. Basil Rathbone was also considered before C. Henry Gordon was finally cast. =Shooting= Principal photography began in April 1936. During filming on location at Lone Pine California, the studio's camera unit helped put out a fire that started at a restaurant across the road from where the actors were staying. Some of the location shooting was done in Mexico where there were fewer restrictions on harming animals during production. =The Charge sequence= The film comes to a climax at the Battle of Balaclava, subject of Lord Tennyson's poem. The lancers charge into the valley, braving the heavy Russian cannon fire, and many are killed. Text from Tennyson's poem is superimposed on screen, coupled with Max Steiner's musical score. Director Michael Curtiz, who did not have an excellent command of English, shouted \\"Bring on the empty horses,\\" meaning the \\"riderless horses\\"; David Niven used this as the title of his autobiographical book about the Golden Age of Hollywood. The battlefield set was lined with tripwires to trip the charging cavalry horses. For the filming of this climax, 125 horses were tripped; of those, 25 were killed or had to be put down afterward. Errol Flynn, an accomplished horseman, was outraged by the animal cruelty and by director Michael Curtiz's seeming indifference. He attacked Curtiz, but they were pulled apart before any serious damage was done. The film's charge sequence later forced the U.S. Congress to ensure the safety of animals in future motion pictures; the ASPCA followed suit and banned tripwires from all films. Unlike Flynn's other blockbusters, because of the number of horses killed during the charge sequence, the film was never re-released by Warner Bros. It would not be seen again until 1956, when the company sold the rights to it and other pre-1950 films to Associated Artists Productions, after which it subsequently premiered on television.

Reception =Box Office= The film was a massive hit in Japan.https://archive.org/stream/variety129-1938-01#page/n27/mode/1up/search/gross According to Warner Bros.' accounts, the film was the studio's most expensive and most popular film of 1936, earning $1,176,000 domestically and $1,560,000 in foreign markets. =Critical= Filmink magazine wrote that \\"If you think that story sounds silly, you‚Äôd be right and it doesn‚Äôt come across any less so on screen\\" but thought the film was redeemed by Flynn and its action sequences. Awards Jack Sullivan won the Academy Award for Best Assistant Director for his work on the film, and it was also nominated for the Academy Award for Sound (Nathan Levinson) and the Academy Award for Original Music Score.

The privileges were granted in Kassa, Kingdom of Hungary (; today: Ko≈°ice, Slovakia). In exchange, one of Louis' daughters (Catherine, Mary or Jadwiga) was to ascend the throne of Poland after his death. The szlachta obtained the following privileges: :*release from the obligation to pay tribute, with the exception of a nominal or token two groschen from one field, to the monarch; :*release from the duty to build and repair castles, except for those nobles holding territory in eastern Poland where the threat from the Russian Empire was significant; :*the restriction of eligibility for certain offices to persons of Polish (as opposed to Lithuanian, Hungarian, or other) ethnicity; :*payment of soldiers' wages to szlachta who personally fought in military campaigns; :*release from the duty to build towns and bridges; :and :*release from the duty to provide food, lodging, and other accommodations for the king and his court when he was traveling within the kingdom. Louis' promising of these privileges was a success, as Louis' youngest daughter Jadwiga eventually succeeded her father as monarch of Poland, following the Greater Poland Civil War. Hungarian influence in Poland waned, as one of the conditions for Jadwiga's ascention to the Polish throne was the end of the Polish-Hungarian Union. While Louis might have intended for the privileges to be rescindend, his death prevented this from happening. They gave a significant power boost to the Polish nobility, influencing the Polish kingdom's government for centuries.

Her autobiographical account of the Holocaust, All but My Life (1957), was adapted for the 1995 short film, One Survivor Remembers, which received an Academy Award and an Emmy Award, and was selected for the National Film Registry. She married Kurt Klein (1920‚Äì2002) in 1946. The Kleins became advocates of Holocaust education and human rights, dedicating most of their lives to promoting tolerance and community service. A naturalized U.S. citizen, Gerda Weissmann Klein also founded Citizenship Counts, a nonprofit organization that champions the value and responsibilities of American citizenship. She has served on the governing board of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, which features her testimony in a permanent exhibit. On February 15, 2011, Klein was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States. In 2013, she published a children's adventure story called The Windsor Caper, which had remained hidden away since the 1980s, when it was a weekly serial in The Buffalo News. Early life Born in 1924 in Bielsko (now Bielsko-Bia≈Ça), Poland, a town known for its textile industry, Gerda Weissmann was educated first in public school and then in a Catholic school for girls. She was one of two children born to a middle-class Jewish family;Personal Histories: Gerda Weissmann Klein and Kurt Klein , United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Retrieved 2013-06-15. her father, Julius Weissmann, was a business executive, and her mother, Helene (n√©e Mueckenbrunn), was a homemaker.Gerda Weissmann Klein, Contemporary Authors Online, Gale Literary Databases 2002 Life under the Nazis On September 3, 1939, German troops invaded fifteen-year-old Gerda's home in Bielsko, Poland. Shortly after the invasion began, the family received a telegram from Gerda's uncle saying that the Germans were advancing quickly, and the family should leave Poland immediately. However, Gerda's father had just suffered a heart attack, and doctors advised that he not be moved or subjected to undue stress. After the invasion, Gerda and her family watched in disbelief as people, ethnic Germans living in Poland, whom they had considered friends began flying the Nazi flag and using the Hitler salute. In mid-October, Gerda's older brother Arthur received a letter from the Germans: as a male between 16 and 50, Arthur (19) was required to register for the army. On October 18, 1939, Arthur complied with the summons and never saw his family again. Gerda and her parents were forced to live in the basement of their home and later in a Jewish ghetto. In 1942, Gerda was separated from her father, who was sent to a death camp where he eventually perished that April. In June, her time in the ghetto was over. Left with only the company of her mother, they approached the guard; her mother was sent right, she went left. As Gerda and her mother boarded separate trucks, Gerda leapt out, pleading not to be separated from her sole remaining family member. Moshe Merin, head of the Jewish Community Council, tossed her back inside saying, \\"You are too young to die.\\" He had saved her life, yet sentenced her mother to death. She was sent to the Dulag (Durchgangslager). = In camps = She was in several camps throughout the war. First, she was in Bolkenhain, a subcamp of Gross- Rosen, working on the looms (July 1942-August 1943). Gerda was then transferred to M√†rzdorf working physical labor (August 1943-?). She was quickly moved to Landeshut, another subcamp of Gross-Rosen, thanks to the help of several people from Bolkenhain. In Landenshut, she was working the looms once again. The Germans were losing the war, and Landenshut was shut down (?-May 1944). The last camp in which Gerda found herself was Gr√ºnberg. She was once again working the looms, but it was very different from her former camps. Bolkenhain and Landenshut were both better than other camps, and the girls were treated (somewhat) fairly at those two camps. Marzdorf was very bad. Gerda almost died from exhaustion due to overwork, but her childhood friend, Ilse, helped get Gerda out. Gr√ºnberg was very different. The director was very violent and very often beat the prisoners. The girls who worked outside managed to stay healthy, but the girls who worked on the looms died quickly due to the bad conditions (May 1944-January 1945).  Death march  Weissman was among 4000 women who began the 350-mile death march to avoid the advance of the Allied forces. During the death march, Gerda's best friend Ilse told her that she would be all alone now. They fell asleep with Gerda holding Ilse, and when she awoke, her friend had died in her sleep. The forced journey went through Dresden, Chemnitz, Zwickau, Reichenbach, Plauen, Germany, and on through Wallern (now Volary in modern-day Czech Republic), and she was one of fewer than 120 women who survived exposure to the winter elements, starvation, and arbitrary execution. Gerda attributed her survival to the fact that her father had told her to wear her ski boots when it came time to leave the home. The boots proved to be invaluable during the three-month march in the snow. Her friends Ilse Kleinzahler, Liesl Steppe, and Suse Kunz are buried in a cemetery in Wallern, Czech republic along with 92 others who died along the way. =Liberation= In May 1945, Gerda was liberated by forces of the United States Army in Volary, Czechoslovakia;Gerda Weissmann Klein's testimony at \\"THE DEATH MARCH TO VOLARY\\" - an exhibition at Yad Vashem website these forces included Lieutenant Kurt Klein, who was born in Germany and immigrated to the United States to escape Nazism as a teenager in 1937. Both of his parents had been murdered at Auschwitz-Birkenau. When Gerda and Kurt first met, Weissmann was white-haired, weighed 68 pounds, and was one day shy of her 21st birthday. She was wearing rags, and had not bathed in three years. They were engaged in September 1945 and married in 1946. Life after the War Gerda and Kurt Klein were married in Paris, France. They settled in Kenmore, New York and had three children and eight grandchildren. She became involved with several local and national charities and soon began to speak about her experiences during the war. The story of Gerda and Kurt's meeting and life together has been featured on numerous television shows, including Oprah, 60 Minutes, and CBS Sunday Morning. A book of their letters, The Hours After, is a poignant collection of correspondence between Gerda and Kurt Klein following the war. In 2013, she published The Windsor Caper (2013), a children's story that had been hidden away since the 1980s when it was a weekly serial in The Buffalo News; it is now available both as in ebook and paperback form. The book is about two American girls who have a night-time adventure in Windsor Castle, England. It features strange dreams, a foiled robbery, plus various historical characters including King Henry VIII. Gerda describes it as the only one of her books that is \\"not rooted in pain\\". Awards and recognition = Presidential Medal of Freedom = On February 15, 2011, President Barack Obama presented Gerda Weissmann Klein and 14 other recipients with the 2010 Presidential Medal of Freedom. At the ceremony in the East Room of the White House, President Obama announced, \\"This year's Medal of Freedom recipients reveal the best of who we are and who we aspire to be.\\" He stated the following as Klein was presented with her Presidential Medal of Freedom: > By the time she was 21, Gerda Klein had spent six years living under Nazi > rule ‚Äî three of them in concentration camps. Her parents and brother had > been taken away. Her best friend had died in her arms during a 350-mile > death march. And she weighed only 68 pounds when she was found by American > forces in an abandoned bicycle factory. But Gerda survived. She married the > soldier who rescued her. And ever since ‚Äî as an author, a historian and a > crusader for tolerance ‚Äî she has taught the world that it is often in our > most hopeless moments that we discover the extent of our strength and the > depth of our love. President Obama then read a statement from Klein: \\"I pray you never stand at any crossroads in your own lives, but if you do, if the darkness seems so total, if you think there is no way out, remember, never ever give up.\\"White House Press Office, Remarks by the President Honoring the Recipients of the 2010 Medal of Freedom, February 15, 2011. Retrieved 2013-06-15. = Others = Klein was selected to be the keynote speaker at the United Nations' first annual International Holocaust Remembrance Day in January 2006. She has spoken to school children in each of the 50 United States and the District of Columbia and has traveled the world to spread her message of tolerance and hope, meeting with world leaders, including Golda Meir and Menachem Begin, as well as Eleanor Roosevelt and U.S. Presidents Harry Truman, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush. In 1996, Klein was one of five women to receive the prestigious international Lion of Judah award in Jerusalem. She has also been featured on the cover of the McDougal-Littell high school textbook, The Americans, with such other notable figures as Franklin D. Roosevelt, Martin Luther King Jr., Ronald Reagan, and General Norman Schwarzkopf. She received an honorary doctorate in Humane Letters from Daemen College in 1975. In 1997, President Bill Clinton appointed her to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum's Governing Council. In 2007, the museum bestowed Klein with its highest honor at The Arizona Biltmore before 1,000 guests. In May 2001, Chapman University awarded Kurt Klein and Gerda Weissmann Klein an honorary doctorate of humane letters, the only married couple to be so honored by the university. Klein has spoken at Chapman University several times, most recently in November 2011. Legacy In 2008, Klein co-founded Citizenship Counts, a national nonprofit organization whose mission is to educate students on the rights and responsibilities of citizenship, inspire their pride in America, and encourage them to participate in community service, with her granddaughter, Alysa Cooper. The vision of Citizenship Counts is to create a well-informed, responsible citizenry who are motivated to participate in local and national communities. Klein's wish is that this organization will give her an opportunity to give back and thank the United States for all that she has been given over the years since she became a naturalized citizen in 1948.

It is situated in the Ore Mountains, 35 km southeast of Chemnitz, and 23 km north of Chomutov, Czech Republic.  History  Presumably, the town's name arose from the old German name Albert (Albernhaw, Alberthau, Albernhau, Albretshain). Olbernhau has its origins back in the 13th century. Encouraged by Archbishop Albert I. of Meissen, the so-called White Monks (Cistercians) from Osek founded the first settlement in the upper Fl√∂ha valley, shortly after ore was found here. Olbernhau was first mentioned in records in 1434 (as \\"Albernaw\\") in a contract documenting the sale of Olbernhau to the patritian Caspar von Berbisdorf. Ore mining started in 1511. In the course of the Protestant reformation Olbernhau became a parish in 1539. A school is mentioned for the first time in 1556. The solidly built church was consecrated in 1590. About 1684 the industrial art of gunsmithing was introduced in Olbernhau. In 1690, Olbernhau's first barrel forge was erected in the Rungstock valley, and in 1708 the gun manufactory delivered 12,000 guns to the Saxonian Army. In 1815, a gunpowder mill was founded, which was partly destroyed by explosions in the years 1835, 1850 and 1865. The last gun left the Olbernhau factory in 1854. The launch of the Pockau-Lengefeld‚ÄìNeuhausen railway (also known as the Fl√∂hatalbahn‚ÄîFl√∂ha Valley Railway) in May 1875 linked Olbernhau to the railway network. A Kindergarten was built in 1878. In the 1880es, Olbernhau gained a hospital, gasworks and gas street lights, and in 1892 Saxony's very first electric power station began operation in Olbernhau. From 1895, steam trains ran on the section of line between Olbernhau and Neuhausen. On 1 January 1902 Olbernhau received town privileges. In 1906, the beautiful art deco Concert and Ball Hall \\"Tivoli\\" was inaugurated. A public swimming bath opened in 1930. In 2002, one of the worst Fl√∂ha floods in history destroyed parts of the town centre and many houses on the river's banks. Thanks to many private donations from all over Germany, most of the enormous damages (amounting to several million Euros) was repaired within one year.  Tourism  Olbernhau is a popular tourist destination. Among the town's major sights are: * the Copper Hammer Mill \\"Althammer\\" on which the Russian tzar Peter the Great once rode * the open-air museum \\"Saigerh√ºtte\\" (founded in 1493, ore processing technology + tiny workmen's houses) * the museum, located in a former manor, offering a wide range of information about local traditions * the \\"Tanz- und Ballhaus Tivoli\\", a ballroom with beautiful Art Deco glass window * the pittoresque Oberneusch√∂nberg church (consecrated in 1695). Snuggled in the beautiful Fl√∂ha Valley with its six sub-valleys, Olbernhau offers scenic views and attractive paths for hiking and winter sports.

The film is an unofficial sequel to the 1975's Wehshi Jatt, starring Sultan Rahi as Maula Jatt and Mustafa Qureshi as his arch-rival Noori Natt,Maula Jatt (1979 film) on Motion Pictures Archive of Pakistan (mpaop.org) website Retrieved 6 June 2019 two of the most iconic characters in Pakistani cinema.https://pakistanicinema.net/2019/05/17/9-most-iconic-films-in-the- history-of-pakistani-cinema/ This movie belongs to a genre which represents the rural culture of Pakistani central Punjab. Its success set the trend of action films being popular in Pakistan and cemented Sultan Rahi as Lollywood's main hero. The film was inspired by Ahmed Nadeem Qasmi's short story \\"Gandasa\\" which described the culture of Gujranwala's rural areas. An unofficial sequel titled Jatt in London, also directed by the Yunus Malik, was released in 1981. Plot Following the settlement of Maula's family feud, Maula has renounced violence and is in charge of administering the peace of his village and its surrounding villages. The film begins with Maakha Natt chasing a girl. She asks for help but as soon as people hear that she is being pursued by Maakha, the brother of Noori Natt, they ask her to leave and not share her misfortune with them. She arrives in Maula's village and asks for help. Maula's Bhabi Daani calls Maula Jatt. Maula Jatt arrives and advises Maakha. When Maakha disagrees with Maula, his friend Moodha beats up Maakha and leaves a scar after kicking him on the nose. Maula decrees that if Maakha wants to avoid the fate of being killed by his 'Gandasa', he should marry the girl whom he has dishonoured and marry his sister off to her brother. As girl has no family, so Maula orders Maakha to marry his sister to Moodha. When Makha returns home to plot his revenge, his sister Daaro incensed upon hearing what he has agreed to, kills him. The Natt clan now try to avenge the humiliation that Maula Jatt has caused them while Maula Jatt tries to ensure that his decision is enforced and justice is done. When Noori Natt gets out of jail, he tells jailor that he has ran out of competition and now he wants a worthy opponent. On jailor's advice he pays a visit to Malik Haku. Haku doesn't tell Noori the name of his old rival and warns him not to get in his way if he ever finds out about him. On returning home, he gets to know the whole incident. Noori starts a quest to find Maula. Noori finally arrives in Maula's village, but instead he gets Moodha. When Moodha tells Noori that it was he who left a scar on his brother's nose, Noori beats him up badly and breaks his leg. Maula returns and finds a brocken legged Moodha, he then swears to take Noori's leg. Maula and Noori finally face off but police stop them from killing each other. Later on, Maula and Noori get together for a final clash, in which Maula overpowers Noori. Just as he is about to deliver the final blow, Daaro, comes to the rescue and requests Maula to spare Noori and considering that Maula had called her his sister. Maula agrees but Noori amputates his own leg so Maula's revenge is completed. The film ends with Daaro agreeing to marry Moodha and their rivalry resolved forever.

Over the years, the movie has been able to attain cult status. It spawned a number of sequels, becoming the first-ever successful unofficial franchise for a Lollywood title. Maula Jat's success spawned Maula Jat tey Noorie Nut as well as Maula Jat in London and continues to influence popular culture.It was also remade in Hindi as Jeene Nahi Doonga. Productions such as the 2002 play Jatt and Bond use Maula Jatt as their \\"inspiration\\". Now Pakistan's highest-grossing film Waar (2013) director Bilal Lashari has said that he is going to make official remake of Maula Jatt (1979). Banning of the movie by the government It is said that this film was banned because of violence, but later this ban was lifted. Soundtracks The songs were composed by Master Inayat Hussain. These were sung by some very popular singers: Noor Jehan, Mehnaz, Inayat Hussain Bhatti, Alam Lohar, Shaukat Ali and Ghulam Ali. The soundtrack consisted of the following songs: *Nashe diye botlay, na aini att chukk ni... Inayat Hussain Bhatti *Jhanjhar kare teinu pyar we, main mar gayi Mehnaz *Rowe maan te gharoor, ajj hasse majboor Noor Jehan *Dildar mere pyar kolun bach ke te kithe Noor Jehan *A te wela aap dasse ga, kon maarda ae maidan pehle halle Alam Lohar, Shaukat Ali and others (a Punjabi bhangra song)  Remake  In December 2013, Bilal Lashari, the director of highly successful film Waar (2013) announced that he will be directing the remake of Maula Jatt (1979) titled The Legend of Maula Jatt. On the remake he commented, \\"My version of Maula Jatt will be a visual epic, with less dialogue and many captivating moments. It will be a dark but stylised take on Pakistan‚Äôs original film genre.\\" The Legend of Maula Jatt is set to release in 2019. References Further reading *Ayres, Alyssa. 2009. Speaking Like a State.

Indications *Screening for malignancy in women with greater than 20% lifetime risk of breast cancer. *Evaluate breast implants for rupture. *Screening the opposite side breast for malignancy in women with known one sided breast malignancy. *Extent of disease and the presence of multifocality and multicentricity in patients with invasive carcinoma and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). *Evaluate response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Comparison to other technologies The available literature suggests that the sensitivity of contrast-enhanced breast MRI in detection of cancer is considerably higher than that of either radiographic mammography or ultrasound and is generally reported to be in excess of 94%. The specificity (the confidence that a lesion is cancerous and not a false positive) is only fair ('modest'), (or 37‚Äì97%) thus a positive finding by MRI should not be interpreted as a definitive diagnosis. The reports of 4,271 breast MRIs from eight large scale clinical trials were reviewed in 2006. Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis  The systemic disease nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) resembles scleromyxedema and to some extent scleroderma. It may occur months after contrast has been injected. Patients with poorer kidney function are more at risk for NSF, with dialysis patients being more at risk than patients with chronic kidney disease. After several years of controversy during which up to 100 Danish patients have been gadolinium poisoned (and some died) after use of the contrast agent Omniscan, it was admitted by the Norwegian medical company Nycomed that they were aware of some dangers of using gadolinium-based agents for their product. At present, NSF has been linked to the use of four gadolinium-containing MRI contrast agents.

The appellation covers almost of vineyards. AOC zone Monbazillac vineyards in the autumn The AOC of Monbazillac was first established in 1936, but the area has a long history of sweet wine production. Only wine made from grapes grown in Monbazillac that are affected by the \\"noble rot\\" (Botrytis cinerea) can be sold under the Monbazillac designation. (Dry white wines from the same area are sold as Bergerac sec.) The grape varieties S√©millon, Sauvignon blanc and Muscadelle are used for Monbazillac, and the permitted base yield is 40 hectoliter per hectare, although actual yields are lower for many producers. Wines Monbazillac wines are broadly similar to Sauternes, but a difference is that Monbazillac often has a significantly higher proportion of Muscadelle in the blend, which can lead to slightly different aromas. While Monbazillac in former times could be a simpler semi-sweet wine, the style in more recent years has been that of a fully botrytized wine, since 1993 no mechanical harvesting is allowed and harvesting in several tries is required.

It is one of several advocacy and public relations groups founded by Richard Berman, whose Washington, D.C.-based public affairs firm, Berman and Company, specializes in research, communications and advertising. The Washington Post describes CUF as \\"part of a constellation of nonprofit groups Berman created to carry out corporate messages.\\" CUF has commissioned studies about workers and unionization and has been a key supporter of legislation aimed at curbing the influence of unions, such as the Employee Rights Act, while also lobbying against union-backed legislation like the Employee Free Choice Act. It has placed advertisements around the US that have been critical of unions. Its representatives have appeared on major broadcast and cable channels to discuss labor issues, and have written commentaries in leading newspapers and on news and opinion websites. In recent years, CUF has made a major point of the decline in union membership and the waning enthusiasm of union members for organized representation. CUF has been especially critical of teachers' unions, which in response have mounted campaigns to counter CUF's messaging. Advertisements CUF was launched in February 2006 via full-page advertisements in major U.S. newspapers, including The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal. In May 2006, the organization aired its first television advertisement. The 30-second spot, running on Fox News Channel and local markets, featured \\"actors posing as workers\\" saying \\"what they 'love' about unions\\", like paying dues, union leaders' \\"fat-cat lifestyles\\" and discrimination against minorities. The advertising campaign cost US$3 million, raised \\"from companies, foundations and individuals that Mr. Berman won't identify\\". Another TV advertisement (aired on CNN and other stations) shows actors posing as large, burly \\"union leaders\\" muscling their way into a worker's home and \\"intimidating\\" him into joining the union. the labor and economics professor Harley Shaiken said the effort \\"to create an antiunion atmosphere\\" more generally, as opposed to business-funded advertising against a particular union organizing drive or strike, \\"is a new wrinkle\\". An AFL-CIO spokesperson called the advertisement's accusations \\"unfounded and outrageous\\". In August 2006, the CUF ran a series of advertisements in Montana, Oregon, Michigan and Nevada attacking public employee unions. It appears that this may have been connected with ballot initiatives in those states proposing public spending caps. The CUF ran an ad in 2008 noting that the Service Employees International Union had been the largest contributor to the 2006 gubernatorial campaign of corrupt Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who, after his election, had signed the state's first- ever contract with the SIEU. The ad also noted the SEIU's donations to Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign and its ties to ACORN. Database The CUF describes itself as having ‚Äúcompiled the single most comprehensive database of information about labor unions in the United States. The database contains more than 100 million facts, ranging from basic union finances and leader salaries, to political operations, to strikes and unfair labor practices, and much more. The data comes from various local, state, and federal government agencies that track labor union operations.‚Äù Among the material available at the website is information about various unions' finances, political and lobbying activity, and criminal history. Websites A page on the CUF website explains how to decertify a union, a process that workers can opt for if they ‚Äúno longer want a union to represent them ‚Äî whether it's because the union is undemocratic, corrupt, violent, or just plain inept.‚Äù The website also provides information about the assets, number of employees, and number of members of several dozen U.S. unions, including the Teamsters, AFL-CIO, Writers Guild West, and United Auto Workers. =Laborpains.org= In addition, CUF publishes a blog at laborpains.org that discusses news developments involving unions around the U.S. and labor-related legislation. In January 2015, for example, the blog covered the indictment of ten people affiliated with Ironworkers Local Union 401 (Philadelphia) in connection with ‚ÄúRICO crimes‚Äù including the ‚Äúburning of a Quaker meetinghouse being built by a non- union contractor,‚Äù the arrest of a union official on charges of physically assaulting New York police officers, an unacknowledged change in policy by the Center for Media and Democracy in regard to accepting union donations, and the ‚Äúradical path‚Äù taken by the Detroit teachers' union. = Other websites = CUF has created a number of websites that describe particular unions in negative terms including: * teachersunionexposed.com * seiuexposed.com * subwayscam.com * workercenters.com Media Representatives of the CUF have discussed issues on Fox Business, CNN, CNBC, and other cable news networks. =Unions' political activism= An NBC News story about the high level of union involvement in the 2012 election campaign cited Justin Wilson of the CUF, who said that in a time when the labor movement is shrinking, ‚Äúthe unions are working overtime to try to maintain a degree of relevancy inside the Democratic Party.‚Äù Although as a rule ‚Äúpolitical power folks try to downplay their role in an election,‚Äù the unions, this time around, ‚Äúdecided that they wanted to telegraph to the administration that they spend much more than the administration probably knew.‚Äù Action on legislation =Employee Free Choice Act= The Center for Union Facts was active in fighting the passage of the Employee Free Choice Act, which would let workers decide on unionization by signing cards, without their employers' knowledge, instead of by casting secret ballots. =Employee Rights Act= CUF pledged in December 2011 to spend $10 million promoting the so-called Employee Rights Act sponsored by Utah Senator Orrin Hatch and South Carolina Congressman Tim Scott. The ERA‚Äôs provisions, wrote In These Times, ‚Äúare an anti-union wish list, including restricting 'non-representation' spending by unions, banning any union recognition process other than an NLRB election, and requiring members to vote every three years on whether to eliminate their union.‚Äù In an op-ed that appeared in The Washington Times in August 2012, Berman championed the Employee Rights Act, which, he noted, ‚Äúextends guarantees to union members in the private sector to decide whether their dues money is spent for political purposes, otherwise known as 'paycheck protection.'‚Äù He also noted that union leaders had ‚Äúpartially boycott[ed] the Democratic National Convention,‚Äù angered over the decision to hold it in North Carolina, ‚Äúa right-to-work state that is proudly the least unionized in the country.‚Äù =Scott Walker recall effort= CUF played a role in supporting Wisconsin governor Scott Walker against the unsuccessful 2012 effort to recall him over the issue of public- employee unions. A CUF spokesperson said in early March that it was spending ‚Äújust over a million dollars‚Äù on running TV ads in Wisconsin, and ‚Äúmay do more in the coming weeks.‚Äù After the controversy over Walker, Berman exposed an internal Wisconsin Education Association Council document instructing teachers in the ‚Äúdo's‚Äù and ‚Äúdon't's‚Äù of winning public sympathy. Teachers' unions The CUF runs a website called AFTFacts.com, which seeks to expose and counter teachers' unions' efforts to block reform and to prevent the firing of bad teachers. The website also features statistics from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. In 2008, the CUF held a nationwide contest for the Ten Worst Union-Protected Teachers in America. Americans aged 13 and older were invited to nominate candidates. Over 600 nominations were received, and ten winners chosen, each of whom ‚Äúwas offered $10,000 to quit the profession forever.‚Äù None took CUF up on its offer, and so the winners' names were not revealed, although CUF did publish details about them: one had been jailed for waving a gun at a fast-food waitress, another was a sexual molester, a third ‚Äúhad sex with two of her male teen students.‚Äù The goal of the contest ‚Äúwas to illustrate how difficult unions have made it to get rid of bad teachers.‚Äù In August 2010, the CUF ran an ad in the Washington, D.C., area about the Washington Teachers' Union (WTU). ‚ÄúD.C.'s teachers union has failed our kids, played politics and now is threatening to file a lawsuit to block recent progress,‚Äù said the ad's voice-over. Sarah Longwell of the CUF said the ad campaign had been launched in response to recent threats by the WTU to sue to prevent the firing of bad teachers. ‚ÄúAs soon as we saw that they were threatening to file a lawsuit, we thought a response was necessary,‚Äù Longwell said. The Washington Post ran an article on September 24, 2014, headlined ‚ÄúCenter for Union Facts says Randi Weingarten is ruining nation‚Äôs schools.‚Äù The article, by Lyndsey Layton, cited a mailing by CUF in which Berman spoke of the ‚Äúterrible impact‚Äù that Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, had had ‚Äúon America‚Äôs educational system.‚Äù The mailing called Weingarten ‚Äúa vicious individual‚Äù who was ‚Äúon a crusade to stymie school reform and protect the jobs of incompetent teachers ‚Äî the bad apples that drain so much of our tax resources and sabotage the efforts of parents and caring teachers.‚Äù The Washington Times article The Washington Times published an article in 2012 about Berman and CUF, noting Berman's desire to ‚Äúhave a regular vote‚Äù to determine whether union members, 90 percent of whom never had a chance to vote for or against organizing, actually want to be union members. CUF supported the Employee Rights Act, which ‚Äúwould require workers to reauthorize their unions every three years. With a vote, they could move forward with the union, disband it or form a new one.‚Äù Berman argued: ‚ÄúIf a congressman has to stand for re-election every two years and the president every four years, why should the unions be basically given lifetime status in that workforce?‚Äù His larger goal, said the times, was to change ‚Äúthe cultural mindset toward the labor movement in America.‚Äù =Chicago Tribune ad= The Chicago Tribune refused in August 2012 to run an ad by the CUF on the grounds that it had ‚Äúracial undertones.‚Äù The ad featured a famous image of George Wallace blocking a door at the University of Alabama, and said that teachers unions now, like Wallace back then, are blocking the door to real school reform. Berman said that ‚Äúthe message of the ad has nothing to do with race-- only with the efforts of teachers unions to block students from getting a good education.‚Äù In an op-ed that appeared in The Wall Street Journal on February 25, 2013, Berman wrote that many labor unions supported a minimum-wage hike because those unions ‚Äúpeg their base-line wages to the minimum wage‚Äù or have job contracts stipulating that ‚Äúfollowing a minimum-wage increase, the union and the employer reopen wage talks.‚Äù He added that such hikes also ‚Äúrestrict the ability of businesses to hire low-skill workers who might gladly work for lower wages in order to gain experience,‚Äù thus preventing ‚Äúcompetition from workers who might threaten union jobs.‚Äù He cited a 2004 study showing that ‚Äúlower-wage union workers typically see a boost in employment and earned income following a mandated wage hike,‚Äù even as nonunion minimum-wage workers experience a ‚Äúcorresponding drop in jobs and earned income.‚Äù Decline in union membership A Detroit News editorial published on January 30, 2015, attributed the widespread decline in U.S. union membership in large part to ‚Äúthe quality of union services‚Äù and cited the CUF's view that unions are ‚Äúused to monopoly status and now they have to deal with competition.‚Äù The editorial also expressed agreement with CUF's argument that ‚Äúright to work doesn't mean unions have to throw up their hands in despair,‚Äù as demonstrated by ‚Äúeffective unions in right-to-work states like Texas and Virginia,‚Äù which ‚Äúhave retooled to focus more on member concerns and less on ideological and political battles.‚Äù In a February 2015 op-ed, Berman dismissed the notion that labor unions were undergoing a renaissance, stating that they were, rather, experiencing ‚Äúa temporary boost thanks to a Labor Board that‚Äôs operating as the legal wing of the AFL-CIO,‚Äù even as worker interest in unionization was at a historic low. ‚ÄúThough unions refuse to acknowledge it,‚Äù he wrote, ‚Äúthe reality is that employees are rejecting them because they‚Äôre still peddling the same industrial warfare rhetoric to a workforce for whom it‚Äôs no longer relevant. It‚Äôs as if Kodak was still trying to sell 35mm cameras in an age of smart phones ‚Äî they might have been popular and even necessary at one point, but the world has moved on.‚Äù He also cited ‚Äúthe sizable (and growing) political disconnect between many current union members and their leaderships: While roughly 40 percent of union members vote Republican, up to 99 percent of union dues used to support ideological organizations are given to Democrat- aligned left-wing groups.‚Äù Criticism of CUF The Chicago Tribune ran a story on the Ten Worst Teachers campaign, in which it quoted Berman as saying he wanted to ‚Äújump-start a conversation‚Äù about the fact that many children ‚Äúcan't read or do math and are well behind in science‚Äù and that many teachers ‚Äúsay their colleagues are not competent to teach kids,‚Äù the teachers' unions responded by calling him ‚Äúa paid attack dog who won't disclose the sources of funding for his work.‚Äù Chuck Porcari of the American Federation of Teachers said: ‚Äú[Berman] tries to make a splash, then disappears into the ether until someone writes him a check....Teachers and the public deserve to know who's bankrolling this effort. Who's paying to attack teachers?‚Äù Similarly, AFT president Randi Weingarten, in response to CUF's above-cited criticism of her in 2014, said Berman ‚Äúwon‚Äôt disclose who is funding his efforts.‚Äù After the CUF ran an ad during the 2012 Super Bowl in which it was stated that \\"Only ten percent of people in unions today actually voted to join the union,\\" Glenn Kessler, author of the ‚ÄúFact Checker‚Äù column in The Washington Post, called this a ‚Äúnonsense fact,\\" given that most employees of unionized companies joined those firms after the firms were unionized and have never had a chance to vote on that status. Mark Hemingway of the conservative Weekly Standard rejected this view, noting Kessler's acknowledgment that CUF's charge ‚Äúmay be technically correct.\\" Finances =Funding= In 2006, Berman said that he had raised about $2.5 million \\"from companies, trade organizations and individuals\\", whom he declined to identify. Sarah Longwell, a CUF spokeswoman, said that \\"The reason we don't disclose supporters is because unions have a long history of targeting anyone who opposes them, whether it be in a threatening way or by lodging campaigns against them.\\" Longwell is also associated with the PETA Kills Animals campaign, is listed as director of communications for the Center for Consumer Freedom, Managing Director of the American Beverage Institute, and a spokeswoman for the Indoor Tanning Association,Increase in melanoma skin cancer blamed on tanning all run by Berman & Co. Retailer Wal-Mart has denied funding the group, but has said that it has a relationship in which it exchanges union information with Berman. = Expenses = Charity Navigator has voiced concern about the substantial share of CUF expenses that go to Berman and Company, Richard Berman's PR firm. Charity Navigator stated that it finds \\"the practice of a charity contracting for management services with a business owned by that charity's CEO atypical\\" and noted that the practice continued in fiscal years 2011 through 2014.

Cortez co-composed it with noted celebrity photographer James J. Kriegsmann and frequent collaborator Kurt Wood. A significant portion of the tune bears a strong resemblance to the traditional \\"Shortnin' Bread\\" tune. The record topped the Billboard Hot 100 on 11 May 1959 and also reached #5 on Billboard's R&B; chart. The song originally featured lyrics and was intended to be sung accompanied by a piano and an organ. Cortez recorded a vocal for it but was unhappy with the result. He spotted an organ (a Hammond B3) in the studio and decided to play the song's melody on it. He also brought in studio drummer, Gary Hammond, to provide percussion. The guitar solo is by session musician Wild Jimmy Spruill. Hearing an organ on a rock or R&B; song at the time was unusual, but Cortez helped popularize its use outside of the jazz field. The song was Cortez' second single for Clock Records, a New York indie launched in 1958. Lowell Music's 'Clock' was located at 1619 Broadway. Doug Moody handled sales & promotion. The next week, the Hot 100's #1 was Wilbert Harrison's cover of \\"Kansas City\\" -- which also included Spruill's guitar.

He was imprisoned several times for his controversial beliefs, and lived in exile in Spain, France and England. His sermons and writings presented revisionist theological and historical opinions that supported republicanism. Mier worked with Francisco Javier Mina during the Mexican War of Independence and, as a deputy in independent Mexico's constituent Congress, opposed Agust√≠n de Iturbide's claim to imperial rule. He is honored for his role in Mexican independence. Education Mier was born in Monterrey, Nuevo Le√≥n, in the colony of New Spain (in modern-day Mexico). He was a descendant of the Dukes of Granada and conquistadors of Nuevo Le√≥n. At the age of 16, he entered the Dominican Order in Mexico City. He studied philosophy and theology in the College of Porta Coeli, and was ordained a priest. By the age of 27, he had earned his doctorate and was a noted preacher. The sermon On December 12, 1794, during the commemorations of the Virgin of Guadalupe apparition, in the presence of Viceroy Miguel de la Gr√∫a Talamanca y Branciforte, marqu√©s de Branciforte, Archbishop Manuel Oma√±a y Sotomayor and the members of the Audiencia of New Spain, Mier preached a sermon affirming that the apparitions of the Virgin of Guadalupe had happened 1750 years before, and not in 1531. He argued that the original painting of Our Lady of Guadalupe was on the cloak of Saint Thomas the Apostle, who had preached in the Americas long before Spanish conquest, and this had been re-discovered by Juan Diego. This sermon, with its bold revision of Mexican history and identity, was seen as a provocation. Our Lady of Guadalupe represented an intense and highly localized religious sensibility that Creole leaders, such as Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, would later use in their opposition to Spanish rule as a symbol of Mexico. In exile The sermon initially drew no attention but one week later, Archbishop Nu√±ez de Haro condemned Mier to 10 years' exile in the convent of Las Caldas del Besaya in Cantabria, Spain; a perpetual ban from teaching, preaching, or hearing confessions; and the loss of his doctoral degree. In 1796, he was granted permission to present his case to the Council of the Indies. However, on his return from the Council, he took the wrong road and was arrested again. This time, he was confined to the Franciscan convent in Burgos. In 1801, he escaped and took refuge in Bayonne, France. From Bayonne, he passed to Bordeaux and later to Paris. There he was interpreter for the rich Peruvian Jos√© Sarea, Count of Gij√≥n. Together with Sim√≥n Rodr√≠guez, Sim√≥n Bol√≠var's former teacher, he opened an academy in Paris to teach Spanish and to translate the Atala of Fran√ßois-Ren√© de Chateaubriand. (The Atala was set in Louisiana, with an Indian heroine.) Mier also wrote a dissertation against Constantin-Fran√ßois de Chasseboeuf, comte de Volney. In Paris, he came to know Chateaubriand; Lucas Alam√°n, then traveling as a student but later an important conservative politician in Mexico; Baron Alexander von Humboldt; and the Duke of Montmorency. In 1802, he left the Dominican Order and became a secular priest in Rome. When he returned to Madrid, he was again apprehended, this time for a satire he had written supporting Mexican independence. He was sent to the reformatory in Seville, from which he escaped in 1804. However, he was again arrested and returned to prison, where he spent three years. Then the Pope named him his domestic prelate, because he had converted two rabbis to Catholicism. In the war between France and Spain, he returned to Spain as military chaplain of the Volunteers of Valencia. He was present at many battles. In Belchite, he was taken prisoner by the French, but he was able to escape again (for the fifth time). He presented himself to General Blake, who recommended him to the Junta of Seville for his services. The Regency in C√°diz granted him an annual pension of 3,000 pesos. He moved to London, where he collaborated with Jos√© Mar√≠a Blanco on , a newspaper that supported the independence movements in Latin America. Expedition to New Spain In London, he met the Spanish revolutionary Francisco Javier Mina. Mina convinced him to join an expedition to New Spain to fight for its independence. They sailed for the United States on May 15, 1816, arriving in Norfolk, Virginia. Mier became friends with New Granadan exile Manuel Torres while Torres and other Spanish American agents helped organize Mina's expedition. The expedition left for New Spain in September, with disastrous results.Bowman, \\"Manuel Torres, a Spanish American Patriot\\", pp. 46‚Äì47 With the capture of the insurgents' fort at Soto la Marina on June 13, 1817, Mier was taken prisoner again, this time by the royalists. He was sent to the castle of San Carlos de Perote, thence to the dungeons of the Inquisition, and finally, in 1820, to Havana‚Äîwhere he escaped for a sixth time. =In Philadelphia= After this escape Mier returned to the United States again in June 1821, where lived in Manuel Torres' home in Philadelphia for three months along with Vicente Rocafuerte. Torres was now acting as the Colombian representative in the U.S. Though opposites in demeanor, Mier and Torres shared a fanatical anti- monarchism and had a close friendship.Bowman, \\"Manuel Torres in Philadelphia\\", p. 22 Through Torres, Mier contacted Colombian secretary of foreign relations Pedro Jos√© Gual to encourage him to send a diplomat to Mexico to counter the monarchist movement there, which he did the next year. Mier published several works while in Philadelphia, including a new edition of A Brief Account of the Destruction of the Indies and the anti-monarchical tract . Historian Charles Bowman suggested one pamphlet bearing Mier's name, , was uncharacteristically moderate for Mier‚Äîand was actually Torres' work.Bowman, \\"Manuel Torres in Philadelphia\\", pp. 18‚Äì20. The priest involved himself in a controversy surrounding St. Mary's Church, to which he was connected through Torres and merchant Richard W. Meade, another acquaintance. Mier defended the parish's excommunicated priest William Hogan, who had offended Bishop Henry Conwell. The trustees of St. Mary's defied the bishop by keeping Hogan as their priest. For Mier this was a matter of control over what the American form of the Church should be, and he became central to the debate. In a dialog of pamphlets \\"Servandus Mier\\" made vigorous assertions and was vigorously condemned; in one response he wrote, \\"It is true that I was a prisoner of the inquisition ... but I would think citizens in the United States and every civilized country would consider this honourable.\\"Warren, \\"Displaced 'Pan- Americans, pp. 352‚Äì354 He left the U.S. with a Colombian passport issued by Torres. Return to independent Mexico In February 1822, he returned to Mexico, at Veracruz, but was again taken prisoner and held at the castle of San Juan de Ul√∫a, still in control of the Spanish. The first Mexican constituent congress was able to secure his release; he became a deputy for Nuevo Le√≥n. He opposed the Mexican Empire under Agust√≠n de Iturbide, and was arrested again. He was imprisoned in the convent of Santo Domingo, but on January 1, 1823, he escaped again, for the seventh and last time. =As a member of the constituent congress= He was elected a deputy to the second constituent congress. On December 13, 1823, he delivered his famous speech (loosely translated, \\"Prophetic Discourse\\"). In this speech he argued for a centralized republic or in the event of a federal system being adopted, for its being in moderation. He was among the signers of the Act Constituting the Federation and of the Federal Constitution of the United States of Mexico. Mexico's first president, Guadalupe Victoria, invited him to live in the palace. Death and legacy In 1797, he wrote a letter where he confirms that the original date of the apparition of the Virgen de Guadalupe was celebrated by the Mexica natives on September 8 (of the Julian calendar), and by the Spanish on December 12.Mier, Cartas Sobre la Tradici√≥n de Ntra. Sra. de Guadalupe de M√©xico, 1797, p. 53 Nearing death, he invited his friends to a party to bid him farewell on November 16, 1827. He gave a speech justifying his life and opinions, and died on December 3, 1827. He was interred with great honor in the church of Santo Domingo in Mexico City. In 1861, his body was exhumed, together with 12 others. All the bodies were mummified. The mummies were exhibited under the claim they were victims of the Inquisition. Some of the mummies, including Mier's, were sold to an Italian who accepted the claim. His mummy was later shown in Brussels,The Memoirs of Fray Servando Teresa de Mier but what became of his remains after that is unknown. Mier's name is inscribed in letters of gold on the Wall of Honor of the Legislative Palace of San L√°zaro, the building that today houses the Chamber of Deputies in Mexico City. Writings Mier published many speeches, sermons and letters on religion and politics, including the following: *Cartas de un americano al espa√±ol (Letters from an American to the Spaniard), 1811‚Äì13. *Historia de la revoluci√≥n de Nueva Espa√±a (New Spain Revolution History), 2 vols., London: 1813. 2nd ed., Mexico City: 1922. *Apolog√≠a y relaciones de su vida bajo el t√≠tulo de Memorias (His life's apology and relations under memoirs title), Madrid: 1924. 2nd ed., Mexico City: 1946. *The Memoirs of Fray Servando Teresa de Mier (Library of Latin America), New York: Oxford University Press, 1998.

Publication history Satannish first appeared in Doctor Strange #174 and was created by Roy Thomas and Gene Colan. Fictional character biography Satannish is a very powerful extra-dimensional demon who has clashed with Doctor Strange. Satannish is known for granting mortals mystical power in exchange for their souls. He has been referred to as a creation and agent of Dormammu, and the father of Daimon Hellstrom and SatanaHellcat #3 (though the latter was later retconned). He has granted power to his cult, the Sons of Satannish, and struck a pact with the human sorcerer Lord Nekron, first encountering Doctor Strange during this affair.Doctor Strange #175 (December 1968) Satannish made a bargain with the human sorcerer Asmodeus, and then encountered the Defenders.Defenders Annual #2 Satannish also bargained with Baron Mordo during the \\"Faust Gambit\\" incident. He battled Mephisto in New York City, and briefly merged with Mephisto as a result of Doctor Strange's spell, revealing that the two demons had once been part of the same demonic energies.Doctor Strange Vol. 3 #5-8 Satannish was revealed to have hidden in the shadow of Mephista, daughter of Mephisto, in order to be taken into Mephisto's domain. There, he battled Mephisto, Mephista, and Doctor Strange, and was vanquished when Strange mystically connected Mephisto's and Satannish's life essences.Doctor Strange Vol. 3 #30 Satannish also once empowered the Night Shift.Avengers West Coast #76-79 (November 1991-February 1992) During the Secret Invasion storyline, Satannish is one of many dark powers imprisoned within Avalon. He is freed, along with all the others, when Pete Wisdom releases Merlin. After hearing the invading Skrulls boast that they will subjugate all magical beings, Satannish and the others kill the Skrull forces invading Avalon. He then offers Wisdom a boon, because the laws of magic insist that since Wisdom freed him, he must be repaid. Wisdom's request is \\"No more Skrulls\\" and Satannish honors this, using his powers to immediately kill every Skrull within Avalon and the United Kingdom. It is stated that Satannish's gift also means that any Skrull entering the United Kingdom immediately dies. While in Limbo, the recently resurrected Illyana Rasputin attacks various other demons looking for her soulsword and the original bloodstone amulet. This does not go unnoticed by him, Mephisto, Blackheart, Dormammu and Hela. When Mephisto asks why they should concern themselves with a minor annoyance, Satannish reveals he is quite impressed by Illyana.X-Infernus #1 Along with the other Lords of Hell, he passed judgement on Meggan; he was also amused to hear of the Duke of Hell, Doctor Plokta, being defeated.Captain Britain and MI:13 Annual During the Fear Itself storyline, Satannish appeared at the Devil's Advocacy where they talked about the Serpent's threat on Earth.Journey Into Mystery #627 In the pages of Avengers Undercover, Satannish appears as a member of the Shadow Council's Masters of Evil.Avengers Undercover #2 He is shown to have taken up residence in Bagalia's Hell Town district.Avengers Undercover #6 Powers and abilities Satannish is a demonic being of pure mystical energy, an embodiment of evil. The guise he most often employs around human sorcerers is that of a green-skinned, horned being with a second face in his stomach. Satannish is more akin to a supernatural force of nature than a being; as such he possesses \\"virtually unlimited\\" mystic power which can be used for a variety of effects,The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Master Edition including (but not limited to) inter-dimensional teleportation, manipulation of time, space, and matter, size transformations, casting bolts of mystic energy as destructive force, demonic possession, and physical strength and durability. The character's extent of power has been shown as equal to that of Mephisto.Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme #6-8 Satannish's ability to manifest in the dimension of Earth is, in some unknown way, limited by mystic factors and he frequently makes use of pawns native to Earth for his purposes. He also proved to be powerful enough to easily kill all the invading Skrulls who attempted to take Avalon's magic, which no other magical being in Avalon was able to do. In other media Satannish appears in the ending of Morrigan Aensland in the video game Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds. He is seen with Mephisto once again.

Plot introduction The Magician was published in 1971 and uses a violent incident in a high school to explore the wider issues of the time. It challenges the view that America is a classless society, and suggests racism was still prevalent in a decade that would see momentous change and decay. It is also a bitter critique of the justice system. Plot summary The story takes place in Ossining, New York. Ed Japhet is sixteen years old, and he is a bright, articulate boy. His father Terence teaches at his school. Ed's hobby is performing magic tricks, hence he is the \\"magician\\" of the title. One evening, Ed performs in front of the school on prom night, and aggravates school hoodlum Urek. Urek and his gang wait for Ed that night as he is about to go home with his dad and girlfriend. Urek attacks Ed and nearly kills him. Urek is eventually arrested on a charge of serious assault. At first this looks like a straightforward case. But Urek's dad happens to have a lawyer named Thomassy, who has made it his life's work to defend the low-lifes and the criminals of the area - and to get them off the hook. When Thomassy started his promising career as a lawyer he joined a firm with WASP surnames deliberately. They took him on and he became their most brilliant lawyer. However, the senior partner told him that as an Armenian he would never get promoted, at least while he was alive. Thomassy, stung, left and decided to follow a controversial path defending the most undesirable characters in society. He sends a birthday card every year to the old senior partner, as if to say, \\"You still alive?\\" As the story unfolds, the reader becomes uncomfortably aware of how an event can be interpreted by the law. It seems as though Ed has the advantage, he is talented, with a nice family and girlfriend, horribly attacked and nearly killed by a brute. But Thomassy manages to play the attack down: he discredits witnesses, intimidates others, and portrays Urek as acting only in self-defense. Now the reader is unsure who the actual \\"magician\\" of the title really is. Also involved is German Jewish Psychiatrist Koch, who has taken an interest in the case. His involvement gives the reader an opportunity to see Urek in more depth, as previously he is portrayed as a mindless, violent and inarticulate monster. Nothing can excuse what he has done, but Koch offers more insight as to why he did it. The book ends on a violent note. Urek walks free from the assault charge and proceeds to attack Ed again, this time by hiding in Terence's car and leaping out at Ed. Ed, newly trained in Karate, can now defend himself against the thuggish Urek, with devastating results. Terence Japhet knows exactly whom to call. The book is written in the third person narrative style, but interspersed at intervals throughout the story are \\"comments\\" provided by the key characters. They are written in the style of statements, but the reader never knows to whom they are directed. Major themes Although this is a story about high school kids, it represents America at the tail end of the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s. Racism appears rife, for example the treatment of Thomassy by the Law firm, but Thomassy himself is guilty of assessing whether a character has \\"a little bit of black somewhere along the line\\". Urek is described as Slavic in appearance. During the trial Thomassy calls him \\"Stanley\\", the prosecution calls him \\"Stanislaus\\" as if to emphasize his Slavic (and therefore undesirable) background. Terence Japhet thinks America is at war with itself. The book highlights too the attitudes of both the kids and the parents to their peers. Thomassy has a stool pigeon in the bowling alley because he knows there will be more trouble brewing there than at the golf club. Resentful working class fathers plot to destroy the garages of the more snooty dads. Small town America is seething with violence. But perhaps it is Thomassy who is the most compelling character, driven as he is by his need to win seemingly hopeless cases, letting the criminal element continue to disrupt the lives of the white middle class.

She is best known for her Top 10 hit version of \\"This Ole House\\", which despite chart competition from other versions of the same song, reached No. 4 in the UK chart. Early life She was born Philomena McGeachie Levy in Glasgow, Scotland. Her mother, Lily, was a talented dancer and her father, a song and dance man, and stage manager at the Glasgow Empire. Her godmother was Gracie Fields. Although her parents divorced when she was eighteen days old, she spent her entire childhood in and around the theatre, and wanted a career on the stage as a dancer. At first her mother was against her going into show business, so on leaving school she reluctantly agreed to train as a dressmaker, but her obsession with the theatre proved too powerful. In 1946, when still only fourteen, she ran away from home and joined the chorus of a touring show as one of \\"May Moxon's Young Ladies\\". Five years later she met Peter Elliott, who was part of a famous show business family called The Musical Elliotts. They developed an instant friendship and, due to their mutual love of dancing, decided on the formation of their own double act. As Phil and Peter Elliott, they successfully toured variety theatres as \\"The Debonair Dancers ‚Äì Four Educated Feet\\". They toured continuously throughout 1952 but, in 1953, were compelled to abandon their act when Peter was called up to do his national service with the Royal Air Force. Singing career During their time on the variety circuit they had met and become friends with singer Tony Brent, who had several hit records to his name. It was Brent who first recognised Levy's vocal potential and, acting on his advice, she decided to go solo in an effort to try to make a living as a singer while Elliott was away. Brent introduced her to his own manager, Don Agness, and he arranged for her to do a trial recording. Then in October 1953, after months of voice training and with her name changed to Billie Anthony, she recorded and released her first single for Columbia Records called \\"I'd Rather Take My Time\\" coupled with \\"Things Go Wrong\\". However it flopped. On 20 February 1954 Anthony and Elliott got married. However, the marriage did not last as they realised that their lives were no longer going in the same direction. By the time Elliott had completed his service in the RAF, Anthony had attained quite a high level of popularity as a vocalist, and Elliott decided that he wanted to explore other possibilities. Thus, they went their separate ways, and eventually divorced in the early 1960s. January 1954 saw the release of her second record, \\"Ricochet\\", followed in March by, \\"Bell Bottom Blues\\", both of which did well for Alma Cogan, Teresa Brewer and Joan Regan. Both sides of her next release \\"Cross Over The Bridge\\" and \\"I Get So Lonely\\" were recorded in April as duets with Tony Brent. Her sixth record release in October finally made the charts. The song was \\"This Ole House\\". Several other singers recorded the same song, including Alma Cogan and Joan Regan, but it was Rosemary Clooney who jockeyed with Anthony for the highest chart position. Clooney, in the charts for eighteen weeks, finally won the battle for the coveted number one spot both in the UK and America. Anthony reached No. 4 in the UK and remained in the UK Singles Chart for sixteen weeks. With the success of \\"This Ole House\\", she became known as \\"Britain's Blonde Bombshell\\". However, although she looked terrific, and had a good voice, no other record of hers ever made the UK chart, leaving her with the unfortunate one hit wonder tag. Her two follow up discs, \\"Teach Me Tonight\\" and \\"No More\\", went almost unnoticed. In January 1955, Stuart Hamblin, the American country & western singer-songwriter and composer of \\"This Ole House\\", came to London and, because he was so impressed with Anthony's version of his song, met her and presented her with the choice of another number from the material he had not yet published. She chose \\"Shake The Hand of a Stranger\\", a song that most people consider to be the best of her career. Recorded and released in April, it failed to take off. Every song she recorded after that seemed to eclipse the preceding one but, although they sold in sizeable numbers, songs such as \\"Boom Boom Boomerang\\", \\"Ten Little Kisses\\" and \\"The Old Piano Rag\\" did not take Anthony back to the charts. During 1955 she toured relentlessly up and down the country, and while appearing in a jazz concert at London's Royal Albert Hall, she was visited in her dressing room by Gene Kelly who had been in the audience. He discussed ideas regarding a part for her in a film musical, but his ideas eventually proved to be without foundation, and a movie part was never offered. 1955 to 1957 were Anthony's busiest years. Due to ever increasing demand her fan club was formed, and besides touring she made regular radio and television appearances, not only in Britain but also on the continent. The greater part of 1957 was spent on the road with Harry Secombe in the variety show 'Rocking The Town'. Anthony spent a hectic eight weeks in the early part of 1958, entertaining the forces in Cyprus, Malta and North Africa. After returning to London she spent the remainder of the year touring in variety, doing one-night stands and the occasional service camp dates. This similar routine of one-night stands continued throughout 1959, interrupted only by a summer season at the Great Yarmouth's Regal Theatre with Hughie Green's 'Double Your Money' show. By 1960 her recording career which had been slowly declining, ground to a halt after six and a half years. \\"A Handful of Gold\\" coupled with \\"Sure Fire Love\\", released in January 1960 were Anthony's last offerings. Later years She eventually withdrew from show business, and with the birth of her daughter Jessica in 1968, she decided to concentrate on full-time motherhood. From then on she chose to live quietly in the north London area of Hornsey. In early 1991, Anthony lost consciousness after suffering a series of strokes and never recovered. She died in London's Whittington Hospital, Archway, on 5 January 1991, at the age of fifty-eight.

Western culture has an idea of the importance of law which has its roots in both Roman law and canon law. As Western culture shares a Graeco-Roman Classical and Renaissance cultural influence, so do its legal systems. History The rediscovery of the Justinian Code in the early 10th century rekindled a passion for the discipline of law, initially shared across many of the re-forming boundaries between East and West. Eventually, it was only in the Catholic or Frankish west that Roman law became the foundation of all legal concepts and systems. Its influence can be traced to this day in all Western legal systems, although differing in kind and degree between the common (Anglo-American) and the civil (continental European) legal traditions. The study of canon law, the legal system of the Catholic Church, fused with that of Roman law to form the basis for the refounding of Western legal scholarship. Its principles of civil rights, equality before the law, equality of women, procedural justice, and democracy as the ideal form of society formed the basis of modern Western culture. Western legal culture Western culture, sometimes equated with Western civilization, Western lifestyle or European civilization, is a term used very broadly to a heritage of social norms, ethical values, traditional customs, belief systems, political systems, and specific artifacts and technologies that have some origin or association with Europe. Western legal culture is unified in the systematic reliance on legal constructs. Such constructs include corporations, contracts, estates, rights and powers to name a few. These concepts are not only nonexistent in primitive or traditional legal systems but they can also be predominately incapable of expression in those language systems which form the basis of such legal cultures.J.C. Smith (1968) 'The Unique Nature of the Concepts of Western Law' The Canadian Bar Review (46: 2 pp. 191-225) in Csaba Varga (ed) (1992) Comparative Legal Cultures (Dartmouth: England). As a general proposition, the concept of legal culture depends on language and symbols and any attempt to analyse non western legal systems in terms of categories of modern western law can result in distortion attributable to differences in language. So while legal constructs are unique to classical Roman, modern civil and common law cultures, legal concepts or primitive and archaic law get their meaning from sensed experience based on facts as opposed to theory or abstract. Legal culture therefore in the former group is influenced by academics, learned members of the profession and historically, philosophers. The latter group's culture is harnessed by beliefs, values and religion at a foundation level.

Following a referendum, in 1982 the Inuit opted to create a new community where they could preserve their traditional lifestyle in an area where fish and game were not threatened by hydro-electric development.

E. Hinton, published in 1979. It was adapted to the film in 1982, which starred Matt Dillon. The book (like Rumble Fish and That Was Then, This Is Now) takes place in the same universe as Hinton's first book The Outsiders, but in a rural town called Garyville, Oklahoma, a fictional suburb of Tulsa. Tex and his older brother Mason live by themselves while their father tours the rodeo circuit. Tex is blissfully happy with his life. He likes simple things and taking it easy. Mason, on the other hand, must step into a parental role when their father is gone for five months touring rodeos. Their mother is dead, so it is just the two of them fighting to meet their financial obligations. These boys' lives are slowly being disrupted. A film adaptation was released in 1982 by Disney starring Matt Dillon, Jim Metzler, and Meg Tilly.  Plot  The book opens with Tex McCormick, a 15-year-old who loves horses, and his brother Mason (Mace), living in a small town and Jamie the girl next door. Tex is growing up mostly with Mace in a small country home. Their mother died years before, and their father goes off for months at a time leaving Mace, a senior and a star basketball player, and Tex at home. At the start of the book, Tex comes home to find the two brothers' horses sold. Negrito, Tex's horse, was considered a friend to Tex. However Mace had to sell the horses to guarantee Tex and himself would have enough to eat through the winter. This action by Mace sets Tex against his brother for most of the book. But the McCormick brothers are not alone. Living in the significantly larger ranch house next door (about 0.5 mi (0.80 km)) are the Collinses which includes Mace‚Äôs best friend Bob, Tex's best friend Johnny, and the younger sister whom Tex loves, Jamie. The Collinses, however, are forbidden to see Mason and Tex because the patriarch of the Collins family, Cole, thinks they are a bad influence. After a turn of events involving Tex and Mace's father, Tex runs away to the city with a family friend and eventually learns that just living life and staying with his brother is the best thing for him.  Characters  Tex McCormick: A fifteen-year-old boy. He has long golden brown hair that is the same color as his eyes and a scar over his right eyebrow from where Mason hit him.

They get in trouble a lot. He has jumpy blue eyes and honey blonde hair. The Collins is a rich family, unlike Tex and Mason.

Cole Collins: Strong, Father of Blackie, Charlie, Robert (Bob), Johnny, and Jamie Collins; married to Mona Collins. Has his kids call him and Mona by their first names, which is something that Tex finds strange. He is the epitome of a strict and controlling father, one that isn't afraid to spank his kids. When Johnny and Tex get drunk at Charlie's party, he goes to where the McCormick's live and blames Tex for getting Johnny drunk. After they get in trouble at school for gluing caps on the typewriter keys, Mason and Cole have an argument, and Mason ends up winning Cole's respect for him. Bob Collins: Son of Cole. Brother of Jamie and Johnny. He is the Basketball star, second to Mason. Best friend of Mason. Pop McCormick: Father of Mason and always on the rodeo tour.

The newly created country soon started to organize its administration and several national organizations. Among them was the PZPN - Polski Zwiazek Pilki Noznej (Polish Football Association), which was created on 20 and 21 December 1919 in Warsaw. According to some sources, several officials representing around 30 Polish Football clubs were then present in Warsaw, but the list of them has been lost. Many Polish Football clubs were not founded in 1918, but much earlier. The first centers of Polish football were Krak√≥w and Lw√≥w, where a club were established as early as 1903 (Czarni Lw√≥w, the first Polish sports club). However, before 1918 it was impossible to create an independent, uniquely Polish Federation, because Poland as such did not exist. Humble beginnings The freshly created Federation began, in late 1919, to organize first, historic Championships of Poland. This was a difficult task as the country's provinces had for 123 years been divided and had belonged to three different countries. Even such seemingly easy detail, as direct rail communication between main Polish cities - Warsaw, Krak√≥w, Lw√≥w, Wilno and Pozna≈Ñ, was virtually non-existent. To make matters worse, Poland was from the very beginning involved with wars with almost all neighbors (see: Polish-Soviet War, Polish-Ukrainian War, Polish-Lithuanian War, Great Poland Uprising, Silesian Uprisings, Border conflicts between Poland and Czechoslovakia). Considering those conflicts, it is not surprising that in these hectic months sports were not a priority for both fledgling government and Polish nation. =Summer 1920 - unfinished championships= However, some time in spring of 1920, officials from PZPN decided to organize first championships of the country. Firstly, the Association divided Poland (whose borders were then not yet determined) into five football districts - Warsaw, Krak√≥w, Pozna≈Ñ, ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and Lw√≥w. It was planned that in early summer of 1920 teams from these districts would play regional qualifying games and then, five champions would play each other in a central tournament. The last games of championships were supposed to take place some time in late October 1920. While planning those games, PZPN's officials did not predict that in summer of 1920 Red Army would reach the outskirts of Warsaw, and Poland's fate would be in grave danger (Russian westward offensive of 1918-1919). So, under the circumstances, only Western districts of Krak√≥w and Pozna≈Ñ managed to carry out its games. Krak√≥w's champion was Cracovia, Pozna≈Ñ's - Warta Pozna≈Ñ. Needless to add - Polish National Team as such did not yet exist and no international friendlies took place. Crucial year - 1921 By mid-1921, the situation in Poland had calmed down. Conflicts were over (see: Peace of Riga) and the nation, while recuperating from all the wars, started to take interest in other activities, including sports. First, in early summer of 1921, teams from five districts played each other, in regional championships. The regional champions were: Cracovia Krak√≥w, ≈ÅKS ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Warta Pozna≈Ñ, Pogo≈Ñ Lw√≥w and Polonia Warszawa. =Cracovia Krak√≥w - first champions= During the final, nationwide games of the tournament, Cracovia proved to be the best, unbeaten team. Led by a legendary forward, J√≥zef Ka≈Çu≈ºa, Krak√≥w's squad won seven games, with only one draw (against Warta). The vice-champion of these historic games was Polonia Warszawa and in third place, Warta Pozna≈Ñ. National championships lasted for only two months, from late August until late October. The top scorer of the national games was Cracovia's forward J√≥zef Ka≈Çu≈ºa, with 9 goals. =First international friendly= In late 1921, the freshly created Polish National Team also played its first, historic, international friendly. On 18 December 1921 in Budapest, Poland lost to Hungary 0-1 (see: The first game: 18 December 1921. Hungary - Poland 1-0). Early 1920s Since 1922, Polish teams began regular games in championships of the country. In the years 1922-1926 the games were organized in the same fashion, as in 1921. First, regional games took place, then best teams would face each other in the national tournament. As Polish borders moved eastwards (Kresy Wschodnie) as well as westwards (Kresy Zachodnie), additional PZPN's districts were added. In 1922, in a nationwide tournament, 8 teams participated. Five of them were champions of the districts established back in 1920 (these teams were the same as in 1921), plus champions of three new districts - Upper Silesia (Ruch Wielkie Hajduki), Lublin (Wojskowy KS Lublin) and Wilno (Strzelec Wilno). Also, since 1922, Polish National Team started to play international games on regular basis. Back then, no FIFA World Cup existed, so the only way to prove side's quality were friendlies or Olympic Games. =National Championships 1922-1926 - dominance of Pogo≈Ñ Lw√≥w= Starting in 1922, Pogo≈Ñ Lw√≥w for four successive seasons was champion of Poland, with the exception of 1924. In this year, due to the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, no championships were organized. The reason for this was so that the National Team would be adequately prepared for its games in the Olympics. Pogo≈Ñ thus was the champion in the years 1922, 1923, 1925 and 1926. Lw√≥w's squad was unequaled in the country, with its leader in excellent athlete, Wac≈Çaw Kuchar, who in 1922 and 1926 was the top scorer of Poland. Another Pogo≈Ñ star was Mieczys≈Çaw Batsch - also a forward, who together with Kuchar and some other Lw√≥w's players regularly represented Polish National Team. Apart from Pogo≈Ñ, in 1922-1926 other important teams were: Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w, Warta Pozna≈Ñ, Polonia Warszawa, Cracovia. In 1925, another district was added to the nationwide games. This time it was Toru≈Ñ, with its champion, Toru≈Ñski KS. Thus, by 1927 there were 9 districts of PZPN - Warsaw, ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Pozna≈Ñ, Krak√≥w, Lw√≥w, Lublin, Wilno, Upper Silesia and Toru≈Ñ. Each of them sent its champion to the national tournament. =National Team 1922-1926 - First Victory= Back in December 1921, just after Hungary vs. Poland friendly, officials from both federations agreed that the next game would take place in Poland. As in early 1920s, Cracovia was regarded as the most influential club, the first international on Polish soil took place on Cracovia's stadium. The Hungarians supposedly were happy with this, as Krak√≥w is in southern Poland, quite close to Budapest. The game occurred on 14 May 1922. Polish football fans must have been in great anticipation of this event, because they filled up the stadium, with 16,000 of them showing up. Supporters intent on seeing this historic game came not only from Krak√≥w, but also from other parts of the country. They were disappointed - Poland lost to its renowned rival 0-3 but, according to some sources, white-reds did not deserve such harsh punishment. Two weeks later, Polish team went a long way to Stockholm, to face Sweden. This time, at the Olympic Stadium, with 16,000 spectators, Poland won the first game in its history. The Poles beat their opponents 2-1, with goals by J√≥zef Klotz (on a penalty kick) and J√≥zef Garbie≈Ñ. It must be mentioned, that in 1922 it took almost four days for the Poles to get by trains and ferry from Krak√≥w, via Warsaw, Berlin, Stralsund and Malm√∂, to the capital of Sweden. This victory, over an experienced Swedish side, was a turning point for the Poles. The National Team quickly took advantage of it, as more nations showed interest in facing white-reds. On 3 September 1922, in CernƒÉu≈£i, Poland tied 1-1 with Romania and on October 1, in Zagreb, Poles beat Yugoslavia 3-1, with two goals by J√≥zef Ka≈Çu≈ºa. In 1923, the first game occurred as late as 3 June. In Krak√≥w, the Poles lost 1-2 to Yugoslavia (goal by Ka≈Çu≈ºa). This goal is also significant - it was the first one scored on home turf. Fans had to wait for next match until 2 September, when in Lw√≥w, on the Czarni Lw√≥w's stadium, Poland tied 1-1 with Romania. Soon after, white-reds traveled north. On September 25 in Helsinki, Poland lost 3-5 to Finland, two days later, in Tallinn, the Poles beat Estonia 4-1. The last game in 1923 took place in Krak√≥w. On 1 November, the Poles tied 2-2 with Sweden. =Failure at the 1924 Olympic Games= In 1924, all efforts of PZPN were directed towards one aim - the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris. Due to this fact, games for national championships did not take place, and manager Adam Obruba≈Ñski was given a free hand in choosing players that would represent the nation in France. Obrubanski, after checking some 40 athletes, chose the roster and went to Stockholm, for the last pre-Olympic friendly. However, on 14 May 1924, Poland was routed by the Swedes 1-5 (goal by Mieczys≈Çaw Batsch). With the Games approaching, fans back in the country were uneasy and their worst predictions turned out right. Upon arriving at Paris, the Poles found out that they would face Hungary. The game, which took place on 26 May 1924 at Stade Bergeyre, was a disaster. The white-reds fought hard in the first half, which they lost 0-1. Alas, after the break, the Poles lost strength and went down by 0-5. The Olympic dream was over, with Uruguay becoming the champion. =After the Olympics, National Team until the end of 1926= In spite of defeat in Paris, Polish players, who for the first time had played in an international tournament, learned an important lesson. Also, Polish officials got acquainted with football officials from United States, who came to France with their team. So, on June 10 in Warsaw, Poland faced the Olympic Team of USA. This game was another letdown for home fans, as the hosts lost 2-3. For the rest of the period described (1924‚Äì1926), Poland rated poorly, occasionally winning some games against such teams as Estonia, Finland or Turkey, but also losing many, with Hungary, amateur team of Czechoslovakia or Sweden. The biggest success of these years was the routing of Finland 7-1 on 8 August 1926 in Pozna≈Ñ. Also, on 12 September 1926, Poland beat Turkey 6-1, this game taking place in Lw√≥w. However, those teams were regarded as somehow \\"second class\\". Facing tougher opponents, the Poles would most likely lose (like on 1 November 1925, in Krak√≥w, Poland - Sweden 2-6 or on 20 August 1926 in Budapest, Hungary - Poland 4-1). At the end of 1926, Poland went to Scandinavia. On October 3 in Stockholm, the Poles lost to Sweden 3-1 and a week later in Oslo, Poland beat Norway 4-3. Among players, who would represent the country, majority of them came from Krak√≥w's clubs, Cracovia and Wis≈Ça, Pogon Lw√≥w, Warta Pozna≈Ñ, Polonia Warszawa and ≈ÅKS ≈Å√≥d≈∫. This means that just like in the early 1920s, the same teams played key roles in Polish football. After Adam Obrubanski, Poland's managers were Tadeusz Kuchar and then Tadeusz Synowiec. The late 1920s and early 1930s 1927 brought a major change, as the Polish football League was created. The National Team's outlook did not change significantly, without any major achievements and international successes. =Creation of the Polish Football League= In December 1926 in Warsaw, representatives from several Polish clubs met each other. The purpose of this meeting was simple - to discuss the possibility of creating a Football League. It is unclear who came up with this idea (some say this was due to numerous changes, introduced at that time in Poland, after the May Coup). Obviously, a League was a much more practical solution than hitherto practised two-stage (regional and then central) games. To the dismay of clubs‚Äô officials, PZPN did not like the idea of the League and the Association wanted to thwart it. However, it turned out that virtually all but one Polish club supported the League and decided to create it, no matter what PZPN's representatives thought of it. In late February 1927, at the PZPN's meeting in Warsaw, its officials openly opposed the League, but the clubs, allegedly egged on by some generals from Polish Army (which, after May Coup of 1926, played a key role in all aspects of public life), would not obey. The creation of the League was announced on March 1, 1927. =Cracovia Krak√≥w= It has been mentioned that all clubs but one supported the League. The only opponent was Cracovia - a very influential and strong organization in Polish Football of the 1920s. Cracovia's boycott was because its director, Dr. Edward Cetnarowski, at the same time held the post of the director of PZPN. It must be mentioned that Cetnarowski was a personality known not only in Poland, but also in other countries. It was due to his efforts that in September 1923 his beloved club, Cracovia, went on a tour to Spain. The Krak√≥w side's results were impressive - a 1-1 tie with FC Barcelona and a 0-1 loss to Real Madrid. In October, also thanks to Cetnarowski, FC Sevilla came to Krak√≥w and lost 2-3 to Cracovia. =Early years of the League - dominance of Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w= The games of the first, historic League Championships started on April 3, 1927. All major teams (except for Cracovia) took part in it. This is the list of the teams (in the order given below in which the League finished in November 1927): *Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w *1. FC Katowice (German-minority team from Katowice) *Warta Pozna≈Ñ *Pogo≈Ñ Lw√≥w *Legia Warszawa *Klub Turystow ≈Å√≥d≈∫ *≈ÅKS ≈Å√≥d≈∫ *Polonia Warszawa *Czarni Lw√≥w *Toru≈Ñski KS Toru≈Ñ *Hasmonea Lw√≥w (Jewish- minority team from Lw√≥w) *Ruch Wielkie Hajduki *Warszawianka Warszawa *Jutrzenka Krak√≥w (Jewish-minority team from Krak√≥w, which finished last and was relegated) =Polish-German rivalry symbolized by Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w and 1.FC Katowice= In this first season of the League, the fight for the Championship was decided between two powerful teams - Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w and 1.FC Katowice. This rivalry was treated very seriously, not only by the two sides involved, but also by the whole nation. 1.FC was regarded as the team supported by German minority, while Wis≈Ça, at the end of this historic season, represented ambitions of all Poles. Some time in Autumn 1927 in Katowice, an ill-fated game between 1.FC and Wis≈Ça took place. The stakes were very high - the winner would become the Champion. Wis≈Ça won 2-0 in Katowice. =The League in the years 1928-1932= In 1928 Cracovia finally decided to enter the League, which was gladly accepted by all fans of Football. However, Championships were once again won by Wis≈Ça, with such excellent players as Henryk Reyman, Mieczyslaw Balcer and Jan Kotlarczyk. Warta Pozna≈Ñ was second and Legia Warszawa third. This was also the last year of 1.FC's dominance. The team finished fifth, to be relegated forever at the end of 1929 season. In 1929 yet another team (after Cracovia, Pogon Lw√≥w and Wis≈Ça) was added to the list of Champions of Poland. This time it was Warta Pozna≈Ñ, who finished one point ahead of Garbarnia Krak√≥w. However, after the last game, on December 1, 1929, it was Garbarnia Krak√≥w that was celebrating the Championship. Two weeks later, in mid-December, PZPN's officials changed the result of the Warta - Klub Turystow ≈Å√≥d≈∫ game. Originally, Warta lost 1-2, but due to a walk-over (it was decided that one of ≈Å√≥d≈∫'s players did not have all necessary documents), this was changed to 3-0 in favor of Pozna≈Ñ's side. As a result of the decision, Warta (with 33 points) became the Champion, Garbarnia finished second with 32 points and Klub Turystow was relegated. In 1930, Cracovia regained the Championship, (to repeat this success in 1932) and a year later another Krak√≥w side, Garbarnia, won the League. It is clear that the 1927-1932 period was marked by the dominance of teams from Krak√≥w. During this time, only once (Warta Pozna≈Ñ, 1929) the Championship was won by a side from a different city. The 1931 Champion, Garbarnia, was unique as this was the first time that the League had been won by a side whose all players had been bought from other teams. =National Team in 1927-1932= In 1927, due to conflict between PZPN and Polish football clubs about the creation of the League, only one international game took place. On June 19, in Bucharest, Poland tied 3-3 with Romania. The new manager, Tadeusz Synowiec, faced a big problem in this match. As most teams refused to send their players, he had to get support almost solely from Cracovia. Krak√≥w's side sent as many as 7 players, the remaining 4 came from Katowice's second-class clubs such as Pogo≈Ñ Katowice and Policyjny KS. Considering this, the tie with Romania was a good result. Polish fans had to wait for an international friendly for as long as a year. In June 1928 in Warsaw, Poland tied 3-3 with USA (the Americans came to Europe for Amsterdam's 1928 Summer Olympics, and accepted the offer. By then, the conflict between PZPN and clubs was over, so new manager Tadeusz Kuchar was able to try all the players he wanted. Poland were losing 2-3 until the 89th minute when they were awarded a penalty kick. None of the home players wanted to take the kick until eventually Zygmunt Steuermann, a forward from Jewish-minority team Hasmonea Lw√≥w, stepped forward and scored the equalising goal. On July 1, for the first time ever, the national team came to Katowice. Poland beat Sweden 2-1, with around 20,000 fans cheering the victory. To please Katowice's fans, Tadeusz Kuchar called up the two best players from 1. FC Katowice - forward Karol Kossok and a very talented defender Erich Heidenreich. The first one gladly accepted the offer and came out on the field, but Heidenreich wrote a letter to PZPN. The player stated that even though he was pleased and honored, he considered himself a German, thus would not play in a white-red jersey. Polish officials were not happy with this (Heidenreich was considered the best defender in the League), but had to comply with his decision. At the end of 1928, Poland for the first time faced its immediate neighbor and one of Football powerhouses - Czechoslovakia. In Prague, on October 27, white-reds lost 2-3. In the years 1929-1932 the national team was considered in Europe as a second-class side, which was proved by international authorities in 1929. In 1929-1930, an international competition, The Amateur Central European Cup took place. Poland was included in these games, together with the amateur teams of Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Austria. First, official teams of these nations played in the \\"real\\" Central European Cup. This was a clear sign that the European elite did not feel that playing such a weak opponent as Poland was useful. Evidence in support of this came in Budapest, when the Poles were routed 1-5 by the official Hungarian team. As games against amateur teams are not considered official by FIFA, for several months Poland did not play any official matches. The breakthrough came at the end of September 1930, in Stockholm. The white-reds beat Sweden 3-0, but the hopes of Polish fans, augmented by a 6-0 victory over Latvia (October 1930, Warsaw), faded away on June 14, 1931, also in Poland's capital. On this day, the hosts faced Czechoslovakia, one of the best teams in the world. The Poles were routed 0-4, and the Czechoslovaks scored their first goal as early as in the 30th second. At the end of the described period, in mid-October 1931, Poland traveled to Brussels, where they lost 1-2 to Belgium. Then, on October 25 in Pozna≈Ñ, the hosts beat Yugoslavia 6-3. This success was the last game of manager Stefan Loth (who died in summer of 1936). Starting in 1932, the national team was managed by former forward of Cracovia, J√≥zef Ka≈Çu≈ºa, who would lead it to its biggest successes and who would stay on this post until September 1939. 1932-1936 The dominance of two early centers of Polish Football - Krak√≥w and Lw√≥w, slowly came to an end. The new manager of the National Team, J√≥zef Ka≈Çu≈ºa, was a huge fan of teams and players from Polish Upper Silesia (see: Silesian Voivodeship (1920‚Äì1939)). Thus, more and more sportsmen from this region appeared in the national lineup, eventually dominating it. Also the League was subject to the reign of Ruch Chorz√≥w. This team won the Championships in the years 1933, 1934, 1935 and 1936. =The Polish Football League 1932-1936= As has been said, the early 1930s marked a decline of the dominance of Krak√≥w and Lw√≥w as centers of Polish Football. The point of gravity slowly moved towards the west - to the Polish part of Upper Silesia, which had belonged to Poland since 1921 (see: Silesian Uprisings). In 1932 the champion was Cracovia, but starting in 1933, Ruch Chorz√≥w (then: Ruch Wielkie Hajduki) completely dominated the league, being the champion for 4 times in a row. Ruch, with such excellent players as Teodor Peterek, Ernest Wilimowski and Gerard Wodarz was by far the best team in those years. For example, in 1934 it finished seven points ahead of second Cracovia. Other important teams of these years were: Cracovia Krak√≥w, Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w, Pogo≈Ñ Lw√≥w and Warta Pozna≈Ñ. In 1933 and 1934 there were 12 teams in the League. In 1935 this number was cut to 11 and in 1936 - to 10. Football officials did it on purpose - with fewer teams, the competition was supposed to be harder, which would attract fans to the stadiums. However, supporters‚Äô turnout was not impressive, with Ruch Chorz√≥w as the most popular team, both at home and away. In late 1935 (the league held its games in the spring-summer-fall system) fans were shocked to find that Cracovia, the legend of this sport, was relegated to the A-class. The Krak√≥w side's absence lasted for a year - it returned in 1937, to become the champion. =Early years of Ka≈Çu≈ºa as a manager= J√≥zef Ka≈Çu≈ºa was one of the best players of the 1910s and 1920s Polish Football. His career in Cracovia started in 1912 and ended in 1931. Then, Ka≈Çu≈ºa started another job - that of a manager. Firstly, for a short time in Legia Warszawa, then returned to Cracovia. Even though not born in Krak√≥w, he was a great admirer of this city, and there died in October 1944. Ka≈Çu≈ºa's post as a manager of the National Team was decided on 20‚Äì21 February 1932, during the General Meeting of PZPN. There, in the election, he beat the main rival, former star of Pogo≈Ñ Lw√≥w, Wac≈Çaw Kuchar. It must be mentioned that the post of the manager of the National Team of Poland was not well-paid in the 1930s. Clearly, Ka≈Çu≈ºa's significance was great; he was widely respected, but to support himself, he had to continue working as a teacher in Krak√≥w's high school. Back then, PZPN was not as rich as it is today. The manager was provided with some money to cover costs of travels and accommodation, but this was not regarded a regular salary. Football officials in Poland must have been pleased with Ka≈Çu≈ºa - unlike his predecessors, who would be rotated after just a few months, he held the seat firmly until the last days of interwar Poland (see: Invasion of Poland). =Ka≈Çu≈ºa's first games= Ka≈Çu≈ºa's debut as Polish coach could not have been better. The new trainer went with his team to Zagreb, to face an always-dangerous team of Yugoslavia. On May 29, 1932 Poland, quite unexpectedly, routed the rivals 3-0. Nobody was expecting this to happen and it was a shock. Then, on July 10 at Warsaw, the white-reds beat 2-0 Sweden and fans realized that under Ka≈Çu≈ºa, the national team can finally be put together and achieve some successes. 1932 ended with yet more achievements. On October 2, a so-called double match took place (such games were popular in 1930s European Football). The reserve Poland team beat 2-1 Latvia at Warsaw, and at the same hour the first lineup faced Romania in Bucharest. Romania (with several of its starters of Hungarian nationality from Transylvania) was regarded a very strong team. The Poles, however, overwhelmed it 5-0 and this was the biggest success of Polish Football so far. This game is significant also for another reason. In Polish lineup there were two newcomers from Upper Silesia - Ewald Urban and Gerard Wodarz. Both performed excellently, each scoring a goal. This meant that Ka≈Çu≈ºa started to notice the Upper Silesians, and after a few years players from there would totally dominate the national team. The remaining three goals were scored by Legia Warszawa's Jozef Nawrot. =FIFA World Cup 1934 - unsuccessful qualifier with Czechoslovakia= At the beginning of 1933 Polish fans, heady with successes, were full of high hopes and expectations. These feelings were blunted on June 4 at Warsaw, when white- reds were defeated 0-1 by Belgium. This was a huge setback and cold water on heads of some fans. The game against Belgium was yet another step towards \\"Silesiazation\\" of the national team. Apart from Urban and Wodarz, two more players from this region were fielded. These were Edmund Giemsa and Karol Dziwisz. All four were from Ruch Chorz√≥w. Fifth Silesian in the lineup was Karol Pazurek from Pogo≈Ñ Katowice. On September 10, 1933 Poland at Warsaw beat Yugoslavia 4-3, but attention of fans already turned on Czechoslovakia. To qualify to the 1934 FIFA World Cup, Poland had to beat its southern neighbors, whose team was regarded as one of the best in the world. The first leg occurred October 15 in Warsaw. The white-reds, after a fierce battle, lost 1-2 (Polish lone goal on a penalty by Legia Warszawa's Henryk Martyna). This was a huge disappointment, and facing the second leg in Prague, nobody believed in success. At the end of 1933, due to thaw of Polish-German relations, the team headed for Berlin. On December 3 the Germans won 1-0, with the goal in the 89th minute. All throughout winter and early spring of 1934, Football fans were waiting for game with Czechoslovakia, scheduled on April 15. However, just a few days before the match, Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs banned the team from traveling to Prague, due to tense situation between two neighbors. As a result, the Czechoslovaks qualified and during the World Cup in Italy proved their skills, becoming the runner-up. =1934-1936 Years marked by rising fame of Ernest Wilimowski= Soon after events of April 1934, the team traveled by train on a tournee to Scandinavia. From Katowice, via Berlin, they went to Copenhagen, where on May 21 the Poles lost 2-4 to Denmark. Two days later, at Stockholm, white-reds faced Sweden, also losing 2-4. These games are important for one reason. Match against Denmark was the debut of a 17-year-old Ernest Wilimowski. The young forward of Ruch Chorz√≥w was a rising star, which was proven in Stockholm, where \\"Ezi\\" scored a goal. The remaining games of the described period were not marked by any significant achievements. Poland lost several prestigious games (2-5 vs Germany in Warsaw, 1-4 vs. Jugoslavia in Belgrad, 1-4 vs. Romania in Bucharest or 2-5 vs. Austria in Wien). The team plunged into mediocrity, winning only 6-3 with Latvia and 1-0 with Austria (on October 6, 1935 at Warsaw, lone goal by Pogo≈Ñ Lw√≥w's Micha≈Ç Matyas). This game was the only notable success of the 1934 - early 1936 period. Wilimowski played in some of these matches, but the young player needed time to establish his position. 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin Olympic experiences of Polish football team were by 1936 few and far between. In 1920 Summer Olympics, at Antwerp, white-reds did not participate, due to Polish-Soviet War. In 1924 at Paris, Poland was routed 0-5 by Hungary. As a result of this failure, the team did not even bother itself to travel to the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. Then, 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles were too far away and too expensive for Polish football officials. Morale among both fans and officials was at the beginning of 1936 very low. Newspapers were urging PZPN to fire Ka≈Çu≈ºa, but eventually this did not happen, as the coach was strongly supported by representatives from Upper Silesia - the strongest and richest district of PZPN. Even though 1936 Olympics were to be held in the neighboring capital, not everyone in Poland favored the idea of National Team's participation in this event. Officials from both Krak√≥w and Lw√≥w rejected it, only to be convinced by an unexpected victory 2-0 over Belgium (February 16, 1936, Brussels). This was a good sign, which changed the general feelings. In mid-June 1936, after a long discussion, PZPN officially permitted the National Team to participate in the Games. Ka≈Çu≈ºa did not have time - he quickly organized a training camp in Warsaw, calling 36 players. After a while this number was cut down to 25 and then - to 18. Among them was Ernest Wilimowski, who was regarded by the manager as a key player, essential for his plans. A few weeks before the games, \\"Ezi\\" was disqualified for alleged excessive drinking and did not go to Berlin. This was a huge mistake of Polish officials. They recklessly got rid of a top forward, thus reducing Poland's chances for a medal. J√≥zef Ka≈Çu≈ºa had to agree with the decision, but obviously he was very unhappy. Without Wilimowski in the lineup, white-reds lost most of their firepower. =Games vs. Hungary, Great Britain and Austria= 1936 Summer Olympics was the second (after 1924 Summer Olympics) major international tournament in which the Poles participated. Considering this fact, it is understandable that both officials and players were nervous before stepping onto the field for the first game. The opponent was the amateur team of Hungary. On August 5 at Berlin's Post-Stadion the white-reds faced Hungary. The opponents, obeying the regulations, fielded their amateur players. With Poland, the situation was more complicated. Officially, there were not any football professionals in the country. All players worked somewhere on a daily basis, so as such they were amateurs. In some cases however, these jobs were just covers and all some athletes did was playing. Thus, Polish lineup consisted of its best players from top League teams. Also, it must be mentioned that games against Hungary, Great Britain and Austria are not considered by FIFA as official, so they simply do not count in any statistics. Poland won the first game with ease, beating the Hungarians 3-0 (two goals by Hubert Gad, one by Gerard Wodarz). Then, white- reds faced amateurs from Great Britain. This was a tougher opponent, but again - no players from English or Scottish professional teams were fielded. The only athlete who eventually turned pro was Bernard Joy, later representing Arsenal London. This game, which took place on August 8, was a show of two players - Gerard Wodarz (who scored 3 goals, with additional strikes by Hubert Gad and Ryszard Piec) and Joy, who netted twice. Poland won 5-4, but the match was very nail-biting. It is enough to say that at some point the Poles were winning 5-1, only then to let 3 goals. Fortunately, the British did not have enough time to tie. Then, on August 11, at Berlin Olympic Stadium, in the semifinal Poland faced amateur team of Austria. Stakes were high, as the winner would qualify to the final. Perhaps because of this, white-reds were nervous and did not play their part, losing 1-3 (lone goal by Hubert Gad). Huge crowd of 80,000 was very partisan, supporting Austria, which also was a disadvantage. Chance of Olympic gold was missed. =The match against Norway= After losing to Austria, the Poles had to content themselves with the game for the bronze medal. This time, for unknown reasons, Norway fielded its first lineup, so this match is regarded as an official international game. The angry Polish officials decided to punish some players, claiming they did not play hard enough against Austria, so the starting roster was much different. It did not help much, as morale in the team was very low. The white-reds scored the first goal (scored by Gerard Wodarz), then the opponents answered with two from Arne Brustad. Poland managed to tie (with Teodor Peterek scoring), only to let Brustad score his third goal of the day. Norway won 3-2 thus receiving bronze medals. 1936-1939: the last years of interwar Poland During the period described, the National Team slowly recovered from the Olympic failure, eventually managing to qualify for the 1938 FIFA World Cup (see: Poland at 1938 FIFA World Cup). In the last game of interwar Poland, the white-reds in Warsaw beat 4-2 Hungary (see: The Last Game (August 27, 1939)). This was the biggest success of Polish football in the years 1918-1939. According to some experts, had the Second World War not started, Poland would have achieved success in the planned 1942 FIFA World Cup, which was supposed to take place either in Brazil or Argentina. Manager J√≥zef Ka≈Çu≈ºa had gathered a group of excellent, prospective players, with Ernest Wilimowski as the top star. Ka≈Çu≈ºa had plans and vision; however, on September 1, 1939, it all changed forever. Poland ceased to exist, only to return to the map of Europe in 1945. By then, however, the situation was radically different. =Polish Football League 1936-1939= Ruch Chorz√≥w was still the dominant team, winning the Championships in 1936 and 1938. In 1937 Ruch's streak of four consecutive champions was broken by Cracovia, and in 1939 the championships were not finished. By August 31, 1939, after some 12 games, Ruch was the leader of the 10-team League. Last games of this summer occurred on August 20. Then, a break was planned, because the National Team was going to play a few international friendlies. Games were to be re-introduced on September 10. As a result of the Second World War, borders of Poland changed significantly. Lw√≥w, one of the centers of Polish football (with such teams as Pogo≈Ñ Lw√≥w, Czarni Lw√≥w and Lechia Lw√≥w) was annexed by The Soviet Union and all these teams ceased to exist. Lw√≥w's football officials and players moved westwards, creating such clubs as Polonia Bytom, Odra Opole and Pogo≈Ñ Szczecin (see: Recovered Territories). Another important center, Wilno (with the team ≈ömig≈Çy Wilno), was also annexed by the Soviets (see: Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union). This is the list of the ten teams that participated in the games for the last Championships of interwar Poland. Teams are presented according to their position on the table, as of August 31, 1939: 1\\\\. Ruch Chorz√≥w 2\\\\. Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w 3\\\\. Pogo≈Ñ Lw√≥w 4\\\\. AKS Chorz√≥w 5\\\\. Warta Pozna≈Ñ 6\\\\. Cracovia 7\\\\. Polonia Warszawa 8\\\\. Garbarnia Krak√≥w 9\\\\. Warszawianka Warszawa 10\\\\. Union Touring ≈Å√≥d≈∫ =The national Team in 1936-37= Both players and manager Ka≈Çu≈ºa did not have much time to recuperate and analyze the Olympics. League teams were waiting for their key players, and less than a month after the Berlin game vs. Norway, Poland played in another double match. On September 6, 1936 the reserve team faced Latvia in Riga, on the same day the first team went to Belgrad, to play Yugoslavia. Both matches were highly unsuccessful. In Riga, Polish second team tied 3-3 with a much-weaker opponent. However, the game in Belgrade was a real disaster. After a very poor performance, the visitors lost 3-9 (two goals by Teodor Peterek, one by Gerard Wodarz), which was a clear sign of athletic and personal slump of Polish team. For the next months Poland was struggling to recover from this drubbing. The White-reds did not manage to beat Germany (1-1, Warsaw, September 13, 1936) or Denmark (1-2, Copenhagen, October 4, 1936, in this game Ernest Wilimowski finally returned to the team). The first signs of improvement appeared in mid-1937. On June 23 in Warsaw Poland beat Sweden 3-1, only to lose 2-4 to Romania a few days later (July 4, ≈Å√≥d≈∫). A crucial game occurred on September 12, 1937 in Warsaw. The hosts beat Denmark 3-1 which brought hope and eventually started a series of great games, climaxing during the 1938 FIFA World Cup. Match after match, the performance of Polish players improved. Results were impressive. Firstly, in a World Cup qualifier at Warsaw (see: Poland at 1938 FIFA World Cup), Poland beat Yugoslavia 4-0 (October 10, 1937). Interesting is the fact that all goals were scored by players from Chorz√≥w's clubs - Leonard PiƒÖtek (2), Ernest Wilimowski and Gerard Wodarz. Manager Ka≈Çu≈ºa betted on players from Polish Upper Silesia (seven of them appeared in the lineup) and was not disappointed. On the same day in Katowice the reserve team beat 2-1 Latvia. These games were a huge boost for the Poles. Winter break was marked by a great level of optimism, and quality of Polish team was assured by the invitation from then very strong team of Switzerland. White- reds faced the Swiss on March 13, 1938 in Z√ºrich, to achieve a 3-3 tie. Again - all goals were scored by players from Chorz√≥w (Wilimowski, Piatek, Jerzy Wostal). Also, in the lineup there were as many as eight Upper Silesians, which was a clear proof of this region's dominance in Polish football. In spring of 1938, just before the World Cup, the Poles were in their best shape. This was proven on May 22 in Warsaw, when the hosts, playing in front of 25,000 fans, routed Ireland 6-0. This match is regarded as one of the best performances of the interwar period. Apart from Wilimowski, who again showed his extraordinary skills and scored once, virtually all players played their hearts out. Out of them, one has to single out the scorers - Jan Wasiewicz, Leonard PiƒÖtek (2) and Gerard Wodarz. The game against Ireland was the last friendly before World Cup. It raised spirits and gave hope. =1938 FIFA World Cup= It is enough to say that Poles, after an impressive game (and amazing show by Ernest Wilimowski) lost 5-6 to Brazil, which automatically eliminated them from the tournament. Also, it is worth mentioning that seven starters (Ernest Wilimowski, Wilhelm G√≥ra, Ewald Dytko, Gerard Wodarz, Leonard PiƒÖtek, Erwin Nyc and Ryszard Piec) were from Upper Silesia (see: Autonomous Silesian Voivodeship). Out of remaining four, three (Edward Madejski, Antoni Galecki and W≈Çadys≈Çaw Szczepaniak) came from Polish heartland and the last one, Fryderyk Scherfke, was an ethnic German from Pozna≈Ñ. =Last months of interwar Poland= After the loss to Brazil, the Poles needed time to recuperate and rethink the tactics. The next friendly occurred three months later, on September 18, 1938. In Chemnitz, the Germans beat their visitors 4-1 (goal by Teodor Peterek). Compared to the Strasbourg match, there was only one change in the lineup - forward Fryderyk Scherfke was replaced by Peterek. According to witnesses, Poland played a good game, but missed countless good opportunities. Germans, however, netted all their chances. A week later, on September 25, in a double game, the first team faced Yugoslavia in Warsaw (4-4, goals by Jozef Korbas, Ernest Wilimowski - 2 and Leonard PiƒÖtek), and reserves went to Riga, where they lost 1-2 to Latvia. This was a surprising defeat, but the worst was yet to come. In the next five games Poland did not manage to beat their opponents. Firstly, on October 23 in Warsaw, the hosts tied 2-2 with Norway (goals by Wilimowski and Ryszard Piec). Then, in late November, white-reds went on a long train and ferry journey to Dublin, where they lost 2-3 to Ireland (goals by Wilimowski and Piatek). The first game of 1939 was a disaster. On January 22, at Paris's Parc des Princes, the French routed Poland 4-0. It must be mentioned that January is the time of winter break in Polish Football League, so the players were completely unprepared for this game. However, Polish officials did not want to refuse invitation from their French counterparts, and thus the match turned out really badly for white-reds. In freezing rain, hosts were faster and stronger and ambitious Poles were no match to them. On May 27, 1939 in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Poland faced Belgium. This time again the white-reds did not manage to win, achieving a 3-3 tie (two goals by Wilimowski, one by Jerzy Wostal). Also on June 4 in Warsaw, facing Switzerland, the hosts tied 1-1, with Poland's lone goal by Piatek. The last game of interwar Poland took place August 27, 1939 in Warsaw. Hosts faced Hungary, beating them 4-2. This was the day of Ernest Wilimowski, who scored 3 goals and set up the 4th one. The game is described here: The last game: August 27, 1939. Poland - Hungary 4-2. On September 3, also in Warsaw, Poland was going to face Bulgaria. Three days later, white-reds were supposed to travel to Belgrad, to play Yugoslavia. These games never took place. On September 1, 1939, Germany invaded Poland (see: Invasion of Poland). Then, on September 17, Soviet Union joined the Nazis (see: Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact). Poland disappeared from the map of Europe, and the occupiers banned Poles from practising any sports.

History Aegerten is first mentioned in 1225 as villa Egerdon. There has been a village here since at least the late-Roman era. It lay on the major Roman road from Aventicum to Petinesca over the Pierre-Pertuis pass to Basel. A bridge was built across Zihl river by 368-69. The ruins of the bridge have been discovered beneath the B√ºrglen village church and on the banks of the Flur island in the river. Very little is known about the village after the collapse of the Roman Empire until the Late Middle Ages. By the late medieval era, Gottstatt Abbey was the major landholder in the village. In 1388, the city of Bern acquired the village and in 1393 incorporated it into the Nidau bailiwick and the B√ºrglen parish. Aegerten remained a small, agrarian village until the 18th century, when shipping on the Zihl river and seasonal work in the Principality of Neuch√¢tel began to provide additional income. Despite four bridges, the village remained isolated from the growing Swiss rail and road networks in the 19th and early 20th century. As the nearby town of Biel grew in the 1950s, Aegerten finally began to develop into a commuter town and was connected into the Swiss Federal Railways network.

Its members included J.R.(Vincent C Paladino) - vocals, Post Mortem (Robert Montena) - bass, CA Richie (Craig Richardson) - guitar, and Eerie Von (Eric Stellman) - drums. The band was active until 1983 and produced a 7\\" EP titled \\"Blood Lust\\", released on the band's own Ghastly Records. A 2004 CD, Talking to the Dead included tracks from the EP, previously unreleased songs, and tracks recorded live at CBGBs NYC May 15, 1983. The band's early musical influences included The Misfits, and DC bands such as Minor Threat, The Bad Brains, and State of Alert (featuring vocalist Henry Rollins) as well as early British Oi! bands like Blitz, Charged GBH and Discharge. Other stylistic influences include films such as A Clockwork Orange, Caligula, and the band's namesake, Rosemary's Baby. Rosemary's Babies was notably active in the New Jersey and New York hardcore punk scenes of the early 1980s, and all band members continued to work in the music industry after the demise of the band. Eerie Von moved on to work with Glenn Danzig in the bands Samhain and Danzig. In 2008, J.R. worked on the Septimus Orion project. Their first collaboration, a cd entitled CAGED, featured a new version of Sanctioned Violence, which was omitted on the 2004 release of Talking to the Dead because the original master tape of this the song could not be located. The band played numerous live shows, most notably opening for The Misfits, and Scream, whose most notable member is drummer Dave Grohl who later on became the drummer of Nirvana.

Shortly after the school had become co-educational, Church Mill was bought in 1908. After the First World War, Carlton House was rented from the Post Office. In January 1963, the school vacated the premises in Wotton and moved into a new building for 350 pupils in the Kingswood Road. The erection of the first phase of extensions to the Kingswood Road buildings began in March 1972. The extensions were completed for the start of the Autumn Term 1973, when Katharine Lady Berkeley's re-opened as a comprehensive school for 830 pupils. Wotton Secondary School closed at the end of August 1973. The second phase of extensions was completed in September 1975. In 1984 the six hundredth anniversary of the foundation of the school was celebrated with a visit from Princess Anne. In 1989, the Duke of Gloucester opened the Renishaw Centre, an IT room costing ¬£60,000 and since then the School has installed three more computer rooms. The Renishaw Company renewed the equipment in the Renishaw Centre, with the former hardware being transferred to the Special Needs Department. In 1992, grant-maintained (GM) status was attained, with the object of providing for the structural improvement of the buildings and a wish to be able to make independent decisions to suit the school's future. In 1996, the school achieved designation as a Language College which attracted additional funding from central government. This enabled the school to offer a languages curriculum covering seven modern languages and Latin. In 1994, accommodation was added to allow for the increase in numbers, from 1,010 in 1984 to 1,170 in 1994 and then to 1,340 in 1998. Further new buildings were completed in September 1997 to provide six more classrooms and the Language Centre costing ¬£220,000 was opened in September 1996. In autumn 1999, work began on further new buildings to provide a new two storey teaching block which includes 11 classrooms, three ICT suites and a new library. In addition to this a three laboratory extension was added to the Science Centre. In 2003, a major new extension was added to the Music block and a small network of computers installed. One of the rooms in the Humanities block was converted into a cross-curricular computer suite. The Business Studies ICT suite was upgraded into a full computer suite. In 2004, a new single-story block was added between the existing Science and Music blocks. This accommodates a new ICT suite, three new classrooms and two small meeting/seminar rooms. In 2005, the reception area was refurbished with new office accommodation added. Since then the Music block has been extended and two further classrooms have been converted to ICT suites. In 2007, the school gained a second DfES specialism, that of training school. The school population has stabilized at around 1500 pupils. On 16 January 2008, the school had an Ofsted inspection and received 'Good' overall, with an 'Outstanding' for the Sixth Form. In September 2011, the school became an academy, directly funded by central government and independent of control by local government. In June, July and August 2017, the school went through physical changes. The Science block had 8 of its 11 rooms completely remade.

The Beans were originally from New Hampshire, but moved to Iowa and joined the Iowa Yearly Meeting (IYM) in the late 1850s. They had not intended to start a new tradition of Quakerism, but in the 1870s and 1880s, an evangelical \\"revival\\" movement spread to Iowa Quakers, who by degrees abandoned traditional Quaker beliefs and practices in favor of more charismatic, Protestant ones. The Beans eventually became alarmed by this phenomenon, and argued against it, but they preferred to work within IYM rather than splitting off as other Quakers did (forming Iowa Conservative Yearly Meeting). But the new revivalist majority in IYM continued to press them, finally denouncing their views in the 1881 yearly session. The Beans shortly moved to San Jose, California and started a meeting there; still not wanting to break fellowship with their Yearly Meeting, they retained their membership and formed the meeting under the care of Iowa Yearly Meeting. But IYM sent two revivalist ministers to California after them, who caused a split in the meeting. The Beans and their supporters withdrew again to form another meeting, in a building they built themselves, and again applied for recognition by IYM. But IYM officially disbanded the Beans' meeting, after sending them a list of doctrinal questions to which the Beans' meeting did not give satisfactory answers, and over the next few years officially purged them as ministers and then as members. Being forced by IYM to be on their own, the Beans thus became innovators. In 1889 they reorganized their local meeting as the College Park Association of Friends, which over the following decades became the hub of otherwise-unaffiliated Quaker meetings that appeared in the West, which later grew to be what are now known as Pacific Yearly Meeting, North Pacific Yearly Meeting, and Intermountain Yearly Meeting (all of whom eventually joined Friends General Conference). The three meetings jointly publish the magazine Western Friend.

In the U.S. market, the first currently available prerecorded HD media was D-Theater. Comprising less than 100 titles and utilizing a 28-Mbit/s MPEG2 stream at 720p or 1080i with either Dolby Digital 5.1 or DTS encoding, D-Theater is an encrypted D-VHS format, and only D-Theater-capable D-VHS players can play back these tapes. This format is superior to broadcast HDTV due to its higher bandwidth and, of course, the ability to do non-realtime optimization of the encoding, which is not possible with broadcast HDTV. D-Theater is currently a small niche market even within the niche HDTV community, and it appears as if the final D-Theater title was published in 2005 with the 20th Century Fox release of I, Robot. In 2006, the first pre- recorded digital optical HDTV media were introduced. There were two competing standards, Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD. The first HD DVD players and discs were released on April 18, 2006 in the United States. Blu-ray Disc was released on June 20, 2006.  HD DVD and Blu-ray  Since the DVD Forum and the Blu-ray Disc Association failed to agree on standards for high-definition 12-cm discs, a format war was under way between the DVD Forum's HD DVD (formerly \\"Advanced Optical Disc\\") standard and the Blu-ray Disc Association's Blu-ray Disc standard. Although there was disagreement about physical format technology, both the HD DVD and Blu-ray factions selected the same three video codecs to be mandatory in their designs: specifically, MPEG-2 Part 2, VC-1, and H.264/AVC. They were engaged in a format war up until February 2008, to determine which of the two formats will become the leading carrier for high- definition content to consumers. This situation was similar to the VHS/Betamax format war in consumer video recorders in the late 1980s. The manufacturers of HD DVD, Toshiba, announced in February 2008 that they were ceasing production of their HD DVD players indefinitely, citing low demand for HD DVD and the growing use of Blu-ray, which had become popular due to its inclusion as part of the PlayStation 3 among other things. There are now some DVD players that will output enhanced or high-definition signals from standard-definition DVDs. This upconversion process can improve the perceived picture quality of standard-definition video.  Compression codecs  Many codecs are in contention such as Microsoft's Windows Media 9(VC1), H.264/AVC (MPEG-4 Part 10) and the VP6/VP7 codecs from On2 Technologies. = Microsoft VC-1 = In an attempt to provide a bitrate-compatible high-definition format for high- definition video on standard DVD-ROMs, Microsoft introduced their Windows Media 9 Series codec with the ability to compress a high-definition bitstream into the same space as a conventional NTSC bitstream (approximately 5 to 9 megabits per second for 720p and higher). Microsoft is marketing its high- definition Windows Media 9 Series codec as WMV HD. It remains to be seen if the codec will be adopted for widespread use, if only as a Wi-Fi industry standard. As of November 2003, this format required a significant amount of processing power to encode and decode, and the only commercially available movie that used the codec was the Terminator 2: Extreme Edition DVD (see 1). Since then, more titles have become available in this format, such as the acclaimed surf documentary Step Into Liquid. As of the start of 2005, Microsoft recommends a 3.0 GHz processor with 512 MB of RAM and a 128 MB video card for 1080p playback on Windows XP, though there are now commercially available DVD players, like the KiSS DP-600, that will play back WMV HD DVD ROMs in high definition on HDTV sets. The codec has been submitted to, and approved by, SMPTE and is now officially SMPTE Standard 421M, also known as VC-1. = MPEG4/H.264 = H.264 as a standard has already been selected and adopted by the biggest broadcasters in the U.S. (DirecTV, DISH Network) and Europe (BSkyB, Premiere, Canal+, TPS, ...). H.264 was chosen for several reasons: The standard was validated as an open standard at least a year before VC-1 was seriously considered as a potential open standard, and, then, there is a lot of uncertainty on the levies Microsoft may want to impose once the algorithm is adopted. = VP6 = VP6 was reported by On2 to have been chosen by China for use in the Enhanced Versatile Disc (EVD) format initiative. As reported, this was a result of China's desire to avoid royalties on WM9 or AVC. As an advantage, VP6 would not require royalties on recorded media (although royalties would be charged for player devices at a similar cost as for other codecs). As China starts to dominate manufacturing of TV and DVD units, the country's choice of standards becomes more important for everyone. A low cost for the codec itself is not a significant advantage over DVD, however, as the standalone hardware players will be incompatible with standard DVD-Video unless the manufacturer pays the royalties for the technologies necessary to make the player DVD-compatible. Very few titles were made available in any market for this format, although it is presumed that many would be needed to drive purchase of incompatible players. Because of this, it is unlikely any major U.S. studio will commit to movies in this format without some form of copy-protection, which is not yet specified. Soon after the announcement that VP6 would be used on EVD, negotiations between On2 and E-World (the consortium pushing EVD to become a standard) broke down. On2 filed multiple breach of contract claims for arbitration, but in March 2005 the arbitrator ruled that E-World had not broken the contract and owed nothing to On2. It was unclear to On2 and the arbitrator whether the Chinese government ever approved the EVD proposal as a standard. = HDV = Canon XL H1 records 16:9 HD with a 1440x1080 sensor, its pixels having a 1:1.333 aspect ratio. The standard for consumer/prosumer HDTV acquisition is HDV (High Definition Video). It records MPEG-2 TS compressed HDTV video on standard DV media (regular DV or MiniDV cassette tape) and transfers it using FireWire. At this time all consumer/prosumer HD camcorders only record at a maximum resolution of 1440x1080. The image is then stretched from a 4:3 aspect ratio to a 16:9 aspect ratio. This means that even consumer or prosumer camcorders that claim 1080i resolution do not include the full horizontal resolution of 1,920 pixels per line. All major prosumer and consumer camcorder vendors provide cameras in this segment. Broadcast-level HD camcorders and other cameras sometimes record to hard drives via a raw input/output or to tape or flash cards in formats that support higher bitrates than standard DV cassettes such a DVCPro HD. Recording at 100 Mbit/s, it uses a better color compression method to give better color representation than a standard MiniDV or other DV25 cassette and less compression artifacts. Sony HDCAM tape format records 4:2:2 YPbPr 1920 x 1080P at up to 30 frame/s at 140 Mbit/s (using compression). Sony HDCAM SR tape format records 10-bit 4:4:4 RGB 1920 x 1080P at up to 30 frame/s at 880 Mbit/s (4.2:1 compression).  Broadcasters  So far, only a handful of very minor broadcasters are seriously considering VC-1. It has been thought for a while that VC-1 was better adapted for the IPTV world than H.264, but press announcements have also already been made by some of the largest STB manufacturers like Amino, Pace, Kreatel demonstrating solutions based on H.264 standards. The main areas of dominance of VC-1 seem to currently be in the Blu-ray Disc and, for obvious reason, the home PCs. In fact, there is some concern in the community that Microsoft may have appropriated itself the H.264 standard, modified and improved upon it and are trying to resell the solution as VC-1, without providing dues to the MPEG LA. However, this is currently a rumor and has not yet been challenged. Example of broadcasters concerns. = Online HD = H.264 has made significant progress towards becoming a widespread video format on the internet thanks to Apple Computer's QuickTime software supporting the format as of version 7. Since many movie trailers are released in QuickTime format, when movie distributors started releasing HD trailers on the web the format they chose was H.264. H.264 is also used by some for encoding video podcasts. Some recorded shows, series and movies are shared via P2P-services.

Named as a portmanteau of \\"tri\\" and \\"bridge\\", the structure opened in 1981. It consists of one tall central pillar supporting three spokes. Each spoke is long by wide. History The bridge was constructed in 1981 at the instigation of the Midland Area Community Foundation (MACF). The bridge cost $732,000 to build, and took 6,400 hours of labor. Ten railroad car loads of prefabricated wood, and of concrete were used to construct three arches, which weigh apiece. Each appendage is . Gerace Construction Company worked on the project. As a symbol, the bridge has been popularized and is the subject, for example, of lithographs. The Tridge was closed in November 2011 due to work on the rails- to-trails project and the construction of a new canoe launch site. In April 2017, the Tridge was closed for renovations with all stain to be removed and restained and some board replacements. The bridge's full reopening would happen in October with a partial reopening on the Fourth of July. Rollin M. Gerstacker Foundation donated $2.5 million towards the project. Recreation The Tridge is a tourist attraction. It and its two surrounding parks‚Äî in Chippewassee and St. Charles parks‚Äîare one of the most popular leisure areas downtown. The Chippewa Nature Trail begins at the bridge. The site also marks the starting point of the Pere Marquette Rail Trail, a Michigan Rails to Trails Conservancy Hall of Fame trail. Although being mainly a footbridge, bicycles, skateboards, and in-line skates are also allowed on the bridge. It is the focal point for summer evening concerts. Fishing is generally not permitted from the bridge although it does occur frequently. The Tridge, located beside the Midland farmers market, has become an icon of the city and is the most famous landmark of the downtown area. Each year, the Tridge mimics the Mackinac Bridge to the north, in hosting a \\"Labor Day walk\\". The festive annual event is sponsored by MACF and the Chippewa Nature Center, and led by the mayor of Midland. In addition, St. Charles Park, which surrounds the Tridge, is host to many public and private events. At night, the bridge's arches are lit. During summer evenings, the Tridge is a popular hangout spot for local teens largely because it is near the Downtown area and several popular areas. The Trilogy Skatepark is located just north of the Tridge in Chippewassee Park.

Gem√ºnden has around 10,000 inhabitants.  Geography  = Location = Gem√ºnden is located in the Main-Spessart district in the Regierungsbezirk of Lower Franconia (Unterfranken) in Bavaria, on the Main, around 40 km downriver from W√ºrzburg. Within the town, the River Sinn flows into the Franconian Saale, which itself then discharges into the Main. The Main river changes its direction at Gem√ºnden, from northwest to west, marking the northeastern end of the Mainviereck (\\"Main Square\\") near Lohr am Main. Gem√ºnden lies on the Birkenhainer Strasse, an ancient trade road from Lower Franconia to today's Frankfurt Rhine Main Region. =Subdivisions= Gem√ºnden's Stadtteile are Adelsberg, Aschenroth, Harrbach, Hofstetten, Hohenroth, Kleinwernfeld, Langenprozelten, Neutzenbrunn, Reichenbuch, Schaippach, Sch√∂nau, Seifriedsburg, Wernfeld and Massenbuch.  History  Old town hall Scherenburg Castle ruins The local Sch√∂nau monastery (') was founded in 1189 by Philipp von Th√ºngen. A Conventual Franciscan monastery since 1699, the monks' main job was to take care of the monastery and pilgrimage church. The town, which likely had grown out of an early fishing village at the confluence of the three rivers, had its first documentary mention in 1243 in an agreement between Prince-Bishop of W√ºrzburg and Countess Adelheid of Rieneck. According to the agreement, two thirds of the castle and half of the settlement were subject to the Hochstift (or secular authority) of the Prince- Bishops of W√ºrzburg. This followed attempts by the Counts of Rieneck to expand their territory to the south. At that point, Gem√ºnden had already been awarded the status of town by the Rieneck counts. The castle above the town, the Scherenburg, had been built by the Rienecks to control the shipping on the Main and the eastern terminus of the Birkenhainer Strasse, an important trade route in the Middle Ages. The first reference to Gem√ºnden as an oppidum (town) was in a document from 1319. In 1377, W√ºrzburg took control of the whole town but in 1405 the Hochstift W√ºrzburg sold the town to the Counts of Rieneck, reserving a right to buy it back. In 1466, Rudolf von Scherenberg made use of this and returned the town to W√ºrzburg. Under Scherenberg's rule, Gem√ºnden experienced a period of prosperity. The castle was named after him. Besides fishing, winegrowing also was an important source of income. During the German Peasants' War and the Thirty Years' War the town was spared from significant damage. The town hall was built between 1585 and 1596. The castle became disused and started to fall into ruin in the 18th century. The Prince- Bishopric of W√ºrzburg was eventually annexed by Bavaria in 1802. Gem√ºnden became a Bavarian district seat (Kreisstadt); a railway link followed in 1854, Ludwig's Western Railway, nowadays the Main‚ÄìSpessart railway. Gem√ºnden became a railway hub. In 1872 came the opening of the Flieden‚ÄìGem√ºnden line, in 1879 the Gem√ºnden‚ÄìSchweinfurt line and in 1884 the Gem√ºnden ‚Äì Hammelburg line. During the time of the National Socialist r√©gime, the Jewish community's synagogue was destroyed on Kristallnacht (9 November 1938) by SA men. During the Second World War, many Soviet prisoners of war had to perform forced labour in operations that were important to the war effort. Owing to the town's strategically important location as a railway hub, two thirds of it was destroyed by Allied bombing raids and fighting towards the end of the Second World War. In the final days of the war, in April 1945, the railway junction was the subject of fierce fighting which lasted for six days. Post-war, the railway was rebuilt and Gem√ºnden once again became an important junction. In 1964, Deutsche Bundesbahn employed 1,200 people in Gem√ºnden. In 1972, the Gem√ºnden am Main district was abolished. With the amalgamation of nine municipalities with 14 Ortsteile between 1971 and 1978, the municipal territory increased sevenfold.  Arts and culture = Museums = Film- Photo-Ton (‚ÄúFilm-Photo-Sound‚Äù) Museum in the Huttenschloss in Gem√ºnden = Regular events = There are the Scherenburgfestspiele (festival) in July and August in the inner courtyard at the Scherenburg ruins. This is run by Festspielverein der Stadt Gem√ºnden e.V.. Heimatfest is a local festival held every year on the fairgrounds on the opposite side of the Franconian Saale from the town's pedestrian precinct. It is always held during the summer months (usually either in June or July). It is very much a scaled-down version of the Oktoberfest (held at the end of September every year in Munich) with a beer tent, rides, and games. It is always one week in length (from Saturday to the following Sunday) concluding in a fireworks display from the Scherenburg castle ruins. Gem√ºnden was well known as the venue for the heavy metal festival \\"Up From The Ground\\". However, the festival was last held in 2007, and owing to a number of factors, including fears for safety and poor service access at the venue, the promoters have no plans to continue the festival in Gem√ºnden.  Attractions Over Gem√ºnden's town centre rise the ruins of Scherenburg, a castle also known as Schloss Scherenberg, which once belonged to the Counts of Rieneck. Farther up the hill are found the ruins of the Slorburg, another castle. The Elias H√ºgel Column from 1740 was built based on the design of the mostly destroyed original in Kaisersteinbruch. The master mason was Friedrich Opferkuh and the sculptor was Ferenc Gyurcsek. It also stands as a token of good collaboration between the Gem√ºnden am Main Historical Society and the Kaisersteinbruch Museum and Cultural Club. A plaque recalls the old synagogue that was heavily damaged on Kristallnacht (9 November 1938) and torn down in 1945. A memorial to those Soviet prisoners who lost their lives during forced labour, can be found in the direction of Rieneck.Gedenkst√§tten f√ºr die Opfer des Nationalsozialismus.

The exact day of Guy's birth was unknown, but the official birthday was set by the Zoo as May 30, and he received large numbers of cards each year.  Life  Guy arrived at the zoo on 5 November 1947,\\"Guy the Gorilla: a life remembered\\" , The Zoological Society of London, 7 November 2007. Guy Fawkes Night, hence his name. A baby, holding a small tin hot-water bottle, he weighed just 23 lb (10 kg). Guy was the replacement for the zoo's previous gorilla, Meng, who had died in 1941. Guy was captured in the French Cameroons on behalf of Paris Zoo and was traded for a tiger from Calcutta Zoo. It was arranged that London Zoo would receive Guy. The Paris Zoo Director sent instructions to their game department in West Africa to find a suitable female to mate with him. London sent a request to animal dealers and zoos worldwide to find a mate, and in 1969 the zoo was offered Lomie, a five-year-old female who had been living in nearby Chessington Zoo. She then lived for a year in the old Monkey House in London Zoo before being introduced to Guy. When the new Ape and Monkey House, the Michael Sobell Pavilion, was opened in 1971, Guy and Lomie were finally introduced. However, after 25 years of isolation, it was too late; they never produced any offspring. Lowland gorillas are the world's largest primates. Males can weigh between 140 and 275 kg. Guy's dimensions as silverback were measured in 1966 and 1971: he weighed 520 lb (240 kg), was 5 ft 4 in (1.63 m) tall, and had an arm span of 9 ft (2.7 m). His upper arm had a circumference of 23.5 in (58 cm), his thighs 28 in (70 cm), and his neck 36 in (90 cm). His appearance was fearsome, yet his nature was very gentle; when small birds flew into his cage, he was often seen to lift them on his hands and examine them softly. This gentleness is said to have been a major part of his great popularity. Guy died aged 31 or 32, in 1978 of a heart attack during an operation on his infected teeth. His tooth decay had been caused by the fact that visitors were allowed to feed him sweets. During pre-production for the film 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Dan Richter ‚Äî who played the lead ape-man (\\"Moonwatcher\\") in the film ‚Äî studied Guy intently and modelled his acting and mime performance partly on Guy's behaviour.Dan Richter (interview), In: 2001: The Making of a Myth (2001), Channel 4, Available on the 2007 DVD Two-Disc Special Edition of 2001: A Space Odyssey. Richter is interviewed in front of the Timym statue. This featurette also includes a brief 1966 clip of Guy. Legacy *A statue of Guy by the sculptor David Wynne was erected in Crystal Palace Park in 1961. *The Natural History Museum head taxidermist at the time of Guy's death, Arthur Hayward, was given the task of modelling and mounting Guy's skin. After nearly nine months of work, the re-creation of Guy was put on display at the Natural History Museum in November 1982. Years later, Guy was taken out of public display and moved into the scientific study collections. As of late 2012, however, he has been returned to public display as part of the permanent new 'Treasures' exhibition in the museum's Cadogan Gallery. *In 1982, Guy was commemorated by a bronze statue by William Timym, located near London Zoo's main entrance, by the Michael Sobell Pavilion for Monkeys and Apes, where Guy spent his final years. He is also commemorated in an oil painting by Timym which hangs in the library of the Zoological Society of London, the charity which runs London zoo.

The first play, Greater Tuna, debuted in 1981 in Austin; Red, White and Tuna debuted in 1998. Williams and Sears regularly tour the country to perform all four plays, with Howard directing. Of the four plays, Red, White and Tuna is notable in that Sears' and Williams' final costume change (normally done off-stage) is done in full view of the audience. Red, White and Tuna is not currently available on VHS or DVD.

They are returning so that they can meet with old friends due to the 4th of July Homecoming Reunion and Fireworks display. They are nervous to see the state of the town, and are also nervous as to whether or not people will remember their 'past lives' from when they still lived in their hometown. They become so upset that Amber forces Star to pull over, and they hum to calm their inner peace (Until Star attempts to hum a Nancy Sinatra song, which angers Amber). They drive on apprehensively under the cover of the night. The next morning, local radio station OKKK signs on and the DJ's Arles Struvie (Williams) and Thurston Wheelis (Sears) begin giving the daily announcements, which are focused around the 4th of July celebrations. The hot topic of the day is the dropping out of Didi Snavely (Williams) and Pearl Burras (Sears) from the Reunion queen contest, essentially ensuring that the stuck-up Vera Carp (Williams) will win. Also mentioned are several issues which are addressed throughout the show, including the Prayer Posse (led by Vera)'s drive to censor hymns, the members of Free White Texas attempts to declare the town of Tuna a free, independent white nation, and the wedding of Arles and Bertha Bumiller (Sears) the next day. The news is suddenly hit with a new hot topic, in that gay theatre director, Joe Bob Lipsey (Sears), has stormed off from his summer production of *Red, White, and Fabulous!* due to Vera saying he cannot sing a song about alcohol in a dry county. Local animal rights activist, Petey Fisk (Williams), also makes an announcement denouncing that all creatures with more than four legs are pests. Meanwhile, at Bertha's home, she is doing her morning cleaning when Petey knocks on the door. They converse, and Petey brings up the subject of how Bertha only has six dogs left (the seventh having just died). Bertha suspects he has brought her another dog, but he explains how it is actually a cat that thinks it's a dog. She ends ups taking it after he shows how well it fends off a pair of Jehovah's Witnesses, that Bertha dislikes because \\"[she] can't stand a Christian who doesn't like war.\\" She agrees to take the cat, and sends Petey away. Her extremely pregnant daughter, Charlene (Williams) comes down and is having one of her usual fits over her military husband, Rayford, being gone overseas. Bertha attempts to talk her down, but Charlene eventually has a tantrum over the lack of malted milk balls and locks herself in her room. Her brother, Stanley (Williams), comes downstairs hearing the commotion. They both tell Bertha that they aren't going to the Reunion for different reasons. Stanley leaves to go visit his Aunt Pearl. Bertha receives a call from her best friend, Vera, who has graciously offered to host the wedding at her home. Their phone call (focused on how Vera thinks Bertha shouldn't wear white tomorrow, as \\"[she] *is* marrying a divorced man\\"), is constantly interrupted by Vera's menace of a son, Virgil, and one of her Hispanic maid's (all named Lupe for ease of remembrance) issues with understanding Vera's cleaning instructions. Bertha ends the conversations, and writes Arles a note saying that when he arrives, he can find her at Didi's Used Weapon's Shop. Stanley arrives at Pearl's, and he voices his issues with his mother and Arles having sex at such an old age. Pearl reassures him, saying that she didn't even start enjoying her sex life until she hit 65. Disgusted, Stanley has to leave. At Didi's Used Weapons shop (motto \\"if we can't kill it, it's immortal!\\"), Joe Bob has arrived demanding to purchase a suicide weapon. She tells him she simply can't, as she has lost too much money over the years agreeing to that, and he leaves. Pearl also arrives, and they discuss briefly how they can prevent Vera from winning, but Didi's senile mother begins to have a fit offstage, and Pearl leaves as Didi goes to attend to her. Bertha arrives looking for Didi, but cannot find her. Arles arrives, and they begin to argue over details of the wedding and their honeymoon. The argument climaxes in Arles saying that the wedding is off, and storming out. Bertha begins to cry as Didi re-enters, and she comforts her, saying that she's sure she can find Bertha a good maiming weapon. Bertha leaves in sadness, and Didi receives a call from Pearl, who has figured out an evil plan on how to get back at Vera. Didi leaves her shop to go see her, which she is suddenly face to face with her husband R.R. Snavely (Sears), a UFOlogist, who hasn't been seen for many years. She is upset with him, because in one more day he would have been pronounced legally dead. She begins to scold him and he shows that he has been abducted by aliens when he snaps his fingers, and she is unable to speak. She silently yells at him as they walk offstage. ;Act II That afternoon, Pearl discovers that her car is unable to start. Virgil Carp has also stolen his mother's car, so Vera has no way to get to her coronation ceremony. They see each other, say their respective silent insults, and politely ask each other for a ride. Vera suggests that they could borrow Lupe's old stick-shift, if Pearl knows how to drive it. Pearl reveals she can not only drive it, she can hot-wire it and bypass the lack of keys. After they begin their trip, Pearl suddenly wrecks the car to avoid a head-on collision. As they begin to fight, Vera realizes it's time for the coronation. They turn on the radio, and Thurston reveals that the winner, by a landslide, is Joe Bob Lipsey. Vera is aghast, stating that \\"this isn't the type of queen we had in mind.\\" Pearl can only laugh, revealing that she and Didi were Joe Bob's campaign managers. The radio is suddenly overtaken by Arles, who has evicted Thurston and locked himself in the broadcast room, stating he isn't going to leave until Bertha takes him back. He begins to loop the Roy Orbison song Only The Lonely, in an attempt to get her back. Vera storms off. At the reunion plaza, ditzy Helen Bedd (Williams) and Inita Goodwin (Sears) have set up their food booth (Helen & Inita's Hot-to-Trot Catering) and are ecstatic over the boys who are returning for the reunion. Helen goes off to see one, and Inita remembers that she left her foot-powder for the square-dancing competition in the car. She sets out Pearl's prize-winning potato salad, and tells one of her many dumb boyfriends, Garland (Williams) to watch the booth. The stereotypical red-neck is almost incapable of running the food booth, and is constantly distracted by Virgil Carp's firecrackers near the building. Mayor Leonard Childers (Sears) runs up to the food booth, out of breath. He is frantic over his wife, Helen, having taken members of Free White Texas hostage (a subplot started in Scene II), Joe Bob's winning the reunion queen crown, and Virgil's fireworks. Garland calms him with a plate of Pearl's potato salad, which upsets Leonard's stomach. Garland says he doesn't know the issue with it, as it's \\"tangy, but that's the way [he] likes it.\\" It is revealed that the potato salad has been sitting in the heat for over two hours, having spoiled it. Garland exits to find Inita. Vera appears, wielding her megaphone. She discovers that the potato salad has gone bad, and almost disposes of it, before deciding that since the town listened to Pearl, they can all just eat her potato salad and \\"God can sort out the rest.\\" She is surprised when Reverend Spikes (Sears) appears, asking how long he's been out of jail. He begins to answer, and then runs off when he hears a siren, not realizing it's the sound of an ambulance, and not a police car. Joe Bob walks over, singing his formerly banned song. Vera begins to darkly insult him, before realizing she can easily dispose of him. She politely offers him a bowl of the rancid potato salad, free of charge. He eats it, and Vera quickly leaves. He realizes what has happened, and runs to find a restroom. Helen re-enters, and gets a phone call from the maid whose car Vera stole. She says that she found Vera's lipstick in the back seat, and Helen encourages her to call the police. R.R. walks over to the food booth, saying he wants to taste one of Helen's barbecue sandwiches before he heads back out to space. Helen calls one of her girlfriends up to tell the outrageous story, and runs off to spread the rumor more. Star appears, looking for food, and is appalled at the extreme amount of cooked meat at the booth. Amber finds her, saying that she just accidentally ate a spoonful of guacamole with bacon in it, and she found it delicious. Star says she wants to see one more person, then they can go to New Mexico and get Amber cleansed. Amber leaves, and Star watches the \\"microcosmically militaristic\\" fireworks Virgil is still firing off. Stanley walks beside her, and he realizes that they used to go to school with him. They agree to head back to New Mexico together, but Stanley says he wants to see his Aunt Pearl one more time before he goes back. They leave, optimistic. Helen and Inita quickly hear of the poisoned potato salad that has been eaten by almost every member of Tuna, Texas since they left the booth, and they decide they must leave. They pack their bags and take the potato salad away for good. Meanwhile, at Didi's, her and R.R. begin to fight again, and she enters her shop to find a weapon to kill him with. Petey arrives, with several animals that don't belong in the deserts of Texas. He explains to them that R.R. is going to take them to space, and they can come back after global warming, because the only things that will survive that are \\"coyotes and cockroaches. Madonna'll probably make it too.\\" R.R. takes them, and the lights fade to the sound of a UFO taking off into space. A radio announcement by Thurston says that the door Arles locked has been opened, and he has disappeared. Thurston says that Vera Carp has been arrested for grand theft auto and a warrant is out for Helen and Inita, but aside from that a good day was had by all. The lights return on Pearl's bedroom, where Stanley finds her proclaiming that she is on her deathbed for the potato salad affair and for wrecking Lupe's car. Stanley tries and fails to bring her to optimism, eventually saying that when she dies, her husband Henry at least won't take long to find a new wife. This puts her ornery fire back, and she shoos Stanley away so that she can find her nightgown with dogs on the front, because \\"it drives [Stanley's] Uncle Henry wild.\\" Arles and Bertha have driven to the Starlight Motel and have been eloped. They make awkward small talk, before Arles reveals a book his preacher cousin Slim gave him, which is all about healthy sexual relations. As Bertha reads it, she becomes uncomfortable, jumping at Arles' mere touch. He calms her, saying they have to put the past behind them, and move on to better things. Bertha eventually gains courage and begins to start foreplay with Arles, which leads to Arles removing his pants and chasing Bertha around the stage. They run off, and return wearing only their nightgown and wifebeater, respectively. The curtain closes on the small town life of Tuna, Texas.

English examples =Comparatives such as unhappier= One type of a bracketing paradox found in English is exemplified by words like unhappier or uneasier.Pesetsky, D. 1985. \\"Morphology and logical form.\\" Linguistic Inquiry 16:193‚Äì246. The synthetic comparative suffix -er generally occurs with monosyllabic adjectives and a small class of disyllabic adjectives with the primary (and only) stress on the first syllable. Other adjectives take the analytic comparative more. Thus, we have older and grumpier, but more correct and more restrictive. From a phonological perspective, this suggests that a word like uneasier must be formed by combining the suffix er with the adjective easy, since uneasy is a three syllable word: :\\\\Big[\\\\mbox{un-}\\\\Big] \\\\Big[ \\\\big[\\\\mbox{easi}\\\\big] \\\\big[\\\\mbox{-er}\\\\big] \\\\Big] However, uneasier means \\"more uneasy\\", not \\"not more easy\\". Thus, from a semantic perspective, uneasier must be a combination of er with the adjective uneasy: :\\\\Big [ \\\\big[\\\\mbox{un-}\\\\big] \\\\big[\\\\mbox{easi}\\\\big] \\\\Big ] \\\\Big[\\\\mbox{-er}\\\\Big] This, however, violates the morphophonological rules for the suffix -er. Phenomena such as this have been argued to represent a mismatch between different levels of grammatical structure.Sproat, R. 1988. \\"Bracketing paradoxes, cliticization, and other topics: The mapping between syntactic and phonological structure.\\" In Everaert et al. (eds), Morphology and Modularity. Amsterdam: North-Holland. =Professions such as nuclear physicist= Another type of English bracketing paradox is found in compound words that are a name for a professional of a particular discipline, preceded by a modifier that narrows that discipline: nuclear physicist, historical linguist, political scientist, etc.Williams, E. 1981. \\"On the notions 'lexically related' and 'head of a word.'\\" Linguistic Inquiry 12:245‚Äì274.Spencer, A. 1988. \\"Bracketing paradoxes and the English lexicon.\\" Language 64:663‚Äì682. Taking nuclear physicist as an example, we see that there are at least two reasonable ways that the compound word can be bracketed (ignoring the fact that nuclear itself is morphologically complex): # \\\\Big [ \\\\mbox{nuclear} \\\\Big ] \\\\Big [ \\\\big [ \\\\mbox{physic(s)} \\\\big ] \\\\big [\\\\mbox{-ist} \\\\big ] \\\\Big ] ‚Äì one who studies physics, and who happens also to be nuclear (phonological bracketing) # \\\\Big[ \\\\big [\\\\mbox{nuclear} \\\\big] \\\\big [\\\\mbox{physic(s)} \\\\big] \\\\Big] \\\\Big [\\\\mbox{-ist} \\\\Big] ‚Äì one who studies nuclear physics, a subfield of physics that deals with nuclear phenomena (semantic bracketing) What is interesting to many morphologists about this type of bracketing paradox in English is that the correct bracketing 2 (correct in the sense that this is the way that a native speaker would understand it) does not follow the usual bracketing pattern 1 typical for most compound words in English.  Proposed solutions  = Raising = Pesetsky (1985) accounts for the bracketing paradox by proposing that phonological bracketing occurs in syntax and semantic bracketing occurs after the output is sent to LF. This solution is parallel to quantifier raising. For example, the sentence: Every farmer owns a donkey has two interpretations: # Every farmer owns their own donkey: ‚àÄx[farmer(x) ‚Üí ‚àÉy[donkey(y) ‚àß own(x,y)] ] # There exists one donkey such that every farmer owns it: ‚àÉy[donkey(y) ‚àß ‚àÄx[farmer(x) ‚Üí own(x,y)] ] * The structure for 1 is: [IP [DP1 every farmer ] [ [DP2 a donkey ] [t1 [VP owns t2 ] ] ] ] * The structure for 2 is: [IP [DP2 a donkey ] [ [DP1 every farmer ] [t1 [VP owns t2 ] ] ] ] Depending on which quantifier expression is higher, the meaning is shifted, but because this movement does not occur until LF, the structures are pronounced identically. Similarly to this account for scopal ambiguity in quantifier raising, Pesetsky proposes that in the structure of unhappier, happy and the comparative suffix -er are the first to combine, since -er may not attach to adjectives that are longer than two syllables. It is then fed to PF before the next phase, at which the negative prefix un- is then attached. At LF in the following phase, -er undergoes raising, forcing the interpretation of the word to be \\"more unhappy\\" and not \\"not happier\\". Syntax: [ un [ happy er ] ] ‚Üí LF: [ [ un [ happy t1 ] ] er1 ] = Late adjunction = An alternative account is proposed by Newell (2005). She argues that un- adjoins at a late stage of the derivation in LF, possibly after the spell-out of [happy -er]. Under this interpretation the stages are: Syntax: [ happy er ] ‚Üí Late Insertion: [ [ un happy ] er ] Contrasting with un-, the prefix in-, which also has negative meaning, is not allowed at late insertion. There are various pieces of evidence that in- is closer to the root. # Selectional Restrictions: in- may only combine with Latinate roots, while un- is nonrestrictive # Bound Morphemes: in- attaches to some bound morphemes, while un- only attaches to free morphemes (inept ‚Üí *ept, inane ‚Üí *ane) # Nasal Assimilation: in- assimilates phonologically with the first phoneme of the morpheme to which it attaches, whereas the /n/ in un- is preserved ## Impossible: /in-/ + /Ààpas…™blÃ©/ ‚Üí [imÀàp ∞as…™blÃ©] (*[inÀàp ∞as…™blÃ©]) ## Unpopular: /un-/ + /Ààp…ípjulrÃ©/ ‚Üí [unÀàp ∞Àà…ípjulrÃ©] (*[umÀàp ∞Àà…ípjulrÃ©]) In order to participate in these processes, in- must attach at an earlier level directly to the root in order to adjectivize it. Thus, because it attaches early, if it creates a three-syllable word, -er may not attach, as -er attaches at a later stage above the root derivation. * [ [ in ‚àöpolite ] -er ] ‚Üí crashes at PF = Glomming = A famous bracketing paradox of Russian verb complex such as razorvala 'she ripped apart' shows different phonological and semantic analyses: razo rv a la PFX Root THEME 3SG.PST.F * morphophonology ‚Äì [prefix [root suffixes] ] * morphosemantics ‚Äì [ [prefix root] suffixes] One of the proposed solutions is parallel to the proposal for Navajo verbs with multiple prefixes.Harley, Heidi (2010). Affixation and the mirror principle. In Interfaces in linguistics: New research perspectives, ed. Rafaella Folli and Christiane Ulbrich. Oxford University Press. It includes head movement and Merger Under Adjacency, also called Glomming. For Russian, the derivation starts with [TP T [AspP Asp [vP v [VP ‚àöV [SC LP DPobj ] It allows for the semantic bracketing as ‚àöV and LP are next to each other. Next, ‚àöV rv merges with v ‚Äìa via head movement and further v complex merges with Asp also via head movement. Lexical Prefix razo- is phrasal and does not participate in the head movement. Thus, the complex structure emerging as a result of head movement to the exclusion of LP allows for the phonological bracketing. Finally, Glomming or Merger Under Adjacency takes place resulting in one verbal complex.

He played college football as a center at Ohio State University from 1933 to 1935. After serving as an assistant coach for 17 years under Bud Wilkinson at the University of Oklahoma, Jones helmed the Sooners for two seasons in 1964 and 1965, compiling a record of 9‚Äì11‚Äì1. He was also the athletic director at Oklahoma from 1964 until his death in 1971. Jones was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1978. Playing career Jones was one of the outstanding college football players in the 1930s. From 1933 to 1935, he played at Ohio State University as a center on offense and a linebacker on defense. Jones was the anchor of the Buckeyes' offensive line, and was named team MVP following the 1934 and 1935 seasons. In 1935, he was named team captain and was a consensus All-American. Jones was selected by the Chicago Cardinals in the second round of the 1936 NFL Draft as the 15th player selected overall, but chose instead to pursue a career in coaching. While at Ohio State, he was a member of the Alpha Rho Chapter of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. Coaching career Jones served as an assistant to Ohio State head coach Francis Schmidt from 1936 until Schmidt resigned following the 1940 season. In 1946, he served as an assistant coach at the University of Nebraska. His greatest coaching success, however, came as Bud Wilkinson's top assistant at the University of Oklahoma for 17 years, developing 16 All-American linemen as line coach and the architect of Oklahoma's great lines. Following Wilkinson's retirement in 1964, Jones was promoted to head coach. But after two disappointing seasons with a cumulative record of 9‚Äì11‚Äì1, he resigned as head coach while staying on as athletic director, which he had also been promoted to in 1964. His teams' mediocre performance may have been caused in part by the dismissal of four of his better players who had signed professional contracts before their college eligibility had expired. Death and honors Jones, still the Oklahoma athletic director, died in New York City while attending the 1971 National Invitation Tournament. Jones was posthumously inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1978 as a player. Earlier that year he had been inducted into Ohio State's own Varsity O Hall of Fame.

The 429 employs the all-new modular airframe concept and the advanced rotor blade design from the MAPL program, but maintains a derivative engine and rotor drive system from the 427.

Design Bell 429 cockpit The Bell 429 has a four-blade rotor system with soft-in-plane flex beams. The rotor blades are composite and have swept tips for reduced noise. The tail rotor is made by stacking two, two-blade rotors set at uneven intervals (to form an X) for reduced noise. The combined cabin volume is 204 ft¬≥ (5.78 m¬≥) with a 130 ft¬≥ passenger cabin and 74 ft¬≥ baggage area, with a flat floor for patient loading. A set of rear clamshell doors under the tailboom is optional for easier patient loading in EMS operations. The 429 has a glass cockpit with a three-axis autopilot (optional fourth axis kit) and flight director as standard. Standard landing gear are skids.

The sovereign involved might be either the monarch or a marcher lord. Law The grant of free warren could be as a gift, or in exchange for consideration, and might be later alienated by the grantee. The stipulated area might be coextensive with the frank-tenement of the grantee, or it might be discontinuous or even at a considerable remove from the grantee's holdings. The right of free warren did not extend automatically to the freeholder of the soil. Although the rights of free warren are usually discussed in the context of forest law, the only law which applied within the warren was common law. Thus, even though the warrant ultimately derived from the sovereign, the only statutes applied to poachers in a warren were the common-law crimes of theft and trespass. The privilege of free warren was a reciprocal relationship. The grantee of the warren was granted an exemption from the law (under which all game in the realm was property of the sovereign), but the grantee owed the sovereign the stewardship and protection of the game from all others who might wish to hunt it. Etymology Modern English warren ‚Üê ME warrene, warreine ‚Üê ONF warrenne ‚Üê Germanic present participle of *warian \\"to take care; to cause to care (for)\\" ‚Üê causative of *waran \\"to care\\" ‚Üê *war \\"care\\". Doublet of guarantor. Related to OHG werien (i.e. *w√§rian) \\"to defend, protect\\", and also to English \\"a-ware, wary\\". A Celtic etymology for warren has been proposed, based on the notion of \\"post ‚Üí enclosure\\"; but this ignores the documented evolution of the term from the Germanic, as well as being semantically inappropriate for an unenclosed woodland. Free warren and domestic warren The original use of free warren was as a legal term. However, as the franchise defined both a set of species and a geographic extent, the natural semantic extensions arose, namely for the individual animals as a group, or for the land they inhabited. As it became pragmatically necessary for freeholders not holding a free warren to enclose their breeding establishments, these \\"closed warrens\\" or domestic warrens began also to be designated simply as \\"warrens\\" (use recorded in 1378; OED). In 1649 the metaphoric use as \\"cluster of densely populated living spaces\\" is recorded. Warren and warden The Mediaeval Latin form of the word warenna was used in legal documents such as Magna Carta. In addition, the office of warden is used for the overseer of a warren: > (5) But the warden, as long as he hath the custody of the lands, shall keep > up and maintain the houses, parks, warrens, ponds, mills, and other things > belonging to them, out of their issues; The warden of a Royal forest was often the castellan or constable of the nearest royal castle; over time the less exalted title of warrener evolved for the custodian of the lowest of the hunting franchises, the warren. Warren and warrant The adjective free in free warren does not refer to the lack of enclosure surrounding the precincts of the warren, but rather to the fact the \\"liberty\\" of hunting derives from a warrant of the sovereign. That is, > The term \\"warrant\\" occurs very early in constitutional documents: it is > found in the Assize of Clarendon and the Assize of the Forest, both in the > reign of Henry II., but in neither case in its modern meaning. The original > meaning seems to have been more akin to guarantee (q.v.), warranty or > security; and to some extent the term implies something in the nature of a > guarantee or representation by the person issuing the warrant that the > person who acts on it can do so without incurring any legal penalty. All of the terms warrant, warrantor, and warranty are used in Henry II of England's Assize of the Forest (a.k.a. Assize of Woodstock) in 1184:The Assize of the Forest (Woodstock) 1184 Henry II :Article 2. Item, he has commanded that no one shall have bows, arrows, dogs, or hounds in his forests, unless [such person] has the warrant of the king or of some other man who can [lawfully] be his warrantor. :Article 9. Item, the king forbids all clergymen to commit any offences touching his venison or his forests. He strictly orders his foresters that, if they find such men committing offences, they shall not hesitate to lay hands on those men in order to hold them and put them under attachment; he himself will give full warranty. Beasts of warren The permission to take game was limited to certain types of animals. Generally, the killing of vermin (defined as predators and other beasts not fit for the table) was not regulated. This definition was flexible, however, depending on whether the animal was thought to provide good sport, as wolves, foxes, badgers, or bears. In practice, vermin could only be killed on the commons or waste, since none but the grantee was permitted to have instruments of the hunt within the warren. =Manwood= The most cited authority on forest law, John Manwood, cites these beasts of warren:Treatise, I:3 > \\"The beasts and fouls of Warren are these, The Hare, the Cony, the Pheasant, > and the Partridge, and none other are accompted beasts or fouls of Warren.\\" However, Manwood is mistaken in his assignments, since the roe deer was transferred to \\"beast of warren\\" from \\"beast of the forest\\" in the fourteenth century.The roe ceased to be a beast of forest in the fourteenth century owing to a decision in the Court of King's Bench, 13 Edw. III, which decided that it was a beast of warren on the ground that it drove away the other deer (Turner, Select Pleas of the Forest (Selden Soc.), xxi).

Roe deer are still found within woodlands named \\"Warren\\" in contemporary England. The 1911 Encyclopedia adds roe, woodcock, quail, and rail to Manwood's list.\\"Beasts of (free) warren are roe, hare, rabbit, partridge, pheasant, woodcock, quail, rail and heron\\" . On the other hand, grouse are not birds of warren. Matthew Bacon‚Äôs A New Abridgment of the Law, (1778): Devonshire v. Lodge, 7 Barn. & C. 36.

It was Canada's oldest toy company and remained independent and family owned until 2001.  History  The company began in 1926 as an importer and distributor of dry goods and clothing, located in Sam and Beatrice Irwin's house. Later on, the company moved to a warehouse in the west end of Toronto and focused mainly on toys. Sam and Beatrice's sons, Arnold and Mac Irwin, took over management of the company in the years to follow. Most of Irwin's profits came from distributing other (usually American) companies' toys. Almost all of the more popular toys available in Canada until the early 1990s were distributed by Irwin. Major American companies wished to sell their toys in Canada, but did not open Canadian branches because of the lower population and tariffs which would generate less income for them. Irwin's success came mainly due to their licensing and contract manufacturing of American companies Kenner and Parker, where Irwin was the Canadian importer and distributor of their products. The business found success with the help of the Hula Hoop, Slinky, Frisbee, and later on in the century with the popular Star Wars action figures, Care Bears and the Easy-Bake Oven. In the early 1980s, the Atari Video Computer System was a success, and Irwin was the Canadian distributor. Irwin would also acquire the rights to the Sega video game brand in Canada later on. The video game sales helped fuel revenues of $100 million and growth for the company. The company also had a junior shareholders program to have children become interested in the toy company and introduce them to the stock market. The company had 350 employees at their downtown Toronto factory. 1972-1987 Ed Hurst, Jerry Inch and Bob Blakely, in charge of Irwins Frisbee promotions, were instrumental in the introduction of disc sports (Frisbee) across Canada. With the use of performing Frisbee athletes Ken Westerfield and Jim Kenner, Irwin partnered with several major companies such as Lee Jeans, Orange Crush, and Air Canada. Together they sponsored Frisbee show tours and the beginning of organized disc sports programs in Canada. Two successful nationally sponsored tournaments were the Canadian Jr Frisbee Championships and the Canadian Open Frisbee Championships (1972-1985). During the 1980s and 1990s, major American companies such as Hasbro, Mattel, and Kenner, acquired many of the companies which Irwin did business with. In the 1980s, with the introduction of the Free Trade Agreement and later, the North American Free Trade Agreement, it became less expensive for American companies to form their own Canadian branches where Irwin lost many business deals as major toy companies began to distribute toys themselves. In 1989, Irwin Toy challenged the constitutionality of a Quebec law prohibiting advertising directed toward children. The Irwin Toy Ltd. v. Quebec (Attorney General) case reached the Supreme Court resulting in a landmark ruling regarding the interpretation of freedom of expression provision in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. As Irwin Toy faced financial and business difficulties, the company was sold to a private investment group, LivGroup Ltd. of Toronto in 2001 for approximately $55 million. Eighteen months after the buyout, Irwin Toy, now owned by Richard Ivey and Jean Marie Halde of Toronto, declared bankruptcy and entered into creditor supported liquidation. The original factory was sold to developers for $10 million and converted into a condominium called Toy Factory Lofts. Following liquidation, the company officially closed down, then in 2003 was re-purchased by the former employees, George and Peter Irwin.

The site was occupied by the pre-Columbian Maya and functioned as a port for navigation and an important Maya trading center. Some of the site's original structures are contained within a modern-day tourism development, the privately owned Xcaret Park. Toponomy Xcaret means \\"small inlet\\" in Mayan.The Mayan \\"X\\" is pronounced approximately \\"Ish\\", hence the name is similar to \\"Ish Ka Ret\\" when pronounced. Its name comes from its situation next to a small inlet that in the past served as a strategic location for navigation and commerce for the Maya. The original name of the site was p'ole', from the root p'ol that means \\"merchandise\\" or \\"deal of merchants\\", which gives an idea of the economical relevance of the site. Site description Xcaret Mayan ruins. It is part of the remains that the park preserves. Xcaret has many reserves that are open to the public. According to the research by the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH), the first buildings of the site can be dated to 200 to 600 A.D., but the majority of them are from the period from 1200 to 1550 A.D. The constructions of the Late Post-Classical period are situated along the coast; some of them in strategic positions for surveillance. The site had a wall, but unlike the one in Tulum that was open towards the ocean, the wall at Xcaret defended the site from assaults coming from the sea. The wall may also have served to divide the solid ground of the interior from the swampy ground closer to the coast. Xcaret was inhabited at the time of the first stage of the Spanish incursion of Alonso D√°vila and Francisco de Montejo into the eastern coast of the Yucat√°n Peninsula (1527 to 1529). In 1548, Juan N√∫√±ez was put in charge of Xcaret. At this time, a Spanish chapel was built. This implies that Xcaret remained an important settlement. The thatched roof of the chapel has disintegrated, but the walls remain standing. The INAH divides the architectural formations into several different groups.  Historical significance  Zone Arqueologica of Xcaret There are documents which suggest that Xcaret was one of the most active and economically significant Maya ports on the east coast. These documents make mention of marriages between the P'ole rulers and the people of Cozumel. These marriages were likely for political advances; they imply that Xcaret was politically important.  Archaeological finds  During archaeological explorations led by archaeologist Mar√≠a Jos√©, 135 human remains were found in the chapel. In another case, DNA found on site was analyzed, and results showed that \\"the distribution of mtDNA lineages in the Xcaret population contrasts sharply with that found in ancient Maya from Cop√°n, which lack lineages A and B. On the other hand, our results resemble more closely the frequencies of mtDNA lineages found in contemporary Maya from the Yucat√°n Peninsula and in other Native American contemporary populations of Mesoamerican origin.\\" These findings suggest that the people of Xcaret are more closely related to contemporary Maya peoples than ancient peoples.

It works as a router that relays SS7 messages between signaling end-points (SEPs) and other signaling transfer points (STPs). Typical SEPs include service switching points (SSPs) and service control points (SCPs). The STP is connected to adjacent SEPs and STPs via signaling links. Based on the address fields of the SS7 messages, the STP routes the messages to the appropriate outgoing signaling link. Edge STPs can also route based upon message body content using deep packet inspection techniques, and can provide address translations and screen content to limit the transfer of messages with dubious content or sent from unreliable sources. To meet stringent reliability requirements, STPs are typically provisioned in mated pairs. These 'routers' are connected just by signaling links; they don't have users attached (where a user could be a mobile station (MS), a PSTN user in case of a public terrestrial network, or a piece of terminal equipment at the end of an ISDN B channel). SEPs send signaling messages to other SEPs, but the messages are normally routed via the SEP's adjacent STPs. An STP's main function is to identify the best path for two SEPs to communicate. A typical application would be for two SEPs to agree on the use of a shared data path (e.g., using ISUP to initiate a voice call between a user on one SEP and a user on the second SEP). In this way, STPs route signaling messages (for starting, maintaining or finishing any kind of calls originated by the SEPs' attached users) while avoiding disabled intermediary STPs. A signaling message typically never goes directly from a given SEP to the destination SEP: the message would normally have to pass through the initiating SEP's adjacent STP so that it can be routed to the destination SEP. In some applications, however, SEPs might be directly connected with signaling links; this would typically be done to enhance robustness or performance between two critical SEPs. Such mesh network configurations are also common in Europe, where STPs have not found widespread deployment. In some cases, signaling messages can be originated by the STP to learn about the state of the signaling network Some examples include: * an STP may send route set test messages to probe the availability of a particular SEP; * it may send low-level MTP messages to an adjacent signaling point to check the Bit Error Rate (BER) on a particular signaling link; or * it may let other adjacent signaling points know that it is going to out of service; in this way, the adjacent signaling points will try to avoid this OOS STP. A given piece of equipment can implement both SEP and STP functionality. This is commonly done in some SSPs. This is also seen in Signaling Gateways that also have Application Server (AS) functionality as defined by the IETF. Some UMTS number portability solutions are implemented in STPs. In UMTS, the STP provides Global Title Translation (GTT), which may be used to route queries from a gateway MSC (GMSC) to the HLR. Note that for every call to an MS, the call is first routed to the MS's Gateway MSC.

K-S is one of many natural systems. The system was definitively described in their 1958 book How to Play Winning Bridge and later revised and retitled to The Kaplan-Sheinwold System of Winning Bridge in 1963. Kaplan‚ÄìSheinwold and the Roth-Stone system were the two most influential challengers to Standard American bidding in the US in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. Although K-S is not frequently played in its original form in the 21st century, many of its features (though not the 12-14 point 1NT opening) survive in the popular 2/1 Game Forcing system. Additionally, a few elements of Kaplan‚ÄìSheinwold (notably Five-Card Majors) have become accepted as part of Standard American practice. Among modern experts, Chip Martel and Lew Stansby play a system closely modeled on K-S, with loads of gadgets. In the late 1960s, the Precision Club system grafted a strong, forcing opening of 1 onto K-S, in effect following earlier suggestions by Marshall Miles that five-card majors and the weak no trump be added to the Schenken system. Kaplan viewed Precision with distaste, noting the disadvantages, both theoretical and at-the-table, of combining a strong club with five-card majors. The principal features of K-S, as revised in the 1960s, are these: # Weak no trump. An opening bid of 1NT promises 12‚Äì14 high card points (HCP). Transfers are not used, and Stayman is non-forcing. Kaplan's highly successful partnership with Norman Kay used \\"Timid K-S,\\" which departed from the original K-S structure by using a strong no trump when vulnerable. # Five-card majors, with limit raises. A 1NT response is forcing and responder's double is negative. 3NT is the strong, forcing raise. Two of a minor over a major suit opening is game forcing, unless rebid. 2 over 1 can be weaker (minimum is 10 points and a five card suit) than two of a minor, so as not to miss a good heart partial. Kaplan preferred to open 1 with 5-5 in the black suits and a minimum hand. # Minor suit openings are strong or unbalanced, or both, because the weak no trump handles all weak, balanced hands. A 1NT rebid by opener shows a strong no trump (15‚Äì17 HCP) and a 2NT rebid shows 18‚Äì20 HCP. Opener's reverses are forcing. Opener's simple rebids (e.g., 1 m ‚Äì 1M; 2m) are restricted to absolute minimum hands, and tend to show six cards in the minor. Opener's jump rebids (e.g., 1 m ‚Äì 1M; 3m) are enormously strong, promising a hand just shy of a forcing opening bid. After a 1 opening, a rebid of 2 shows the strength and pattern of a reverse, and opener's jump to 3 shows a weak hand with 5-5 in the minors. # In response to one of a minor, responder shows a four card major if possible with a weak or moderate hand. But with values for game, responder first bids a longer side suit, even the other minor, and may rebid in a major. For example, the sequence 1 - 1 ; 1 - 1 may show a strong hand with long diamonds and four spades, but it may also be a \\"moderately strong hand without a spade stopper.\\" # Inverted minor suit raises are used (a single raise is strong, a double raise is weak and preemptive). # Weak two bids, including 2. # 2 is the only strong, forcing opening. # Defensively, simple overcalls are taken to have the same range as an opening bid, and take-out doubles emphasize distribution.

It is located at Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, Ontario. The Hall of Fame annually inducts Thoroughbred and Standardbred horses, sulky drivers, jockeys, trainers and the horse racing industry's builders. Background Although the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame (CHRHF) was founded in 1976, it was not until 1997 that it had a physical location. At that time, the Ontario Jockey Club granted a permanent site located at the West Entrance to Woodbine Racetrack. The Hall now includes information on each of the inductees plus related memorabilia including trophies, silks, old racing programs and bronzed horseshoes. Each year, special displays are created to honour some of racing's greats such as jockey Ron Turcotte or pacer Cam Fella. In 2014, the Hall commemorated the 50th anniversary of Northern Dancer's wins in the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes and Queen's Plate with a series of initiatives such as an online timeline of his career, the induction of his trainer Horatio Luro, a special tribute at the annual ceremony and a calendar. Northern Dancer and his owner E.P. Taylor were part of the original class of inductees in 1976. Since then, Northern Dancer's sire Nearctic, dam Natalma, sire's dam Lady Angela, several sons and daughters including Nijinsky, The Minstrel, Northernette and Vice Regent, plus numerous descendants have also been inducted. There are two nominating committees, one for the Thoroughbred industry, the other for Standardbreds. Each committee nominates up to eight candidates, which are later voted on by the corresponding election committee. Any Canadian person or horse can be nominated for their achievements whether in Canada or internationally. Foreign-bred horses who had a significant influence on Canadian racing or breeding may also be nominated. For example, Secretariat was nominated in 2013 in recognition of his appearance in the 1973 Canadian International, an appearance that brought worldwide attention to the race.

While not a commonplace breed, they are found in small numbers as \\"productive pets\\" amid larger numbers of other dairy cattle breeds on dairy farms throughout North America. Known for their distinctive colour-sided coloration, the Lineback has a black base and nose with a skunk-like white stripe or finching along the spine. Due to the rarity of the pure-strain breed, variations such as red lineback and animals with a heavily speckled pelt instead of a distinct stripe occur from time to time. The breed is often cross bred to other dairy cattle, though the coloration trait is generally dominant in offspring History of Lineback Dairy Cattle-‚ÄúA Well-Marked Breed‚Äùhttp://www.americanlinebacks.com (by Robert Gear 1986) Cattle with \\"Lineback\\" color patterns have occurred throughout the world in many breeds. In the Texas Longhorn and some African breeds, the Lineback patterns occur randomly. In breeds such as the English Longhorn, Gloucester, Pinzgauer, Vosgienne, and the Moiled cattle of Ireland, the Lineback pattern in some form is their identifying characteristic. And still others, such as the native Welsh breed, consistently display several ‚Äúcolor phases‚Äú, of which the \\"Lineback\\" is one. Geneticists recognize two variations of the Lineback Dairy Cattle. The first, is known as Gloucester, in which the animal has a dark, usually black or red body with a white dorsal stripe, possibly a star on the face, white tail and belly, and perhaps one or more garters or white bands around the legs, where they join the body. The other, known as Witrick separates into 3 major types of ‚ÄúWitrick‚Äôs‚Äù the White classic Witrick, Dark- Sided Witrick, and Dark Specked Witrick. The White Classic Witrick is more prevalent type and has a lot more white on the body and face, followed with black or red eyes, nose and ears, but Witrick‚Äôs of all patterns can be found with much \\"speckling or brockling\\" on the face, body, and legs. The brockling may be in the form of round or elliptical spots or roaning or both. Of the variations found, the Witrick variety predominating over the Gloucester. The English Longhorn, Irish Moiled, Norwegian Telemark, Swedish Mountain, and Dutch Witrick have the Witrick as their characteristic marking, while the Gloucester pattern in which brockling does not occur is exemplified by the English Old Gloucester and the Austrian Pinzgauer. It is reasonable to assume that Linebacks were among the cattle imported into the U.S. in the 17th and 18th centuries. The Dutch were bringing their Witrick cattle into New York at a time when the Witrick was plentiful. The name Witrik (Without a \\"c\\") is a compound word derived from dialectal Dutch Wit (White) and Rik (\\"Rug\\" in standard Dutch, meaning \\"Back\\") and means \\"White Back\\". Additionally, many British ships coming to America were sailing from Bristol, a geographically convenient port for the export of Gloucester and Welsh cattle. Considering that livestock of all classes has been imported to the United States, it is not surprising that we have our own \\"Dairy Lineback breed\\". During the 19th century progressive American farmers began to look again to Europe for improved stock, including Ayrshires, Friesians, Herefords and Milking Shorthorns, all of which were capable of throwing occasional linebacked offspring. There breeds, plus the English Longhorn, probably contributed to the Lineback presence in the United States. Following World War II, in the stampede for bigger yields, dairy farmers increasingly began to use Holstein bulls to \\"upgrade\\" their herds. In New England these herds were often the old unimproved Durhams or Milking Shorthorns, but in New York and the Midwest, as well as much of northern Vermont and neighboring Canada, there were many herds of Linebacks of both types which were graded up with Holstein bulls. Because the Lineback patterns are genetically strong and the Holstein pattern is weak, the Lineback will often persist through many generations of outcrossing. The sources from which our stock derive and the periods when their ancestors entered our agricultural history are conjectural and likely not be resolved fully, as documentation is almost nonexistent. Today there are several thousand Lineback dairy cows in the United States, some of them essentially Holsteins, some from Milking Shorthorn or other backgrounds, and some quite unique! History of \\"The Lineback Dairy Cow\\" Originating mainly from Holland, Europe in the 1700-1800s, Lineback‚Äôs first appeared in America when English and Hollanders settled in the country. Lineback‚Äôs were a very dual-purpose animal, fulfilling the owners' needs for both milk and meat. As time went on into the 1900s, farmers started to specialize in either beef or dairy production. The Lineback has over time been selected for improved dairy production due to there ‚Äúhigh components‚Äú, although it remains a very versatile breed, that was and is heavily influenced by Holstein Blood. The current \\"Idealistic Lineback Cow\\" The ‚ÄúLineback cow‚Äù has been up-bred to be a very productive dairy cow. Still occasionally influenced by Holstein blood this genetically superior breed has remained versatile enough to be prevalent in these demanding modern times. Today there are several thousand Lineback dairy cows in the United States. The term ‚ÄúLineback‚Äù The use of the word ‚ÄúLineback‚Äù refers to both appearance and breed. The common factor of all the patterns is the white line across the back, the dark solid color of the ears and nose, outlining of the eyes and one or more dark hooves. ‚ÄúRed and white‚Äù or ‚ÄúBlack and white‚Äù are the predominant ‚Äúcolor‚Äù patterns.

Description It has branched stems and dark violet flowers. Like other irises, it has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. The standards are slightly paler than the falls, they have white veining on the throat. It has a beard which is whitish yellow, and the spathes are slightly tinged with red-violet, like those of Iris aphylla. =Biochemistry= As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It was counted as 4n=48 (making it a tetraploid). Taxonomy It was described in 1962 by botanists Ivo and Marija Horvat, in 'Acta Bot. Croatica', Issue 20‚Äì21 on page 8. Then in 1981, Brian Mathew in his book 'The iris', reclassified it a synonym of Iris germanica.T. K. Lim Distribution and habitat Iris croatica is native to temperate areas of Europe. =Range= It is found in Croatia and Slovenia. It grows mostly in the woods of downy oak (Quercus pubescens) and black hophornbeam (Ostrya carpinifolia) on dolomite and limestone soils. It is known from hilly parts of continental Croatia including the hills of Samoborsko gorje (near Samobor), the hill Cesargradska gora (near Klanjec), near Josipdol, on the hill of Strahinjƒçica (near Radoboj), and at Zagrebaƒçko gorje and ≈Ωumberaƒçko gorje.

Chemically, it is an organic compound consisting of an aniline derivatized with a sulfonamide group. Powdered sulfanilamide was used by the Allies in World War II to reduce infection rates and contributed to a dramatic reduction in mortality rates compared to previous wars. Modern antibiotics have supplanted sulfanilamide on the battlefield; however, sulfanilamide remains in use today, primarily for treatment of vaginal yeast infections. The term \\"sulfanilamides\\" is also used to describe a family of molecules containing these functional groups. Examples include: * Furosemide, a loop diuretic * Sulfadiazine, an antibiotic * Sulfamethoxazole, an antibiotic Mechanism of action As a sulfonamide antibiotic, sulfanilamide functions by competitively inhibiting (that is, by acting as a substrate analogue) enzymatic reactions involving para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). PABA is needed in enzymatic reactions that produce folic acid, which acts as a coenzyme in the synthesis of purines and pyrimidines. Mammals do not synthesize their own folic acid so are unaffected by PABA inhibitors, which selectively kill bacteria. History Sulfanilamide was first prepared in 1908 by the Austrian chemist Paul Josef Jakob Gelmo (1879‚Äì1961) as part of his dissertation for a doctoral degree from the Technische Hochschule of Vienna. It was patented in 1909.On May 18, 1909, Deutsches Reich Patentschrift number 226,239 for sulfanilamide was awarded to Heinrich H√∂rlein of the Bayer corporation. Gerhard Domagk, who directed the testing of the prodrug Prontosil in 1935, and Jacques and Th√©r√®se Tr√©fou√´l, who along with Federico Nitti and Daniel Bovet in the laboratory of Ernest Fourneau at the Pasteur Institute, determined sulfanilamide as the active form, are generally credited with the discovery of sulfanilamide as a chemotherapeutic agent. Domagk was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work. In 1937 Elixir sulfanilamide, a medicine where the sulfanilamide was synthesized using diethylene glycol as a solvent, poisoned and killed more than 100 people as a result of acute kidney failure, prompting new US regulation for drug testing. In 1938, the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act was passed.

Initially judged a death by natural causes, the court later declared that the woman had been murdered by her husband, following testimony by the victim's mother, in which the latter claimed that her daughter's spirit revealed the true cause of death. Background Elva Zona Heaster, the murder victim, was born in Greenbrier County sometime around 1873. Almost nothing is known of her early life, other than that she was brought up near Richlands and that she gave birth to a child out of wedlock in 1895. In October 1896, Zona met a drifter named Erasmus Stribbling Trout Shue; he had moved to Greenbrier County in search of a new life, and to work as a blacksmith. Shue found work in the shop of one James Crookshanks; Zona met him not long after his arrival in town. The two fell in love and soon married, despite objection to the match by Zona's mother, Mary Jane Heaster, who had taken an instant dislike to Shue. Murder The couple lived peacefully for a short time, but on January 23, 1897, Zona's body was discovered at her home by a young boy who had been dispatched to the house by Shue on an errand. The boy found Zona lying at the foot of the stairs, stretched out with her feet together and one hand on her stomach. The boy ran to tell his mother, who summoned the local doctor and coroner, George W. Knapp. Knapp did not arrive for close to an hour. By the time the doctor arrived, Shue had carried his wife's body upstairs to the bedroom, and laid her out on the bed. He dressed the corpse himself; this was unusual, as traditionally the job of washing and preparing the body for burial would be undertaken by the women of the community. Nevertheless, Shue dressed her in a high-necked dress with a stiff collar, and placed a veil over her face. Shue remained by the corpse while Dr. Knapp examined it, cradling his wife's head and sobbing. Knapp, noting the husband's grief, gave the body only a brief examination, noting some bruising on the neck. When he tried to look closer, Shue reacted so violently that Knapp ended the examination and left the house.House where the murder took place Initially, Zona's cause of death was listed as \\"everlasting faint\\"; later, this was changed to \\"childbirth\\". Knapp had been treating her for \\"female trouble\\" for two weeks before her death, but whether she was pregnant or not is unknown. Zona's parents were soon informed of her death. Mary Jane Heaster is reported to have said that \\"the devil has killed her\\" upon hearing the news. Burial Zona was buried on January 24, 1897 in the local cemetery now known as the Soule Chapel Methodist Cemetery. Shue showed great devotion toward the body, keeping a vigil at the head of the open coffin during the move. The body was 'laid out' in the Heaster's house. Soon his behavior began to arouse suspicion. During the wake, his grief changed repeatedly from overwhelming sadness to incredible energy. He allowed no one to come close to the coffin, especially while he was placing a pillow on one side of her head and a rolled-up sheet on the other. He explained these additions by saying that they would help his wife 'rest easier'. Shue also tied a large scarf at the corpse's neck, explaining tearfully that it 'had been Zona's favorite'. When it came time to move the corpse to the cemetery though, several people noticed that there seemed to be a strange looseness to Zona's head. For her part, Mary Jane Heaster was convinced that her son-in-law had murdered his wife. After the wake, she removed the sheet from inside the coffin and tried to return it to him, but he refused it. She noticed an odd odor about it, so she washed it; the water in the basin turned red when she dropped the sheet in. The sheet then turned pink and the water cleared. The stain could not be removed, which Mrs. Heaster interpreted as a sign that Zona had been murdered. She began to pray, and every night for four weeks kept up her prayers, hoping that Zona would return to her to explain what had happened. Haunting According to local legend, Zona appeared to her mother in a dream four weeks after the funeral. She said that Shue was a cruel man who abused her, and who had attacked her in a fit of rage when he believed that she had cooked no meat for dinner. He broke her neck; to prove this, the ghost turned her head around until it was facing backwards. Supposedly, the ghost appeared first as bright light, gradually taking form and filling the room with a chill. She is said to have visited Mrs. Heaster over the course of four nights. Exhumation and autopsy Armed with the story allegedly told to her by the ghost, Mary Jane Heaster visited the local prosecutor, John Alfred Preston, and spent several hours in his office convincing him to reopen the matter of her daughter's death. Whether he believed her story of the ghost is unknown, but he did have enough doubt to dispatch deputies to reinterview several people of interest in the case, including Dr. Knapp. He was likely responding to public sentiment, as numerous locals had begun suggesting that Zona had been murdered. Preston himself went to speak to Dr. Knapp, who stated that he had not made a complete examination of the body. This was viewed as sufficient justification for an autopsy, and an exhumation was ordered and an inquest jury formed. Zona's body was examined on February 22, 1897 in the local one-room schoolhouse. Shue had \\"vigorously complained\\" about this turn of events, but was required by law to be present at the autopsy. He responded that he knew he would be arrested, but that no one would be able to prove his guilt. The autopsy lasted three days, and found that Zona's neck had indeed been broken. According to the report, published on March 9, 1897, \\"the discovery was made that the neck was broken and the windpipe mashed. On the throat were the marks of fingers indicating that she had been choked. The neck was dislocated between the first and second vertebrae. The ligaments were torn and ruptured. The windpipe had been crushed at a point in front of the neck.\\" On the strength of this evidence, and his behavior at the inquest, Shue was arrested and charged with the murder of his wife. Trial Shue was held in the jail in Lewisburg while waiting for the trial to begin. During this time, more information about his past was coming to light. He had been married twice before: his first marriage had ended in divorce, with his wife accusing him of great cruelty; his second wife had died under mysterious circumstances less than a year after they were married. Zona was his third wife, and Shue began to talk of wishing to wed seven women; he freely spoke of this ambition while in jail, and told reporters that he was sure he would be let free because there was so little evidence against him. The trial began on June 22, 1897, and Mary Jane Heaster was Preston's star witness. He confined his questioning to the known facts of the case, skirting the issue of her ghostly sightings. Perhaps hoping to prove her unreliable, Shue's lawyer questioned Mrs. Heaster extensively about her daughter's visits on cross-examination. The tactic backfired when Mrs. Heaster would not waver in her account despite intense badgering. As the defense had introduced the issue, the judge found it difficult to instruct the jury to disregard the story of the ghost, and many people in the community seemed to believe it. Consequently, Shue was found guilty of murder on July 11 and sentenced to life in prison. However, according to reports accessed, the Greenbrier ghost was never mentioned by the prosecution and played no part in the case against Shue. A lynch mob was formed to take him from the jail and hang him, but the mob was disbanded by the deputy sheriff before any damage was done. Four of the mob's organizers later faced charges for their actions. Aftermath Shue was moved to the West Virginia State Penitentiary in Moundsville, where he lived for three more years. He died on March 13, 1900, the victim of an unknown epidemic, and was buried in an unmarked grave in the local cemetery. Mrs. Heaster never recanted her story of her daughter's ghost, and died in September 1916. As for Zona, her ghost was never seen in the area again. State historical marker The state of West Virginia has erected a state historical marker near the cemetery in which Zona Shue is buried. It reads: > Interred in nearby cemetery is Zona Heaster Shue. Her death in 1897 was > presumed natural until her spirit appeared to her mother to describe how she > was killed by her husband Edward. Autopsy on the exhumed body verified the > apparition's account. Edward, found guilty of murder, was sentenced to the > state prison. Only known case in which testimony from a ghost helped convict > a murderer. In popular culture Katie Letcher Lyle, a writer and an amateur historian, in her book The Man Who Wanted Seven Wives: The Greenbrier Ghost and the Famous Murder Mystery of 1897, gave a dramatized account of the Greenbrier Ghost. Lyle explained her conclusion in a 1999 issue of Wonderful West Virginia Magazine in which she said that Mary had probably made up the story of the ghost in order to make a compelling argument to open up her daughter's case. She said, \\"Mary knew [Shue] to be clever, unprincipled, and persuasive. If he'd murdered once, he could murder again. Perhaps she feared that if no one validated her accusations, Shue would prove extremely dangerous. So pretending to receive the news directly from Zona, she could appeal to the superstitions of her mountaineer neighbors and get a lot of public attention. As it turned out, she didn't need the ghost story, for Shue was convicted, according to every account, strictly on earthly considerations, without any unearthly ghosts.\\" The story of the Greenbrier Ghost is the subject of three stage adaptations. Jan Buttram's play Zona was produced in 1998 by Greenbrier Valley Theatre, the Year-Round State Professional Theatre of West Virginia. The Greenbrier Ghost, a full-length musical adaptation, was written by Cathey Sawyer (book and lyrics) and Joe Buttram (music). The show premiered in 2003 at Greenbrier Valley Theatre, with subsequent productions in 2004, 2009 and 2013.http://www.gvtheatre.org/#!__about-us/past-productions Another full- length musical adaptation of this story is \\"Greenbrier, 1897,\\" written and performed by Lovewell Institute for the Creative Arts. The musical debuted on June 28, 2018, and had performances on June 28-June 30 of 2018. A full video of the production can be found on Youtube. The Unquiet Grave by Sharyn McCrumb was published on September 12, 2017 by Atria Books (an imprint of Simon & Schuster) and is \\"based on the true story of one of the strangest murder trials in American history‚Äîthe case of the Greenbrier Ghost.\\" The Comedy Central show Drunk History profiled the Greenbrier Ghost and subsequent trial in the episode \\"Believe It Or Not\\" (season 6 episode 9).

B. antiquus is the most commonly recovered large mammalian herbivore from the La Brea tar pits. B. antiquus was taller, had larger bones and horns, and was 15-25% larger overall than modern bison. It reached up to 2.27 m (7.5 ft) tall, 4.6 m (15 ft) long, and a weight of 1,588 kg (3500 lb). From tip to tip, the horns of B. antiquus measured about 3 ft (nearly 1 m). B. antiquus skull One of the best educational sites to view in situ semifossilized skeletons of over 500 individuals of B. antiquus is the Hudson-Meng archeological site operated by the U.S. Forest Service, northwest of Crawford, Nebraska. A number of paleo-Indian spear and projectile points have been recovered in conjunction with the animal skeletons at the site, which is dated around 9,700 to 10,000 years ago. The reason for the \\"die-off\\" of so many animals in one compact location is still in conjecture; some professionals argue it was the result of a very successful paleo-Indian hunt, while others feel the herd died as a result of some dramatic natural event, to be later scavenged by humans. Individuals of B. antiquus of both sexes and a typical range of ages have been found at the site.Davis, L.B. and Wilson, M. (1978) \\"Bison procurement and utilization: A symposium,\\" Plains Anthropologist. Volume 23, Issue 82, Part 2. p 128.Agenbroad, L.D. (1978) The Hudson-Meng site: an Alberta bison kill in the Nebraska high plains. University Press of America. According to internationally renowned archaeologist George Carr Frison, B. occidentalis and B. antiquus, an extinct subspecies of the smaller present-day bison, survived the Late Pleistocene period, between about 12,000 and 11,000 years ago, dominated by glaciation (the Wisconsin glaciation in North America), when many other megafauna became extinct. Native Americans of the Plains and Rocky Mountains depended on these bison as their major food source. Frison noted, \\"[the] oldest, well-documented bison kills by pedestrian human hunters in North America date to about 11,000 years ago.\\" Excavation of B. antiquus were found in Washington State in recent years, with apparent fracture patterns on bones consistent with stone tools as opposed to carnivorous activity. https://qmackie.com/2010/04/24/orcas-bison/ References Further reading  * *  External links  * *Paleobiology Database - Bison antiquus Category:Bison Category:Extinct animals of the United States Category:Pleistocene even-toed ungulates Category:Pleistocene species extinctions Category:Prehistoric bovids Category:Prehistoric mammals of North America Category:Mammals described in 1852 Category:Fossil taxa described in 1852 Category:Extinct animals of Canada Category:Taxa named by Joseph Leidy ","title":"Bison antiquus"},{"id":"5642106","text":"David Cubberley is a Canadian politician, active in municipal, regional and provincial issues since 1990.

The storyline first aired in 1986 and although it was considered to be a failure on-screen, it nevertheless became a successful part of the serial's extensive merchandising industry that year, as it spawned two hit singles in the UK Music Charts. Storyline development and impact In 1986, the creators of EastEnders, scriptwriter Tony Holland and producer Julia Smith, decided to tackle \\"an important and complicated story about the ups and downs of a pop group.\\" The idea was considered to be an \\"interesting and major undertaking\\" in the serial. It featured the majority of teenage characters in the soap at the time. Prominent characters such as Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean), Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), Simon Wicks (Nick Berry) and Kelvin Carpenter (Paul J. Medford), were joined by several new characters, introduced especially for the storyline, including \\"lefty-student stereotype\\" Harry Reynolds (Gareth Potter). Actors such as Paul Medford, Letitia Dean and Nick Berry were musically trained, having attended London stage schools. They were chosen as the group's singers, and renamed themselves \\"The Banned\\" after their first gig got them kicked out of The Queen Victoria public house. The storyline proved to be a successful merchandising tool for the serial, as it spawned two hit singles in the \\"real world\\". Actor Nick Berry released a ballad entitled \\"Every Loser Wins\\" in October 1986, having previously sung the song in character on-screen (accompanied by a piano). The song was written and produced by Stewart and Bradley James, along with Simon May who famously composed the EastEnders theme tune. \\"Every Loser Wins\\" was a smash hit, reaching number 1 in the UK singles chart, where it stayed for three weeks, knocking Madonna's \\"True Blue\\" off the top spot. It was the second biggest- selling single in the UK that year after \\"Don't Leave Me This Way\\" by The Communards, and held the record as the highest climbing chart single ever until 2001, when it was eclipsed by \\"It's the Way You Make Me Feel\\" by Steps (which climbed from 72-2). \\"Every Loser Wins\\" sold over a million copies and earned composer Simon May an Ivor Novello award. The song \\"also provided levity\\" on-screen, when it was used as Lofty Holloway's (Tom Watt) break-up song after Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully) had jilted him at the altar. One critic has commented \\"[Lofty] played it to death. He played it so much it caused Dirty Den (Leslie Grantham) to ask whether he had any other records\\". The second song \\"Something Outa Nothing\\" (also performed in the on-screen serial) was released by Letitia Dean and Paul Medford. The song was a modest success, making number 12 in the UK singles chart in November 1986. Although the plot produced two hit singles in the real world, the actual storyline was not a great success with viewers. EastEnders creators Julia Smith and Tony Holland both felt it lacked credibility and branded it an experiment that failed. The plot has since been described as \\"an horrific scenario where fact and soap merged in messy fashion to give the fictional band a real-life hit with the appalling Something Out Of Nothing.\\" The songs, which \\"were recorded when the show was riding high on huge ratings success\\", have not aged well in critical opinion. A critic for The Guardian newspaper has commented that \\"The Banned\\" was EastEnders' \\"Eighties bid to add a pop angle to their socially conscious template\\", which \\"went down like the proverbial ton of bricks\\". The critic goes on to say: \\"Worse was the record; an acne-scarred 'song' of no merit whatsoever, called 'Something Out of Nothing'. You said it, kid.\\" In 2004, \\"Something Outa Nothing\\" was voted the 9th worst single ever released by a soap star. Though extremely popular at the time, \\"Every Loser Wins\\" has since been branded \\"a tuneless ode\\". Plot The band started life off- screen, where Simon Wicks (Nick Berry) and Eddie Hunter (Simon Henderson) were bandmates. Before Simon came to Walford, he had borrowed money from loan sharks for their band's musical equipment and was left owing them huge amounts of money that he couldn't pay back. Eddie was happy to leave Simon with the debt and disappeared to work at Suttons Holiday Camp in Clacton so the band dissolved. With the debts finally repaid, and needing an ally to support him in the new band, Simon contacts Eddie and asks him to join. The reformed group consist of Simon, Eddie, Kelvin Carpenter (Paul J. Medford), Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean), Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) and band manager Harry Reynolds. They initially call themselves Dog Market, after dismissing Sharon's \\"So So Reverso\\" and Simon's \\"Bottled Up\\", \\"Left Of Arthur\\" (a reference to Arthur Scargill), \\"Conjugal Rights\\" and Lofty's (Tom Watt) \\"The Harry Reynolds Quartet\\". Eddie is the lead guitarist. Kelvin's girlfriend, Tessa Parker (Josephine Melville), also wants to join, but she has no musical talent and is refused membership. They are due to have their debut in The Queen Victoria public house in August 1986, but after their enormous amplifier fuses the electricity in the pub during a performance of \\"Venus\\", publican Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) throws them out, shouting after them \\"You're banned!\\", after which the group change their name to The Banned. Simon and Harry constantly disagree with the direction the band is taking. Harry loses his argument to make the band a vehicle for communist propaganda and blames Wicksy for the band taking a more practical attitude. They all decide to enter a competition for young musicians, and both Harry and Simon vow to outdo each other by writing the best song to perform. The rest of the band all prefer Simon's song, \\"Something Outa Nothing\\", which infuriates Harry and he starts bad- mouthing him to the rest of the band, saying he is superfluous and a closet BBC Radio 2 listener. Simon then declares that the band has to choose between him and Harry, but as Harry owns all the instruments and equipment, they side with him and Simon quits. Simon writes his own solo song called \\"Every Loser Wins\\". He doesn't get very far however, and by the end of the year he gives up his dream of becoming a musician. Simon allows the band to continue using his song, \\"Something Outa Nothing\\", for the competition. The day of the competition comes and for some reason Harry, who is a political activist, decides to sabotage their performance by switching the cartridge in the synthesizer, wrecking any hopes the group have of getting anywhere. They are humiliated, and the rest of the band are furious when Harry confesses that he sabotaged their performance to show them up. Specially introduced characters As well as the regular characters featured in the storyline (Sharon, Simon, Ian and Kelvin), a number of new characters were introduced specifically for the duration of the storyline. =Harry Reynolds= Harry Reynolds, played by Gareth Potter, is a college friend of Kelvin Carpenter (Paul J.

Soon after his arrival, Harry, Kelvin and several other Walford youths decide to form a band. Harry is the manager, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) plays drums, Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean) and Kelvin provide vocals, Simon Wicks (Nick Berry) plays the keyboard and Eddie Hunter Simon Henderson is the lead guitarist. Harry and Kelvin decide that the band's music should demonstrate \\"decay in the capitalistic society\\" and have a strong political message. Simon and Harry begin to disagree with the direction the band is taking.

Both Harry and Tessa have radical Marxist beliefs and it isn't long before they manage to recruit Kelvin to the same way of thinking. Tessa soon discovers that she and Kelvin have more in common than their beliefs. She finds him attractive and they start dating. Their romance quickly fades when Kelvin becomes more interested in pop music than overthrowing the Thatcher government. He sings with a group known as Dog Market and its successor, The Banned. Tessa secretly wants to be in the group but she has no musical talent and is refused membership. She quietly leaves Albert Square when Kelvin tells her it is time for them to \\"pack it in\\".

The portrait was previously thought to be that of his cousin, Thomas Boleyn, but it has been officially identified as the 9th Earl of Ormond.David Starkey, Holbein's Irish Sitter, The Burlington Magazine, May 1981 James Butler, 9th Earl of Ormond and 2nd Earl of Ossory (Irish: S√©amas \\"Bacach\\" de Buitl√©ir) (149628 October 1546), known as The Lame, was the son of Piers Butler, 8th Earl of Ormond and Margaret Fitzgerald, Countess of Ormond. He was created, in 1535, Viscount Thurles, and was confirmed by Act of Parliament, 6 November 1541, in the Earldom of Ormond, as 9th Earl with the pre-eminence of the original earls. His death by poisoning in London has remained an unsolved mystery to this day. Marriage and children About 1520 James joined the household of Cardinal Wolsey, who praised him as a young gentleman \\"both wise and discreet\\". In early 1522, it was proposed by King Henry VIII that he marry his cousin Anne Boleyn, who was the great-granddaughter of Thomas Butler, 7th Earl of Ormond. This was to resolve a dispute her father Thomas Boleyn had with James's father Piers over the Ormond inheritance and title; Wolsey himself supported the proposal. The marriage negotiation came to a halt for unknown reasons.Antonia Fraser, The Six Wives of Henry VIII, pp. 121‚Äì124 He subsequently married Lady Joan Fitzgerald some time before 21 December 1532. Lady Joan was the daughter and heiress of the other great Munster landholder, the 10th Earl of Desmond and his wife Amy O'Brien. James and Joan had seven sons: * Thomas Butler, 10th Earl of Ormond, known as Black Tom (c. 153222 November 1614) * Sir Edmund Butler of Cloughgrenan (1534‚Äì1602) * John Butler of Kilcash (before 154610 May 1570) who married Katherine MacCartie, with issue. * Hon. Edward Butler of Ballinahinch, married Mary Bourke who was the daughter of Richard Burke, 4th Earl of Clanricarde and Frances Walsingham. They had a son, James Butler. * Walter Butler of Nodstown * James Butler of Duiske * Piers Butler of Grantstown Career During the early 1540s he gradually restored the Butler dynasty to their former position of influence, leading to antagonism from the quarrelsome Lord Deputy of Ireland, Sir Anthony St Leger. St Leger gave Ormonde command of the Irish forces in the Anglo-Scottish War of 1544. On the face of it this was an honour, but allies of Ormond accused St Leger of deliberately sending Ormond into danger.Robert Dudley Edwards Ireland in the Age of the Tudors Croom Helm London 1977 p.58 Ormond himself demanded an inquiry into claims that St Leger had planned his murder, and the matter was thought to merit a Privy Council investigation; the Council found in favour of St Leger and he and Ormond were ordered to work together amicably for the future.Dudley Edwards pp.58-9 Key allies of Ormond like John Alan and Walter Cowley were removed from office, and Ormond was struggling to maintain his standing when he was poisoned. Poisoning On 17 October 1546, James was in London with many of his household. They were invited to dine at Ely Palace in Holborn. He was poisoned along with his steward, James Whyte, and 16 of his household.Emerson He died nine days later, on 28 October, leaving Joan a widow in her thirties. It is surprising, in view of Ormond's high social standing, that no proper investigation into his death was carried out.Dudley Edwards p.58 Who was behind the poisoning remains a mystery. His host at the dinner, John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, though he could be notably ruthless towards his enemies, seems to have had no motive for the crime, as he is not known to have had any quarrel with Ormond.

At least two lead seals and an inscription found on a tower in Heraclea Pontica attest that he was the first of his family to use the style Megas Komnenos.Anthony Bryer, \\"David Komnenos and Saint Eleutherios\\", Archeion Pontou 42 (1988-1989), pp. 166f Œóe was the son of Manuel Komnenos and grandson of the Emperor Andronikos I. Capture of Trebizond David's life is not well-documented; the primary historian for the Empire of Trebizond, Michael Panaretos, fails to mention him even once. Because he was the brother of Alexios, we can deduce the names of some of his relatives: Their father was Manuel Komnenos, and their grandfather Byzantine Emperor Andronikos I. Their relative Tamar was queen of Georgia; exactly how David and Tamar were related is not clear. According to Michael Panaretos, Queen Tamar was Alexios' paternal relative (œÄœÅŒøœÇ œÄŒ±œÑœÅœåœÇ Œ∏Œµ·Ω∂Œ±); Cyril Toumanoff argued that their grandfather Andronikos had, while in Georgia, married an unnamed sister of king George III.Toumanoff, \\"On the Relationship between the Founder of the Empire of Trebizond and the Georgian Queen Thamar\\", Speculum, 15 (1940), pp. 299-312 More recently Michel Kur≈°anskis has argued against Toumanoff's theory, producing evidence that Alexios' mother and/or grandmother were daughters of the houses of Palaiologos or Doukas, yet failing to offer an explanation why Panaretos describes Tamar as Alexios' paternal aunt.Kur≈°anskis, \\"L'Empire de Tr√©bizonde et la G√©orgie\\", Revue des √©tudes byzantines, 35 (1977). pp. 237-256 Whatever the nature of their relationship, after the death of Emperor Andronikos and their father Manuel, Queen Tamar provided a refuge for the boys at the Georgian court, where presumably they were raised and educated.A. A. Vasiliev, \\"The Foundation of the Empire of Trebizond (1204-1222)\\", Speculum, 11 (1936), pp. 9-18 In April 1204, while Constantinople was occupied with the on-going conflict with the Fourth Crusade, David and Alexios occupied the city of Trebizond and raised the banner of revolt.Michael Panaretos, Chronicle, ch. 1.

Laskaris had neutralized rivals along his southern marches‚ÄîSabas Asidenos, Manuel Maurozomes, and Theodore Mangaphas, while frustrating the attempts of Henry of Flanders to expand the newly founded Latin Empire into Anatolia.Alice Gardiner, The Lascarids of Nicaea: The Story of an Empire in Exile, 1912, (Amsterdam: Adolf M. Hakkert, 1964), pp. 75-78 David dispatched his young general Synadenos with some soldiers to occupy the city of Nicomedia, which had been evacuated by the Latin Empire but Laskaris considered part of his domain, the Empire of Nicaea. Theodore Laskaris strategically circled around Synadenos, leading his men through a difficult pass, and fell upon his enemy's flank with complete surprise. Laskaris was prevented from following up this victory and force David's western frontier to recede further eastwards by the timely action of the Latins under Thierri de Loos of seizing Nicomedia. But a Bulgarian invasion of Thrace forced the Latins to withdraw.Miller, Trebizond, pp. 16f For their assistance, David rewarded the Latin Empire with shiploads of grain and hams. Then, considering how Laskaris had encouraged Sultan Kay Khusrau I to besiege Trebizond in 1205 or 1206, David petitioned the Latin Emperor to include him as his subject in his treaties and correspondence with Laskaris, and to treat his land as Latin territory. In the words of William Miller, \\"It was his interest to prefer a nominal Latin suzerainty to annexation by the Nicaean emperor.\\"Miller, Trebizond, p. 17 Once his position was thus secured, he crossed the Sangarios River with a body of about 300 Frankish auxiliaries, ravaged the villages subject to Laskaris, and took hostages from Plousias. David withdrew, but the Franks, incautiously advancing into the hilly country, were suddenly surprised by Andronikos Gidos, a general of Laskaris, in the Rough Passes of Nicomedia, and scarcely a man of them was left.Miller, Trebizond, p. 17 In 1208 Laskaris renewed his offensive against David Komnenos at Sangarios River and invested Heraclea Pontica. David responded by sending a messenger to the Latin emperor Henry of Flanders, who begged for help and warned the monarch that if Henry did not help him, David would suffer a serious defeat. Leaving his marshal in Adrianople to finish rebuilding the city, Henry then crossed the Sea of Marmara and occupied Nicomedia, threatening Laskaris' rear, which forced the latter to lift his siege and return to his own territory. Theodore's withdraw was costly, for he lost about 1000 men in crossing the Sangarios, which was in flood.Anthony Bryer, \\"David Komnenos and Saint Eleutherios\\", Archeion Pontou, 42 (1988-1989), p. 183 Henry's army might have seized more land in Bithynia, had not an abominably cold winter swept in preventing his troops from advancing any further.Henri de Valenciennes pg. 336 Despite this setback, Theodore did not abandon his attempts on Paphlagonia. Following the Seljuk defeat at Antioch on the Meander, he concluded a treaty with the new Seljuk Sultan, Kaykaus I, and together they encroached on the Trapezuntine territory.Kur≈°anskis, \\"Tr√©bizonde et les Turcs\\", p. 112 According to the panegyric of Niketas Choniates, there was no resistance to Theodore's incursions, and Theodore eventually captured Heraclea Pontica and Amastris.Shukurov, \\"The Enigma of David Grand Komnenos\\", Mesogeios, 12 (2001), p. 131; Bryer, \\"David Komnenos\\", p. 185 Here we lose sight of David; what exactly happened to David over the next few years is unknown. Vassiliev commented that the lack of reference to David Komnenos in the Treaty of Nymphaeum was evidence that his former suzerain had no further use for him and abandoned him in order to gain a peace with Theodore. Had Laskaris captured him, it would probably have been recorded in the histories. Earlier scholars, beginning with Jakob Philipp Fallmerayer, had placed the death of David during the siege of Sinope in 1214.Savvides (2009), p. 38 n. 39 It seems likely that David might have fled to the Latin emperor. As mentioned above, Michael Panaretos never mentions David, so he provides no help answering that question. More recently the truth of his fate was rediscovered: a marginal note written at Mount Athos records David died as a monk of Vatopedi monastery on 13 December 1212.Bryer, \\"David Komnenos\\", p. 184 But this evidence raises more questions than it answers, such as how did he become to reside there. Shukurov looks for the answer in Panaretos' silence, which he believes was intentional and therefore significant: David somehow disgraced himself and was confined to Vatopedi by Alexios.Shukurov \\"The Enigma\\", pp. 129f A clue to his offense may lie in William Miller's observation above referring to David's suzerainty to the Emperor of the Latin Empire, a hated enemy of Byzantines. Despite the attested flexibility of Byzantine ideology, his submission might have been too much for his brother to tolerate, and it was this that led to his downfall and confinement.

Founded to provide choirboys for the Choir of St George's Chapel, it now educates over 400 boys and girls. History The school was established to provide six choristers for the Choir of St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, which sings in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, which is the official country residence of the British Royal Family. St George's is one of the oldest schools in the country, and has provided an unbroken line of boy choristers to sing daily services in St George's Chapel since 1352. As late as 1942 the school was reported by its headmaster as being \\"for the sons of Gentlemen only\\". The school's choristers have sung at events such as the wedding of Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys- Jones, now the Countess of Wessex; the funeral of John Hunt, Baron Hunt; and also the Blessing of the Wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. Present day The seventeen full choristers live at the school, with about seven 'probationers' who are mostly day pupils. The choristers attend lessons at the school with the other children and rehearse each day before and after school in the Song School by the Chapel, where they also sing seven services each week during term time. Their school fees are partly met by grants from the Dean and Canons of Windsor. The school has a boarding community of thirty children, many of whom board on weekly or flexible arrangements. Most pupils have experienced some level of boarding before they leave at 13. The school buildings are situated just below the north wall of Windsor Castle, with the school being divided into three distinct sections ‚Äì the Pre-Prep (Nursery to Year 2) the Middle School (Years 3, 4 and 5) and the Senior School (Years 6, 7 and 8). The school has strong reputations in music, the performing arts and in sport. Nearly all pupils over the age of 7 learn an instrument, the vast majority of girls take part in ballet, tap or jazz dancing and there is a wide range of school choirs covering all age-groups. Although the school is a town centre school, spacious playing fields are situated next door to the school site, within the Queen's private grounds. Boys play football, rugby and cricket and the girls play netball, hockey, and rounders. Swimming in the school's indoor pool is an important activity ‚Äì in recent years the school has featured prominently in a number of National Prep School sporting competitions.

She first appeared in Millennium #2 (January 1988), and was created by Steve Engelhart and Joe Staton. Fictional character biography The creators of the Green Lantern Corps, the Guardians of the Universe, had planned to create their successors, a race of new Guardians. The Guardians foresaw that their successors were destined to originate on the planet Earth, so they channeled their vast powers into the \\"Millennium Project\\", gathering ten individuals together, teaching them about the nature of the cosmos and endowing them with immortality and metahuman powers. One of these was Celia Windward, a young Jamaican woman living in Great Britain, to whom the Guardians gave the power to control electromagnetic energies. She became Jet, and joined the other heroes the Guardians had made in the team named (appropriately enough) the New Guardians. Jet fought many foes, but contracted HIV fighting the \\"Hemo-Goblin\\". As her symptoms worsened into AIDS, she used her last bit of energy to repel an alien invasion, an act which claimed her life. One Year Later, Jet is apparently alive, and is leader of the Global Guardians. She has publicly renounced the actions of the Green Lanterns, saying that they violated the rules of foreign countries, and undermined her team's attempt to prove that metahumans can act without governmental restrictions. She has been assembling more non-American heroes, even forcing the new Crimson Fox to join her team. As seen in the pages of Green Lantern, Jet and her team were under the psychic thrall of two Faceless Hunters. Powers and abilities Jet has the ability to generate various forms of electromagnetic waves, such as microwaves, to use for a variety of uses. She can fire blasts of heat and force, generate electromagnetic pulses, move and manipulate metal with magnetic fields, fire blasts of electricity, and see in other frequencies of the spectrum besides visible light (such as ultraviolet and infrared). She can fly by \\"riding\\" the natural electromagnetic field of the Earth (via magnetic levitation). When she uses her powers, her hair resembles green flames, although she doesn't have any fire-related abilities.

The school was founded in 1927 by Fr. Justin Figas, OFM Conv. The school is operated under the jurisdiction of the Saint Anthony of Padua Province of the Order of Friars Minor Conventual and is accredited by the New York State Board of Regents and the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. Founding and development The Quad addition. In the foreground is Friar's Hall. One of the copper gnomes of the Chapel can be seen. In the upper left the original Justin Hall can be seen, and to the right is the most recent addition. The school's founder, Fr. Justin Figas, OFM Conv., wished to establish a secondary school for young men especially to serve the Polish- American immigrant community in Western New York. The Conventual Franciscans of the Saint Anthony of Padua Province already owned a parcel of land on the shore of Lake Erie in Athol Springs just outside Buffalo. The site was purchased in 1916 by Father Hyacinth Fudzinski. The land had previously been the estate of one \\"Dr. Pierce,\\" who developed pharmaceuticals around the start of the 20th century. In 1924 Father Justin assembled a group of Polish- American businessmen and local liturgical leaders to help raise funds and support for the construction of the school. This group became known as the \\"Father Justin Drivers,\\" or the \\"Justin Drivers.\\" The group was successful and in 1925 ground was broken for the new school in a ceremony held on 12 July 1925. Construction took sixteen months and Saint Francis High School was dedicated on 25 November 1926. In 1927 the first class was enrolled. The original structure built on campus is now called Friar's Hall. In May 1937 the school was found to meet all requirements of the Board of Regents of the State of New York. In 1943 the school became affiliated with the Catholic University of America in Washington, DC. In the 1940s there was a great increase in student enrollment, and Father Justin again saw the need to build. This time he planned to build a dormitory/gymnasium building with a tunnel linking to the original building. In 1946 Father Justin again assembled a group of \\"drivers\\" and four years later, in 1950, ground was broken on the new complex. The gymnasium was completed first on 2 September 1951, but the dormitories were not completed for another six years. The building is now known as Justin Hall. In the 1960s and 1970s reconstruction was done to the chapel, science labs, student dining room, residence facilities, offices, and gymnasium. The physical development of the institution also spurred development of the educational program. The school was able to offer a full college preparatory curriculum for students who lived on campus, and for students who commuted daily. Enrollment again increased and increased classroom space was needed. Classrooms were made in Justin Hall where resident living was once planned. At the same time, in the late 1970s and continuing into the 1980s, the number of resident students steadily decreased. By the late 1980s, only the top floor of Justin Hall was used for residence life. At the end of the 1988 school year, the Board of Directors terminated the residency program. In 1985 fundraising began for the construction an auditorium complex. In May 1987 ground was broken and on 29 October 1988 the John Ormsby Alumni Auditorium opened. The building was constructed adjacent to Justin Hall and includes a thrust stage with an orchestra pit in an 800-seat auditorium, a campus book store, a fitness center, and a boardroom. In 1995 the complex was completed with the construction of a band room, practice rooms, dressing rooms, offices, and storage space. In 1999 the campus was expanded with the acquisition of a parcel of land behind the school's football field on Big Tree Road. Practice fields and additional playing fields were constructed in that space.History of Saint Francis High School Retrieved March 10, 2018. The science labs in Friar's Hall were overhauled and modernized in 2003. In November 2004 an expansion of Justin Hall and the gymnasium began. In late 2005 construction was completed and the new facility included additional classrooms; separate locker-rooms for gym classes, home teams, opposing teams, and referees; an additional gym floor, and an athletic trainer's room. At the time of construction the campus traffic pattern was also changed. Previously traffic blowed between the two major complexes on campus, essentially forming a sea of parking and traffic. The update saw the addition of a 52-space parking lot on the Lake Erie side of Friar's Hall and the creation of a traditional grass quadrangle with walkways between Friar's and Justin Halls. In 2007, construction began on the new Mary Schneider Visual Arts Center located in the lower floor of Friar's Hall. It features of floor space and includes space for art classes and storage. Also included are a new classroom and a teachers' dining room. 2010 saw an update of the school's athletic facilities with the addition of new bleachers as well as a new press box on the football field. In 2010-2011 construction took place for new resident rooms. There are dorms for 26 residents along with an activities rooms. The dormatories opened in the 2011-2012 school year. Most recently, in 2015 construction started on a new athletic complex. The field was completed in October of 2015. The athletic building was completed in spring of 2016. The complex was funded by Brian Polian '93 for the field and the athletic complex by the Gaicoch family. The complex features home and away locker rooms, indoor and out door concessions, and a press box on the second floor.

In the historical center is a twelfth-century church, with a benefice barn and parsonage from the 16th century. History Bolligen is first mentioned in 1180 as Bollingin. Traces of a neolithic settlement were discovered in Burech. There are traces of an earthen fort of an indeterminate age above Flugbrunnen, along with medieval earthen forts at Grauholz and on the Bantiger. Bolligen, Muri bei Bern, Stettlen and Vechigen were the first villages to come under Bern's control as Bern began its expansion into a city-state. During the 13th and 14th centuries, representatives of Bern and the Kyburg Counts often met in Bolligen for negotiations. After the extinction of the Knights of Gerenstein, their castle, Gerenstein Castle and the Geristein farms passed into private ownership. The castle and farm passed through the hands of a number of wealthy Bernese citizens and several monasteries, including Interlaken Abbey and Thorberg Charterhouse. The city of Bern also continued to acquire rights around Bolligen. In 1345 it bought Habstetten from Berchtold of Thornberg. Following the Protestant Reformation in 1528, Bern secularized a number of monasteries around the Canton. From the Thorberg Chapterhouse they acquired the low court in Bolligen and from Interlaken Abbey the rights over Bolligen's church. The Grauholz-S√§delbach woods near Bolligen became a popular summer retreat for Bern's patrician families. An early example of these was the Wegm√ºhle house which was built in 1600 and then renovated in 1669. It was followed by the Hubelgut house in Habstetten in 1670 and in 1720 by the Lindeburg house. The village church of St. Niklaus was first mentioned in 1180. It was probably the family church of the Gerenstein family. The current church was built in the 12th or 13th century and expanded in the 15th century. In 1792-95 it was renovated and repaired. In 1274 Ulrich of Stein gave the patronage over the church to Interlaken Abbey. After the secularization of the Abbey in 1528, the church's patronage fell to Bern, who made it the parish church for Habstetten. The parish grew to include 30 villages, hamlets and farms with a population of 1,771 in 1764. In 1834, the political municipality was created from this large parish. Following a long running debate on whether to centralize (1930, 1945, 1963), incorporate in Bern (1913, 1919) or decentralize (1956, 1962, 1972), in 1978 the residents decided to divide the municipality into three independent municipalities; Bolligen, Ittigen and Ostermundigen. Beginning in the 18th century, farmers in Bolligen began to grow hay in addition to the traditional grain. The hay was sold to provide food during winter for the many dairy and cattle farms that were developing in the surrounding area. Also in the 18th century large industrial operations opened. These included; the quarries in Stockeren (1708-1918/49) and the paper mill in the Wegm√ºhle which opened in 1787 and converted into a grain mill in 1855. The municipality remained a mostly rural town until the agglomeration of Bern spread into Bolligen in 1950s transforming it. Agricultural land was replaced by shopping centers and housing developments. Many of the residents of the municipality commute to Bern for work and by 1990, over three-fourths of the workers were commuters. The expansion of the infrastructure has led, in part, to urbanization. Primary schools are located in Bolligen, Ferenberg and Geristein, along with a secondary school and a pre-Gymnasium in Bolligen.as well as in a secondary school and lower secondary school. Since 1913, following the example Worblental train. Geography Bantiger mountain with Bolligen in the foreground Bolligen has an area of . Of this area, or 43.3% is used for agricultural purposes, while or 44.0% is forested. Of the rest of the land, or 12.4% is settled (buildings or roads), or 0.2% is either rivers or lakes and or 0.1% is unproductive land.Swiss Federal Statistical Office-Land Use Statistics 2009 data accessed 25 March 2010 Of the built up area, housing and buildings made up 7.2% and transportation infrastructure made up 3.3%. Out of the forested land, all of the forested land area is covered with heavy forests. Of the agricultural land, 26.1% is used for growing crops and 14.8% is pastures, while 2.4% is used for orchards or vine crops. All the water in the municipality is flowing water. The municipality is located in the agglomeration of Bern. Bolligen lies northeast of Bern, its area connects the Worblental to the Emmental. The \\"Lutzere\\" mountains form the watershed boundary between the Emme River and the Aare River. In 1980 and 1983, the small but heavily populated towns of Ittigen and Ostermundigen divided from Bolligen to form independent municipalities. It consists of the village of Bolligen and the hamlets of Bantigen, Ferenberg, Flugbrunnen, Geristein and Habstetten. In the municipality is the Bantiger mountain (). The transmission tower of Swisscom located there supplies the surrounding region with radio and television programs. The mountain also provides a panorama of the Jura mountains, the Swiss plateau, and the Alps. On 31 December 2009 Amtsbezirk Bern, the municipality's former district, was dissolved.

Born in Katona, Hungary in 1900, Barcsay was a descendant of an aristocratic family from Transylvania. In 1919, he went to Budapest to begin his studies in the Fine Art School and graduated in 1924. The summer of 1926 was spent in Mak√≥ and H√≥dmez≈ëv√°s√°rhely, where he worked on the constructive structural powers in landscapes. In that year, he went to Paris for a year where he discovered the works of C√©zanne. His paintings greatly influenced the young artist. While in Italy in 1927, Barcsay learned about the Quattrocento movement of the early Renaissance, particularly the anatomical studies of the period. He became a resident of Szentendre after many visits and embarked on another fellowship to Paris in 1929 to understand the rules of cubism.

The name comes from the fact that there are five roads leading off The Square; the central part of the village on the main road. The five roads are: Rehoboth Road, Horeb Road, Heol Hen, and the entrance and exit of the main road, known as Ynys-y-Cwm Road on the Llanelli side and Eclipse Terrace on the Carmarthen side. There are two pubs, The Stag, situated centrally on the main road, and the Waun Wyllt 1/4 mile distant in the neighbouring hamlet of Horeb, which abuts Five Roads. The Stag pub is famous as the meeting place of the Rebecca Rioters who gathered there to plan raids in the 18th Century. Prior to its refurbishment in 2007 the pub operated a two-bar system with the names of the bar and lounge, reflecting its Rebecca Riots history, named the Dai'r Cantwr Bar and Shoni Sguborfawr Lounge after two of the ringleaders.

It is a division of the Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union of Australia. The Union has predominantly covered workers employed by Australia Post and Telstra, but has significantly expanded to cover contractors and workers employed by private sector firms in the postal, logistics, telecommunications and information technology industries. The Postal & Telecommunications branches within the CWU had their origins in the Australian Postal & Telecommunications Union (APTU). The APTU holds its origins in the Australian Letter Carriers' Association and the Australian Telegraph, Telephone Construction & Maintenance Union (later known as the Australian Postal Linesmen Union of Australia) which were both registered federally in 1912. In 1924 the Australian Letter Carriers' Association changed its name to the Commonwealth Public Service Fourth Division Employees' Union of Australia only to amalgamate a year later with the Postal Sorters' Union of Australia and the Australian Postal Linesmen Union of Australia to form the Amalgamated Postal Linesmen Sorters' & Letter Carriers' Union of Australia. From 1926 it was known as the Amalgamated Postal Workers' Union (APWU), covering postmen, sorters and linesmen. The APWU served until 1974 when it changed its name to the Australian Postal & Telecommunications Union as a result of a further amalgamation with the Union of Postal Clerks and Telegraphists. From 1990 the Union amalgamated with the Australian Postmasters‚Äô Association and later the Postal Supervisory Officers' Association to eventually be known as the Communication Workers‚Äô Union and later to be joined by the Australian Telecommunications Employees Association/Australian Telephone & Phonogram Officers Association (ATEA/ATPOA) and the Telecommunication Officers Association (TOA).

Romero's Italian- American film Dawn of the Dead, (1978) or Lucio Fulci's Italian film Zombi 2 (1979). The latter was itself falsely marketed by the Italian distributor as a sequel to the former, against the wishes of both Romero and Fulci. A confusing history has emerged from the practise of retitling films for release in different countries, in which a given film may have a different title in each country in which it is released. In Britain, these films were released as the Zombie Flesh Eaters series. In North America, these same films became known as the Zombie series. For the European release of Romero's Dawn of the Dead, the film was re-edited by Dario Argento, and re-scored by Goblin, and retitled Zombi. Following its success, a zombie film by Lucio Fulci that was already in production was retitled Zombi 2, to appear as an ersatz sequel. A series of increasingly tenuous efforts by various producers to capitalize on the Zombi name ensued.Russell, Jamie. Book of the Dead. FAB Press, 2005 .

Since World War I, to conduct indirect artillery fire, three distinct components have evolved in this organization: the forward observer (FO), the Fire Direction Center (FDC) and the Firing Unit, sometimes referred to as the gun line. On the battlefield, the field artillery team consists of some combinations of all of these elements. In other words, there may be multiple FOs calling in fire on multiple targets to multiple FDCs and any component may be in communication with some of the other elements depending on the situational requirements.  Motivation  Modern artillery batteries shoot at targets measured in distances of kilometers and miles, a hundredfold increase in range over 18th century guns. This dramatic range increase has been driven by the ongoing development of rifled cannons, improvements in propellants, better communications, and technical improvements in gunnery computational abilities. Since a modern enemy is engaged at such great distances, in most field artillery situations, because of weather, terrain, night-time conditions, distance or other obstacles, the soldiers manning the guns cannot see the target that they are firing upon. The term indirect fire is therefore used to describe firing at targets that gunners cannot see, as opposed to observed direct fire. In most cases, the target is either over the horizon or on the other side of some physical obstruction, such as a hill, mountain or valley. Since the target is not visible, these gunners have to rely on a trained artillery observer, also called a forward observer, who sees the target and relays its coordinates to their fire direction center. The fire direction center, in turn, uses these coordinates to calculate a left-right aiming direction, an elevation angle, a number of bags of propellant, and a time before exploding (if necessary) for the fuse. The fuse is then mated to the artillery projectile. Organization =Reconnaissance and Advance Party= An often overlooked but very critical component of the Field Artillery team is the Advance Party. The Advance Party consists of the Battery Commander, his Driver, First Sergeant, Gunnery Sergeant, FDC Guide, Gun Guides, and Communications Representatives. Initially, the Party looks to find suitable positions for an artillery unit to perform fire missions from. Then they perform what is known as route reconnaissance. The primary purpose of this reconnaissance is to determine the suitability of the route of the units movement. Items to be analyzed include possible alternate routes, cover, concealment, location of obstacles, likely ambush sites, contaminated areas, route marking requirements, and the time and distance required to traverse the route. Several factors are taken into consideration. Once a location is determined, and having arrived at the new position, the advance party conducts a security sweep and prepares the position for occupation. The purpose of the advance party security with METT-T and the absence of enemy troops, mines, booby traps, NBC hazards, and so on. If these threats or conditions are present in the proposed position area, the advance party breaks contact with any enemy forces or marks minefield and hazards and moves on to find another position area. The battery commander can coordinate for additional assets, or augment the advance party with internal assets, to provide the additional ability to clear areas of small enemy forces, obstacles, and minefields. Natural cover must be used to the maximum. Security is continuous throughout advance party operations. Once a location is determined to be safe, the advance party prepares the position for eventual howitzer emplacement. This consists of several procedures, such as escorting each howitzer to its prepared position, setting up communications, providing the unit with its initial azimuth of fire, and providing each gun with an initial deflection. This entire process is covered in U.S. Army Field Manual 6-50 Chapter 2. =Forward Observer (FO)= Because artillery is an indirect fire weapon, the forward observer must take up a position where he can observe the target using tools such as maps, a compass, binoculars and laser rangefinders/designators, then call back fire missions on his radio or other communication device. This position can be anywhere from a few hundred meters to 20‚Äì30 km distant from the guns. Modern day FOs are also called Fire Support Specialist's trained in calling close air support, naval gunfire support and other indirect fire weapons systems. Using a standardized format, the FO sends either an absolute position or a position relative to another point, a brief target description, a recommended munition to use, and any special instructions, such as \\"danger close\\" (warning that friendly troops are close to the target, requiring extra precision from the guns). Firing begins with an adjustment phase where only a single gun fires, and if the rounds are not accurate, the FO will issue instructions to adjust fire in four dimensions (three spatial and one temporal). When the degree of accuracy is acceptable, the FO will then typically call \\"fire for effect\\", unless the objective of that fire mission is something other than suppression or destruction of the target. A \\"Fire For Effect\\" or \\"FFE\\" calls for all of the guns or tubes to fire a round. The FO does not talk to the guns directly - he deals solely with the FDC. The forward observer can also be airborne; one of the original roles of aircraft in the military was airborne artillery spotting. =Fire Direction Center (FDC)= The fire direction center concept was developed at the Field Artillery School at Ft. Sill, Oklahoma, during the 1930s under the leadership of its Director of Gunnery, Carlos Brewer and his instructors, who abandoned massing fire by a described terrain feature or grid coordinate reference. They introduced a firing chart, adopted the practice of locating battery positions by survey, and designated targets with reference to the base point on the chart. In the spring of 1931, the Gunnery Department successfully demonstrated massing battalion fire using this method, which was used extensively by field artillery during World War II. Typically, there is one FDC for a battery of six guns, in a light division. In a typical heavy division configuration, there exists two FDC elements capable of operating two four gun sections, also known as a split battery. The FDC computes firing data, fire direction, for the guns. The process consists of determining the precise target location based on the observer's location if needed, then computing range and direction to the target from the guns' location. This data can be computed manually, using special protractors and slide rules with precomputed firing data. Corrections can be added for conditions such as a difference between target and howitzer altitudes, propellant temperature, atmospheric conditions, and even the curvature and rotation of the Earth. In most cases, some corrections are omitted, sacrificing accuracy for speed. In recent decades, FDCs have become computerized, allowing for much faster and more accurate computation of firing data. =Firing Unit= The FDC will transmit a warning order to the firing unit, followed by orders specifying the type of ammunition, fuze setting and propelling charge, bearing, elevation, and the method of adjustment or orders for fire for effect (FFE). Elevation (vertical direction) and bearing orders are specified in mils, and any special instructions, such as to wait for the observer's command to fire relayed through the FDC. The crews load the howitzers and traverse and elevate the tube to the required point, using either hand cranks (usually on towed guns) or hydraulics (on self-propelled models). Parent battalion and US Army brigade/USMC regimental FDCs FDCs also exist in the next-higher parent battalion that \\"owns\\" 2‚Äì4 artillery batteries. Once again, an FDC exists at the US Army brigade or USMC regimental level that \\"owns\\" the battalions. These higher-level FDCs monitor the fire missions of their subordinate units and will coordinate the use of multiple batteries or even multiple battalions in what is called a battalion or brigade/regimental mission. In training and wartime exercises, as many as 72 guns from three battalions may all be coordinated to put \\"steel on the target\\" in what is called a \\"brigade/regimental time on target\\" or brigade/regimental TOT for short. The rule is \\"silence is consent\\", meaning that if the lower unit does not hear a \\"cancel the mission\\" (don't shoot) or even a \\"check firing\\" (cease firing) order from the higher monitoring unit, then the mission goes on. Higher-level units monitor their subordinate unit's missions for both active as well as passive purposes. Higher level units also may get involved to coordinate artillery fire across fire support coordination boundaries (often parallel lines on maps) where one unit can not fire into without permission from higher and/or adjacent units that \\"own\\" the territory. Direct fire exceptions to usual mission of artillery indirect fire Artillery gunners are taught how to use direct fire to engage a target such as mounted or dismounted troops attacking them. In such a case, however, the artillery crews are able to see what they are shooting at. With indirect fire, in normal artillery missions, the crews manning the guns cannot see their target directly, or observers are doing that work for them. There have been exceptions to this situation, but even when US Marines assaulted Iwo Jima during World War Two, and gunners could see the impact of their rounds on Mt. Suribachi, the actual adjustment of their fire was accomplished by forward observers directly supporting and attached to infantry units, because they were in the position not only to see the enemy but to prevent friendly fire incidents and to coordinate shelling the Japanese with their infantry unit's movements.

Shannon's classic paper \\"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\\" in the Bell System Technical Journal in July and October 1948. In this revolutionary and groundbreaking paper, the work for which Shannon had substantially completed at Bell Labs by the end of 1944, Shannon for the first time introduced the qualitative and quantitative model of communication as a statistical process underlying information theory, opening with the assertion that :\\"The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point, either exactly or approximately, a message selected at another point.\\" With it came the ideas of * the information entropy and redundancy of a source, and its relevance through the source coding theorem; * the mutual information, and the channel capacity of a noisy channel, including the promise of perfect loss-free communication given by the noisy-channel coding theorem; * the practical result of the Shannon‚ÄìHartley law for the channel capacity of a Gaussian channel; and of course * the bit - a new way of seeing the most fundamental unit of information. Before 1948 = Early telecommunications = Some of the oldest methods of telecommunications implicitly use many of the ideas that would later be quantified in information theory. Modern telegraphy, starting in the 1830s, used Morse code, in which more common letters (like \\"E\\", which is expressed as one \\"dot\\") are transmitted more quickly than less common letters (like \\"J\\", which is expressed by one \\"dot\\" followed by three \\"dashes\\"). The idea of encoding information in this manner is the cornerstone of lossless data compression. A hundred years later, frequency modulation illustrated that bandwidth can be considered merely another degree of freedom. The vocoder, now largely looked at as an audio engineering curiosity, was originally designed in 1939 to use less bandwidth than that of an original message, in much the same way that mobile phones now trade off voice quality with bandwidth. =Quantitative ideas of information= The most direct antecedents of Shannon's work were two papers published in the 1920s by Harry Nyquist and Ralph Hartley, who were both still research leaders at Bell Labs when Shannon arrived in the early 1940s. Nyquist's 1924 paper, \\"Certain Factors Affecting Telegraph Speed\\", is mostly concerned with some detailed engineering aspects of telegraph signals. But a more theoretical section discusses quantifying \\"intelligence\\" and the \\"line speed\\" at which it can be transmitted by a communication system, giving the relation :W = K \\\\log m \\\\, where W is the speed of transmission of intelligence, m is the number of different voltage levels to choose from at each time step, and K is a constant. Hartley's 1928 paper, called simply \\"Transmission of Information\\", went further by using the word information (in a technical sense), and making explicitly clear that information in this context was a measurable quantity, reflecting only the receiver's ability to distinguish that one sequence of symbols had been intended by the sender rather than any other‚Äîquite regardless of any associated meaning or other psychological or semantic aspect the symbols might represent. This amount of information he quantified as :H = \\\\log S^n \\\\, where S was the number of possible symbols, and n the number of symbols in a transmission. The natural unit of information was therefore the decimal digit, much later renamed the hartley in his honour as a unit or scale or measure of information. The Hartley information, H0, is still used as a quantity for the logarithm of the total number of possibilities. A similar unit of log10 probability, the ban, and its derived unit the deciban (one tenth of a ban), were introduced by Alan Turing in 1940 as part of the statistical analysis of the breaking of the German second world war Enigma cyphers. The decibannage represented the reduction in (the logarithm of) the total number of possibilities (similar to the change in the Hartley information); and also the log-likelihood ratio (or change in the weight of evidence) that could be inferred for one hypothesis over another from a set of observations. The expected change in the weight of evidence is equivalent to what was later called the Kullback discrimination information. But underlying this notion was still the idea of equal a-priori probabilities, rather than the information content of events of unequal probability; nor yet any underlying picture of questions regarding the communication of such varied outcomes. =Entropy in statistical mechanics= One area where unequal probabilities were indeed well known was statistical mechanics, where Ludwig Boltzmann had, in the context of his H-theorem of 1872, first introduced the quantity : H = - \\\\sum f_i \\\\log f_i as a measure of the breadth of the spread of states available to a single particle in a gas of like particles, where f represented the relative frequency distribution of each possible state. Boltzmann argued mathematically that the effect of collisions between the particles would cause the H-function to inevitably increase from any initial configuration until equilibrium was reached; and further identified it as an underlying microscopic rationale for the macroscopic thermodynamic entropy of Clausius. Boltzmann's definition was soon reworked by the American mathematical physicist J. Willard Gibbs into a general formula for statistical-mechanical entropy, no longer requiring identical and non-interacting particles, but instead based on the probability distribution pi for the complete microstate i of the total system: : S = -k_\\\\text{B} \\\\sum p_i \\\\ln p_i \\\\, This (Gibbs) entropy, from statistical mechanics, can be found to directly correspond to the Clausius's classical thermodynamic definition. Shannon himself was apparently not particularly aware of the close similarity between his new measure and earlier work in thermodynamics, but John von Neumann was. It is said that, when Shannon was deciding what to call his new measure and fearing the term 'information' was already over-used, von Neumann told him firmly: \\"You should call it entropy, for two reasons. In the first place your uncertainty function has been used in statistical mechanics under that name, so it already has a name. In the second place, and more important, no one really knows what entropy really is, so in a debate you will always have the advantage.\\" (Connections between information- theoretic entropy and thermodynamic entropy, including the important contributions by Rolf Landauer in the 1960s, are explored further in the article Entropy in thermodynamics and information theory). Development since 1948 The publication of Shannon's 1948 paper, \\"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\\", in the Bell System Technical Journal was the founding of information theory as we know it today. Many developments and applications of the theory have taken place since then, which have made many modern devices for data communication and storage such as CD-ROMs and mobile phones possible. Notable later developments are listed in a timeline of information theory, including: * The 1951, invention of Huffman encoding, a method of finding optimal prefix codes for lossless data compression. * Irving S. Reed and David E. Muller proposuing Reed‚ÄìMuller codes in 1954. * The 1960 proposal of Reed‚ÄìSolomon codes. * In 1966, Fumitada Itakura (Nagoya University) and Shuzo Saito (Nippon Telegraph and Telephone) develop linear predictive coding (LPC), a form of speech coding. * In 1968, Elwyn Berlekamp invents the Berlekamp‚ÄìMassey algorithm; its application to decoding BCH and Reed‚ÄìSolomon codes is pointed out by James L. Massey the following year. * In 1972, Nasir Ahmed proposes the discrete cosine transform (DCT). It later becomes the most widely used lossy compression algorithm, and the basis for digital media compression standards from 1988 onwards, including H.26x (since H.261) and MPEG video coding standards, JPEG image compression, MP3 audio compression, and Advanced Audio Coding (AAC). * In 1976, Gottfried Ungerboeck gives the first paper on trellis modulation; a more detailed exposition in 1982 leads to a raising of analogue modem POTS speeds from 9.6 kbit/s to 33.6 kbit/s * In 1977, Abraham Lempel and Jacob Ziv develop Lempel‚ÄìZiv compression (LZ77) * In the early 1980s, Renuka P. Jindal at Bell Labs improves the noise performance of metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) devices, resolving issues that limited their receiver sensitivity and data rates. This leads to the wide adoption of MOS technology in laser lightwave systems and wireless terminal applications, enabling Edholm's law. * In 1989, Phil Katz publishes the \`.zip\` format including DEFLATE (LZ77 + Huffman coding); later to become the most widely used archive container. * In 1995, Benjamin Schumacher coins the term qubit and proves the quantum noiseless coding theorem.

Wind-dried fish remains popular in Iceland. Icelandic cuisine, the cuisine of Iceland, has a long history. Important parts of Icelandic cuisine are lamb, dairy, and fish, the latter due to Iceland being surrounded by ocean. Popular foods in Iceland include skyr, hangikj√∂t (smoked lamb), kleinur, laufabrau√∞, and bollur. √ûorramatur is a traditional buffet served at midwinter festivals called √ûorrabl√≥t; it includes a selection of traditionally cured meat and fish products served with r√∫gbrau√∞ (dense dark and sweet rye bread) and brenniv√≠n (an Icelandic akvavit). The flavors of this traditional country food originates in its preservation methods; pickling in fermented whey or brine, drying, and smoking. Modern Icelandic chefs usually emphasise the quality of available ingredients rather than age-old cooking traditions and methods. Numerous restaurants in Iceland specialise in seafood. At the annual Food and Fun chef's competition (held since 2004), competitors create innovative dishes with fresh ingredients produced in Iceland. Points of pride are the quality of the lamb meat, seafood, and (more recently) skyr. Other local ingredients include seabirds and waterfowl (including their eggs), salmon and trout, crowberry, blueberry, rhubarb, Iceland moss, wild mushrooms, wild thyme, lovage, angelica, and dried seaweed, as well as a wide array of dairy products. Because of the history of settlement in a harsh climate, animal products dominate Icelandic cuisine. Popular taste has been developing, however, to become closer to the European norm. As an example, consumption of vegetables has greatly increased in recent decades while consumption of fish has diminished, yet is still far higher than any other developed country at about quadruple the average.Tillaga til √æings√°lyktunar um a√∞ger√∞ir til a√∞ b√¶ta heilbrig√∞i √çslendinga me√∞ hollara matar√¶√∞i og aukinni hreyfingu. [Whitepaper on \\"ways of improving the health of Icelanders through better nourishment and exercise\\"], Acts of the 131st Legislature of Iceland, 2004-05, case 806 () History The roots of Icelandic cuisine are to be found in the traditions of Scandinavian cuisine, as Icelandic culture, from its settlement in the 9th century onwards, is a distinctly Nordic culture with a traditional economy based on subsistence farming. Several events in the history of Iceland were of special significance for its cuisine. With Christianisation in 1000 came the tradition of fasting and a ban on horse meat consumption. More significantly in terms of farming and food supply was the onset of the Little Ice Age in the 14th century. Farmers were not able to grow barley anymore and had to rely on imports for any kind of cereal grains. The cooling of the climate also led to important changes in housing and heating: the longhouse of the early settlers, with its spacious hall, was replaced by the Icelandic turf houses with many smaller rooms, including a proper kitchen. This type of dwelling was used well into the 20th century. Historians often use the Reformation in 1517 as the transition between the Middle Ages and the early modern period in Icelandic history. Farming in Iceland continued with traditional practices from the 14th century to the late 18th century, when reforms were made due to the influence of the Enlightenment. A trade monopoly instituted by the Danish king in 1602 had a certain effect on culinary traditions. But the cuisine of Denmark had the most influence in the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th, when the country had close relations to Iceland. In the early 20th century, an economic boom based on commercial fishing and processing resulted in a slow transition from traditional dairy and meat-based foods to consumption of fish and root vegetables. Preserved foods began to be replaced with greater emphasis on fresh ingredients. =Medieval Iceland= Interior of a recreated medieval longhouse at L'Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland When Iceland was settled by immigrants from Scandinavia and Viking colonies in the British Isles, they brought their farming methods and food traditions of the Norse world. Research indicates that the climate of Iceland was much milder during the Middle Ages than it is now, and sources tell of cultivation of barley and oats. Most of this would have been consumed as porridge or gruel or used for making beer. Cattle was the dominant farm animal, but farms also raised poultry, pigs, goats, horses and sheep. The poultry, horse, sheep and goat stocks first brought to Iceland have since developed in isolation, unaffected by modern selective breeding. Therefore, they are sometimes called the \\"settlement breed\\" or \\"viking breed\\". Preservation methods Fermented shark, h√°karl, is an example of a culinary tradition that has continued from the settlement of Iceland in the 9th century to this day. Fish was stored in salt, and before the Black Death, Iceland exported stockfish to the fish market in Bergen. However, salt seems to have been less abundant in Iceland than in Norway. Saltmaking, which was mostly done by boiling sea water or burning seaweed, gradually disappeared when overgrazing caused a shortage of firewood in most parts of the country in the 14th century. Instead of curing with salt, the people of Iceland began to preserve meat in fermented whey. This method was also known from Norway but acquired little significance there. Archeological digs in medieval farms have revealed large round holes in storage rooms where the barrel containing the lactic acid was kept. Two medieval stories tell of men who save their lives in a burning house by staying submerged inside the acid barrel. Medieval Icelanders used fermentation for preserving both fish and meat, a method that greatly alters the taste of the food, making it similar to very strong cheese. Fermentation is still used to cure shark (see h√°karl), skate and herring. Fermented eggs are a regional delicacy, rarely found nowadays. The practice of smoking and drying meat and fish was also practiced, although the drying of meat was seen as somewhat of a last resort. Cheese Cheese was made from goat and sheep milk as well as cow milk. Skyr, a soft yogurt-like cheese eaten with spoons, was originally a tradition brought to Iceland from Norway. It has survived only in Iceland. The whey left over when making skyr was made to go sour and used for storing meat. It is likely that the predominance of skyr in Icelandic cuisine caused the disappearance of other cheesemaking traditions in the modern era, until industrial cheesemaking started in the first half of the 20th century. Cheesemaking was part of seter-farming (seljab√∫skapur), living in mountain huts in the highlands in late spring. Here farmers could separate the kids/lambs from their mothers in order to milk the adults. They often made cheese while still in the highlands. Flavors would reflect the new grasses. Cooking and meals Two Icelandic drinking horns from around 1600 in the Danish National Museum. The longhouses of the first settlers usually included a long fire in the center to warm the house. Around it, holes were dug in the floor to be used as earth ovens for baking bread and cooking meat. Women would place dough or meat in the hole along with hot embers from the fire, and cover it tightly for the time needed. They boiled liquids in wooden staved churns by putting hot stones from the fire directly into the liquid (a practice that continued to the modern age). Low stone hearths surrounded the fire, but mostly the cooking was done on the floor. In the 14th century, Icelandic turf houses were developed and gradually replaced the longhouses. They had a kitchen with a raised stone hearth for cooking called hl√≥√∞ir. The cooling of the climate during the Little Ice Age made it impossible to grow barley, and sheep replaced the more expensive cattle as predominant livestock. Iceland became dependent on imports for all cereals. Due to a shortage of firewood, the people turned to peat, dung, and dried heather for fuels. In medieval Iceland the people ate two meals during the day, the lunch or dagver√∞ur at noon, and supper or n√°ttver√∞ur at the end of the day. Food was eaten from bowls. Wooden staved tankards with a hinged lid were used for drinking. Later these were developed into the bulging casks, called askar used for serving food. The upper class used elaborately carved drinking horns on special occasions. Spoons were the most common eating utensil, made of horn or bone, and often decorated with carvings. Except for feasts, where tables would be laid, people ate their food from their laps, while sitting on their beds, which lined the outer wall of the longhouse. In addition to processing crops and meats and cooking, the farmer's wife apportioned the food among the family and friends. In richer households this role was entrusted to a special butler called bryti. =Early modern period= Icelandic subsistence farming from the Middle Ages well into the 20th century was restricted by the short production period (summer) compared to the long cold period. Apart from occasional game, the food produced in the three months of summer (including preserving meats and cheeses) had to suffice for nine months of winter. Researchers have estimated that, based on these methods of subsistence, Iceland could support a population of around 60,000. For centuries, farming methods changed very little, and fishing was done by men using hooks and lines from rowboats constructed from driftwood. Farmers also owned the boats, so fishing was limited to periods when the farmhands were not needed for farm work. Fish was not just a food, but a trade good, and it was exchanged for products brought by foreign merchant ships. The people were dependent on trade for cereals, such as rye and oats, transported to Iceland by Danish merchants. Until the 19th century, the vast majority of Icelandic farmers were tenant farmers on land owned by the Icelandic landowner elite, the Catholic church, or (especially after the confiscation of church lands during the Reformation) the king of Denmark. Tenant farmers used surplus fish, tallow, and butter to pay the landowner his dues. Considerable regional variation in subsistence farming developed according to whether people lived close to the ocean or inland. Also, in the north of the country, the main fishing period coincided with the haymaking period in the autumn. This resulted in underdevelopment of fishing because labor was devoted to haymaking. In the South, by contrast, the main fishing period was from February to July. Some historians have described Icelandic society as a highly conservative farming society. Because of the demand for farmhands in the short summers, tenant farmers and landowners opposed the formation of fishing villages. Fishing was considered risky compared to farming, and the Al√æingi passed many resolutions restricting or forbidding landless tenants from living in coastal villages to pursue fishing. Foreign trade Cooking eggs and small game and even baking in hot springs is a peculiar feature of Icelandic cuisine. Given the dominance of subsistence farming in Iceland, there was a lack of specialisation and commerce among farms. As testified in some of the Icelandic sagas, domestic trade seems to have been suspect as a type of usury from the age of settlement. Trade with foreign merchant ships was lively, however, and vital for the economy, especially for cereals and honey, alcohol, and (later) tobacco. Fishing ships from the coastal areas of Europe stopped for provisions in Icelandic harbors and traded what they had with the locals. This would include stale beer, salted pork, biscuits, and chewing tobacco, sold for knitted wool mittens, blankets, etc. Merchant ships put in occasionally from Holland, Germany, England, Scotland, Ireland, France and Spain, to sell their products, mainly for stockfish. It is prominently displayed in the royal seal of Iceland. In 1602 the Danish king, worried about the activities of English and German ships in what he considered to be territorial waters, instituted a trade monopoly in Iceland, restricting commerce to Danish merchants. They were required to regularly send merchant ships to Iceland carrying trade goods needed by the country. While illegal trade flourished in the 17th century, from 1685 the government instituted stricter measures to enforce the monopoly. It flourished until 1787. As a result, Iceland farmers grew a type of rye predominant in Denmark, and brenniv√≠n, an akvavit produced from rye, was introduced. These products displaced other cereals and beer. Cereals A quern-stone from Scotland. Similar stones were used in Iceland for grinding corn into flour. Different types of bread were considered a luxury among common people, although they were not uncommon. The corn bought from the merchant would be ground using a quern-stone (called kvarnarsteinn in Icelandic) and supplemented with dried dulse (seaweed) and lichens. Sometimes it was boiled in milk and served as a thin porridge. The porridge could be mixed with skyr to form skyrhr√¶ringur. The most common type of bread was a pot bread called r√∫gbrau√∞, a dark and dense rye bread, reminiscent of the German pumpernickel and the Danish rugbr√∏d, only moister. This could also be baked by burying the dough in special wooden casks in the ground close to a hot spring and picking it up the next day. Bread baked in this manner has a slightly sulphuric taste. Dried fish with butter was served with all meals of the day, serving the same purpose as the \\"daily bread\\" in Europe. Cooking and meals From the 14th century, food was prepared in the kitchen on a raised stone hl√≥√∞ir or hearth. Hooks were placed above in order to hold the pots at the desired height above the fire. Ovens were rare, as these required much firewood for heating. Baking, roasting and boiling were all done in cast iron pots, usually imported. The two meals of the medieval period were replaced by three meals in the early modern period; the breakfast (morgunskattur) at around ten o'clock, lunch (n√≥nmatur) at around three or four in the afternoon, and supper (kv√∂ldskattur) at the end of the day.Hallger√∞ur G√≠slad√≥ttir (2000), Eldamennska √≠ √≠slensku torfb√¶junum [Cooking in the Icelandic turf houses], Bygg√∞asafn Skagfir√∞inga, pp. 23. In the Icelandic turf houses people ate sitting on their beds, which lined the room. Food was served in askar, low and bulging wooden staved casks with a hinged lid and two handles, often decorated. Spoon food was served from the cask, and dry food placed on the open lid. Each household member had a personal askur for eating from and was responsible for keeping it clean. =Modernity= Women producing stockfish for export in Reykjav√≠k in the 1910s. M√≥√∞uhar√∞indin, arguably the greatest natural disaster to have hit Iceland after its settlement, took place in 1783. Ten years earlier, a ban on Danish merchants residing in Iceland had been lifted and five years later the trade monopoly was ended. Some of the Danish merchants became residents, and some Icelanders became merchants themselves. During the Napoleonic Wars (1803‚Äì1815), there was a shortage of trade goods as merchant ships were diverted by war. Forced to self-reliance, Icelanders began to emphasize production and consumption of local vegetables raised during the short growing season. In the 19th century, nationalism and schools for women were influential in formalising traditional methods and shaping modern Icelandic cuisine. Danish influence The first written cookbooks to be published in Icelandic were collections of Danish recipes published in the 18th century. They were intended to introduce the upper-class cuisine from Denmark-Norway to their peers in Iceland. The recipes sometimes had a \\"commoner version\\", using less expensive ingredients for farmhands and maids. The cuisine of Denmark influenced Iceland well before that through trade. In addition, Danish merchants who settled in Iceland, after the ban was lifted in 1770, often ran large households characterised by a mixture of Danish and Icelandic customs. Reykjav√≠k, which developed as village by the end of the 18th century, began to grow and became a center of a melting pot of Icelandic and Danish culinary traditions. Fishing villages formed in the 19th century, many located by the trading harbours, which previously had featured little more than a natural harbour and a locked warehouse nearby. The Danish influence was most pronounced in pastry-making, as there were few native traditions in this craft. Ethnic Danish bakers began to operate around the start of the 20th century in both Reykjav√≠k and Akureyri. Some Danish pastry- making traditions have survived longer in Iceland than in Denmark. Vegetables In the late 17th century, some farmers cultivated the first vegetable gardens, but growing vegetables did not become common until the early 19th century, when the Napoleonic Wars resulted in the merchant ships staying away. Resident Danes, who brought the tradition of vegetable gardens with them, were usually the first to start growing vegetables. Popular early garden vegetables included hardy varieties of cabbage, turnip, rutabaga, and potato. They were generally prepared in Iceland as boiled accompaniments to meats and fish, and sometimes mashed with butter. Girls' schools In the first half of the 20th century, many home economics schools, intended as secondary education for girls, were instituted around Iceland. Within these schools, during a time of nationalistic fervor, many Icelandic culinary traditions were formalised and written down by the pupils. They were published in large recipe compendia a few years later. Later emphasis on food hygiene and the use of fresh ingredients was a novelty in a country where culinary traditions had been based on preserving food for long term use. The modern economy began to expand, based on commercial export of seafood. The modern generation rejected many traditional foods, embracing the concepts of \\"freshness\\" and \\"purity\\" associated with ingredients from the sea, especially when marketed abroad. During the urbanisation boom of the late 1940s, many Icelanders formed regional associations in Reykjav√≠k. Together as fraternity, they revived some old culinary and other rural traditions. These associations organised midwinter festivals, where they started serving \\"Icelandic food\\", traditional country foods served in a buffet. This was later called √ûorramatur. The cooperatives In the beginning of the 20th century, farmers living near the towns would sell their products to shops and directly to households, often under a subscription contract. (This is similar to the concept of Community Supported Agriculture in some United States cities since the late 20th century.) To deal with the Great Depression in 1930, the Iceland government instituted state monopolies on various imports, including vegetables. They granted the regional farmers' cooperatives, most of them founded around the start of the 20th century, a monopoly on dairy and meat production for the consumer market. This meant that smaller private producers were out of business. The large cooperatives were believed able to implement economies of scale in agricultural production. They invested in production facilities meeting modern standards of food hygiene. These cooperatives still dominate agricultural production in Iceland and are almost unchallenged. They pioneered new cheesemaking techniques based on popular European varieties of gouda, blue cheese, camembert, etc. Cheesemaking (apart from skyr) had been nearly extinct in Iceland since the 18th century. The cooperatives have driven product development, especially in dairy products. For instance, they market whey-based sweet drinks and variations of traditional products. One of these is \\"Skyr.is\\", a creamier, sweeter skyr, which has boosted the popularity of this age-old staple. Fishing Fishing on an industrial scale with trawlers started before World War I. Fresh fish became a cheap commodity in Iceland and a staple in the cuisine of fishing villages around the country. Until around 1990, studies showed that Icelanders were consuming much more fish per capita than any other European nation. Since then, however, steeply rising fish prices have caused a decline in consumption. Types of food = Fish = Icelanders consume fish caught in the waters of the North Atlantic Ocean. Fresh fish can be had all the year round. Icelanders eat mostly haddock, plaice, halibut, herring, and shrimp. H√°karl H√°karl (meaning 'shark' in Icelandic) is putrescent shark meat, which has been preserved. It is part of the √æorramatur, the traditional seasonal Icelandic foods. It is often accompanied by brenniv√≠n, a local schnapps. =Meat= An Icelandic sheep. Traditionally, domestic sheep, the most common farm animal in Iceland, was the primary source of meat. Sheep were also used for their milk and wool, and were worth more alive than dead. When a sheep was slaughtered (usually the young rams and infertile ewes), most or all of the carcass was used for making food, which was carefully preserved and consumed. Traditionally lambs are slaughtered in the autumn, when they are more than three months old and have reached a weight of almost 20 kg. After Christianisation, horses were eaten only as a last resort. After the middle of the 18th century, attitudes changed. Horse meat, usually salted and served boiled or in bj√∫gu, a form of smoked sausage, has been common in Iceland since the 19th century. Icelandic beef is usually of top quality with good marbling due to the cold climate. Icelandic cattle are grass-fed and raised without growth hormones and drugs. However, the lack of tradition for eating beef has resulted in sales of lower quality meat, forcing buyers to be careful. Game A puffin hunter in Vestmannaeyjar. Small game in Iceland consists mostly of seabirds (puffin, cormorant and great black-backed gull) and waterfowl (mallard, greylag goose and pink-footed goose). The meat of some seabirds contains fish oil. It is placed in a bowl of milk overnight to extract the oil before cooking. Ptarmigan is also found in Iceland, but hunting of them has been banned because of dramatically declining stocks since the late 20th century. Ptarmigan, served with a creamy sauce and jam, has been a traditional Christmas main course in many Icelandic households. Seal hunting, especially the more common harbor seal, was common everywhere farmers had access to seal breeding grounds. Seal was considered an important commodity. Whereas mutton was almost never eaten fresh, seal meat was usually eaten immediately, washed in seawater, or conserved for a short time in brine. Seal meat is not commonly eaten anymore and is rarely found in stores. Systematic whaling was not possible in Iceland until the late 19th century, due to the lack of ocean- going ships. Small whales were hunted close to the shore with the small rowboats used for fishing. Beached whales were also eaten. The Icelandic word for beached whale, hvalreki, is still used to mean a stroke of good luck. When Iceland started commercial whaling (mostly minke whales) in the early 20th century, whale meat became popular as a low-priced red meat. It can be prepared in much the same manner as the more expensive beef. When Iceland withdrew from the International Whaling Commission in 1992, commercial whaling stopped. Some whale meat was still sold in specialised stores, coming from small whales that had beached or been accidentally caught in nets. In 2002 Iceland rejoined the IWC, and commercial whaling recommenced in 2006. Whale meat is commonly available again, although the price has gone up due to the cost of whaling. Reindeer were introduced in Iceland in the late 18th century and live wild on the moorlands in the eastern farthing. A small number are killed by hunters each autumn. Their meat is sold in stores and prepared in restaurants most of the year. Reindeer meat is considered a special delicacy and is usually very expensive. Limits on meat imports Minke whale on a stick, at the Sea Baron restaurant in Reykjavik Harbour area, Iceland Importing raw meat to Iceland is strictly regulated and dependent on specific licenses issued to importers. The government has feared contamination. Due to Iceland's isolation, most of the stocks of domestic animals raised in Iceland have no resistance to some diseases common in neighboring countries. For this reason, tourists are banned from bringing in even cured ham or sausage with them; these are confiscated by customs officers. =Dairy products= Dairy products are very important to Icelanders. The average Icelander consumes about of dairy products in one year. =Fruits and vegetables= Vegetable production and consumption is steadily growing, with production going from around 8,000 tonnes in 1977 to almost 30,000 tonnes in 2007.\\"Heyfengur og uppskera gr√¶nmetis, korns og gar√∞√°vaxta 1977-2007\\", Hagstofa √çslands, 2008 (). The cold climate reduces the need for farmers to use pesticides. Vegetables such as rutabaga, cabbage and turnips are usually started in greenhouses in the early spring, and tomatoes and cucumbers are entirely produced indoors. Iceland relies on imports for almost any type of sweet fruit except for berries. Since the early 20th century, it has again been possible to grow barley for human consumption in a few places, for the first time since the Middle Ages. =Bread and pastry= Kleina Sn√∫√∞ur Modern Icelandic bakeries offer a wide variety of breads and pastry. The first professional bakers in Iceland were Danish and this is still reflected in the professional traditions of Icelandic bakers. Long-time local favorites include sn√∫√∞ur, a type of cinnamon roll, usually topped with glaze or melted chocolate, and sk√∫ffukaka, a single-layer chocolate cake baked in a roasting pan, covered with chocolate glaze and sprinkled with ground coconut. A variety of layer cake called randal√≠n, randabrau√∞ or simply lagkaka has been popular in Iceland since the 19th century. These come in many varieties that all have in common five layers of cake alternated with layers of fruit preserve, jam or icing. One version called v√≠narterta, popular in the late 19th century, with layers of prunes, became a part of the culinary tradition of Icelandic immigrants in the U.S. and Canada. Traditional breads, still popular in Iceland, include r√∫gbrau√∞, a dense, dark and moist rye bread, traditionally baked in pots or special boxes used for baking in holes dug near hot springs, and flatkaka, a soft brown rye flatbread. A common way of serving hangikj√∂t is in thin slices on flatkaka. Other breads include skonsur which are soft breads, and Westfjord Wheatcakes (Vestfirskar hveitik√∂kur). Traditional pastries include kleina, a small fried dough bun where the dough is flattened and cut into small trapezoids with a special cutting wheel (kleinuj√°rn), a slit cut in the middle and then one end pulled through the slit to form a \\"knot\\". This is then deep-fried in oil.Kleina is mentioned in one of the first cookbooks printed in Icelandic, Einfaldt Matreidslu Vasa-Qver fyrir heldri manna H√∫ss-freyjur by Marta Mar√≠a Stephensen from 1800 Laufabrau√∞ (lit. \\"leafbread\\"), a very thin wafer, with patterns cut into it with a sharp knife and ridged cutting wheels and fried crisp in oil, is a traditional Christmas food, sometimes served with hangikj√∂t. Feasts =Christmas dishes= Decorating laufabrau√∞ (leaf bread) is a Christmas tradition in many Icelandic homes. In Iceland the Christmas dinner is traditionally served on Christmas Eve. Traditional main courses are hangikj√∂t (smoked lamb), hamborgarhryggur (salted pork rib) and various types of game, especially ptarmigan stew, puffin (sometimes lightly smoked) and roast greylag goose where these are available. These are usually accompanied by a b√©chamel or mushroom sauce, boiled potatoes and peas, pickled beetroot or red cabbage and jam. A traditional dessert is rice pudding with raisins, topped with ground cinnamon and sugar called j√≥lagrautur (\\"Yule pudding\\"). On December 23 (mass of Saint Thorlak) there is a tradition (originally from the Westfjords) to serve fermented skate with melted tallow and boiled potatoes. Boiling the Christmas hangikj√∂t the day after serving the skate is said to dispel the strong smell which otherwise tends to linger around the house for days. In the weeks before Christmas many households bake a variety of cookies to keep in store for friends and family throughout the holidays. These include pipark√∂kur, a type of ginger biscuits often decorated with colored glaze. Laufabrau√∞ is also fried some days before Christmas and decorating it is for many an occasion for holding a family gathering. =√ûorramatur= A typical √ûorramatur assortment. The concept of √ûorramatur was invented by a restaurant in Reykjav√≠k in 1958 when they started advertising a platter with a selection of traditional country food linking it to the tradition of √ûorrabl√≥t popular since the late 19th century. The idea became very popular and for older generations the taste of the food will have brought back fond memories of growing up or spending summers in the countryside before World War II and the urbanisation boom. In recent years, however, √æorramatur has come to represent the supposed strangeness and peculiarity of traditional Icelandic food, and its very mention will send shivers down the spine of many modern Icelanders, overlooking the fact that many commonplace foods are also traditional though not generally thought of as part of the √æorramatur category. =Birthdays, weddings, baptisms and confirmations= These are the various occasions for inviting the extended family to a lunch or \\"afternoon tea\\" called kaffi in Icelandic, as filter coffee is usually served rather than tea. Traditional dishes include the kransakaka of Danish origin and various types of brau√∞terta, similar to the Swedish sm√∂rg√•st√•rta with filling of e.g. shrimp, smoked salmon or hangikj√∂t and liberal amounts of mayonnaise between layers of white bread. Also popular for large family gatherings are various types of sponge cake, topped with fresh or canned fruit, whipped cream, marzipan and meringue. This tradition is satirised in an often-quoted passage from Halld√≥r Laxness's novel, Under the Glacier, where the character Hnall√æ√≥ra insists on serving multiple sorts of sumptuous cake for the bishop's emissary at all meals. Her name has become a byword for this type of cake.

The California portion of US 50 runs east from Interstate 80 (I-80) in West Sacramento to the Nevada state line in South Lake Tahoe. A portion in Sacramento also has the unsigned designation of Interstate 305. The western half of the highway in California is a four-or-more-lane divided highway, mostly built to freeway standards, and known as the El Dorado Freeway outside of downtown Sacramento. US 50 continues as an undivided highway with one eastbound lane and two westbound lanes until the route reaches the canyon of the South Fork American River at Riverton. The remainder of the highway, which climbs along and out of the canyon, then over the Sierra Nevada at Echo Summit and into the Lake Tahoe Basin, is primarily a two-lane road. The US 50 corridor is a historic one, used by many 49ers who came to California during the Gold Rush as well as the Pony Express. In 1895, part of the present-day route was designated as California's first state highway, and it was later designated as one of two routes of the Lincoln Highway across the Sierra Nevada. Much of US 50 was constructed during the initial construction of the California state highway system. Route description US 50 begins in West Sacramento, where I-80 leaves the West Sacramento Freeway onto a bypass of Sacramento. The old route of I-80 through Sacramento is signed as US 50 and Business 80 in the western section and Business 80 (Capital City Freeway) in the eastern section. Business 80 overlaps US 50 on the West Sacramento Freeway to the split with SR 275, then over the Sacramento River on the Pioneer Memorial Bridge and across I-5 to SR 99. Beginning in 2016, signs on this section are being updated to remove references to Business 80 and instead sign the route only as US Highway 50.http://caltrans.ca.gov/hq/esc/oe/project_ads_addenda/03/03-4F7104/plans/03-4f7104_plans.pdf US 50 is part Interstate Highway as well, carrying the unsigned designation of Interstate 305 from I-80 to its interchange with SR 99. Eastbound U.S. Route 50 in Sacramento Descending eastbound into the Lake Tahoe Basin Placerville, South Lake Tahoe, and the east end of the route in Ocean City, Maryland Lake Tahoe Boulevard. Here the route leaves California and enters Nevada (Nevada territory would be at the bottom). A tiny portion of Lake Tahoe is visible in the upper right corner Highway 50 winds down Echo Summit At the US 50/Business 80/SR 99 interchange, Business 80 splits to the north, SR 99 heads south, and US 50 continues east as the El Dorado Freeway and the Lincoln Highway. This freeway parallels Folsom Boulevard and the American River east-northeasterly through the suburb of Rancho Cordova to Folsom. Entering El Dorado County, US 50 continues eastward through the foothills of the Sierra Nevada via El Dorado Hills, Cameron Park, and Shingle Springs to downtown Placerville. The freeway ends, and US 50 has several at- grade intersections in Placerville, including SR 49. Leaving Placerville, the expressway through town starts, only to end several miles later. The final section of freeway begins near Camino, where the Lincoln Highway splits from US 50, and ends at the east end of Pollock Pines. Just east of Pollock Pines, US 50 continues as an undivided conventional highway with one eastbound lane and two westbound lanes, entering the river canyon of the South Fork American River near Riverton and crossing to the north side of the river near Ice House Road. From Ice House Road to the crest of the Sierras, US 50 is a steadily rising mostly two-lane road, staying just north of the river except for a 1995 cutoff that crosses the river twice in quick succession west of Kyburz, the boyhood home of ski racer Spider Sabich. Several hairpin turns take the highway up a grade east of Strawberry, after which US 50 continues east alongside the river to its source at Echo Summit. Echo Summit is the highest elevation U.S. Route 50 reaches in California at . In 1968, it was the site of the U.S. Olympic trials for men's track and field, held at a temporary facility in the parking lot of the Nebelhorn ski area. From Echo Summit down to the Lake Tahoe Basin, the roadway slowly descends the side of a steep hill; it then curves northeast to its south junction with SR 89 (which heads south to Luther Pass) beginning co-signing of SR 89, and then turns northward near the city of South Lake Tahoe. Where US 50 and SR 89 split, at an intersection known as \\"The Y\\", the former turns east on the four-lane Lake Tahoe Boulevard, which it follows to and along the south shore of Lake Tahoe, then it enters the state of Nevada. US 50 has been added to the California Freeway and Expressway System by the state legislature, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. The highway east of SR 49 is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System, and has been recognized as such except within the South Lake Tahoe city limits, meaning that it is a substantial section of highway passing through a \\"memorable landscape\\" with no \\"visual intrusions\\", where the potential designation has gained popular favor with the community. History =Emigrant trails and wagon roads= The earliest roads used by Europeans to cross the Sierra Nevada into California were branches of the California Trail. The first route near the present US 50 was the Carson Route, laid out in 1848 by an eastward Mormon party that wanted to avoid the Truckee Route and its deep crossings of the Truckee River. The group left Pleasant Valley, southeast of Placerville, on July 3, following Iron Mountain Ridge up to the crest of the Sierra at Carson Pass and then descending through Carson Canyon into the Carson Valley. Along the Humboldt River in Nevada, the Mormons met Joseph B. Chiles, who was leading a westward wagon train to California, and told him of their new trail. Although this new Carson Route crossed two summits ‚Äî Carson Pass over the crest of the Sierra and West Pass over the Carson Spur just to the west, these crossings were easier than Donner Pass on the Truckee Route, and only three fords of the Carson River were required. The route became the primary westward route into California at the start of the Gold Rush. Through California, the general alignment of the Carson Route, in terms of today's highways, was State Route 88 over Carson Pass and Mormon Emigrant Trail and Sly Park Road to Pleasant Valley. John Calhoun Johnson of Placerville surveyed and cleared a shorter, lower (and thus less snow-covered) trail east from that town in 1852, completing the work by the summer. Rather than following the ridge to the Sierra's crest as the Mormons had, Johnson headed eastward to the South Fork American River, crossing to its north side near the present Pacific Ranger Station in order to follow Peavine Ridge around a rocky stretch of the river. Returning to the river between Kyburz and Strawberry, he then continued alongside it to the crest at Johnson Pass, where a steep slope descended to Lake Tahoe. Within Nevada, his route generally followed the lake to Glenbrook, where it turned inland and crossed the Carson Range over Spooner Summit into the Carson Valley near Carson City. This trail, known as Johnson's Cut-off, generally followed the present US 50, with notable deviations only just east of Placerville (via Carson Road), over Peavine Ridge (roughly following Peavine Ridge Road, some trails, and Wrights Lake Road), just east of Strawberry (via Slippery Ford Road), over the crest of the Sierra (via Johnson Pass Road and Meyers Road), south of Lake Tahoe (via Pioneer Trail), east of Lake Tahoe (via Genoa Peak Road), and from Spooner Summit into the Carson Valley (via Kings Canyon Road). By 1854, Bartlett's Bridge had been built at the trail's westernmost crossing of the American River, allowing wagons to follow the cutoff; it was soon washed away by a freshet on March 7, 1855, and replaced by Brockliss Bridge, several miles to the east. Due to an improvement of the road through Carson Canyon on the old Carson Route, most travelers ended up turning southeast from Johnson Pass over Luther Pass (present SR 89) to join the older route northeast of Carson Pass rather than following the cutoff along Lake Tahoe.. Johnson's Cut-off was the only trail that could be used year-round, but it still had problems, as it had been built without use of earth-moving equipment, and thus did not always take the optimal route. The state adopted a survey by Sherman Day in September 1855, but failed to make use of it. Two years later, the counties of Yolo, Sacramento, and El Dorado, all of which would be benefited by further improvements, began planning and carrying out work. The state legislature created a \\"Board of Wagon Commissioners\\" on March 8, 1858, and it completed the improvements by the end of that year. This new route had better grades than the old cutoff, deviating from it in several places: it followed the present Smith Flat Road rather than Carson Road east of Placerville, traversed Peavine Ridge much further down the slope, returning to the river west of Kyburz (roughly via the present White Meadows Road, Ice House Road, and Weber Mill Road to US 50 at Granite Springs Road), and crossed into Carson Valley via Luther Pass. By 1860, the immense traffic over the road and lack of maintenance had worsened it to the point that it could no longer be used by stagecoaches.. To provide for better maintenance, improvements funded by tolls were authorized. The first of these was built and operated by Kingsbury and McDonald, who improved the old Johnson's Cut-off between Johnson Pass and Stateline, where they turned east over Daggett Pass (now SR 207) in Nevada, connecting Lake Tahoe to the Carson Valley via a shorter route than that over Luther Pass. Two other competing toll roads soon opened across the Carson Range: one built by Rufus Walton from Spooner Summit down Clear Creek to the valley (now part of US 50), and an 1863 improvement of the original Johnson's Cut-Off along the lake, across Spooner Summit, and through Kings Canyon to Carson City. West of Johnson Pass, the Slippery Ford Grade down to Strawberry was rebuilt by George W. Swan. The first toll-supported bypass of Peavine Ridge was built by Oglesby and opened in 1861, leaving the old road from Placerville at Pollock Pines, following the ridgetops and slopes south of the South Fork American River, crossing the river east of White Hall, and then following US 50 along the north bank to the 1858 county road west of Kyburz. Johnson began work on a lower-grade replacement on the north side of the river in 1864, but stopped when Pearson and McDonald opened a road over the present alignment of US 50, leaving the pre-1861 main road southwest of Brockliss Bridge and following US 50, across the river at Riverton, to Oglesby's road east of White Hall. Toll collection ended in California in 1886, when El Dorado County bought the privately improved sections and made them public roads.. West of Placerville, the wagon road headed south to Diamond Springs, where it turned west along the original Carson Route over relatively gentle terrain to Sacramento, generally following the present US 50 on parallel surface roads, such as Pleasant Valley Road and White Rock Road. The Pony Express used this route from its beginning in April 1860 until July 1, when its western terminus became Folsom on the Sacramento Valley Railroad. (The route was further cut back to Placerville, where messages were passed to the telegraph, from July 1861 to its discontinuance in October.) The Placerville and Sacramento Valley Railroad reached Latrobe in 1864, Shingle Springs (on the old Carson Route west of Placerville) in 1865, and was finally completed to Placerville in 1888. As the railroad extended east, the western terminus of the stage lines followed; the completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad in 1869 took most of the traffic off the Placerville wagon road. =State maintenance and reconstruction= The 1901 bridge at Riverton At the dawn of the automobile era, the state legislature authorized California's first state road on March 26, 1895, by creating the post of \\"Lake Tahoe Wagon Road Commissioner\\" to maintain the road from Newtown Road near Smith Flat (just east of Placerville) to Nevada. The county deeded the 58-mile (93 km) road to the state on February 28, 1896. Funding was only enough for minimal improvements, including a new stone bridge over the South Fork American River at Riverton in 1901. The Department of Engineering took over its maintenance in 1907, immediately completed a survey and posted granite milestones that marked the distance from Placerville, and in 1910 started sprinkling the dirt road with water in summer to keep down dust (as had been done in the 1860s). A 1915 law added the short distance from Smith Flat west to the east limits of Placerville to the state road.. With the passage of the first state highway bond issue in 1910, the Department of Engineering was directed to lay out and construct a system connecting all county seats. Placerville, seat of El Dorado County, was connected to Sacramento by the Route 11, which followed Folsom Boulevard from Sacramento to Folsom, Bidwell Street and Placerville Road to White Rock, the old Carson Route to El Dorado, and Forni Road and Placerville Drive to Placerville. Between El Dorado and Placerville, the state had two routes to choose from, including one via Diamond Springs (present SR 49), where it decided improving a cut would be too expensive. Instead, it chose the \\"O'Keefe grade\\" (Forni Road), following the old road for about 4 miles (6 km) and then building a cutoff (now part of Placerville Drive) to the Green Valley road. In 1917 the mileage that had been added by special laws, rather than as part of bond issues, was consolidated with the rest of the system, and Route 11 was extended east to the state line. (The route was extended farther, from Sacramento southwest to Antioch via present SR 160, in 1933.: \\"Walnut Creek- Stockton Road near Antioch to Sacramento.\\": \\"Route 11 is from Route 75 near Antioch to the Nevada State line near Lake Tahoe via Sacramento, Folsom, Placerville and Sportsman's Hall.\\") The third bond issue, passed in 1919, included funds for the improvement of 10 miles (16 km) from Placerville east to Sportsman's Hall, by which time paving was complete west of Placerville. Westbound at the bottom of the 1947 grade to Echo Summit The Lincoln Highway, one of the earliest marked highways across the country, split in two over the Sierra Nevada. The main route followed the present I-80 alignment over Donner Pass, but an alternate \\"Pioneer Branch\\", designated as part of the initial routing in 1913, turned south at Reno, Nevada to Carson City and then crossed the Sierras via Johnson Pass and the Placerville route. Contrary to the Lincoln Highway Association's policy of marking the most direct route, this deviation was explained simply as \\"for those tourists desiring to see Lake Tahoe\\". However, it actually became shorter in 1921, when the Fallon Cut-off opened from Carson City directly east to the main route near Fallon, bypassing Reno. The U.S. Highway system was created in 1926, and this route (along with the main Lincoln Highway east of the cutoff) became part of U.S. Route 50. (The Donner Pass route was U.S. Route 40, crossing Nevada on the Victory Highway.) US 50 initially ended in Sacramento, where motorists could follow US 40 (Victory Highway) southwest to the San Francisco Bay Area or turn south over US 99 to Stockton and take US 48 (Lincoln Highway) west over Altamont Pass. Originally, US 48 was a road connecting the San Francisco Bay area with the San Joaquin Valley, traveling from San Jose to near Modesto, largely following the future routing of US 50, which replaced US 48. Its western terminus was located near the present location of the Interstate 238/Interstate 880 interchange. It generally followed the route of current Interstate 580 to the Interstate 205 junction. From here, US 48 continued east on Interstate 205, then followed Old Highway 50 (present I-205 Bus.) through Tracy, thence to Interstate 5. It then followed Interstate 5 to SR 120, where US 48 followed SR 120 to the old location of the SR 99/SR 120 interchange (present day intersection of Main and Yosemite in Manteca), the location of its eastern terminus. At this time, US 50 was improved but unpaved east of Placerville. As part of the state project to pave this portion, the old road was bypassed in several areas, completing the final two-lane alignment. These realignments included Broadway, bypassing Smith Flat Road, at Smith Flat (1932), a new route around Slippery Ford Grade east of Strawberry (1931), and a new route through South Lake Tahoe, leaving behind Pioneer Trail (1931). The crossing of the Sierra crest at Johnson Pass was bypassed in 1940 by a better- quality route over Echo Summit; the lower part of the current road east of the summit opened in 1947, bypassing Meyers Road. West of Placerville, several major two-lane relocations were built. A bypass (now Mother Lode Drive) around El Dorado and the winding Forni Road was completed in 1938, and the improvement was extended west to Shingle Springs in 1947. A short relocation north of White Rock, between Bidwell Street and Bass Lake Road, opened in 1940, and was extended west beyond Hazel Avenue, bypassing Folsom, in 1949. (road data updated later, since it shows the completed bypass) Extension to San Francisco By the early 1930s, US 50 had been extended to San Francisco via the former US 48 by overlapping US 99 from Sacramento to Stockton and replacing US 48 over Altamont Pass to US 101E (Foothill Boulevard at Castro Valley Boulevard) near Hayward. It was extended over the new Bay Bridge at the time of its opening in 1936, replacing US 101E on Foothill Boulevard and the present MacArthur Boulevard to the Bay Bridge Distribution Structure in Oakland. As the new MacArthur Freeway (now I-580) was constructed, US 50 was moved to it. This extension was officially eliminated in the 1964 renumbering,: \\"Route 50 is from Route 80 in Sacramento to the Nevada state line near Lake Tahoe via Placerville.\\" but it remained on maps and signs for several more years before being replaced by I-80 over the Bay Bridge, I-580 over Altamont Pass, I-205 business route through Tracy, I-5 to Stockton, SR 4 (Charter Way) and SR 26 through Stockton, and SR 99 to Sacramento. =Freeway and expressway upgrades= When the California Freeway and Expressway System was created in 1959, it included US 50 from Sacramento to Nevada. (The Oakland-Sacramento portion was also included, mostly as part of the Interstate Highway System.): \\"US 50 from Sacramento to the Nevada state line.\\" Two segments had already been upgraded to freeway or expressway standards ‚Äî an expressway through Placerville, championed by its mayor Alexander Howison Murray Jr. and completed in 1955, and a freeway bypass of Camino with an expressway continuing west to Five Mile Terrace, completed in 1957. From Pollock Pines east to the bridge at Riverton, the road was widened to four lanes in about 1960. The next decade saw the improvement of every remaining two-lane section between Rancho Cordova (near Sunrise Boulevard) and Riverton, with the final section, connecting Bass Lake Road and Shingle Springs, opening in July 1970. The freeway was completed west to I-80 (now Business 80) and SR 99 in early 1973, bypassing the mostly four-lane Folsom Boulevard. US 50 was extended west along former I-80 to the new I-80 bypass in 1981, when the old I-80 became Business 80. Since Business 80 was not a valid legislative designation, the remainder became State Route 51.: \\"Route 50 is from Route 80 west of Sacramento to the Nevada state line near Lake Tahoe via Placerville.\\" For many years, the four lanes from Sacramento stopped at Riverton, where the original two-lane road continued through the canyon and over Echo Summit. The state rejected a proposed $133 million total realignment between Riverton and Kyburz in 1985, instead opting for a less expensive program of spot improvements including new bridges and passing lanes. Portions of the work were completed by 1987, including a four-lane bridge at Riverton (though two lanes are used by traffic turning at Ice House Road at the east end of the bridge). Between White Hall and Kyburz, a pair of four-lane bridges over the South Fork American River, carrying a realignment across a bend in the river, were dedicated on May 31, 1995, as the El Dorado County Veterans Bridges. The route through the South Fork American River Canyon remains vulnerable to mudslides and other storm damage. One particularly bad slide closed the highway east of Riverton for 28 days from January 24 to February 21, 1997, only a week after a similar 17-day closure caused by flooding on January 1. A project to make more permanent repairs and prevent future closures began on July 31, and from September 2 to October 24 the highway was closed during the week to allow for more efficient reconstruction. The state signed the detour, which followed Sly Park Road, Mormon Emigrant Trail (the old ridgetop Carson Route), SR 88, and SR 89 (over Luther Pass), as Alternate U.S. Route 50, a designation not approved by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, which generally assigns new bannered U.S. Highways. After the work was complete, signs were left along the route.

He served his uncle, Manuel I Komnenos, as a diplomatic envoy to the Russian principalities and the Kingdom of Jerusalem, but also helped his father escape imprisonment in Constantinople. His opposition against the regency of Empress-dowager Maria of Antioch and the protosebastos Alexios Komnenos landed him in prison, but he was released in April 1182, when his father stood poised to take power in the Byzantine capital. Nevertheless, Manuel opposed his father's policy of persecuting the aristocracy, and refused to sanction or supervise the execution of Maria of Antioch. As a result, when Andronikos crowned himself emperor in 1183, Manuel was bypassed in the succession, and his younger brother John Komnenos was made co-emperor instead; Manuel received the title of sebastokrator. Despite his well-known opposition to Andronikos' more tyrannical policies, Manuel was blinded by Isaac II Angelos when the latter overthrew Andronikos in 1185. His subsequent fate is unknown, but his two sons, Alexios and David, went on to found the Empire of Trebizond in 1204, which was ruled by Manuel's descendants until its fall in 1461. Origin and early life Manuel Komnenos was born in 1145, the firstborn son of the future Byzantine emperor Andronikos Komnenos (). The name and identity of his mother are unknown and disputed among scholars, but she was most likely a member of the high Byzantine aristocracy. Whatever her origin, Manuel was of high birth: his paternal grandfather, Isaac, was a younger son of the founder of the Komnenian house, Alexios I Komnenos () and Empress Irene Doukaina. Already at a young age, Manuel received the high court title of sebastos from his uncle, Emperor Manuel I Komnenos (). The Emperor was of age with Manuel's father, and the two had grown up together. Manuel I cherished this friendship and would always be partial to Andronikos, even though the latter, like his own father, was a highly ambitious man who coveted the throne. His ambition, plotting with foreign powers, rumours of attempting to assassinate Manuel I, and above all his scandalous affair with his niece Eudokia (a daughter of the sebastokrator Andronikos) brought Manuel's father into trouble, and in 1155, he was imprisoned by the Emperor in the dungeons of the Great Palace of Constantinople. Manuel is first mentioned in the sources in 1164, when he helped his father escape his imprisonment. Andronikos fled to Galicia, but soon the Emperor pardoned him and allowed him to return to Constantinople. Under Manuel I Komnenos Miniature of Manuel's uncle, Emperor Manuel I Komnenos, and his second wife, Maria of Antioch, from a manuscript in the Vatican Library Some modern scholars also identify Manuel with the namesake who was entrusted in with a diplomatic mission to the Russian princes Rostislav I of Kiev and Mstislav Isyaslavich of Volhynia, as part of Emperor Manuel I's preparations for war against Stephen III of Hungary. According to the contemporary historian John Kinnamos, the mission was a success, as the Russian princes were flattered by the high rank of the imperial envoy: both rulers agreed to maintain friendly relations with Byzantium. Mstislav of Volhynia even promised to send troops, while Rostislav of Kiev also agreed to accept the appointment of the Byzantine bishop John IV as Metropolitan of Kiev and all Rus'. It also appears that the embassy managed to turn the neighbouring ruler of Galicia, Yaroslav Osmomysl, who was tied to Stephen III by marriage, towards friendship with Byzantium, and adopting a neutral stance in the oncoming Byzantine‚ÄìHungarian conflict. In 1166, Manuel's mother died, and he had her buried in the Monastery of Angourion. In the next year, he was a member of the high-ranking mission that accompanied his niece Maria Komnene to the Kingdom of Jerusalem for her wedding to King Amalric at Tyre on 29 August 1167. His life during the remainder of Manuel I's reign is obscure. According to a Georgian chronicler, when Andronikos sojourned in the Georgian royal court at Tiflis , he was \\"accompanied by his wife, of dazzling beauty, by his sons, and those of his sister\\". This would most likely indicate the presence of Andronikos' mistress Theodora Komnene and their two children, but the plural \\"sons\\" leaves open the possibility that Manuel followed his father in his wanderings during his exile. Modern historians are doubtful about the accuracy of this account due to the ambiguousness of its wording. In 1180, shortly before his death, Emperor Manuel I was reconciled with Andronikos: after swearing an oath of loyalty to the emperor and his offspring, Andronikos was pardoned and allowed to serve as governor at Oinaion in the Pontus. As a guarantee of his good behaviour, however, Manuel and his legitimate half-siblings, John and Maria, remained in Constantinople. Under the regency of Maria of Antioch According to Varzos, it was probably after the death of Emperor Manuel I in 1180, that Manuel married the Georgian princess Rusudan, daughter of King George III. with extensive discussion of the previous literature on the possible identity of Manuel's wife. Given his age, Rusudan was possibly his second wife, or alternatively, if the match was arranged by his father during his stay at Tiflis, he had remained unwed to honour that pledge. Manuel and his brother were among the nobility who sided with Manuel I's daughter, the Caesarissa Maria Komnene, against the regency of Manuel I's underage son, Alexios II Komnenos (), headed by Empress-dowager Maria of Antioch and another cousin, the protosebastos Alexios Komnenos. The conspiracy was uncovered, however, and after a trial headed by Theodore Pantechnes, John and Manuel and other conspirators were imprisoned (February 1182). Taking advantage of the troubles in the capital, Andronikos rose in revolt and marched on Constantinople. After defeating the loyalists under Andronikos Doukas Angelos near Nicomedia, Andronikos advanced up to Chalcedon, across the Bosporus from Constantinople. The increasing number of defections to the rebel culminated when the megas doux Andronikos Kontostephanos and the fleet went over to Andronikos. A revolt overthrew the regency in late April, the protosebastos was taken prisoner, and those imprisoned by him, including Manuel and John, were set free. Under Andronikos I 15th-century codex containing a copy of the Extracts of History by Joannes Zonaras Released, Manuel and his brother, and Andronikos' partisans, took over the palace and managed the government in his name. In mid-May Andronikos himself crossed the Bosporus and entered Constantinople, assuming power as regent for Alexios II. The contemporary official and historian, Niketas Choniates, writes critically of Andronikos' subsequent purge of the officialdom and the undiscerning award of offices to his supporters, as well as that Andronikos \\"promoted his own sons\\" in the process. However, as a member of the high aristocracy nurtured in the court ethos of Manuel I, Manuel quickly came to oppose is father's policies, which aimed to break the power of the palace nobility and the great landowners. The first act of public opposition was his refusal, along with his maternal uncle, the sebastos George, to vote in the Senate for the execution of the Empress-dowager Maria of Antioch in August 1183, or to preside over the deed. According to Choniates, this refusal stunned Andronikos, but only served to postpone the execution for a few days. Following the execution of the Empress-dowager, Andronikos assumed the imperial title in September, and within a month had eliminated the young Alexios II. Along with the patriarch Basil Kamateros, whom he had appointed, Andronikos then crowned his younger son John as co-emperor. Although widely acknowledged as more capable than his brother, Manuel was bypassed due to his opposition, although officially his father justified this choice with following the AIMA prophecy. Nevertheless, as the emperor's son he still received the high title of sebastokrator. His opposition became even more marked in August 1185, during the crisis caused by the Norman invasion of the Empire. Public hostility to the Emperor increased as the Normans advanced, and, in order to stifle dissent, Andronikos and his supporters in the Senate passed a law that would condemn to death not only those currently imprisoned, but also their families. Manuel was entrusted with carrying it out, but refused to carry it out except by direct imperial warrant, condemning the edict as illegal and immoral, as it would effectively put the entire populace, as well as many foreigners residing in the Empire, under the death penalty. This opposition delayed the edict's implementation, and Andronikos' downfall shortly after meant that it was never enforced. It was found among his papers after his death. At the same time, Manuel still retained a measure of influence over his father, as shown when he successfully pleaded for the life and rank of his cousin, David, the doux of Thessalonica, who was being besieged there by the Normans. Blinding and subsequent fate During the popular uprising that brought Isaac II Angelos () to power on 11‚Äì12 September 1185, Andronikos for a time held the Great Palace against the urban mob. Left with a handful of companions, he realized that resistance was doomed, and tried to negotiate, offering to step down in favour of Manuel, rather than the co-emperor John, but the mob angrily refused, cursing both Andronikos and Manuel. Soon after, the mob broke into the palace precinct, and Andronikos, taking only his wife and mistress along, fled the city by ship. He was captured, mutilated, publicly humiliated and executed a few days later. Manuel too was arrested and blinded, even though, according to Choniates, \\"he in no way assented to his father's crimes and that this was well known\\" both to the common people and Isaac II. As Varzos writes, the most likely reason for this measure was not only in satisfying the mob's demand for vengeance on Andronikos and his sons, but also in Andronikos' desperate offer to hand over the crown to Manuel, which marked him as a potential rival to Isaac II. The same fate befell Manuel's brother, the co-emperor John. Manuel's subsequent fate, or the date of his death, are unknown. The fate of his two infant sons, Alexios and David, is also obscure for many years: they may have fled Constantinople during the turmoil of Andronikos' deposition and taken to their maternal relatives in Georgia, but other scholars maintain that they remained unmolested in Constantinople, and left the city only after the failed uprising of Alexios' father-in-law, John Komnenos the Fat, in 1200/1, or even as late as the first siege of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in July 1203. With Georgian assistance, the two brothers captured the region of the Pontus in March‚ÄìApril 1204. While Alexios established himself at Trebizond and assumed the imperial title, David moved on to capture Paphlagonia, which he ruled until his death in 1212, when the region was annexed by the Empire of Nicaea. The Empire of Trebizond continued to be ruled by Manuel's descendants, the Grand Komnenoi, until it fell to the Ottoman Empire in 1461. Based on a much- faded inscription in a tower in the city walls of Trebizond, the Russian Byzantinist Fyodor Uspensky suggested that perhaps the tower housed the tomb of Manuel, whose body (and that of Andronikos I) may have been brought to the city by his sons.

Origin Route in 1912 Watsonville was served by the Southern Pacific railroad, but local businessmen felt they could secure more favorable rates if they had a seaport. A electric railway line was built from Main Street in Watsonville along Wall Street to a wharf constructed from the shore of Monterey Bay at Port Rogers. A power station, car barn, and freight warehouse were built on Beach Road where the electric line crossed the similarly narrow gauge Pajaro Valley Consolidated Railroad; but there was little cause to interchange cars because the steam railroad served its own wharf at Moss Landing. The electric railroad had two street cars serving the dual purpose of carrying passengers and pulling some of the railroad's two boxcars and four flatcars. 1904 & 1905 The 997-ton passenger-carrying steam schooner F.A.Kilburn was built by Hans Ditlev Bendixsen of Fairhaven, California, to operate as a produce packet between the wharf and San Francisco. Kilburn's maiden voyage in May 1904 brought seventy passengers from San Francisco to meet the electric cars at Port Rogers. Regular scheduling had the Kilburn leave Port Rogers in the early evening to arrive in San Francisco the following morning in time for the early market, where it became known as the berry boat. Within a few months of initiating service the wharf at Port Rogers required replacement of timbers damaged by teredo worms. Heavy seas damaged the wharf soon after the damaged timbers had been replaced with redwood. The total cost of repairs was $35,000; and the company declared bankruptcy on 8 September 1905. 1911 to 1913 The company was reorganized as the Watsonville Railway and Navigation Company on 22 April 1911 with Port Rogers renamed Port Watsonville. The rolling stock was stored while service was discontinued through the bankruptcy proceedings, and one of the two streetcars had been destroyed by fire in 1909. The berry boat had run aground off Coos Bay while being operated in coastal trade by stockholder Fred Linderman, but was towed to North Bend, Oregon to receive a new rudder and a patch for the holed hull. The railroad resumed operation with the streetcar and ten flatcars, which were often fitted with benches for carrying additional passengers to various entertainment events on Monterey Bay beaches. The company was unable to pay for repairs after a December 1912 storm destroyed 160 feet of the wharf; so operations ceased in October 1913. The repaired berry boat went through a series of owners before burning off American Shoal Light on 14 June 1918.

It underwent several name changes throughout the years, from World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) to World Wrestling Federation (WWF) to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in 2002. WWE is the largest professional wrestling promotion in the world. It has promoted some of the most successful wrestlers and storylines, and featured some of the most iconic and significant matches and moments in the history of sports entertainment. WWE currently airs several high-profile programs such as Raw and SmackDown in more than 150 countries, hosts 12 pay-per-view events a year including WrestleMania, and holds approximately 320 live events a year throughout the world. In 2014, WWE launched the first ever 24/7 streaming network which would eventually showcase the entire WWE video library. Capitol Wrestling Corporation = Early years (1953‚Äì1963) = WWE's origins can be traced back as far as the 1950s when on January 7, 1953 the first show under the Capitol Wrestling Corporation (CWC) was produced. There is uncertainty as to who the founder of the CWC was. Some sources state that it was Vincent J. McMahon while other sources cite McMahon's father Jess McMahon (who died in 1954) as founder of CWC. The NWA recognized an undisputed NWA World Heavyweight Champion that went to several different professional wrestling promotions in the NWA. The championship was defended around the world. The NWA generally promoted strong shooters as champions, to give their worked sport credibility and guard against double-crosses. While doing strong business in the Midwest (the NWA's core region), these wrestlers attracted little interest in the CWC territory. In 1961, the NWA board decided instead to put the championship on bleach blond showman \\"Nature Boy\\" Buddy Rogers, a much more effective drawing card in the region.Dave Meltzer, Wrestling Observer Newsletter, July 20, 2011. The rest of the NWA was unhappy with McMahon and Toots Mondt (who joined the CWC in the early 1960s) because he rarely allowed Rogers to wrestle outside of the Northeast. Mondt and McMahon wanted Rogers to keep the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, but Rogers was unwilling to sacrifice his $25,000 deposit on the championship belt (championship holders at the time had to pay a deposit to insure they honored their commitments as champion). Rogers lost the NWA World Heavyweight Championship to Lou Thesz in a one-fall match in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on January 24, 1963, which led to Mondt, McMahon, and the CWC leaving the NWA in protest, creating the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) in the process.  World Wide Wrestling Federation  = Rise of Bruno Sammartino (1963‚Äì1980) = The official WWWF logo from 1963 to 1979 The World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) was formed on January 24, 1963. On April 25, 1963, Buddy Rogers was awarded the new WWWF World Heavyweight Championship, supposedly winning an apocryphal tournament in Rio de Janeiro. He lost the championship to Bruno Sammartino a month later on May 17, 1963, after suffering a heart attack shortly before the match. To accommodate Rogers' condition, the match was booked to last under a minute. Bruno Sammartino (right) is the all-time longest-reigning WWWF World Heavyweight Champion and one of the most prolific wrestlers in the sport Andr√© the Giant (middle right), King Kong Bundy (center), Hillbilly Jim (right turnbuckle), and Big John Studd (middle corner) Sammartino would retain the title for seven years, eight months and one day (2,803 days), making his the longest continuous world championship reign in men's wrestling history. Although Sammartino was the face of the WWWF, wrestlers such as Superstar Billy Graham and Bob Backlund were also hugely popular. The WWWF gained notoriety in the 1970s by holding their biggest shows at Shea Stadium or Madison Square Garden and doing strong business across the entire Northeast megalopolis. They leveraged former, but still popular, wrestlers such as Captain Lou Albano, \\"Grand Wizard of Wrestling\\" Ernie Roth and \\"Classy\\" Freddie Blassie to act as managers for Sammartino's heel (villainous) opponents. At this time, only babyface (fan favorite) wrestlers were allowed to have long championship reigns, such as Bruno Sammartino, Pedro Morales and Bob Backlund, who all retained for more than one year each. The heel champions, such as Ivan Koloff and Stan Stasiak, were used to \\"transition\\" the championship from one wrestler to another, and they generally kept the title for no more a single month-long program before dropping it to the next babyface. Graham was the only heel character to keep his championship for longer than one month, as the WWWF felt it needed time to build Backlund up as championship material.Dave Meltzer, Wrestling Observer Newsletter, January 31, 2011. The WWWF was relatively conservative for promotions of its day; running its major arenas monthly rather than weekly or bi-weekly. Programs generally involved a babyface champion facing a heel challenger for one to three meetings in each scheduled town; for longer programs the heel would often win the first match in a non-decisive manner such as a countout or via excessive blood loss, and the champion would then retain in an ultraviolent blow-off match such as a steel cage match or Texas Death match.Dave Meltzer, Wrestling Observer Newsletter, June 3, 1991. Unlike most of the NWA territories, the main event would occur in the middle of the arena show cards, allowing the company to build upon the match's finish in order to sell tickets to the next event; reliable, popular workers such as Chief Jay Strongbow would then wrestle at the end of the show to send the crowd home happy.Dave Meltzer, Wrestling Observer Newsletter, October 17, 2011.Dave Meltzer, Wrestling Observer Newsletter, May 9, 2012. The WWWF also featured popular wrestlers based out of non-WWWF territories such as Dusty Rhodes and retained the services of (at the time) the most popular and highly paid wrestler in the world, Andr√© the Giant, in between his territorial and international obligations. WWWF held their then major event Showdown at Shea three times at Flushing, New York's Shea Stadium in 1972, 1976 and 1980. Bruno Sammartino main evented the 1972 and 1980 events, in 1972 wrestling Pedro Morales to a 75 minutes time limit draw and in 1980 defeating Larry Zbyszko in a Steel cage match. The main event of the 1976 event was a Boxer vs Wrestler fight between Muhammad Ali and Antonio Inoki which ended in a draw. At that event Sammartino had retained the WWWF World Heavyweight Championship against Stan Hansen. The 1972, 1976 and 1980 events each had attendance figures of 22,508, 32,000 and 36,295 respectively.https://web.archive.org/web/20080105150626/http://www.100megsfree4.com/wiawrestling/pages/other/wrescrds.htm Wrestling Information Archivehttp://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/shea.html Wrestling Supercards and Tournaments Toots Mondt left the WWWF in the late sixties, and Vincent J. McMahon assumed complete control of the organization in 1971. Later that year, The Mongols created controversy after they left the WWWF with the WWWF International Tag Team Championship. The championship would be considered inactive as a result until Luke Graham and Tarzan Tyler won a tournament to claim the championship. They then defeated the Mongols in November 1971, voiding any claim The Mongols had to the championship. In March 1979, for marketing purposes, the World Wide Wrestling Federation was renamed as the World Wrestling Federation (WWF).  World Wrestling Federation  = Transition (1979‚Äì1982) = In 1980, Vincent K. McMahon, the son of Vincent J. McMahon, founded Titan Sports, Inc. and applied trademarks for the initials \\"WWF\\". = The Golden Era (1982‚Äì1993) = Vince McMahon, the owner of WWE In 1982, McMahon purchased Capitol Sports, the parent company of WWF, from his father and associates Gorilla Monsoon and Arnold Skaaland. Seeking to make WWF the premier wrestling promotion in the world, he began an expansion process that fundamentally changed the industry. In an interview with Sports Illustrated, McMahon noted: Upon taking over the company, McMahon immediately worked to get WWF programming on syndicated television all across the United States. This angered other promoters and disrupted the well-established boundaries of the different wrestling promotions. In addition, the company used income generated by advertising, television deals, and tape sales to secure talent from rival promoters. Capitol Sports already controlled most of the northeastern territory, but the younger McMahon wanted WWF to be a national wrestling promotion; something the NWA did not approve of. He shortly defected his promotion from the NWA, much like the American Wrestling Association, which controlled the U.S. Northern Midwest. To become a national promotion, WWF would have to become bigger than AWA or any NWA promotion. McMahon's vision for his promotion was starting to become possible when he signed AWA talent Hulk Hogan, who had achieved popularity outside of wrestling ‚Äì notably for his appearance in Rocky III as Thunderlips. McMahon signed Rowdy Roddy Piper as Hogan's rival, and shortly afterward signed Jesse \\"The Body\\" Ventura. Other significant wrestlers who were part of the roster included: Big John Studd, Andr√© the Giant, Jimmy \\"Superfly\\" Snuka, \\"The Magnificent\\" Don Muraco, Junkyard Dog, \\"Mr. Wonderful\\" Paul Orndorff, Greg \\"The Hammer\\" Valentine, Ricky \\"The Dragon\\" Steamboat, and Nikolai Volkoff. In 1984, Hogan was pushed to main event status. He defeated WWF Heavyweight Champion The Iron Sheik at Madison Square Garden on January 23, 1984 and thus evolved into one of the most recognizable and popular faces in professional wrestling. Hulk Hogan (left), Sergeant Slaughter (centre) and Brutus Beefcake (right) were mainstays of 1980's WWF wrestling With reasonable revenue being made, McMahon was able to secure television deals, and WWF was being shown across the United States. McMahon also began selling videotapes of WWF events outside the Northeast through his Coliseum Video distribution company, again angering other promoters. The syndication of WWF programming forced promotions to engage in direct competition with the WWF. The increased revenue allowed McMahon to sign more talent, such as Brutus Beefcake, Tito Santana, Jake \\"The Snake\\" Roberts, Butch Reed, and \\"Hacksaw\\" Jim Duggan. However, for McMahon to truly turn WWF into a national promotion, he needed to have WWF touring the entire United States. Such a venture was impossible with the revenue WWF currently had, so McMahon envisioned a way to obtain the necessary capital through a risky all-or-nothing gamble on a supercard concept called WrestleMania in 1985. WrestleMania would be a pay-per-view extravaganza, viewable on closed-circuit television and marketed as the Super Bowl of professional wrestling. WrestleMania was not the first supercard seen in professional wrestling, as the NWA had previously run Starrcade in 1983. However, McMahon's vision was to make WWF and the industry itself mainstream, targeting more of the general television audience by exploiting the entertainment side of the industry. With the inaugural WrestleMania, WWF initiated a joint-promotional campaign with MTV, which featured a great deal of WWF coverage and programming, in what was termed the Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection. The mainstream media attention brought on by celebrities including Muhammad Ali, Mr. T and Cyndi Lauper at the event helped propel WrestleMania to become a staple in popular culture, and the use of celebrities has been a staple of the company to the present day. With the success of WrestleMania, other promotions which tried hard to keep the regional territory system alive started to merge under Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP). Starrcade and The Great American Bash were the JCP versions of WrestleMania, but even when operating inside of its territory, JCP had trouble matching the success of WWF. After Ted Turner purchased majority of JCP's assets, the promotion would become World Championship Wrestling (WCW), providing WWF with a competitor until 2001, when WCW and its trademarks were purchased by WWF. WrestleMania would become an annual pay-per-view phenomenon, being broadcast in nearly 150 countries and in almost 20 different languages. Perhaps the peak of the 1980s wrestling boom was WrestleMania III at the Pontiac Silverdome, which set an attendance record of 93,173. In the main event Hulk Hogan retained the WWF Championship against Andr√© the Giant. McMahon used the success of WrestleMania to create more pay-per-views and traditions such as SummerSlam, the Royal Rumble and the Survivor Series, the latter two both receiving their names from unique stipulation matches featured at the event. McMahon's focus on entertainment rather than giving his product a legitimate sports feel, the policy that became the concept of sports entertainment, led to great financial success for WWF. During the 1980s, Hulk Hogan would crossover into mainstream prominence presented as an all-American hero. Hogan's time as the face of the WWF would last until he departed from the company in the summer of 1993. Other stars such as \\"Macho Man\\" Randy Savage, \\"Rowdy\\" Roddy Piper, The Ultimate Warrior, The Honky Tonk Man, \\"Million Dollar Man\\" Ted DiBiase, and others also helped make WWF a financial success in this time period. Jim Duggan won the first ever Royal Rumble match in 1988. While these talents were recognizable as individuals, some talent became better known for their teamwork as part of tag teams. Stables or groups such as Demolition, Strike Force, The Hart Foundation, The British Bulldogs, The Rockers and The Fabulous Rougeaus helped create a strong tag team division for WWF. Towards the end of the \\"Golden Age\\", Bret Hart of the Hart Foundation began to break out on his own as a singles competitor, with his most memorable match early on taking place at SummerSlam in 1992 against \\"The British Bulldog\\" Davey Boy Smith. Hart would eventually capture the WWF World Heavyweight Championship from Ric Flair later that year and would win the King of the Ring tournament the following year. In January 1993, WWF created their prime time cable TV program Monday Night Raw, which aired on the USA Network. = New Generation Era (1993‚Äì1997) = Logo and tagline used for the New Generation Era from 1995‚Äì1997 Bret Hart was by far the biggest star at this point and defeated Yokozuna to win back the WWF World Heavyweight Championship in the main event of WrestleMania 10. In 1991, it was reported that Hulk Hogan, Roddy Piper, Rick Martel, Brian Blair, and Dan Spivey were to testify that they had purchased steroids from WWF physician Dr. George T. Zahorian, who was being charged with the illegal distribution of the drug. Two years later, Vince McMahon was indicted due to his connection to Zahorian, and faced a possible eight-year prison term and a $500,000 fine if convicted. The trial began on July 7, 1994, with the prosecutor, who promised to expose \\"the dark, corrupt underbelly\\" of WWF, claimed McMahon distributed steroids \\"like candy\\" and pressured wrestlers into taking the drug. Wrestler Nailz testified that McMahon had once said to him: \\"I strongly suggest you go on the gas\\". Days later, Hogan admitted that steroid use amongst WWF wrestlers was common, but denied ever being pressured into doing so by McMahon. A week later, McMahon was acquitted of all charges, and was quoted as saying \\"I'm elated. Just like in wrestling, in the end the good guys always win\\". With business down in 1992 because of bad press from the steroid scandal, Vince McMahon began pushing younger talents into the spotlight over the next several years. By mid 1993, Bret \\"Hit Man\\" Hart, Shawn Michaels, The Undertaker, Razor Ramon, Diesel, Lex Luger, Yokozuna, Owen Hart, Crush, Tatanka and others all became the stars of what the WWF eventually branded as the \\"New Generation\\". Hulk Hogan would leave the company in the summer of 1993 and Hart would become one of the most popular stars of this period until his departure in 1997. Meanwhile, competition between the major wrestling companies increased. In 1994, WCW signed Hulk Hogan and other former WWF stars to multi-year contracts, and in 1995 launched Monday Nitro on TNT, to go head to head with Raw, starting the Monday Night Wars. At WrestleMania X in 1994 a ladder match between Shawn Michaels and Razor Ramon received critical acclaim and was said to be ground breaking and is said to have revolutionized the concept of ladder matches. By mid-1996, with the introduction of the New World Order (nWo), a stable led by former WWF wrestlers Hulk Hogan, Scott Hall (Razor Ramon), and Kevin Nash (Diesel), Nitro started a near two years of ratings domination. More talent would eventually leave WWF for WCW including Ted DiBiase, Curt Hennig, reigning WWF Women's Champion Alundra Blayze and The 1-2-3 Kid while Bret Hart decided to stay with the WWF in spite of a lucrative offer by WCW. At Badd Blood: In Your House in 1997 the first Hell in a Cell match would be held between The Undertaker and Shawn Michaels, which Michaels won after interference from Undertaker's storyline half brother Kane. The Hell in a Cell match has since become one of the most popular gimmick matches in wrestling history.\\"Remembering Badd Blood: 15 years later\\". WWE. = The Attitude Era (1997‚Äì2002) = Logo used from November 1997 ‚Äì May 2002 In 1997, Vince McMahon responded to WCW's big success by taking the WWF in a different direction with more realistic characters and edgier storylines. Rising stars included D-Generation X group (consisting of Shawn Michaels, Triple H, Rick Rude, X-Pac, Road Dogg, Billy Gunn and Chyna) and Stone Cold Steve Austin, whose rise to popularity began with his 1996 King of the Ring win and famous \\"Austin 3:16\\" speech. Despite starting out as a villain, Austin's popularity would start to gradually exceed those of the top fan favorites in the promotion. At Survivor Series on November 9, 1997, WWF debuted the \\"scratch\\" logo which would be the company's signature throughout the Attitude Era and on December 15, 1997, Vince McMahon aired a promo on Raw Is War addressing the audience on the company embarking on a \\"more innovative and contemporary campaign\\", which would advise parent discretion for a younger audience. This same episode also marked the beginning of the scratch logo being officially used for WWF television broadcasts and went into full effect, replacing the New Generation logo. In 1997, McMahon also informed Bret Hart that he could not longer afford to pay him what his contract stated, and suggested that he go back to the more lucrative deal that WCW had offered him. Hart signed with WCW but a behind- the-scenes controversy developed over Hart's final matches, resulting in the Montreal Screwjob. Hart was defending the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against Shawn Michaels at 1997 Survivor Series, when McMahon ordered the referee to award the match and the championship to Michaels as if Hart had submitted. While Hart went on to WCW, McMahon received enormous backlash from the media, wrestlers and fans alike, inspiring him to create the Mr. McMahon character, a villainous extension of his status as promoter. Following Hart's departure the company implemented a heavy push of popular anti hero character, Stone Cold Steve Austin whose popularity was rising and was similar to Hulk Hogan's popularity in the 1980s. During an angle involving Mike Tyson at WrestleMania XIV in March 1998, Austin became WWF Champion by beating Shawn Michaels, giving rise to the Austin era and the despotic Mr. McMahon character which began a long-lasting feud with Austin this feud would be very important in the WWF turning the tides in the ratings war with rival company WCW. Later in the year, new talent began to emerge for WWF: The Rock, Triple H, Mick Foley, and Kane strengthened WWF's singles division while stables such as D-Generation X and the Nation of Domination, helped the fight against rival company WCW. WWF head writer Vince Russo also contributed to the formation of D-Generation X in 1997, The Undertaker vs. Kane feud in 1998, the Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Mr. McMahon feud, the rise of The Rock, and Mick Foley's three face pushes during the Attitude Era, which helped put Raw ahead of Nitro in Ratings. Russo's booking style was often referred to as Crash TV which included short matches, backstage vignettes, and shocking angles. Stone Cold Steve Austin is often called one of the most popular stars in WWE history WWF rebounded in its ratings and popularity, with Raw Is War finally beating Nitro for the first time in 84 weeks on April 13, 1998. Ratings would continue to rise through 1998 and 1999 a 12-minute match between Stone Cold Steve Austin and the Undertaker drew a 9.5 rating on June 28, 1999. It currently stands as the highest-rated segment in Raw history. The Rock's popularity was fueled by his charisma and speaking abilities, which led to many catchphrases and merchandising opportunities The Attitude Era saw WWF expand its television coverage and its business structure as well. During this period, WWF's parent company Titan Sports was renamed World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, Inc. (WWFE, Inc. or WWFE) and on October 19, 1999 became a publicly traded company, offering 10 million shares priced at $17 each, and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in October 2000. In 1999, WWF launched a secondary program known as SmackDown! on the UPN network to compete with WCW's Thunder. SmackDown!'s pilot debuted as a special on April 29, 1999. Beginning on August 26, 1999, the WWF program was aired weekly. In 2000, WWF, in collaboration with television network NBC, created XFL, a new professional football league. XFL, however, was a failure, having only lasted a single year before closing its doors. Head writer Chris Kreski replaced Vince Russo and Ed Ferrara, who defected to WCW in 1999. Kreski's work was admired for well planned and detailed storylines, and the transitional period saw feuds and storylines such as the Triple H/Cactus Jack feud, the Triple H/Kurt Angle/Stephanie McMahon love triangle, and a highly successful feud between The Hardy Boyz, Edge and Christian, and The Dudley Boyz. At Survivor Series, WWF's top star Stone Cold Steve Austin was run over by a car at the Joe Louis Arena in Detroit Michigan to write him off of television due to a serious neck injury. At SummerSlam in 2000, WWF debuted the highly popular Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match, the inaugural match seeing Edge and Christian defeating The Dudley Boyz and The Hardy Boyz for the WWF Tag Team Championship. Prior to WrestleMania 2000, the McMahon family had gone into an on-screen rivalry with each other for the first time, setting up the \\"McMahon in Every Corner\\" four-way elimination main event between Big Show (managed by Shane McMahon), The Rock (managed by Mr. McMahon), Triple H (managed by Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley), and future WWF Commissioner Mick Foley (managed by Linda McMahon). Triple H won after Mr. McMahon turned on The Rock and thus retained the WWF Championship. Stone Cold Steve Austin would make his return to the company at Unforgiven 2000 and then would make his in ring return at No Mercy, to gain revenge on Rikishi, who had been revealed as the driver of limousine that had struck Austin at Survivor Series. Austin would go on to win the next year's Royal Rumble match and come out victorious against The Rock for the WWF Championship at WrestleMania X-Seven with help from his former rival, Mr. McMahon, turning into a villain in the process. At this point WWF won the Monday Night Wars against WCW.  The Alliance Invasion and the nWo (2001‚Äì2002)  Kevin Nash was a key member of nWo In the Invasion storyline, Shane McMahon (kayfabe) acquired World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in April 2001 and WCW personnel invaded WWF. For the first time since the Monday Night Wars, WWF's purchase of WCW had made a major American inter-promotional feud possible, but the Invasion turned out to be a disappointment to many fans. One main reason would be that many of WCW's big name stars were still under contract to WCW's old parent company, AOL Time Warner, rather than WCW itself, and their contracts were not included in the purchase of the company. These wrestlers chose to sit out the duration of their contracts and be financially supported by AOL Time Warner rather than work for WWF for a cheaper salary. On July 9, 2001, the stars of WCW and Extreme Championship Wrestling (acquired by Stephanie McMahon in a related storyline) joined forces, forming \\"The Alliance\\" with WCW owner Shane McMahon and the new owner of ECW Stephanie McMahon leading charge, with the support and influence of original ECW owner Paul Heyman. At Invasion, Stone Cold Steve Austin turned on WWF and helped the Alliance win the Inaugural Brawl. At Survivor Series, WWF finally defeated WCW and ECW in a \\"Winner Takes All Match\\" and the angle was concluded. In the aftermath of the Invasion angle, WWF made several major changes to their product. Ric Flair returned to the WWF as \\"co-owner\\" of the company, feuding with Vince McMahon. Jerry Lawler returned to the company after a nine-month hiatus, after his replacement on commentary Paul Heyman was fired on-screen by Vince McMahon. Several former Alliance stars were absorbed into the regular WWF roster, such as Booker T, The Hurricane, Lance Storm, and Rob Van Dam. At Vengeance 2001, Chris Jericho went on to unify the WCW Championship and WWF Championship, beating both The Rock and Steve Austin on the same night.\\"PWTorch.com ‚Äì TORCH FLASHBACK (12-09-01): Chris Jericho becomes WWE Undisputed champion ‚Äì Torch cover story with parallels to The Miz as WWE champion, Vengeance 2001 PPV Report\\". www.pwtorch.com. Eventually Vince McMahon brought back Hollywood Hulk Hogan, Kevin Nash, and Scott Hall to reunite the nWo at the No Way Out pay-per-view in February 2002. However, the storyline proved unpopular with fans and Hogan soon turned face at WrestleMania X8 after his classic match with The Rock, which The Rock won. On the edition of March 25, 2002 of Raw, the World Wrestling Federation had the first time ever WWF draft lottery, which meant the WWF superstars are separated between two brands, Raw and SmackDown!. This became effective from April 1, 2002 on Raw, thus leading to a brand new era, and ending the Attitude Era.  World Wrestling Entertainment / WWE  The official WWE logo from May 06, 2002 to August 17, 2014 In 2002, the World Wrestling Federation lost a lawsuit initiated by the World Wildlife Fund over the WWF trademark. World Wrestling Federation was forced to rebrand itself, and on May 6, 2002 the company changed its business name to World Wrestling Entertainment Inc. (WWE). Shortly thereafter, they eliminated all elements that used the term Federation; this affected licensed merchandise such as action figures, video games, and home video releases with its previous logo, which was replaced by a new \\"scratch\\" logo. The last-ever WWF-branded pay-per- view event was the UK-exclusive Insurrextion on May 4, 2002. During this time, the company launched WWE Studios, which was originally formed as WWE Films. = Ruthless Aggression Era (2002‚Äì2008) = The Undertaker (pictured here in March 2008) has been a highly popular figure in WWE since 1990, holding an undefeated WrestleMania streak until 2014. By April 2002, with an excess of talent employed as a result of having purchased WCW and ECW, WWE needed a way to provide exposure for all of its talent. This problem was solved by introducing a \\"Brand Extension\\", with the roster split in half and the talent assigned to either Raw or SmackDown! in a mock draft lottery. Wrestlers, commentators and referees became show-exclusive, and the shows were given separate on-screen General Managers. The brand extension came into effect on April 1, 2002. Shortly thereafter, on the June 24, 2002 episode of Raw, Vince McMahon officially referred to the new era as \\"Ruthless Aggression\\". Later in 2002, after WWE Champion Brock Lesnar announced himself exclusive property of the SmackDown! brand and with the creation of the World Heavyweight Championship, all the championships became show-exclusive too. Additionally, both Raw and SmackDown! began to stage individual pay-per-view events featuring only performers from that brand ‚Äì only the major four pay-per-views Royal Rumble, WrestleMania, SummerSlam and Survivor Series remained dual- branded. The practice of single-brand pay-per-view events was abandoned following WrestleMania 23. In effect, Raw and SmackDown were operated as two distinct promotions, with a draft lottery taking place each year to determine which talent was assigned to each brand. This lasted until August 2011, when the rosters were merged and the Brand Extension was quietly phased out. After the company transitioned into its Ruthless Aggression era, this period still featured many elements of its predecessor the Attitude Era, including the level of violence and amount of profanity but there was less sexual and politically incorrect content, and a further emphasis on wrestling was showcased. The two top stars of the Attitude Era, Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Rock, eventually left the company in 2003 and 2004 respectively, while newcomers such as Brock Lesnar, who would become the youngest WWE Champion and Randy Orton, who became the youngest World Heavyweight Champion, saw huge success. Triple H would also be featured prominently during this time, winning several of his fourteen world championships, as would The Undertaker whose WrestleMania win streak started gaining fame. Eddie Guerrero, Rey Mysterio, Kurt Angle, Chris Benoit, Edge, Brock Lesnar, Randy Orton, John Cena, Batista, John \\"Bradshaw\\" Layfield, and Rob Van Dam were also given main event opportunities and all ended up becoming multiple-time world champions. From mid 2002 to 2003, WWE brought several prominent WCW stars to the company, including Eric Bischoff, Scott Steiner, Goldberg, Kevin Nash and Ric Flair. The Great American Bash, originally a WCW pay-per-view event, made its debut in WWE. Triple H was a very prominent superstar during this period main eventing WrestleMania 20, WrestleMania 21 and WrestleMania 22 respectively. He led the prominent villainous stable Evolution. He has since won 14 world championships. In August 2002, Shawn Michaels would also return as a wrestler at SummerSlam after a hiatus of over four years. He would achieve great success, and won a World Championship in the first ever Elimination Chamber match at Survivor Series. The match between Shawn Michaels and Kurt Angle at WrestleMania 21 has been named one of the greatest matches in WWE history. Though Angle won the match, Michaels received praise for his \\"courageous effort\\".https://www.wwe.com/videos/shawn-michaels-vs-kurt-angle- wrestlemania-21-april-3-2005 In 2006, Michaels would reunite with Triple H to once again form the popular 1990s group D-Generation X. They would have major feuds with The Spirit Squad, the McMahon family, and the newly established Rated-RKO (Edge and Randy Orton), which ended prematurely when Triple H suffered a torn quadriceps muscle in 2007. alt= Eddie Guerrero from the famous Mexican Guerrero wrestling family achieved huge stardom during this period. He gained a large fanbase in 2003 on SmackDown!, which lead to a rapid increase in his popularity, promoting him to main event status and he ultimately won his first world championship, the WWE Championship at No Way Out in 2004 defeating Brock Lesnar in a highly acclaimed match. He remained the top wrestler of the company after winning the WWE title, until his untimely death on November 13, 2005. He was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame, the following year in 2006. Guerrero's death due to his drug addictions caused WWE to implement WWE Wellness Policy to prevent wrestlers from taking drugs. The circumstances of his death would provide a medium to his on and off-screen friend Rey Mysterio to emerge as a major main eventer and win the 2006 Royal Rumble match and the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 22. Mysterio had begun a rivalry with the villainous nephew of Eddie: Chavo Guerrero Jr. who had cost him the World title during a match with Booker T. During the feud Mysterio injured his kneeshttp://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/10202006/articles/reyunderknife and would be sidelined for the rest of 2006 and most of 2007, halting his main event push. Mysterio returned and defeated Chavo in the 2007 edition of SummerSlam and remained a popular fan favorite wrestler.http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/2007/matches/390008832 John Cena was one of the biggest breakout star of the Ruthless Aggression era. Upon his debut, Cena quickly proved popular due to his \\"Doctor of Thuganomics\\" white rapper gimmick on the SmackDown brand, receiving a WWE Championship match against Brock Lesnar in the spring at Backlash in 2003, and had a major feud with The Undertaker during the summer. At WrestleMania 21, he won his first world championship when he defeated John \\"Bradshaw\\" Layfield the WWE Champion at that time. Cena's popularity soared when he was drafted to Raw, where he quickly became the face of WWE, a rise not seen since Austin and Hulk Hogan. Cena's popularity has led to him becoming the all-time record \\"wish maker\\" for the Make-A-Wish Foundation, granting over 500 wishes as of August 2017. Cena secured victories over veterans Triple H and Shawn Michaels in the main events of WrestleMania 22 and WrestleMania 23 respectively. A popular wrestler during the period was Bobby Lashley from the ECW brand. Cena would defeat Lashley at The Great American Bash in 2007 in a well received match, shortly after which Lashley left the WWE. After being sidelined due to a shoulder injury for the latter half of 2007, Cena returned in the 2008 Royal Rumble match, winning the match. John Cena was by far the biggest star to emerge during the Ruthless Aggression Era. Triple H, Randy Orton, Ric Flair and Batista were part of the villainous stable Evolution who were prominently featured between 2003-2005 until their eventual break up.http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/10032005/ Beginning in early 2005 the popularity of Batista would soar much like Cena's, winning the 2005 Royal Rumble and the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 21 from Triple H. Later in 2005 Batista would go on to defeat Triple H in a highly acclaimed Hell in a Cell match at Vengeance.\\"Vengeance 2005\\". WWE. Although Batista would have major success in the months following his championship win, he would suffer an injury in early 2006 and miss that year's WrestleMania. After returning and eventually winning another world championship, at WrestleMania 23 in 2007, Batista would defend the title to The Undertaker in a classic encounter, though he lost the match. However Batista defeated The Undertaker at Cyber Sunday. Cena and Batista would not face each other for the first time until SummerSlam in 2008, with Batista winning. Randy Orton became a prominent Superstar during this period becoming the youngest world champion in WWE history at the age of 24, defeating Chris Benoit at the 2004 SummerSlam event. Dubbed the legend killer he would go on to have feuds with legendary superstars such as The Undertaker and Hulk Hogan facing them at WrestleMania 21 and the 2006 SummerSlam event respectively. Along with fellow Superstar Edge he would form the villainous tag team Rated- RKO, and find success in the tag team division. After returning to singles competition Orton became a multi times WWE Champion. Rising star CM Punk made his WWE debut in 2006, wrestling his first main roster match at Survivor Series that year, in a 5-on-5 Survivor Series elimination match as part of Team DX in a clean sweep victory over Team Rated-RKO. In 2008 he won the money in the bank brief case and on the June 30 episode of Raw he cashed it on the then World Heavyweight Champion Edge, winning the title. The same night he had to defend the title against John \\"Bradshaw\\" Layfield in the main event, but retained it.Matthews, Graham GSM. \\"WWE Flashback: The Impact of CM Punk's First World Championship Victory\\". Bleacher Report. The final pay-per-view event to receive an adult oriented rating was The Great American Bash in 2008 where Triple H retained the WWE Championship against Edge in the main event. Following the event, WWE shifted to TV-PG, family friendly programming.Gagnon, Joshua (December 5, 2011). \\"The WWE PG Era: Is it actually working?\\". Cageside Seats.  Money in the Bank (2005)  The concept for the Money in the Bank match was introduced in March 2005 by Chris Jericho. Jericho pitched the idea on an episode of Raw to general manager Eric Bischoff, who liked it and promptly signed it for WrestleMania 21 assigning Jericho, Christian, Chris Benoit, Edge, Shelton Benjamin, and Kane to participate in the match. Edge won this inaugural match, and since, many times the match became a way to help elevate new stars to the main event, with winners such as CM Punk, The Miz, Daniel Bryan, Alberto Del Rio, Seth Rollins and Dean Ambrose. The match format was originally exclusive to the annual WrestleMania until 2010, when the Money in the Bank pay-per-view debuted. In 2017 Shane McMahon announced the first- ever women's Money in the Bank match, which was won by Carmella.  Return of ECW (2005‚Äì2006)  Paul Heyman, the owner of ECW'' By 2005, WWE began reintroducing Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) through content from the ECW video library and a series of books, which included the release of The Rise and Fall of ECW. On May 26, 2006, WWE officially announced the relaunch of the franchise with its own show on NBC Universal's Sci Fi Channel, later to be known as Syfy, starting June 13, 2006. Despite initial concerns that professional wrestling would not be accepted by Sci Fi Channel's demographic, network President Bonnie Hammer stated that she believed ECW would fit the channel's theme of \\"stretching the imagination\\". On June 13, Paul Heyman, former ECW owner and newly appointed figurehead for the ECW brand, recommissioned the ECW World Heavyweight Championship to be the brand's world championship and awarded it to Rob Van Dam as a result of winning the WWE Championship at One Night Stand 2006. Under the WWE banner, ECW was presented in a modernized style to that when it was an independent promotion and was produced following the same format of the other brands, with match rules, such as count outs and disqualifications, being standard. Matches featuring the rule set of the ECW promotion were classified as being contested under \\"Extreme Rules\\" and were only fought when specified otherwise. The brand would continue to operate until February 16, 2010, when the brand was rendered defunct. = PG Era (2008‚Äì2013) = In the Summer of 2008, WWE began distancing itself from the edgier content of years past, going with a more conservative approach. On July 22, 2008 all WWE programming transitioned to a PG television rating, with the 2008 SummerSlam event being the first pay per view event held under PG ratings. Although the SmackDown brand tv shows were always held under TV-PG ratings since inception in 1999, in 2008 Raw tv shows which were broadcast in TV-14 ratings started to be broadcast under TV-PG ratings. While fans would dub this the \\"PG Era\\" early on, references from wrestlers themselves would come later such as Triple H in his \\"Thy Kingdom Come\\" documentary and Natalya on an episode of \\"Table for 3\\". Another most notable example was that John Cena's famous finishing move, the F-U was renamed Attitude Adjustment. Intentionally blading, which was common until then, became forbidden in the WWE. John Cena remained the top star of the company during this era. New superstars Sheamus and Alberto del Rio also registered notable success during this period winning the WWE Championship in the years 2009 and 2011 respectively.http://www.wwe.com/shows/wwetlc/history/2009/matches/12734254/results/https://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/wweppvs/article_52111.shtml A rivalry between straight edge CM Punk and drug addict Jeff Hardy in 2009 over Hardy's real life drug addiction issues received critical acclaim, and after Punk forced Hardy to storyline quit the WWE, Punk would form the villainous stable Straight Edge Society that would feud with fan favorite Rey Mysterio throughout 2010.https://www.wwe.com/videos/cm-punk-vs-jeff-hardy- world-heavyweight-championship-steel-cage-match-smackdown-august-28-2009 John Cena (left) and The Rock (right) in the April 04, 2011 episode of Raw, they had an on and off cross-generational feud between 2011‚Äì2013. CM Punk became one of the most popular and high-profile wrestler in the WWE during this period, and holds a record 434 days long WWE Championship reign, the longest reign of the title in the company in 25 years. At WrestleMania XXVI in 2010, popular wrestler Shawn Michaels retired following a loss to The Undertaker. In August 2011, WWE began to phase out the brand extension when they gave Raw the tagline \\"SuperShow\\", meaning wrestlers could appear on both Raw and SmackDown.http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2011-08-29/results The year 2011 saw a highly acclaimed feud between the company's two most high-profile superstars at that point, John Cena and CM Punk. Their match at Money in the Bank on July 17, 2011 was named one of the greatest matches in WWE history. Punk, who had become a top star during the summer of 2011 due to his infamous \\"Pipe bomb\\" promo, would hold the WWE Championship for 434 days before losing to The Rock in 2013 at the 2013 Royal Rumble, a reign recognized by WWE as the sixth- longest championship reign of all-time and the longest in 25 years. The Rock defended the championship until he was defeated by John Cena at WrestleMania 29 in a rematch from their bout the previous year. Popular stable The Shield were prominently featured during this period.http://www.wwe.com/inside/the- shields-10-best-six-man-tag-team-matches On December 15, 2013, the World Heavyweight Championship and WWE Championship were unified in a Tables, Ladders and Chairs match between John Cena and Randy Orton, which Orton won and the unified championship was briefly called the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, but wound soon be renamed as just the WWE Championship.https://pwinsider.com/article/82221/complete-wwe-tlc-coverage- the-unified-wwe-world-champion-is-crowned-and-much-more.html?p=1  Launch of NXT (2010)  On February 23, 2010, WWE launched a new program on Syfy called NXT. The premise of the show was a reality-like show which saw eight new stars (Rookies) being mentored by Superstars from the main roster (Pros), and ran for just over three months, with the last episode of the first season being on June 1, 2010. The winner of the season was Wade Barrett, mentored by Chris Jericho. Six days after the end of the first season, the rookies, now calling themselves The Nexus, interfered in the Raw main event match between John Cena and CM Punk, attacking both competitors as well as the announcing team, before dismantling the ring area and surrounding equipment. During the segment, Daniel Bryan strangled ring announcer Justin Roberts with the announcer's own tie, which WWE reportedly felt was too violent for their family-friendly programming. As a consequence, WWE announced via their official website four days later that Bryan had been (legitimately) released from his contract. Bryan was later rehired due to fan's outrage over his firing and joined Team WWE against Team Nexus in the 2010 SummerSlam event in a 7 on 7 Elimination Tag Team match, which Team WWE won. NXT lasted for a further three complete seasons, which were won respectively by Kaval, Kaitlyn, and Johnny Curtis. A fifth season, dubbed NXT Redemption, featuring former NXT participants, never announced a winner and quietly ended with Derrick Bateman being the sole remaining participant. Eventually, the show morphed into both a television show and WWE's new official development territory, replacing Florida Championship Wrestling, and is permanently located at Full Sail University. = The Reality Era (2014‚Äì2016) = Brock Lesnar broke The Undertaker's undefeated Wrestlemania streak In 2013, Daniel Bryan became one of the most popular wrestlers in the company. On several occasions, fans would begin hijacking segments in which Bryan was either not involved in, or involved only secondarily, with his \\"Yes!\\" chant. The night after the 2014 Royal Rumble, CM Punk quit WWE due to feeling mistreated by officials within the company while also dealing with a misdiagnosed staph infection. Meanwhile, fan outrage over the misuse of Bryan's character resulted in an unplanned change for the WrestleMania XXX main event. On the March 24, 2014 episode of Raw, Bryan's rival at the time Triple H dubbed this point in WWE as \\"The Reality Era\\" where he acknowledged the Internet and fans being more knowledgeable about the behind-the-scenes workings of WWE as well as having more influence on the company than ever before.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hemBUIEc1uohttps://www.wwe.com/polls/what- is-your-favorite-wwe-era Bryan would eventually be inserted into the main event of WrestleMania, defeating Randy Orton and Batista in a critically acclaimed triple threat match, and capture the WWE World Heavyweight Championship in the process. Also at WrestleMania XXX, The Undertaker was defeated for the first time at the event by Brock Lesnar, following 21 consecutive victories dating back to 1991. Lesnar would then defeat John Cena at SummerSlam to win the WWE World Heavyweight Championship.http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/2014/john-cena-brock- lesnar-26505313 This was seen as the end of Cena's position as the face of WWE, a position Cena had held since 2005. Lesnar would go on to be featured as the most dominant wrestler of this era.https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2165230-brock-lesnar-destroying-john- cena-at-summerslam-2014-was-brilliant- bookinghttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aCm3NCgGNI The introduction of the WWE Network and the WWE Performance Center were also major breakthroughs during this period. WCW legend Sting, who had previously been dubbed the \\"greatest wrestler to never wrestle in WWE\\", made his debut at the 2014 Survivor Series and had his first-ever match in WWE at WrestleMania 31 against Triple H, a match he would lose. WrestleMania 32 in Arlington, Texas (billed as Dallas) garnered the largest crowd to ever attend a WWE event, surpassing a disputed 100,000 attendees. In the main event, Roman Reigns defeated Triple H to capture the WWE World Heavyweight Championship.

At Wrestlemania 34 in 2018, Charlotte ended Asuka's 914 days undefeated streak. The Three members of The Shield: Seth Rollins, Dean Ambrose and Roman Reigns, have been by far the most featured stars in the WWE in the men's division during the New Era. The 2016 Payback event, held on May 1, 2016, was billed as the start of a \\"New Era\\". In the main event Roman Reigns would retain the WWE World Heavyweight Championship against AJ Styles. Later in May 2016, WWE announced that a roster split, similar to the one in 2002, would take place beginning in July. The three former members of The Shield: Dean Ambrose, Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins have been heavily featured since the start of the New Era, with all three men exchanging the WWE World Heavyweight Championship at Money in the Bank in June 2016.Kennedy, Jamie (June 21, 2016). \\"WWE Money In The Bank 2016: 10 Things You Probably Missed\\".

While the now renamed WWE World Championship would be moved to the SmackDown brand, the new WWE Universal Championship was introduced for the Raw brand, with Finn B√°lor becoming the inaugural champion. The Divas division was rebranded as the Women's division and the company introduced a new WWE Women's Championship and retired the Divas Championship.

It was shown on two nights of April 4 and April 5 respectively. In the main event of Night 1 The Undertaker defeated AJ Styles in a Boneyard match which was well praised.https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2885079-wwe- wrestlemania-36-results-winners-grades-reaction-and-highlights-from- day-1#slide9 In the main event of Night 2 Drew McIntyre defeated Brock Lesnar for the WWE Championship in a match critically panned for its short length.https://www.cnet.com/news/wwe-wrestlemania-36-day-2-results-new- champion-match-ratings-and-full-recap/ Despite having no attendance due to the circumstances, WrestleMania 36 was the most viewed event in WWE history with a record 967 million views combining both nights across the company's digital and social platforms.https://www.wwe.com/article/wrestlemania-36-sets- viewership-recordshttps://comicbook.com/wwe/2020/04/07/wwe- wrestlemania-36-viewership-breaks-records-20-percent/ On July 2, 2020, the WWE had purchased rival turned partnered-wrestling promotion Evolve and acquired all their wrestling talents.https://www.cbr.com/wwe-purchases-evolve- wrestling/  Other  = WWE Online = In 1998, Shane McMahon helped form WWE's digital media department and launched WWF.com on May 21, 1998 (now known as WWE.com), a site that receives more than seven million hits a month. = Death of Owen Hart = Owen Hart On May 23, 1999, Owen Hart fell to his death in Kansas City, Missouri during the Over the Edge pay-per-view event. Hart was in the process of being lowered via harness and grapple line into the ring from the rafters of Kemper Arena for a booked Intercontinental Championship match against The Godfather. In keeping with his Blue Blazer's new \\"buffoonish superhero\\" character, he was to begin a dramatic entrance, being lowered to just above ring level, at which time he would act \\"entangled\\", then release himself from the safety harness and fall flat on his face for comedic effect‚Äîthis necessitated the use of a quick release mechanism. It was an elaboration on a Blue Blazer stunt done previously on the Sunday Night Heat before Survivor Series in 1998. While being lowered into the ring, Hart fell 78 feet (24 m), landing chest-first on the top rope (approximately a foot from the nearest turnbuckle), throwing him into the ring. Hart had performed the stunt only a few times before. Hart's widow Martha has suggested that, by moving around to get comfortable with both the harness and his cape on, Hart unintentionally triggered an early release. Television viewers did not see the incident. Moments after the fall, a pre-taped vignette was being shown on the pay-per-view broadcast as well as on the monitors in the darkened arena. Afterward, while Hart was being worked on by medical personnel inside the ring, the live event's broadcast showed only the audience. Meanwhile, WWF television announcer Jim Ross repeatedly told those watching live on pay-per- view that what had just transpired was not a wrestling angle or storyline and that Hart was hurt badly, emphasizing the seriousness of the situation. Hart was transported to Truman Medical Center in Kansas City. While several attempts to revive him were made, he died from his injuries; some believe he died in the ring.Jerry \\"The King\\" Lawler claimed this was the case at the end of the \\"Raw is Owen\\" special the night after the accident. The cause of death was later revealed to be internal bleeding from blunt force trauma. = Legends program and the WWE Hall of Fame = The Legends program began informally with the return of the WWE Hall of Fame ceremony in 2004, held annually during WrestleMania weekends. The introduction of WWE 24/7, WWE's on- demand television service, the WWE Network, WWE's over-the-top streaming service and the success of career retrospective home video releases such as The Ultimate Ric Flair Collection, Roddy Piper: Born to Controversy, and Brian Pillman: Loose Cannon have ingrained WWE's modern product with a sense of heritage, and allows a new generation of wrestling fans to witness matches and events they may only previously have heard of. WWE will also offer a select group of former or retired WWE wrestlers, billing them publicly as \\"WWE Legends\\", contracts to make periodic appearances‚Äîeither on WWE TV or for promotional events‚Äîand to serve as \\"Ambassadors\\" (public representatives/spokespeople) for the company. = Death of Eddie Guerrero = Eddie Guerrero as one half of the WWE Tag Team Champions On the morning of November 13, 2005, Chavo Guerrero checked into a hotel with his uncle, Eddie Guerrero, in Minneapolis, Minnesota where they were both scheduled be a part of a planned Raw and SmackDown! \\"Supershow\\" (a show where both Raw and SmackDown! would take place the same night in the same arena). After Eddie missed a wake-up call, security opened his hotel room and Chavo found his uncle unconscious. Chavo attempted CPR, but 38-year-old Eddie was declared dead at the scene. Vickie Guerrero, Eddie's wife, later announced that an autopsy ruled the cause of death to be massive heart failure. Guerrero's death fell on the day that he had been scheduled to compete in a match for the World Heavyweight Championship versus Batista and Randy Orton. The company held tributes to Guerrero on both Raw and SmackDown during the week following his death. On April 1, 2006 at the WWE Hall of Fame induction ceremonies during WrestleMania 22 weekend, Guerrero's wife Vickie accepted his posthumous induction into WWE Hall of Fame by Rey Mysterio, Chris Benoit, and his nephew Chavo Guerrero. Following Guerrero's death, Vince McMahon announced a new drug policy under which performers would be subject to random drug tests by an independent company and would receive regular medical physicals with an emphasis on cardiovascular health. = Chris Benoit's double-murder and suicide = Chris Benoit On June 25, 2007, the Fayette County Police notified WWE around 4:15 p.m., informing them that they had discovered three bodies of Chris, Nancy, and their seven-year-old son Daniel Benoit at their home in Fayette County, Georgia, and the house was now ruled as a \\"major crime scene\\". WWE canceled the scheduled three-hour-long live Raw show on June 25 (which, coincidentally, was supposed to be a scripted memorial for the Mr. McMahon character), and replaced the broadcast version with a tribute to his life and career, featuring past matches, segments from the Hard Knocks: The Chris Benoit Story DVD, and comments from wrestlers and announcers from the Raw, SmackDown! and the now-defunct ECW brands. Shortly after the program aired, many of the aired comments were posted on WWE.com. It was not until the program was nearly over that reports surfaced that police were working under the belief that Benoit murdered his wife and son before killing himself over a three-day period. The next night, after some of the details of the deaths became available, the company aired a recorded statement by its chairman Vince McMahon before their ECW broadcast: Following the double-murder suicide committed by Chris Benoit, the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform began investigating WWE regarding their Wellness policy. After Benoit's death, the WWE began to tone down the violence, swearing and sexual content of their product. Furthermore, after further deaths among WWE wrestlers were found (including Benoit's) to have been caused by chronic traumatic encephalopathy, which was an emerging study in brain injuries in sport, WWE legitimately banned chair shots to the head. = Social media and WWE HD = The SmackDown stage, an example of the universal WWE High Definition stage set In January 2008, WWE began broadcasting in high- definition, beginning with the January 21 episode of Raw, while the 2008 Royal Rumble was the first pay-per-view event presented in HD. On November 19, 2008, WWE officially launched their online social network, WWE Universe. It opened in April as WWE Fan Nation, and adopted the name WWE Universe a few months later. The website was similar to MySpace, with blogs, forums, photos, videos, and other features. Despite a heightened popularity the site was shut down on January 1, 2011 and has since replaced with WWE InterAction. Since closing down their social media website, WWE has created accounts on social media websites such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Tout, and Instagram, with executive vice president of digital media Perkins Miller stating that \\"social media is going to transform our company\\". In July 2012, WWE made an investment of $5 million into Tout, and a month later released an official app. In 2013, WWE's main Twitter account was cited as one of the top 25 most engaged brands on the website. In 2014, WWE launched WWE SuperCard, a trading card app game, which was downloaded 1.5 million times in the first week of its launch. = WWE Network = In September 2011, WWE officially announced plans to launch the WWE Network in time for WrestleMania XXVIII. WWE's official website featured a countdown clock that would have expired on April 1, 2012 however, the clock was quietly removed, and the network did not launch as advertised. At the Consumer Electronics Show on January 8, 2014, WWE announced the WWE Network would launch on February 24, 2014 in the United States. WWE called the network \\"the first-ever 24/7 streaming network\\". On February 27, 2014, the WWE Network aired its first ever live event, NXT Arrival, which featured three championship matches and a well-received match between Cesaro and Sami Zayn. Despite #CancelWWENetwork trending on social media in early 2015 after angry fans were upset with the booking of the 2015 Royal Rumble match, the trend did not prevent the Network from its continued growth, reaching 1 million subscribers the very same week. = Pink Ribbon campaigning = Starting in October 2012, WWE formed a partnership with Susan G. Komen for the Cure to promote breast cancer awareness.showbizjunkies As part of the campaign, WWE adorned their sets with pink ribbons, put up a pink middle rope on the ring, filmed numerous PSAs, and sold special John Cena \\"Rise Above Cancer\\" merchandise.BR article All of these efforts culminated in a donation from WWE of $1 million, which was presented to Susan G. Komen representatives in an in- ring ceremony during the October 29, 2012 episode of Raw.WWE YOUTUBE The campaign continued every year since, but caused controversy as the foundation has been accused of pinkwashing. = Backstage harassment = In April 2017, WWE became embroiled in a scandal concerning the company allowing certain employees to harass others, most notably John \\"Bradshaw\\" Layfield. According to multiple sources including Dave Meltzer's Wrestling Observer, hazing is something which is encouraged by the higher ups in the company and has been going on since the company's inception. = Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (2020‚Äìpresent) = In March 2020, WWE began to be impacted by the American onset of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The March 11 episode of NXT was filmed without spectators at the WWE Performance Center facility in Orlando, as three of the four major sports leagues had announced two days earlier that they would close locker rooms to the media as a precautionary measure. As other sports cancellations and postponements were being announced, WWE officially announced on March 12 that its weekly programs, beginning with the following night's episode of SmackDown, would be filmed at the Performance Center with no spectators and only essential staff present. Major pay per view events including WrestleMania 36 have been aired taped without any attendance as opposed to being aired live. NXT has continued to air from Full Sail University, but under similar restrictions. The highly advertised NXT TakeOver: In Your House aired taped in June 2020, however certain WWE officials were used as part of a very limited crowd for the event.https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/wwe-nxt-takeover-in-your-house- results-recap-grades-incredible-womens-main-event-steals-nostalgic-show/live/ Live broadcasts returned on April 13, with the existing arrangements continuing; WWE stated to ESPN.com that \\"we believe it is now more important than ever to provide people with a diversion from these hard times\\", and that the company's programming \\"bring[s] families together and deliver a sense of hope, determination and perseverance\\". It was subsequently reported that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis had deemed WWE a business critical to the state's economy, and had added an exception under the state's stay-at-home order for employees of a \\"professional sports and media production\\" that is closed to the public and has a national audience. The decision was met with criticism from media outlets, with several media outlets pointing out that DeSantis' actions happened on the same day a pro-Donald Trump political action committee led Linda McMahon, who was previously a part of Trump's cabinet, pledged to spend $18.5 million in advertising in Florida, and that, also on the same day, Vince McMahon was named part of an advisory group created by Trump to devise a strategy in re-launching US economy. On April 15, WWE announced a series of cuts and layoffs in response to the pandemic, including releasing a number of personnel. WWE executives also took a pay cut, and the company has also suspended construction on its new headquarters for at least six months. The firings released significant backlash with both fans; with Business Insider calling them \\"livid.\\" Both fans and several media outlets pointed out that while WWE claimed that these actions were \\"necessary due to the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic\\". The WWE also claimed to have \\"substantial financial resources. Available cash and debt capacity currently total approximately $0.5 billion\\". DeSantis' claimed WWE was \\"essential\\", which meant that the company's revenues loss would be limited.
