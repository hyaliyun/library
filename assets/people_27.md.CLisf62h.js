The edifice was constructed in 1899-1900 to be the new headquarters for the city's Masonic lodge, as its former meeting place had burned down in 1898. The lodge, formally known as the Rock River Lodge Number 612 A.F. & A.M., first met in 1869 and was the town's second chapter of the Masons. Architect George W. Ashby designed the lodge's new building in the Chateauesque style. The building's design includes a steep mansard roof with equally steep dormers adorned with pinnacles, buttresses topped by ornamental griffins, and a brick and stone exterior. The Masons met on the third story, as Masonic meeting rooms were typically elevated for secrecy; the lower two floors were rented to businesses. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 7, 1996. The Masonic lodge still meets in the building, though its membership has declined dramatically since the 1960s.

Haas, released by Allied Artists, and starring Tom Tryon, Jan Merlin, and was the film debut of French Miss Universe 1954 runner up Jacqueline Beer. The story is set during the night of the Normandy Invasion where the 101st Airborne Division jumps into France. The title of the film refers to the nickname of the Division, based on its shoulder sleeve insignia. The film is notable for its large cast of up-and-coming actors. Plot Prior to the Normandy landings, former Merchant Marines Mason (Tom Tryon) and Corliss (Martin Milner) are among three new recruits that are assigned to the 1st Platoon, \\"D\\" Company, 502nd Parachute Infantry Regiment, the other being Talbot (Ralph Votrian). Mason gets off on the wrong foot with certain members of the platoon, mainly Sgt. Forrest (Pat Conway) and Cpl. Dreef (Paul Burke). Mason gets drunk as he reads a Dear John letter from his girlfriend back home. The platoon's passes into town are canceled due to a stand-by for the invasion and are restricted to barracks. When the platoon returns to the barracks, they find it destroyed by a drunken Mason. Platoon Leader Lt. Pauling (Jan Merlin) decides to keep Mason in the platoon and give him a chance, despite his behavior. Lt. Pauling talks to the platoon about Mason's behavior and Corliss speaks positively about him. The men decide to take a chance on him, including Grimes (Alvy Moore), Dubrowski (Joe di Reda), and Foley (Paul Smith). The 502nd find themselves boarding troop planes that will be flying over Normandy, marking the beginning of the Normandy Invasion. Peterson (Robert Dix) begins to suffer from air sickness as a result of forgetting to take his air sickness pills. Sgt. Forrest is the jumpmaster for the platoon's plane and he gives directions on what to do when preparing to jump and what to do on the ground. The platoon is tasked to set up roadblocks and hold a bridge along the Douve, with their drop zone being a mile beyond 2nd Battalion's. Only seconds after the planes fly over the coast the Germans man anti-aircraft cannons and aim them towards the formation of planes. Peterson is killed when flak hits the platoon's plane. After the men jump out of the aircraft they realize that they did not land in their assigned drop zone but create a rallying point. The platoon heads out and Lt. Pauling gives out the order to not engage the enemy single-handedly. The men decide to split up into three groups and they scout the area. Mason sees a German sentry aiming his rifle at Cpl. Dreef and kills the sentry, which results in a firefight that ends with Cpl. Dreef getting killed. Not having seen what Mason did, the others blame him for a hotheaded stunt. After the platoon meets back at their rallying point, the platoon is outraged when Dubrowski tells them what happened. A German soldier fires at Lt. Pauling, the bullet flash burning him. Sgt. Forrest selects Mason to take care of Lt. Pauling, who is now suffering from blindness. The platoon decides to attack a German-infested farmhouse later that morning, resulting in the deaths of Lambert (Mark Damon), Hernandez (Robert Blake), and Nolan (Wayne Taylor). After the firefight, the platoon raids the house, finding a German soldier by the name of Hans Schacht (Robert Boon) holding a French girl named Marianne (Jacqueline Beer) hostage. Hans is taken prisoner and Marianne volunteers to aid Lt. Pauling. Hans informs the platoon that there are 300 German soldiers between them and the Douve. The platoon hijacks a German truck and forces the driver to take them to a tavern that is being used as a German headquarters. At gunpoint, Hans telephones false orders that draw German troops away from their positions. But then he seizes a chance to telephone again so the Germans can hear the platoon chattering in English. A truckload of Germans raid the tavern. Hans is killed by friendly fire. Talbot, Foley, Smith (Edward G. Robinson Jr.), and Torren (Robert Roark) are killed while Mason is wounded in his arm. The seven surviving members of the party (Mason, Lt. Pauling, Marianne, Corliss, Sgt. Forrest, Grimes, and Dubrowski) escape by truck. By midday the party links up with the rest of \\"D\\" Company at the very bridge that they were supposed to hold. Lt. Pauling bids a farewell to Marianne before he and Mason are driven to a field hospital. Cast * Tom Tryon as Pvt. Mason * Jan Merlin as Lt. Pauling * Jacqueline Beer as Marianne * Alvy Moore as Pvt.

Many local civic and business leaders were members of the lodge. Containing a large ballroom and other meeting space, the building was an important venue in Winona for both Masonic activities and general public events. The Winona Masonic Temple was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998 for having state-level significance in the themes of art and social history. It was nominated as the headquarters of a fraternal organization important to Winona's civic and social development, and for containing Minnesota's largest collection of Masonic theatre backdrops and stage equipment. Masonic history of Winona Many Euro-American men who came to Minnesota in the mid to late nineteenth century were Freemasons. Consequently, the development of Masonry in Minnesota paralleled the organization of many of the state's first towns. In 1853 a Grand Masonic Lodge was organized by the three lodges that already existed in Stillwater, Saint Paul, and St. Anthony. The Grand Lodge dispensed charters for new lodges and created standard procedures and rituals. In January 1857 a charter was issued for Winona Lodge No. 18. For the first several years of its existence the Winona Lodge met in various buildings. Meetings were mostly held in members' places of business. In 1863 and 1864 local chapters of the Royal Arch and Knights Templar Masons merged with the Winona Lodge. In 1873 the Masons moved to the third floor of the new Laird Norton Lumber Company Building. The space was designed according to the Masons' specifications. In the late nineteenth century membership grew and the Masonic activities of the Winona Masons became more complex. New Masonic chapters were formed under other Masonic orders. Several bodies were charted that followed the Scottish Rite Valley, one of the most complex orders of Freemasonry. In 1900 a local chapter of the Order of the Eastern Star was formed that allowed female members. With membership growing the Winona Masonic Benevolent Association (WMBA) was formed in 1906. Part of the WMBA's mission was to construct a new Masonic temple. The WMBA commissioned architects Warren Powers Laird and C.F. Osborne of Philadelphia. Local contractor John Lohse constructed the building. The temple was built in a red brick and stone Beaux-Arts tradition of the Neoclassical style. One of the Temple's historic stage backdrops The most prominent interior feature was a large proscenium-arch stage at the heart of the building. The stage and its scenery were important in the rites and rituals of the various orders of masons, especially the Scottish Rite. The WMBA bought ninety-eight hand- painted scenic drops that were produced by Sosman and Landis Scene Painting Studios in Chicago. The temple was completed in December 1909 with mahogany finishes that reflected Masonic ideology. Masonic furniture and other decorations were also purchased. The Masons were highly respected in Winona, and the construction of the temple only served to heighten their presence in the community. Masonic events held at the temple consistently brought large numbers of people to Winona. The town's role as a Scottish Rite headquarters also brought regional Masonic conferences to the city for over eighty years. The large ballroom hosted balls, banquets, and civic events. In the 1930s membership in Masonic organizations began to wane. The Winona Temple, because it was a center for the Scottish Rite, fared better than many others. However, in 1978 the Winona Temple lost what made it prominent when the Scottish Rite was moved to a temple in Rochester, Minnesota. A year later the WMBA sold the Winona Temple to the city. The valuable scenic drops were left in the building even though the Scottish Rite had moved. Current use In 1979 the Winona Masonic Benevolent Association sold the building to the city to create a senior center on the ground floor, while retaining access to the upper second and third floors. In 1997 the Theatre du Mississippi was founded and began performances in the Masonic Temple. The city of Winona also rents out the facility as an event venue.

Background Immediately after the New Zealand general election, 2008, the new National-led government announced that, in accordance with its coalition agreement with the ACT Party, it would delay implementation of the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme (\\"NZ ETS\\") as established by the Labour Government in the Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2008 and set up the Emissions Trading Scheme Review Committee to review the NZ ETS. In November 2008, the National Business Review reported that an international carbon trading company, EcoSecurities Group, had postponed opening an office in New Zealand because of the National Government‚Äôs decision to delay the NZ ETS. Terms of reference The National-ACT coalition agreement mentioned reviewing the emissions trading scheme and possible alternatives to it, as well as \\"hear[ing] competing views on the scientific aspects of climate change\\" and considering whether responding to climate change is economically worthwhile. New Zealand Herald journalist Brian Rudman commented that National's approach was \\"indulging Mr Hide in his fruitcake views on global warming\\". However, the final terms of reference, released on 9 December 2008, were to: \\"identify the central/benchmark projections which are being used as the motivation for international agreements to combat climate change; and consider the uncertainties and risks surrounding those projections\\". The most economic-oriented term was to: \\"consider the impact on the New Zealand economy and New Zealand households of any climate change policies, having regard to the weak state of the economy, the need to safeguard New Zealand's international competitiveness, the position of trade- exposed industries, and the actions of competing countries\\". Report of the Select Committee On 31 August 2009, the Emissions Trading Scheme Review Committee reported back to Parliament, with Climate Change Issues Minister Nick Smith stating that the National-led Government was still intending to amend the NZ ETS.Nick Smith, Minister for Climate Change Issues, Govt welcomes ETS Review Committee report, 31 August 2009, retrieved 15 September 2009, New Zealand Government Media Release. The report consisted of minority reports from the New Zealand Labour Party, the Green Party, the MƒÅori Party and the ACT Party. The chairman of the Committee, Peter Dunne, described report as a 'middle road' through 'complex and contentious' material. According to NZ Law firm Simpson Grierson, although the review report made 34 recommendations on climate change policy, it did not make any specific recommendations to amend either the NZ ETS or the Climate Change Response Act 2002. Simpson Grierson considered that the key findings of the review were that: * the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report represents a consensus on scientific evidence, and should underpin New Zealand's policy. * the ETS should be the primary economic mechanism to respond to climate change. * the ETS should cover all sectors and all gases * at the December 2009 Copenhagen Climate Conference New Zealand should seek an agreement that reflects New Zealand‚Äôs willingness to do its fair share and play its part in setting the stage for further multilateral action for the post-2012 period. Rod Oram described the recommendations made by the report as \\"obvious, indecisive or generic\\". Oram considered that the politics of the review were to provide a \\"sop to the ACT party and a time- waster for National\\". Oram concluded that the review had 'failed to make any serious contribution towards improving the working of the ETS'. On 14 September 2009, the National Government announced that it had reached an agreement with the MƒÅori Party about revisions to the NZ ETS. On 24 September 2009, the Climate Change Response (Moderated Emissions Trading) Amendment Bill had its first reading in Parliament.

Club history =Formation= In 1907 the first two rugby league teams in Wales were formed, Ebbw Vale and Merthyr Tydfil. Although South Wales was best known for its rugby union teams, events in Aberdare and the Rhondda between 1905 and 1907 had revealed several clubs were breaking amateur rules and were paying their players. This led to club and player suspensions by the Welsh Rugby Union, and this in turn led to some clubs considering switching to the professional Northern Union and rugby league. On 1 January 1908, Aberdare hosted a Wales versus New Zealand encounter in the world's first full international rugby league game. Then, on 20 April, Tonypandy was chosen as the location for the very first rugby league encounter between Wales and England,Gate (1986) pg. 141 with the match played at the local Athletic Ground.Lush (1998), pg. 31 Wales won 35‚Äì18, and a crowd of 12000 was recorded. The Mid-Rhondda club, also known as the Mid-Rhondda Social and Athletic Club, was formed just a few weeks after the Wales vs. England game and was admitted to the Northern Union on 30 June 1908. The club headquarters was at the Cross Keys Hotel in Tonypandy, and their home pitch was the Athletic Ground, later known as King George's Park. With the formation that year of three other Welsh league teams, Barry, Aberdare and Treherbert, a Welsh League was formed allowing Mid-Rhondda to compete in two leagues. =1908‚Äì09= touring 'Kangaroos', the 1908 Australia team that played Mid-Rhondda Mid-Rhondda played their debut in the Northern Rugby League on 5 September 1908 in a home fixture with Bradford Northern.

This was followed by a string of defeats to Treherbert, Ebbw Vale and Merthyr, before the club faced international opposition, the first touring Australian team. Mid-Rhondda were the Australians' first opponents of the tour, and a crowd of 7500 was recorded for the match, one of the largest attendances of the tour.Kangaroo Tour: 1908‚Äì1909 Sean Fagan, rl1908.com The Australians led 18‚Äì0 at half time, but tries from Frank Wrentmore and Dai Thomas, gave Mid-Rhondda some respectability, losing the match 20‚Äì6.Lush (1998), pg. 32 Australia's Dally Messenger, one of rugby league's greatest players, scored two tries and four goals during the match.

On 12 December, the club played in their first Challenge Cup match, and were drawn against fellow Rhondda team, Treherbert. In a close encounter, Mid-Rhondda won 8‚Äì7, opening up a tie in the next round to Barry. The second round cup game took place just two weeks later, with Mid-Rhondda winning 2‚Äì0 to take them into the quarter- finals. The season continued in a familiar pattern for Mid-Rhondda with fair success over the Welsh teams, but being unable to beat the English teams. The club beat Barry in the Northern League and Welsh League, managed a double victory over Aberdare and Merthyr and a win and a loss to Treherbert. Amongst these games there were loses to Broughton Rangers (0‚Äì6), Swinton (7‚Äì16) and Hull (7‚Äì15). On 27 February, the club faced Hunslet in the quarter-finals of the Challenge Cup; however Hunslet proved too strong, with their star player Billy Batten scoring four tries in a 25‚Äì5 victory over the Welshmen. Mid- Rhondda finished the season with a record of 18 games played in the Northern League, five won, one drawn and twelve loses, leaving them 24th out of 31 clubs. =Switch to association= At the end of the season the club officials stated that they had not been happy with the low attendances and financial rewards offered by the Northern Union game. In April 1909, the Athletic Ground played host to the final of the South Wales and Monmouthshire Association Football Cup, played between Merthyr Town and Ton Pentre. The game, won by Ton Pentre 2‚Äì0, was watched by a crowd of 8,000, an attendance figure Mid-Rhondda only matched when they faced the touring Australians. After the match, the Mid-Rhondda chairman stated that the financial position under the Northern Union had not realised expectations, and that as far as club could see, soccer was the coming game. In July 1909, it was reported that neither Treherbert or Mid-Rhondda, would be included in the Challenge Cup draw as both teams were in arrears to the Northern Union as of 30 June. In the same month Mid-Rhondda RLFC withdrew from the Northern Rugby League, and as was expected an Association side appeared at the Athletic Ground, called Mid-Rhondda AFC, from the 1909‚Äì10 season.

It served in this capacity until 1933, when it was decommissioned and replaced with another structure. More recently, it has been restored and opened to the public as a museum. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. Construction The jail was constructed in 1859 using a design by A. B. Cross, a notable early architect in Kansas City, Missouri. It consisted of a home for the countymarshal, with twelve limestone jail cells located at the rear of the residence. A brick structure was added on to the rear of the original jail in 1907, to house chain gangs who worked on roads, sewers and other public projects.1859 Jail, Marshal's Home and Museum . The marshal lived with his family in the Marshal's residence, which was the front half of the structure. The marshal's wife often cooked meals for the prisoners, as well as her own family, in a small kitchen at the back of the house. The Marshal was paid about $50 per month, plus the use of the house, for his services. The marshal's office formed part of the residence, but had a separate entryway from the house. The jail consisted of six upstairs and six downstairs cells, with two-foot thick walls of limestone blocks. A single kerosene lamp in the hallway provided the only light at night. Two doors, one of grated iron and one of solid iron, were provided for each cell, as was a window covered with grated iron that permitted wind from the outside to enter. The cells were not heated, and some prisoners incarcerated inside died of exposure during the jail's history.Team Searches for the Supernatural in 1859 Jail . Independence Examiner, 18 June 2010. Each cell was six by nine feet and designed to hold three prisoners, though during the Civil War, as many as twenty prisoners were confined in each one. Some of the crimes for which a person could be imprisoned in the jail prior to the Civil War included: horse racing on public streets, firing guns in town, operating a gaming house, assault and battery, disturbing the peace, disturbing a religious meeting, or building a privy \\"not over a pit\\". Famous prisoners During the American Civil War, the jail held both military and civilian prisoners, and served as the U.S. Provost Marshal's office. William Clark Quantrill, the famous Confederate guerrilla leader, was briefly incarcerated there, as were those who refused to take a pro-Union loyalty oath. After the war, its most famous inmate would be Frank James, older brother to the famous outlaw Jesse James, who spent almost six months here in the 1880s. During his time at the jail, James' cell was furnished with a Brussels carpet, fine furniture and paintings, and he was permitted free run of the jail and hosted card games in his cell at night. Frank James' cell is preserved as it was when he occupied it, as part of the modern museum.

It is a significant example of unaltered, Modernistic style commercial architecture, combining Late Gothic Revival and Art Deco decorative elements. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. The building was constructed in two phases. A six-story building, built in 1911-12, was enlarged in 1931-1932 with an eight-story, south unit. As part of the enlargement, two additional stories were added atop the 1911-1912 unit. The building, constructed on level grade, faces west onto Walnut Street. Modernistic in style, the building is an amalgam of Late Gothic Revival and Art Deco design elements. The most ornate area of the building's exterior; is the west facade, with embellishments and eighth story step-backs creating a strong vertical and rectilinear effect. The building is currently controlled by Kansas City-based real estate firm Copaken Brooks and is planned to be used as a mixed commercial and residential property sometime in the future. History The Jenkins Music Company has been a musical institution in Kansas City since its founding in 1878 by John Wesley Jenkins, Sr. During the 1880s Jenkins brought in his son, John Wesley, Jr. to form the J.W. Jenkins and Son Music Company. Apparently following the death of Jenkins, Sr, in approximately 1890, J.W. Jenkins, Jr., with his brothers, Frederick B. and Clifford W., formed the J.W. Jenkins' Sons Music Company, During the decade of the 1890s, the Jenkins Company became one of the largest manufacturers of guitars and mandolins in the world and one of the most distinguished publishers of sheet music in the nation. By 1931, the firm reorganized and became the Jenkins Music Company. Following three successive moves, the firm completed in 1912, a six-story fireproof building at 1217 Walnut Street, designed by Smith, Rea & Lovitt and built by Harvey Stiver. In 1932, the enlargement of the 1912 unit was completed from plans by Charles A. Smith and the construction was executed by A. J. Rector Construction Company. The newly expanded building boasted of an intricate ventilation and air condition system, plus several interior features that enhanced the business aspects of the music company. Each floor was utilized for the merchandising of musical instruments and supplies. One unusual feature of the building was a small space on the fifth floor devoted to a remote control broadcasting studio. The eighth floor contained Steinway Hall, an auditorium and recital hall, which had a seating capacity for approximately 240 people. In 1947, the Jenkins Music Company sponsored the first summer conference of new music, which brought several hundred of the nation's leading music teachers, composers, and performers to the event. The participants of the Jenkins Conferences, held in the building, discussed musical composition, materials, instruction and new trends in music. The conference was held for eight successive years. At its height, during the 1950s, the Jenkins Music Company employed nearly 700 persons and operated throughout Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas and Arkansas under the management of the Jenkins family. By August 1971, due to financial difficulties caused by strong competition, the Jenkins Company filed for bankruptcy. In July, 1973, David Richard son, founder of Rich Music Inc., acquired the Jenkins Company, later closing a majority of the former Jenkins Music Stores in the city and the surrounding area.

Let's Move! was a public health campaign in the United States, led by Michelle Obama, wife of then-President Barack Obama. The campaign aimed to reduce childhood obesity and encourage a healthy lifestyle in children. The initiative had the initially stated goal of \\"solving the challenge of childhood obesity within a generation so that children born today will reach adulthood at a healthy weight.\\" Let's Move sought to decrease childhood obesity to 5% by 2030. History The campaign was announced on February 9, 2010 by Michelle Obama. The campaign was funded by diverting money away from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (food stamps). Obama indicated the campaign would encourage healthier food in schools, better food labeling and more physical activity for children. On the same date, Obama signed a presidential memorandum creating the Task Force on Childhood Obesity to review current programs and develop a national action plan. The Task Force reviews policy and programs related to child nutrition and physical activity. It hopes to create change through a national action plan with five goals: *Creating a healthy start for children *Empowering parents and caregivers *Providing healthy food in schools *Improving access to healthy, affordable foods *Increasing physical activity The White House Task Force hoped to bring the childhood obesity rate down to five percent by 2030. A song, \\"Move Your Body\\", was released to promote the campaign called Let's Move! Flash Workout. The song was by Beyonc√© and Swizz Beatz, and the video was filmed in a school cafeteria where Beyonc√© was dancing with children. The initiative was led for several years by Sam Kass, the personal chef to the Obamas who became the first-ever White House Senior Policy Advisor on Nutrition. He was succeeded in 2015 as both Executive Director of Let's Move! and Senior Policy Advisor on Nutrition by Debra Eschmeyer, a cofounder of FoodCorps. Since the Let's Move initiative was a collaboration of many government agencies and private entities, it lacked full-time employees. Department heads, business executives, volunteers, teachers, legislators, and others carry out the mission and goals of Let's Move in conjunction with their primary work obligations. Michelle Obama is the chief spokeswoman and promoter, but she does not have staff solely dedicated to carrying out the Let's Move initiative.Let's Move. Learn the Facts. Accomplishments. 2010. (accessed 27 Sept. 2015). Childhood obesity Obama participates in a Let's Move! and Sesame Street public service announcement taping with Big Bird in the White House Kitchen, 2013. Body mass index (BMI) is a measurement of weight in relation to height that can help to determine weight status. In children, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) determine that is overweight if he/she is above the 85th percentile and lower than the 95th percentile and obese if at or above the 95th percentile. The CDC indicates that there are several factors that can contribute to childhood obesity: genetic factors; behavioral factors including energy intake, physical activity and sedentary behavior; and environmental factors. Overweight and obesity pose many potential risks and consequences: psychological; cardiovascular disease; among additional risks including asthma, hepatic steatosis, sleep apnea, and type 2 diabetes. Today nearly one in five children in the U.S. between ages 6‚Äì19 are obese, and one in three are overweight. The childhood obesity rate tripled from 1980‚Äì1999 creating an epidemic and a generation where children may have shorter life spans than their parents. The Let's Move! initiative focuses on the reform of behavioral factors and environmental factors by focusing on active lifestyles and healthy eating through community involvement, including but not limited to schools, parents, work places, and healthcare providers. Nutrition To promote healthy eating, the Let's Move! initiative emphasizes nutrition information, a next generation food \\"icon\\", food nutrition labeling and having pediatricians as partners. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) presents its Let's Move food choice guidelines on the webpage called MyPlate, located at ChooseMyPlate.gov. Guidelines take the form of \\"half all grains eaten should be whole grains\\" and 37 nutrition tips. Let's Move! also provides consumers with nutrition information through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (or FDA)'s \\"New Front-of-Package Labeling Initiative\\" and \\"New Menu and Vending Machines Labeling Requirements\\". President Barack Obama meets with children from a Let's Move! tennis clinic on the South Lawn of the White House. Let's Move! advocates healthy eating habits to be promoted by families, schools, and communities. Let's Move! urges mothers to eat more healthily when pregnant and offers links to a special \\"MyPyramid Plan for Moms\\" so they can create a personalized and healthy diet. The initiative also provides guidelines for parents to set up and promote healthy eating habits for their entire family and children. In order for healthier eating to be promoted at schools, Let's Move! promotes the USDA's HealthierUS School Challenge. Random House publishers has said Michelle Obama will be writing a book on her White House garden, and her family's favorite healthy cooking ideas. Community involvement For Let's Move to work effectively, communities would need to be involved, schools would need to implement health programs, and parents would need to teach their children healthy habits. The following sections describe how organizations and businesses had gotten involved in this nationwide movement. =Chefs Move to Schools= Chefs Move to Schools was founded in May 2010 as part of First Lady Michelle Obama's Let's Move campaign. The Chefs Move to Schools program is a nationwide effort to teach culinary skills to school children and to get them to try new, healthful food options. Professional chefs volunteer a specified amount of their time to cook with students and/or to help train school workers in how to prepare and provide food in a healthier manner. As of February 2, 2012 about 3,500 schools were partnered with professional chefs in an effort to educate students about a healthier diet in an entertaining and appealing way. The program is also figure headed by Chef Sam Kass, an assistant chef at the White House and the Senior Policy Advisor for Healthy Food Initiatives. Food Network star Rachael Ray also publicly supports the program and has encouraged children to be involved in the kitchen on episodes of her show Rachael Ray. Other partners of the program include the School Nutrition Association, the American Culinary Federation, Cooking Matters, the United States Department of Agriculture, the Culinary Trust, the Partnership for a Healthier America, Cornell University, Philip Lempert the Supermarket Guru, the Harvard School of Public Health, the International Corporate Chefs Association, and the Food Service Management Institute. Chefs can sign up to participate in the program on the website on the official Chefs Move to Schools website to be matched with a school in their area. They can select any or all of what they are interested in: helping to plant a school garden, teaching children about healthier living in the classroom, helping officials to develop school lunch menu items, and training students about culinary skills in the kitchen. On the application, chefs are also asked to provide information about their qualifications and training. Chefs are asked to specify how many hours they can devote to the program and which days of the week they can volunteer. These profiles are matched with other profiles that are created by schools to become an official partnership. Once the partnership is created, Chefs Move to Schools provides schools and chefs with resources to help them get started and to help guide both parties through a successful process. =Business involvement= Private businesses have also decided to make changes to improve healthy habits for kids. For example, Disney now requires that all foods sold and advertised have to follow nutritional guidelines of increasing fruit and vegetable consumption while decreasing calorie count. Also, Walgreens, Superval, and Walmart have announced building or expanding stores in areas that have limited access to healthy foods. Physical activity Cherokee practice their choreography for a new student- produced fitness video The CDC recommends that children engage in one hour or more of physical activity every day. It states that children should do three different types of activity: aerobic activity, muscle strengthening, and bone strengthening. Let's Move! looks to promote physical activity through the support and cooperation of families, schools, and communities. On children, the initiative states, \\"Those who feel supported by friends and families or are surrounded by others interested in physical activity, are more likely to participate.\\" Let's Move! also provides several guidelines for schools to promote physical activity, including strong physical education programs, and indicates the subsidizing of such guidelines with several government programs. Guidelines by which physical activity can be promoted in communities are also outlined on the Let's Move! website. Impact evaluation The Center for Disease Control publishes obesity rates broken down by age group. The report found that between 2009 and 2012, the obesity rate dropped by 3.7 percentage points among children aged 2‚Äì5, dropped by 0.3 points among those aged 6‚Äì11, and increased by 2.1 points among those aged 12‚Äì19. By 2015, childhood obesity rates had not changed much since 2008 but had dropped significantly among the youngest children; the exact impact that Let's Move! has had on these trends is uncertain. A major concern with the Let's Move program is that it does not evaluate itself, nor is it documented how much money was spent. It allows programs like the Center for Disease Control and other independent organizations to evaluate whether or not Let's Move is making a difference. This causes critics and proponents to have a hard time improving the program without measurements, and the program lacks an understanding of impact. Let's Move would benefit immensely from putting together its own group to go through steps to evaluate how its program is affecting the country. It should be evaluated on two major indicators: increasing healthy childhood eating and increasing childhood physical activity. Collaboration Let's Move faces a challenge: effective coordination between all involved agencies, companies, non-profits, and levels of government. Dr. Susanna Campbell, an international relations scholar, and Michael Harnett, an international business professional, conducted research and discussed the barriers to coordination, the main concepts of coordination, and recommendations for improving coordination. Rodrigo Serrano also provides insight into creating incentive programs to promote coordination.Campbell, Susanna P. and Michael Hartnett. 2005. A framework for improved coordination. https://www.regjeringen.no/ globalassets/ upload/UD/Vedlegg/missions/framework.pdf (accessed November 25, 2015). Organizations are sovereign and the individuals within are accountable first to their organization and second to the coordination effort. Conflicts can arise when the goals of the coordination process don't align well with an agency's main goals. If there is a pressing problem to solve, it acts as its own incentive for coordination as long as the problem involves a possibility to find a coordinated solution.Serrano, Rodrigo. 2005. What makes inter-agency coordination work? Insights from the literature and two case studies. Inter- American Development Bank Sustainable Development Department Social Development Division. www.iadb.org/sds/soc (accessed November 25, 2015). Of all the incentive programs proposed, an incentive system involving recognition may be the most effective and efficient. Agencies and organizations associated with Let's Move could receive an award as a result of making a positive impact according to Let's Move's goals and mission. Organizations could report their impact to the Task Force, and Michelle Obama could recognize the organizations that engaged the most and had the greatest impact. The award would also help remind organizations of the importance of working together to solve the problem of childhood obesity. Let's Move could also improve its coordination process by establishing clear field officers in each associated organization and have them report to a central authority figure, like the Task Force on Childhood Obesity. The improved coordination process would make sure each organization or agency is accountable and that there isn't overlap or redundancy Accomplishments * 597 museums and gardens in all 50 states have signed up to offer active exhibits and healthy food choices as part of Let's Move! Museums and Gardens. *The Department of Defense updated their nutritional standards to include more fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean meats, and low-fat dairy products with every meal for troops. * Walmart lowered the cost of fruits, vegetables, and whole grain products by $1 billion in 2011. They also promised to work with manufacturers to eliminate trans fats and remove 10% of the sugar and 25% of the sodium in the food they sell by 2015. * Birds Eye committed to spending at least $2 million per year for three years to marketing and advertising efforts designed to encourage children to consume and enjoy vegetables, including 50 million coupons to promote vegetables. * The First Lady worked with the US Tennis Association to build or refurbish more than 6,200 kid-sized tennis courts across the country, sign up more than 250,000 kids to complete their PALAs, and train 12,000 coaches to help kids learn tennis. * The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association funded street-closings, called \\"Play Streets,\\" to create a safe place for children and families to run, walk, bike, or play outside freely without traffic. In 2013, at least four Play Streets per city/town in 10 cities/towns across the country will be funded. * The President's Council on Fitness, Sports and Nutrition updated the President's Challenge Youth Fitness Test to reflect the latest science on kids' health and promote active, healthy lifestyles rather than athletic performance and competition. The new Presidential Youth Fitness Program is a voluntary, school-based program that assesses students' fitness- based health and helps them progress over time. The new program will be implemented in 25 percent of US schools by the end of 2013, and 90 percent of US schools by 2018. * The Partnership for a Healthier America teamed up with 157 hospitals to deliver more healthy options to patients and on-site cafeterias. * Through the HealthierUS School Challenge, more than 5,000 schools now meet high standards in nutrition and fitness. * Walgreens, Supervalu, Walmart and several regional grocers announced a commitment to build or expand 1,500 stores in communities with limited or no access to healthy food. This initiative will provide access to fresh food to an estimated 9.5 million people who currently have limited access. In California alone, the Fresh Works Fund has committed 200 million dollars to this effort to increase access to healthy food. * The First Lady launched MyPlate and MiPlato, an easy to understand icon to help parents make healthier choices for their families.

Flash Workout is a 2011 initiative by Beyonc√© in collaboration with Michelle Obama, and the National Association of Broadcasters Education Foundation to help boost her campaign against child obesity. Beyonc√© reworked \\"Get Me Bodied\\" and renamed it \\"Move Your Body\\" for the Let's Move! Flash Workout initiative. A Spanish version was also created. The lyrics were switched to fit the cause. The new lyrics include the line: \\"Don't just stand there on the wall, everybody just move your body, move your body, move your body.\\" The song is a step-by-step flash dance-style workout that combines hip hop, Latin and dancehall moves with traditional exercise. On April 9, 2011, an instructional video featuring a group of teenagers dancing to \\"Move Your Body\\" was released online. After a few days, Beyonc√© has said that she \\"would record her own version of the exercise routine\\" to show kids how it is done by shooting a new music video featuring a series of fun workouts to accompany the track. On April 26, 2011, Beyonc√© released a video of her own version of the exercise routine. Concerning the campaign, Beyonc√© expressed: > I am excited to be part of this effort that addresses a public health > crisis. First Lady Michelle Obama deserves credit for tackling this issue > directly, and I applaud the NAB Education Foundation for trying to make a > positive difference in the lives of our schoolchildren. =\\"Move Your Body\\"= alt=A woman that wears a white blouse, blue shorts, green socks, and red sneakers is standing.

After Beyonc√©'s entry, all the kids jump to their feet, following along as Beyonc√© leads the group through all kinds of dances. The instructional video was distributed to participating schools across the country on May 3, 2011, during a 'dance-in'. Beyonc√© was at P.S. 161 middle school in Harlem on that particular date. She taught students the moves from her \\"Move Your Body\\" video. Beyonc√© appeared in the gym much to the delight of her young fans, who danced alongside her and took photos. Lauretta Charlton of Black Entertainment Television (BET) gave the video a positive review stating that \\"It's impossible to watch without wanting to, well, move your body.\\" Nicole James of MTV Buzzworthy showed great interest in the video and its message, stating that Beyonc√© gets kids heart pumping, \\"in more ways than one\\". Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club added that \\"if anything can help curb the nation's childhood obesity problem, it is the galvanizing power of Beyonc√© Knowles dancing\\", and further praised how \\"[the] bunch of cute kids [were] doing the Running Man and The Dougie in the cafeteria with Beyonc√©.\\" See also *American Grown: The Story of the White House Kitchen Garden and Gardens Across America *Every Kid in a Park * Songs for a Healthier America (2013) *White House Kitchen Garden References External links *Archived version of the official website *choosemyplate.gov (was mypyramid.gov) *Food and Nutrition Service *Chefs Move to Schools Category:Obesity in the United States Category:American children Category:Obama Administration initiatives Category:Diet food advocates Category:Beyonc√© songs Category:Michelle Obama ","title":"Let's Move!"},{"id":"28199656","text":"ANHAD (Act Now for Harmony and Democracy) is an Indian socio-cultural organization established in March 2003, as a response to 2002 Gujarat riots.

The film opens with a young girl who walks into the house on the day of the massacre and discovers the bloody scene of the crime. Fourteen years later, local girl and student actress Claire Thompson has been seeing her therapist over an experience she had in the house which left her disturbed. He suggests that she revisit the old house, but she has never been able to get past the gate. When horror mogul Walston Rey appears in her advanced acting class, he reveals that he has converted the house into a horror attraction site and that he wants to hire Claire and her classmates to work as hosts to his attraction. Claire sees the opportunity as a chance to enter the house safely surrounded by her peers. In the house, Walston and his staff proudly show off their holographic three-dimensional system which creates lifelike interactive and harmless horror figures, but when Mrs. Darrode's ghost gets into the system, the holograms become real and are activated by fear. They start killing everyone inside as the survivors try to shut down the system and try to escape. Claire finally manages to remember what happened in the house years ago. She was fostered under the care of Mrs. Darrode, who was an abusive religious fanatic. As a child Claire one day led a rebellion among the other kids. They burned their Holy Bibles and rejected Mrs. Darrode's teachings. Mrs. Darrode flew into a psychotic rage and murdered all the children, labeling them sinners and heretics, with the exception of Claire who only managed to escape by hiding in a closet. Then struck by remorse for what she had done, Mrs. Darrode thrust her hands into the kitchen garbage disposal and killed herself. In the present day after remembering, Claire loses her fear and flies at Mrs. Darrode, who disappears. She is discovered by the police, who believe she was responsible for the murders and is committed to a mental asylum.

She and her boyfriend are quickly locked into the house and are killed.

Long. In planning the farm Long turned to Henry F. Hoit of Hoit, Price and Barnes, as he had designed Corinthian Hall and the R.A. Long Building. George Kessler was chosen as the landscape architect. The farm and over 50 other structures were built on 1,780 acres. Construction started in 1913 and completed in 1914 taking just 18 months to complete. The result is what came to be known as The World's Most Beautiful Farm. -Worlds most beautiful farm remembered Construction workers included 50 Belgian craftsmen and 200 Sicilian stonemasons, among 2,000 other workers, to build the Longview Mansion and farm. Employing 175 people, the farm not only consisted of all the amenities to care for the Longs prize horses but also a modern dairy, including prize Jersey cows, that produced enough milk for the farm, community, and charities. Hogs, chickens, farm land for the food, as well as green houses and a manicured main yard of 225 acres, were all part of the expansive farm. Scenic and self-sufficient, the farm and dairy even included underground electricity and a 100,000 gallon water tower. -Longview Farm History Robert Long made the decision to build the farm and the grandness shows no expense was spared. A place in the country was needed for his animals as the house in town (Corinthian Hall) was too small. By 1912 a place was selected and the planning began. In 1914 a small \\"town\\" had been created. =The farm= The farm had a list of modern marvels including experimental innovations. In the mansion Long did not want to use antique furniture because it was used. Long had new antique style replica furniture shipped from New York. The farm had a telephone system, complete plumbing, of white wooden fence that was built without nails or bolts, and over seven miles (11 km) of macadamized roads. The roads were not innovative because in the 1820s John Loudon McAdam, a Scottish engineer, pioneered the state-of-the-art Macadam road. Aside from the natural grass fields there were many acres of hay fields and feed still had to be brought in to feed all the livestock. =Buildings= There were over 50 buildings at Longview and, with the exception of the log grandstand and clubhouse, all were built of stucco with red tile roofs. 2000 Italian workers lived in tents while building the foundations and sewer system. The farm included an office, a chapel and school room. Several horse barns including, a draft horse barn, saddle horse barn, two broodmare horse barns, a hospital barn, a calf and shelter barn, a large show horse barn and arena, and a hog barn. There was a power house/garage, a milk house that included a bottling room, an ice plant, a blacksmith shop, post office, firehouse, and general store. There was a Hotel/Boarding House, equipped with a tennis court, where guests as well as unmarried workers could stay. Other buildings included houses for the General manager, C. J. Tucker, Assistant general manager, H. C. Spencer, as well as residence for J. T. Hook the manager of the saddle horse department. Married workers were provided a house for their families and the entire compound included underground wiring, water supplied by a six-inch water main, and a sewage system. =The mansion= No expense was spared on the structure with 48 rooms, 6 fireplaces, 14 bedrooms and 10 baths. It also claimed the first central vacuum system west of the Mississippi as well as steam heating. -Longville farm mansion =The church= The church at the farm was opened in 1915 as the Longview Chapel Christian Church and is still active today. -Longview Chapel Christian Church The Long family Long was very successful in the lumber business with the Long-Bell Lumber Company and other enterprises. His lumber empire spanned several states and up to 110 lumber yards as well as over 250,000 acres of timber land by the 1900s. Already owning the Corinthian Hall mansion in Kansas City he decided to build the country estate and purchased the land in Lee's Summit. He and his wife Ella had a son that died shortly after birth and two girls, Sally America and Loula. =Sally America Long Ellis= Shortly after graduating from Mt. Vernon Finishing School in Washington, D.C. in 1903, Sally went on a world tour where she met her future husband. Hayne Ellis was a naval officer that had graduated from Annapolis in 1900. Nine days after meeting Sally he proposed and she accepted. They were married December 17, 1904. Sally traveled with her husband as a military wife while her sister took care of the horses at the farm. After Hayne died in 1961 Sally moved back to the farm to live with her sister. She died in 1970 at 91 years old. -Link; Sally America Long =Loula Long Combs= The undisputed head over the horses was Loula Long. She shared a love for horses with her father. She married Pryor Combs and it is said that she would agree to marry him only if he agreed to live at Longview Farm. They were married and he lived there until his death. The fact that Loula loved the farm is reflected in the fact that she lived there from the time the farm was opened until her death. After 65 years of showing horses and winning blue ribbons Loula died in 1971, shortly after her sister. Animals By 1916 the farm had over 500 head of Jersey cattle, 232 being milked daily in two dairy barns, 16 Percheron draft horses, 61 saddle horses, 44 harness horses, 29 colts, 29 mules and 375 Duroc Jersey hogs. By 1941 there was over 800 cows and dairy barn #2 and #3 were added to accommodate the 500 cows being milked. =Horses= Loula chose the names for horses bought or born on the farm and there were many famous horses. She began to use -ion as the ending of many of the horses names. These included what she termed \\"the park four\\"; *Revelation *Realization *Hesitation *Consternation *The Dude, bought by Long in 1905 was Loula's first horse. *Shoo Shoo and Hoo Hoo, bought in 1906, were hackney horses. *The King, bought in 1908 was one of the best road horses of the time. *Sensation was bought in 1908 and was the first horse of many with -ion at the end of the name. *Beau Brummel, bought in 1909, a bay trotting stallion that cost $4500. * Beaucaire, also bought in 1909 for $4500. *In 1909 Loula bought Revelation for $1500. This was her prize horse and was buried in front of the arena with a memorial. *Adoration, Importation, and Ovation were bought and imported between 1909 and 1910. *Speculation was bought in 1912 and was a cow pony. *Ladylike was Roberts horse *Aspiration, a black mare, gave Loula the distinction of being the first woman to drive a winner in the Sporting Novice Roadster Class, at her first show at Madison Square Garden in 1913. *Aviation and Affection (a chestnut gelding) allowed Loula to break the world's record for the heavy harness half-mile race for tandems at the Springfield, Ohio show in 1914. *Easter Cloud won the first $10,000 stake at the Kentucky State Fair in 1917 *Chief of Longview, \\"The Great Parader\\", was born, raised, and trained at Longview Farm. Bought by Lurline Matson Roth, Chief was the World Champion stallion four times. He was the only horse to win the $10,000 stake at the Kentucky State Fair two successive years ‚Äì 1928 and 1929. His fame as a model five-gaited horse was so wide that he became Ralston Purina's advertisement for their new horse feed. The Longs sold four brothers and sisters of the chief and received over $45,000. *Independence Chief was the sire to Chief of Longview and was bought for $250. *My Major Dare, was first American Saddle Horse to sell for $10,000. In 1921 he was valued at $25,000 with thirty-two first place ribbons in thirty-six times shown. *Reputation, won a Championship as a pair with revelation. *Fascination (Buck) *Baby List *Captivation (Cappy) was outstanding as a heavy harness horse. *Invasion *Animation Other Saddle Horse Champions * Kentucky's Best, * Maurine Fisher *La France In 1920 Loula won thirty-one Championships and three Reserves in sixteen shows. -Horses of Longview Farm Charities Loula held benefit horse shows at the farm to raise money for the Boy Scouts, Animal Rescue League, Animal Protective Association, Children's Mercy Hospital, Red Cross and many others. NRHP Longview Farm was listed on the National Register of Historic Places October 24, 1985. The listing includes the main residence, three staff residences, several farm outbuildings, ornamental monuments, and a chapel. The property is significant as an example of the era when a large estates were built by barons of industry. The farm was built as part of a large interrelated collection of buildings that included the farm, show horse faculties including racetrack and grandstand, a chapel/school house, living quarters for the large staff that at one time exceeded 200 workers, and a power house. Longview was intended to be a self-sustaining community and operated as such for many years. Includes 29 photos Current =Longview Farm Elementary school= The Longview Farm Elementary school became a realization in 2005 with a partnership involving the Lee's Summit R-7 School District, the City of Lee's Summit and Gale Communities. Gale community bought the remaining land of Longview Farm to establish a 260-acre project community, called New Longview, with historical preservation in mind. The founder, David Gale, approached Dr. Tony Stansberry, Lee's Summit School District superintendent, and the R-7 Board of Education, with the idea of converting the show horse arena into an elementary school. Sunday, Oct. 9th, 2005 the school celebrated a dedication ceremony -School partnership =New Longview= The community of New Longview includes many historically restored buildings with a residential as well as a commercial district. Residential district Along with the 225 acre residential area there is a 50-acre park, the 146 acre Longview Community College campus, and the community borders the 4,800-acre Longview Park as well as the 900 acre Longview Lake. Commercial district The commercial district has of retail stores and of office space, including restaurants, a grocery store, a drug store, home furnishing stores, a bookstore, hair care salon and medical and business services.

Originally released as two 7-inch records in October 1987, it served as a benefit to raise money for the Berkeley, California DIY punk scene (known as the Gilman Street Project). The compilation featured the first appearances of many bands who would later become well known outside of the scene, including Operation Ivy, Crimpshrine and Isocracy. Due to the poor sound quality of the original 7-inch version, Turn It Around! was reissued by Very Small Records in September 1991 as one LP. However, the compilation is currently out of print and has never seen a CD release. In retrospect, it has been cited as an important compilation album and served as an introduction to a number of the bands, most of which would go on to release albums on the then-newly formed Lookout Records. Many musicians from the later Gilman Street scene have cited Turn It Around! as an influence.10 Questions for Billie Joe. Time Magazine. Retrieved 2015-10-25 Background and production In the summer of 1987, Maximumrocknroll asked one of its writers, David Hayes, to put together a compilation album to raise money for the Gilman Street Project, the first wave of bands from the local Berkeley, California DIY punk scene centered on the 924 Gilman Street venue. Hayes agreed to do it, seeing this as an opportunity to document the bands from the scene, as almost all of them had no recordings available at that point.Turn It Around! liner notes. Retrieved 2015-10-25 In preparation, Hayes set up a \\"Battle of the Bands\\" concert at 924 Gilman Street on June 14, 1987 featuring bands such as Corrupted Morals, Crimpshrine, Operation Ivy, Isocracy and Soup (the latter of which would not end up on Turn It Around!), with the idea being that the two best songs by each band would be released on the compilation. In August, after everything was chosen, most of the bands set out to record their songs with Kevin Army in one day at Dangerous Rhythm Studio in Oakland, California. Recorded on a small budget, Hayes shepherded the bands in and out of the studio \\"like an assembly line,\\" as Operation Ivy guitarist Lint would later describe it, with bassist Matt McCall adding \\"you'd see the other band coming out while you were going in.\\" Corrupted Morals, however recorded its track at Art of Ears Studio in San Francisco with Andy Ernst, while Nasal Sex went to Creative Sound in San Jose with Dick Dias and \\"Yeast Power\\" by the Yeastie Girlz was recorded on the soundboard at 924 Gilman Street with engineer Radley Hirsch. After the recordings were done, George Horn mastered the album at Fantasy Studios in Berkeley. Packaging The title, Turn It Around!, was chosen by Maximumrocknroll founder Tim Yohannon in reference to the members of the Gilman Street Project trying to \\"reestablish a sense of community\\" within the underground punk scene. \\"At a time when the scene is plagued by mindless violence, intimidation, vandalism and general stupidity\\" Yohannon said, \\"when it's all becoming more like the mainstream than an alternative, there are groups of dedicated people who are determined to fight back and revitalize things.\\" The front cover was taken by Cammie Toloui of the Yeastie Girlz and, although the man on the front is unknown, he is referred to as \\"Walter\\" on the back cover. Hayes handled the layout and packaging, and put together an extensive booklet of the bands' pictures and lyrics to all of the songs and sent the artwork to Positive Press in Oakland to be printed. It was later decided before release that the compilation would be on two 7-inch records, which Hayes said was a \\"statement, maybe we're trying to set an example to get people off of their asses and create something.\\" He further stated that \\"Most distributors won't even take 7-inches to begin with, so we're obviously not in it for the money.\\" The album was pressed at a pressing plant called Alberti in Monterey Park, California, which would later press vinyl for Lookout Records. Release and influence Turn It Around! was released in early October 1987 with an original pressing of 2,000 copies that here numbered. The album was a success within the punk scene and it served as an introduction to the scene for many fans. Its initial pressing sold out by 1989 and was out of print for the next two years. In September 1991, Hayes reissued Turn It Around! on his own label Very Small Records. This version did not come with the booklet and did not have the original cover intact, instead cutting up images from the booklet and pasting them together to make the artwork. It was also released as one LP rather than the original double 7-inch. This was because of the length of the album, as each original 7-inch was about 15 minutes, resulting in its poor sound quality.History of East Bay Punk: The David Hayes Story. Retrieved 2015-10-25 In recent years, Turn It Around! has been regarded as a classic punk compilation album and proved to be influential to many later Gilman Street bands. Many people of the scene have given it praise as well, including Larry Livermore and Chris Applegren of Lookout Records, who both called the compilation \\"legendary\\" on their blogs.

The inscription is written in the Pallava alphabet. The inscription documents an edict of Sanjaya, in which he declared himself the universal ruler of Medang.  Content  The inscription describes the erection of a lingam (the symbol of Shiva) on the country of Kunjarakunja, by Sanjaya's order. The lingam is sited on the noble island of Yava (Java), which the inscription describes as \\"rich in grain and gold mines\\". Yawadwipa (\\"Java island\\"), the inscription says, had long been under the rule of the wise and virtuous king Sanna, but fell after his death into disunity. Amid a period of confusion Sanjaya, son of Sannaha (the sister of Sanna) ascended to the throne. Sanjaya mastered holy scriptures, martial arts, and displayed military prowess. After the conquest of neighboring areas his reign was peaceful and prosperous. The inscription makes reference to Kunjarakunja-desa, perhaps meaning \\"the hermitage land of Kunjara\\", which has been identified as the hermitage of Rishi Agastya, a Hindu Maharishi revered in Southern India. The Ramayana contains a reference to a visit to Agastya hermitage on Kunjara by Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana. The name Sanjaya, Sanna and Sannaha curiously was also mentioned in Carita Parahyangan, a book from later period composed around 16th century which suggested refer to same historical person.

Charles Brenner (18 November 1913, in Boston ‚Äì 19 May 2008) was an American psychoanalyst who served as President of the New York Psychoanalytic Society, and is perhaps best known for his contributions to drive theory, the structure of the mind, and conflict theory. He was for half a century an exemplary figure for psychoanalysis in America, being termed by Janet Malcolm ‚Äúthe intransigent purist of American psychoanalysis‚Äù.Janet Malcolm, Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession (London 1988) p. 4. Early contributions Brenner first made his name as the author of the Elementary Textbook of Psychoanalysis, which Eric Berne paired with Freud's Outline of Psychoanalysis as the best guide to the subject.Eric Berne, A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis (Middlesex 1976) p. 297. In it he stressed for example how, unlike 'conscience', the superego functions mainly or entirely unconsciously.H. Mindess/A. Berger, Laughter and Liberation (2010) p. 5. He went on to co-author, with Jacob Arlow, Psychoanalytic Concepts and the Structural Theory, which, initially controversial, would become a standard advanced text.Janet Malcolm, Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession (London 1988) p. 4. Brenner himself conceded that probably ‚Äúmy most significant influence was as author of An Elementary Textbook‚Äù.Quoted in Arnold M. Cooper, Contemporary Psychoanalysis in America (2006) p. 2. Technique While Brenner favored a cool, aseptic analytic technique, and opposed the idea that the transference could be separated off from the so-called working alliance,Malcolm, Impossible pp. and 45. he also challenged the mechanical use of the analysis of defences without consideration of the instinctual impulses involved.S. Akhtar, Comprehensive Dictionary of Psychoanalysis (2009) p. 69. Brenner pointed out that just as ‚Äúit is presumptuous to act the analyst, unbidden, in a social or family situation. It is a technical lapse to be other than an analyst in one's relations with an analytic patient‚Äù.Quoted in Malcolm, Impossible p. 45-47. His technique epitomised what Malcolm called ‚Äútaking respect for individual experience and generosity of spirit toward human frailty very far indeed'‚Äù.Malcolm, Impossible p. 47. Late revisions Brenner has been notable for his readiness to challenge psychoanalytic dogmas,Cooper, Contemporary p. 2. \\\\- something perhaps most apparent with his late revision of Freud's structural theory, culminating in his article \\"Conflict, Compromise Formation, and Structural Theory\\"(2002) which he himself considered ‚Äúthe most useful and valuable contribution I have been able to make to the field of psychoanalysis‚Äù.Quoted in Cooper, Contemporary p. 3. His late development of conflict theory went back to Freud's early concept of 'compromise formation', as well as drawing on Arlow's idea of 'fantasy function' in a mixture of conservatism and innovation.Arnold Rothstein, Making Freud More Freudian (London 2010) p. ix-x. Arguably the result was to produce the leading analytic theory for 21stC American psychoanalytic training.Mats Winther, \\"Critique of Conflict Theory (2007)\\". Criticism Brenner has been criticised for a tendency to follow his own theoretical furrow, rather than engage with other points of view.

They built a house in this location around 1836. The current Gothic Revival frame farmhouse replaced the original log house in 1844. The farm was about eight miles south of Independence along the Santa Fe Trail and became a popular stop for travelers. Archibald died in 1849 and his son Elihu Coffee Rice became the owner.

Bannu District makes up a part of the topographic region known as the Bannu basin, which sits adjacent to the hills of Afghanistan and Waziristan to the west and the Indus River floodplain on the east. The site of Sheri Khan Tarakai was discovered in 1985 by members of the Bannu Archaeological Project,The Bannu Archaeological Project , and it is the oldest known village settlement in the Bannu region. Archaeological excavations were carried out at the site for five seasons between 1986 and 1990. These excavations have shown that the settlement at Sheri Khan Tarakai was a small village, populated at any one time by perhaps a few hundred people who lived in mud-walled houses, some of which had stone foundations and flat roofs made of wattle and daub.Khan, F., Knox, J.R., Thomas, K.D., Petrie, C.A. & Morris, J.C. 2010.

Sheri Khan Tarakai and early village life in the borderlands of north-west Pakistan, Bannu Archaeological Project Monographs - Volume 1, Oxbow Books, Oxford: 211-303. The range of finished pottery vessels, lithic tools and small finds, and the associated production debris that was discovered, indicate the range of craft activities being carried out on-site, including pottery firing, bone working, lithic flaking, stone grinding and bead drilling. The diverse range of terracotta figurines and the motifs depicted on many of the ceramic vessels suggest that the lives of the inhabitants were enlivened by a rich iconographic tradition. The inhabitants of Sheri Khan Tarakai deployed a range of subsistence strategies, including the cultivation of barley and wheat, the management of domestic sheep, goat and cattle, the collection of a range of wild plant and wood species, and the hunting of a wide variety of wild animals.Thomas, K.D. and Cartwright, C. 2010. The biological remains from Sheri Khan Tarakai, In Petrie, C.A. (Ed.). Sheri Khan Tarakai and early village life in the borderlands of north-west Pakistan, Pakistan, Bannu Archaeological Project Monographs - Volume 1, Oxford, Oxbow Books: 305-342 The abundance of grinding artefacts at the site and the presence of rachis internodes and chaff in some deposits suggests that several phases of grain processing were probably taking place on-site. Few young domestic animals appear to have been slaughtered at the site, and the fact that most lived on into adulthood suggests that they were primarily used as a source of meat, but possibly also to provide secondary products such as wool and milk, as well as work and dung. The location of the settlement would have allowed use of the run-off from the ephemeral torrents that flowed from the hills of Waziristan to the west of the site, and the inhabitants are likely to have engaged in some type of flood- water farming. Storage structures imply that people might have lived at the site throughout the year, but there is also evidence that either a proportion of the population, or other people that they were interacting with, were engaging in some form of transhumant pastoralism. Sheri Khan Tarakai in context Sheri Khan Tarakai and several other contemporaneous sites in the Bannu basin and the Gomal plain present a relatively conservative cultural assemblage that shows limited technological change throughout much of the fourth millennium BC. The available dating evidence indicates that Sheri Khan Tarakai was occupied from the late fifth until the early third millennium BC.Petrie, C.A., Thomas, K.D. & Morris, J.C. 2010. Chronology of Sheri Khan Tarakai, in Petrie, C.A. (ed.). Sheri Khan Tarakai and early village life in the borderlands of north-west Pakistan, Bannu Archaeological Project Monographs - Volume 1, Oxbow Books, Oxford: 343-352. This date range indicates that the occupation at Sheri Khan Tarakai was also contemporaneous with several other important early village sites in the borderlands at the northwestern edge of South Asia, including Mehrgarh (Periods III-V), Kili Gul Mohammad (Periods III-IV), and Rana Ghundai (Periods I-II). The earliest occupation at Sheri Khan Tarakai appears to slightly predate the earliest occupation at major sites on the plains of the Punjab, such as Harappa (Period Ia - Ravi phase).

The Savoy Grill is the oldest restaurant in Kansas City, Missouri. In the early 1900s, the Savoy was a luxury destination for travelers arriving by train in Kansas City. It was the first hotel seen by travelers as they entered the city from the old Union Depot. With the depression of the 1930s and the later shift toward suburban living, the hotel began to fall into disrepair, although the restaurant remained active. The Savoy was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 30, 1974., and renovation of the hotel into a bed and breakfast began in 1985. The renovation project was undertaken by owner Don Lee. Lee had purchased the Savoy Grill in 1960 and the entire Savoy Hotel in 1965. During the renovation, care was taken to preserve original pieces of the hotel that were still in usable condition, including the original reception desk and stained glass artwork. The Savoy Grill also still includes the original carved oak bar, high beamed ceilings, murals painted in 1903 by Edward Holslag, and the famous Booth No. 4, which was frequented by Harry and Bess Truman.\\"Owner tries to build on success of restaurant to refurbish hotel.\\" The Southeast Missourian. June 7, 1998. 7C. Savoy Grill The Savoy Grill, located at 9th and Central, is a longstanding Kansas City, Missouri fine dining establishment that was founded in 1903 and gained historic landmark with the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.About Us Many notable figures have visited the restaurant including Harry S. Truman who made frequent visits over his lunch hour when he was the owner/operator of a downtown haberdashery. Booth No. 4, known as the presidents' booth, has been host to Warren Harding, Harry S. Truman, Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan. During prohibition, rather than remove the bar, drapes were hung up to conceal its presence. The Grill is most famous for its seafood and steaks. Murals \\"The original Grill Room is surrounded by The Savoy Murals, painted by Edward Holslag in 1903 when he was in his early thirties. Those murals depict the pioneers' departure from Westport Landing and their journey along the Santa Fe Trail. Holslag, who was a pupil of The National Academy of Design and John LaFarge, is represented at the Congressional Library in Washington, D.C. The Savoy Grill Murals have been included in the Smithsonian Institution's \\"Bicentennial Inventory of American Paintings.\\" \\" Hauntings Staff members and hotel guests have reported hauntings at the Savoy Hotel. In the late 1800s, Betsy Ward lived and died in room 505 of the hotel. One story claims that she committed suicide in the bathtub. Another story claims that someone else was involved with her death. A turn-of-century 32 caliber pistol was supposedly found sealed in the wall when the apartment was renovated. Hotel guests and staff have heard strange voices, seen shadows, and heard doors open and close on their own in and around room 505. Stories also claim that the spirit of Fred Lightner still haunts his apartment at the Savoy. Other hauntings include a feeling of being followed on the second floor, where a restaurant manager was stabbed to death by the dishwashers in 1990. Other phenomena include very clear EVPs and pictures with orbs and apparitions. Many have reported the sighting of a small girl in Victorian dress on the fourth floor, and the elevator repeatedly gets stuck on the fourth floor or will send passengers to the sixth when they push the fourth floor button. Fire On October 23rd, 2014 a major fire destroyed the kitchen of the Savoy Grill. The historic restaurant area was not destroyed but sustained significant smoke damage. The fire was caused by a cook who was not paying attention. The restaurant was closed down and the hotel was evacuated.

It provided expertise and knowledge to digital research projects in the arts and humanities in Ireland. Through activities such as a DHO Summer School, practice-based workshops, seminars, symposia and consultations the DHO helped researchers in Ireland be aware of and stay current with developments in the creation, use, and preservation of digital resources. The DHO developed DRAPIer, a database of digital research projects in Ireland and DHO:Discovery, a portal to collections of Irish cultural artefacts. Description The DHO operated summer and spring schools, and week-long workshops for scholars undertaking digital projects. It operated from 2008 through August 30, 2013. The Royal Irish Academy was awarded a three-year grant of about ‚Ç¨3.5 million in late 2007 for Humanities Serving Irish Society. The first DHO first director was Susan Schreibman from the University of Maryland. In 2011 Schreibman joined the faculty of Trinity College Dublin. Digital Humanities Observatory =DRAPIer= DRAPIer (backronym to Digital Research and Projects in Ireland) was an interactive database of digital humanities projects created by third level institutions on the island of Ireland. DRAPIer was named after Drapier's Letters - a series of seven pamphlets written between 1724 and 1725 by Dean Jonathan Swift of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin. The text used in creating the logo was taken from Drapier's Letters. The visualisation was created using a simple text analysis routine written within Processing, an open source programming environment. Each purple circle represents one unique word within the text. The circle's radius is directly proportional to the number of occurrences of the word within the text. Each circle has the same base colour but it is semi-transparent, so that when one is plotted on top of another it appears to be darker, representing overlapping networks from human to digital. =DHO:Discovery= In 2011 the DHO opened a Web site called DHO:Discovery, a gateway to Irish digital collections and resources, information and knowledge. It aimed to increase the visibility of resources at HSIS partner institutions and national cultural bodies, allowing users to easily browse and create connections between a variety of digital collections. Using display tools such as Exhibit and Google Charts, statistical data and visualisations not present on the collections' own sites are made available to the academic community.

OSI was intended to be an independent design branch of Ghia's, focussing on niche efforts. The short lived company made some custom built cars based on Alfa Romeo, Fiat and Ford models. One of their first contracts was to build the bodyshells of the 1960 Innocenti 950 Spider, designed by a young Tom Tjaarda at Ghia's behest.Heseltine, p. 98 Probably its best known model outside Italy was the Ford 20M TS Coup√© based on the German Ford Taunus 20M. The car was designed by Sergio Sartorelli, better known as the designer of the Type 3 based Volkswagen Karmann Ghia Type 34. Approximately 2,200 of the Ford 20M based coup√©s were produced, of which approximately 200 were thought to have survived through till 2010. The company also built the Ford Anglia Torino designed by Giovanni Michelotti: 10,007 examples of this model were sold in Italy. Segre died after complications following appendicitis (variously reported as an infection during convelence after successful removal of kidney stones) in 1963, leaving the rising company without its personal link to Ghia and Ford. He was replaced by Giacomo Bianco of Fergat, but Bianco was unable to keep the company afloat as contracts began to dry up. In 1966 2,000 employees had to be laid off, and OSI car production ended in December 1967. Bianco was fired and Sartorelli was charged with winding down operations, incorporating the OSI design office with that of Fiat's in May 1968. The company remained active as a producer of steel pressings and industrial equipment.

This is primarily caused by the Kashmir conflict. According to the Software Freedom Law Center, the internet in Kashmir was blocked at least 31 times from 2012 to 2016.  2010 protest censorship  A protest reportedly took place in the Indian Administered Kashmir against the summer of 2010, when 15 people were allegedly killed in three weeks by the Indian Armed Forces. Army's help was sought to restore law and order after protests by people as Government virtually banned the media in the Valley by imposing severe restrictions on journalists. The revolution was allegedly carried out by youth who disseminated information to the outer world in view of the gagging of media, newspapers and SMS services.  July 2016 media outlet ban  The ban of media in 2016 in Kashmir began 10 days after the killing of Burhan Wani, a popular rebel group leader in Kashmir. Protests against the killing of Wani broke out in the streets as young Kashmiris attacked the police. Wani was a social-media-savvy insurgent who affected the lives of the majority of Kashmiris, requesting them to follow his path through social media and newspaper posts. These protests led to more than 33 deaths and hundreds being severely injured. The riots and protests got so unruly that the government decided to impose serious actions on the media while they struggled to bring the situation under control. The government decided to shut down cable TV operators and private cellphone services, as well as banning daily newspapers. The government called this an ‚Äòinformation blockade‚Äô as they believed that young and emotion lot of people out on the streets that are surcharged by certain media publications. The newspapers refrain from publishing content deemed inappropriate by the government but this was the first time there was a ban imposed on the newspapers. Police officials and security forces raided printing presses and seized copies of newspapers. The ban lasted for over a week in the state of Jammu and Kashmir.  April 2017 social media ban  In April 2017, the authorities in Indian-administered Kashmir (IAK) banned several social media sites after they believed that they were being used as a tool to indulge violence and terrorism amongst the youths by anti-national elements. The government of IAK regularly blocked internet connections but this was the first time such a step was taken on social media. Over the past five years, the government blocked internet signals over 28 times and in 2016, the internet connection was blocked for about five months. The social media sites and apps blocked included WhatsApp, Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter, WeChat, Skype, Pinterest, and Vine. The government described this ban as an action to control the political space in IAK. Due to this ban, riots broke down in certain IAK regions. The protests started in the southern district of Pulwama by certain ringleaders. Hundreds of students have taken it to the streets, some chanting antinational slogans while others attacking the police using rocks.  Censorship on Facebook  Several newspapers and magazines, such as Free Press Kashmir, Wande Magazine, and Lost Kashmir History, have been censored on Facebook.  2019-20 Jammu and Kashmir lockdown  On August 5, 2019, a security lockdown and communications blackout was imposed to prevent protests during which thousands of people, mostly young men, have been detained in Jammu and Kashmir. The lockdown started on 5 August 2019 following Revocation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir via scrapping of the Article 370 of the Constitution of India, Article 35A of the Constitution of India and the introduction of Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019. Since 5 August, no foreign journalists have been granted permission from the Indian government to report in Kashmir. According to a September 6 report of the Indian government, nearly 4,000 people have been arrested in the disputed region. Among those arrested were more than 200 politicians, including two former chief ministers of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K;), along with more than 100 leaders and activists from All Parties Hurriyat Conference. Censorship on internet Censorship on internet refers to the restrictions on telecommunication such as broadband as well as mobile internet imposed by the government of India or state administration. In August 2019, the Government of India barred all broadband as well as mobile internet services in the region to prevent the deliberately fabricated falsehood on social media. In January 2020, 2G internet was resumed with no access to social media. Although some cases of COVID-19 infection have been confirmed in the region, authorities continue to curb the 4G internet ban, preventing people from getting important information about the COVID-19 pandemic and its safety tips. Medical institutions has described 4G ban a risk factor for COVID-19 deaths in J&K;, as the information about WHO's guideline on testing and its countermeasures remained inaccessible in the region. Amnesty International also urged government to restore 4G internet in critical situation of pandemic disease. Jammu and Kashmir doctors stated that \\"We'll die like cattle\\". Doctors, according to news media, are not able to deal the coronavirus due to non- availability of 4G internet and lack of significant information available online. In April - May 2020, Supreme Court of India heard a batch of writ petitions challenging the ban on 4G internet services. J&K; administration opposed the plea stating that \\"the right to access the internet is not a fundamental right\\". On 11 May 2020, Supreme Court disposed of these petitions refusing the request for restoration of 4G internet services. Court, however, constituted a special committee composed of senior bureaucrats to look into the issue.

History Before the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors, Putaendo was a very old town of hunters and gatherers. The Spanish were attracted to gold mines discovered in the outskirts of town in the mid 18th century. Little by little, they formed a population center and constructed the Church of San Antonio. On 20 March 1831, the Assembly of Aconcagua granted the town a title. San Antonio de la Uni√≥n de Putaendo was the first town to become a patriotic force in 1817. In 1485, during the conquest of the Inca T√∫pac Yupanqui, his son Huayna C√°pac crossed the Andean mountains and descended through this valley, camping in Putaendo and incorporating the Aconcagua valley into the Incan civilization. The advancing expedition of Diego de Almagro was stopped here in 1536. The Inca road system (Camino del inca) passed through this valley. This was the fastest route between the tribes of the valleys of La Ligua, Aconcagua and Mapocho. The outline of the city extends longitudinally from north to south, and its historic center has been called \\"Typical Zone\\" (Zona T√≠pica). Toward the south, there is a commercial area, structured in the form of Calle Larga, with adobe facades from the 18th and 19th centuries. In the extreme north, there is a plaza with large trees, and on either side of town, public buildings can be found. Geography The Putaendo river valley is located in the northern Zona Central and is a part of the Aconcagua river watershed located in the transitional zone, with respect to geomorphology (transitioning from the Norte Chico to the longitudinal Chilean Central Valley) and climatology (from semiarid to a temperate Mediterranean). Putaendo spans an area of . Demographics According to the 2002 census of the National Statistics Institute, Putaendo spans an area of and has 14,649 inhabitants (7,344 men and 7,305 women). Of these, 7,214 (49.2%) lived in urban areas and 7,435 (50.8%) in rural areas. The population grew by 14.4% (1,843 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses. Administration As a commune, Putaendo is a third-level administrative division of Chile, administered by a municipal council, which is headed by a directly elected alcalde. The current alcalde is Guillermo Reyes. The council has the following members: * Silvia Arancibia Abarca * Laya Nara Negrete * Julio Aravena * Enzo Gazzolo * Manuel Olivares Leiva * Sergio Zamora Within the electoral divisions of Chile, Putaendo is represented in the Chamber of Deputies by Mr. Marco Antonio N√∫√±ez (PDC) and Mr. Gaspar Rivas (RN) as part of the 11th electoral district, (together with Los Andes, San Esteban, Calle Larga, Rinconada, San Felipe, Santa Mar√≠a, Panquehue, Llaillay and Catemu).

History of the Forest The Marutswa Forest Boardwalk is built on an old logging area harvested in the late 19th century and is named after a local Zulu man called ‚ÄòMahustjwa‚Äô who harvested Sneezewood trees which he sold and were used to build railway sleepers. The lower walk of the contour trail is part of the old logging route which was used by oxen and mules to drag timber for sale in Durban and Pietermaritzburg. Objective The Marutswa Forest Trail & Boardwalk, located close to the country village of Bulwer on the R617, is a joint initiative between the SappiWWF TreeRoutes Partnership, the Bulwer Biosphere group, the BirdLife South Africa, the Southern KZN Birding Route and local conservation groups. They have incorporated the site into the route. The project has so far provided three full-time jobs for local community members as custodians of the project, as well as a welcome platform for local crafters to sell their original and unusual handicrafts from. The Forest The site comprises a network of arterial trails leading into the indigenous forest, where there are a number of lookout jetties boardwalk sections, picnic sites, decks and view points, allowing visitors to view the various layers of the forest, including the canopy. Animals Attracted to the pristine forest habitat bushbuck and reedbuck are frequent visitors to the forest, as are a herd of bush pig that freely forage. Rock dassies have been seen and the call of the tree dassie has also been heard in the forest. Very recently mongooses were also seen around the forest boardwalk. Natal dwarf chameleons and several species of butterfly such as the emperor swallowtail can also be found. Marutswa Forest has been described by some of the South Africa‚Äôs top birding tour operators as one of the most active cloud forests in KwaZulu-Natal. The forest is home to a vast number of rare and interesting birds. Cape parrots, sadly endangered and dwindling in numbers in South Africa are attracted by the seeds, and the nesting potential of the plentiful yellow wood trees and are often found in flocks of up to 100 birds in the forest. Specials to look out for are Cape parrot, orange ground-thrush, African crowned eagle, bush blackcap, white-starred robin, buff-spotted flufftail, Narina trogon, grey cuckooshrike, yellow-throated woodland warbler, crowned and southern ground hornbill. Plants Within the forest there are a number of very large and old yellowwoods of about the same age and size, surviving simultaneously because they were too small to harvest for logging during the late 19th century. On the upper contour of the walk old vines are present. Other species of trees include cabbage trees, white ironwood (Vepris lanceolata), knobthorn (Senegalia nigrescens), black stinkwood, sneezewood, lemonwood, wild currant, wild quince and tree fuchsia (Halleria lucida). The forest hosts a rich selection of wild plants and grasses including; a large variety of ferns, wild lilies including the spectacular paintbrush lily (Scadoxus puniceus , ground and tree orchids, wild dagga and wild iris. Nursery and craft and coffee shop The forest has an indigenous nursery selling plants and tree saplings. The Marustwa craft shop sells ites made by crafters from the surrounding communities, including baskets, pots, wire, and woven gifts as well as jewelry and carvings.

Early life and education Amos was born in 1791 in India, where his father, James Amos, a Russian merchant, of Devonshire Square, London, who had travelled there, had married Cornelia Bont√©, daughter of a Swiss general officer in the Dutch service. The family was Scottish, and took its name in the time of the Covenanters. Andrew Amos was educated at Eton and at Trinity College, Cambridge, of which he became a fellow, after graduating as fifth wrangler in 1813.. Legal career Amos was called to the bar by the Middle Temple and joined the Midland circuit, where he soon acquired a reputation for rare legal learning, and his personal character secured him a large arbitration practice. On 1 August 1826, he married Margaret, daughter of the Rev. William Lax, Lowndean Professor of Astronomy at the University of Cambridge. Within the next eight years Amos became auditor of Trinity College, Cambridge; recorder of Oxford, Nottingham, and Banbury; fellow of the new University of London; and criminal law commissioner. The first criminal law commission on which Amos sat consisted of Mr. (afterward Professor) Thomas Starkie, Mr. Henry Bellenden Ker, Mr. (afterward Mr. Justice) William Wightman, Mr. John Austin, and himself. The commission was renewed at intervals between 1834 and 1843, Amos being always a member of it. Seven reports were issued, the seventh report, of 1843, containing a complete criminal code, systematically arranged into chapters, sections, and articles. The historical and constitutional aspects of the subject received minute attention at every point, and the perplexed topic of criminal punishments was considered in all its relations. Amos's correspondence with the Chief Justice of Australia in reference to the penal transportation system partially appears in the report, and he was consulted by the Chief Justice as to the extension of trial by jury under the peculiar circumstances of the settlement. Thomas Hosmer Shepherd. Amos was the first professor of English law at London University upon its establishment in 1826. The institution is now called University College London and is part of the University of London. On the foundation of London University (now called University College London), Amos was first professor of English law, with Austin, professor of jurisprudence, as his colleague. Between 1829 and 1837 Amos's lectures attained great celebrity. It was the first time that lectures on law at convenient hours had been made accessible to both barristers and solicitors, and Amos's class sometimes included as many as 150 students. Amos encouraged his classes by propounding subjects for essays, by free and informal conversation, by repeated examinations, and by giving prizes for special studies, as, for instance, for the study of Edward Coke's writings. He repeatedly received testimonials from his pupils, and his bust was presented to University College. In 1837 Amos was appointed \\"fourth member\\" of the council of the Governor-General of India, in succession to Lord Macaulay, and for the next five years he took an active part in rendering the code sketched out by his predecessor practically workable. He also took a part as a member of the \\"law commission\\" in drafting the report on slavery in India which resulted in the adoption of measures for its gradual extinction. The commissioners were unanimous on the leading recommendation that \\"it would be more beneficial for the slaves themselves, as well as a wiser and safer course, to direct immediate attention to the removal of the abuses of slavery than to recommend its sudden and abrupt abolition\\". Amos, with two commissioners, differed from the remaining two as to the remedies to be proposed. The majority inclined to leave untouched the lawful status of slavery, and with it the lawful power of the master to punish and restrain. They thought this power necessary as a check to the propensity to idleness which the situation of the slave naturally produces. At the close of Amos's term in India, he was forced into an official controversy with Lord Ellenborough, the Governor-General, as to the right of the \\"fourth member\\" to sit at all meetings of the council in a political as well as a legislative capacity. When Lord Ellenborough's general official conduct was brought under the notice of the House of Commons, his alleged discourtesy to Amos was used as an argument in the debate by Lord John Russell, but this controversy was closed by the production by Sir Robert Peel of a private letter given to him without authorisation in which Amos incidentally spoke of his social relations in his usual way. It was a lasting political misfortune for Amos that by this misadventure his political adversaries won the day in a debate of the first importance. On Amos's return to England in 1843 he was nominated one of the first county court judges, his circuit being that of Marylebone, Brentford, and Brompton. In 1848 he was elected Downing Professor of the Laws of England at Cambridge, an office he held till his death on 18 April 1860. Literary career Amos was throughout life a persistent student, and published various books of importance on legal, constitutional, and literary subjects. His first book was an examination into certain trials in the courts in Canada relative to the destruction of the Earl of Selkirk's settlement on the Red River. It had been alleged that in June 1816 the servants of the North West Company had destroyed that settlement and murdered Governor Temple and twenty of his people. A few accused persons were brought to trial before the courts of law in Upper Canada, and they were all acquitted. Amos reproduced and criticised the proceedings at some of these trials, and denounced the state of things as one \\"to which no British colony had hitherto afforded a parallel, private vengeance arrogating the functions of public law; murder justified in a British court of judicature, on the plea of exasperation commencing years before the sanguinary act; the spirit of monopoly raging in all the terrors of power, in all the force of organisation, in all the insolence of impunity\\". John Fortescue's De Laudibus Legum Angli√¶: The Translation into English Published A.D. MDCCLXXV (1825), which Amos edited In 1825 Amos edited for the syndics of the University of Cambridge John Fortescue's De Laudibus Legum Angli√¶, appending the English translation of 1775, and original notes, or rather dissertations, by himself. These notes are full of antiquarian research into the history of English law. His name is familiar in the legal world through the treatise on the law of fixtures, which he published in concert with Joseph Ferard in 1827 when the law on the subject was wholly unsettled, never having been treated systematically. He found a congenial part of his task to consist in the examination of the legal history of heirlooms, charters, crown jewels, deer, fish, and \\"things\\" annexed to the freehold of the church, such as mourning hung in the church, tombstones, pews, organs, and bells. He had shared with Samuel March Phillipps the task of bringing out a treatise on the law of evidence, and had taken upon himself the whole charge of the preparation of the eighth edition, published in 1838; when, in 1837, he went to India, he had not quite finished the work. In 1846 he wrote The Great Oyer of Poisoning, an account of the trial of Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset, for poisoning Sir Thomas Overbury, a subject bearing on the constitutional aspects of state trials. In the same year he dedicated to his lifelong friend, William Whewell, Four Lectures on the Advantages of a Classical Education, as an Auxiliary to a Commercial Education. Among his purely constitutional treatises may be mentioned Ruins of Time exemplified in Sir Matthew Hale's Pleas of the Crown (1856). The object of this was to advocate the adoption of a code of criminal law. In 1857 followed The English Constitution in the Reign of King Charles the Second, and in 1859 Observations on the Statutes of the Reformation Parliament in the Reign of King Henry the Eighth, in which he presented a different view of the subject from that of the corresponding chapters of Mr. Froude's History, which had then lately appeared. Among his purely literary works may be mentioned Gems of Latin Poetry (1851), a collection, with notes, of choice Latin verses of all periods, and illustrating remarkable actions and occurrences, \\"biography, places, and natural phenomena, the arts, and inscriptions\\". In 1858 he published Martial and the Moderns, a translation into English prose of select epigrams of Martial arranged under heads with examples of the uses to which they had been applied. He published various introductory lectures on diverse parts of the laws of England,For example, ; ; ; ; and pamphlets on various subjects, such as the constitution of the new county courts, the expediency of admitting the testimony of parties to suits, and other measures of legal reform. Amos's political and philosophical convictions were those of an advanced liberalism qualified by a profound knowledge of the constitutional development of the country and of the sole conditions under which the public improvements for which he longed and lived could alone be hopefully attempted. Though he was in constant communication with the leading reformers of his day, and was a candidate for Kingston upon Hull on the passing of the Reform Bill in 1832, he concerned himself little at any time with strictly party politics.

Kanije defender In 1600 during Long War, the Ottoman army occupied Kanije (modern Nagykanizsa in southwest Hungary). Tiryaki Hasan Pasha was appointed governor of the fort, with a contingent of 7,000. But the next year, Ferdinand II tried to regain the fort, with an army of 50,000. The siege began on 9 September 1601. During the siege and frequent clashes, the Austrians lost 18,000 men. In October, Ferdinand had to end the skirmish temporarily because of the coming winter. He constructed winter emplacements around the fort and continued the siege. As a last resort, on 18 November 1601, Hasan Pasha organized a surprise charge.

It is designated by Cadw as a Grade II* listed building, and is under the care of the Friends of Friendless Churches. It is set in an isolated location off a country road and is adjacent to a farmstead. History The dedication to a \\"Saint Afran\\" is probably a corruption of Saint Afan.Baring-Gould, Vol. I, p. 116. (The 16th-century Peniarth MS 147 lists the church as dedicated to \\"Sannan and Afan and Evan\\".) Afan was a bishop and saint in Ceredigion and Brycheiniog during the 6th century. He was, however, related to the Cuneddan dynasty of Gwynedd and was claimed as an ancestor by a 10th-century Ieuan martyred by Viking raiders. The church was built probably in the late 14th century, and the south chapel was added in the 17th century. In 1899 a new church was built nearer the centre of the settlement, some to the east, and it became redundant. Its fabric deteriorated, by 1937 it was in a state of disrepair, and by 1970 it was in ruins and without a roof. It was restored in 1976‚Äì77. It was vested with the charity the Friends of Friendless Churches in 1978, who hold a 999-year lease with effect from 1 November 1978, and was one of the first of the Welsh churches to be acquired by the charity. Architecture =Exterior= It is built in stone and has a modern slate roof. Its plan is simple, with a continuous nave and chancel, and a chapel extending to the south. A stone gabled bellcote stands on the west end. In the south wall of the nave is a round-headed doorway. To the left is a single rectangular window, and to the right a double window, over which is a large rough stone. There is a rectangular doorway in the north wall with a single square window to its left. The east window consists of a pair of trefoiled lights with a small shield-shaped window between. In the south chapel there are double square-headed windows in the east and south walls, and a single rectangular window in the west wall. =Interior= Internally the church is paved with stone slabs. Most of the fittings and furniture presumably date back to the 18th century, including the box pews and benches. The altar is simple, consisting of a slate slab supported on piers; a simple cross is set into the wall behind it. The font dates from the 12th century and consists of a deep circular bowl on a cylindrical column standing on a stepped rough base. The font is not original to the church, but was moved from the church at Grove, Buckinghamshire when it was converted into a house in the 1970s. There are memorials on the walls, and a gravestone set on a chest on the floor of the nave.

The scheme can provide 440 MW of power and has a capacity of 7.1 GWh. The turbine hall is located inside Ben Cruachan, and the scheme takes water between Cruachan Reservoir to Loch Awe, a height difference of . It is one of only four pumped storage power stations in the UK, and is capable of providing a black start capability to the National Grid. Construction began in 1959 to coincide with the Hunterston A nuclear power station in Ayrshire. Cruachan uses cheap off- peak electricity generated at night to pump water to the higher reservoir, which can then be released during the day to provide power as necessary. The power station is open to visitors, and around 50,000 tourists visit it each year. Location The power station is on the A85 road, about 8 km or 5 miles west of Dalmally, on a branch of Loch Awe leading to the River Awe, which is the outflow from the loch, at its NW corner. There is a seasonally open Falls of Cruachan railway station nearby. History Construction commenced in 1959, and the power station was opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 15 October 1965. The concept was designed by Sir Edward MacColl, who died before it opened. The civil engineering design of the scheme was carried out by James Williamson & Partners of Glasgow, and the main project contractors were William Tawse of Aberdeen and Edmund Nuttall of Camberley. Consulting electrical engineers were Merz & McLellan of Newcastle upon Tyne. At the peak of the construction, there were around 4,000 people working on the project. Thirty-six men died in the construction of the power station and dam, and the cost of the scheme was . Cruachan was one of the first reversible pumped- storage systems, where the same turbines are used as both pumps and generators. Previous pumped-storage systems used separate pumps with a network of pipes to return water to the upper reservoir, making them much more expensive to build than conventional hydroelectric systems. Cruachan is predated by the smaller L√ºnerseewerk (de) of 1958 and the Ffestiniog Power Station of 1963. It is one of four pumped storage schemes in the UK. Its construction was linked to that of Hunterston A nuclear power station, to store surplus night-time nuclear generated electrical energy. The power station was originally operated by the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board, before being transferred to the South of Scotland Electricity Board. It was owned by Scottish Power from the privatisation of Britain's electricity industry in 1990 until Drax Group purchased it along with other Scottish Power assets on 1 January 2019.\\"Pumped storage: what are its prospects?\\" AECOM / International Water Power and Dam Construction. Global Trade Media, 13 June 2014. Retrieved: 21 January 2015. Maintenance of the penstocks, which formerly required them to be drained, is now done using a remotely operated underwater vehicle. To commemorate the 50th anniversary of the station's opening, a 2015 BBC radio documentary \\"Inside the Rock\\" covered the history of construction. Design The Cruachan station temporarily stores energy at times of low demand, and releases it at times of high demand, when electricity prices are higher, reducing the maximum power that must be provided by power stations. It is also used to cope with sudden surges in the demand for electricity, such as at the end of television programmes. Despite the use of some rainwater, Cruachan is not a net generator of electricity: it uses more energy for pumping water and spinning its turbines than it generates. Water is pumped from Loch Awe to the upper reservoir, above, during periods of low energy use (such as at night), and then released during the day. The upper reservoir also receives rainwater, supplemented by a network of of tunnels. Around 10% of the energy from the station is generated from rainwater; the rest is from the water pumped up from Loch Awe. The station is capable of generating of electricity from four turbines, two of and two of capacity, after two units were upgraded in 2005. It can go from standby to full production in two minutes, or thirty seconds if compressed air is used to start the turbines spinning. When the top reservoir is full, Cruachan can operate for 22 hours before the supply of water is exhausted. At full power, the turbines can pump at per second and generate at per second. The power station is required to keep a 12-hour emergency water supply in order to provide a black start capability to the National Grid, to enable utilities to be restarted without access to external power. =Turbine hall= There are four Francis turbines, which operate as both pumps and generators. These are housed in a cavern within Ben Cruachan, which is long, wide and high, with an adjacent transformer hall. The chamber is at a depth of around , and is located within a hard granite intrusion. Construction of the power station required the removal of of rock. Access to the hall is gained by a road tunnel long, high and wide, which is warm and humid enough to allow tropical plants to grow. The transformers step up the voltage from 16 kV to 275 kV for transmission. Six oil-filled cables carry the electric current up a cable shaft to a point in front of the dam, and from there it is carried on pylons to Dalmally to the east. The staircase in the cable shaft has 1,420 steps, making it the tallest in Britain. After passing through the turbines, the water enters a surge chamber designed to balance fluctuations in the level of water before entering the tailrace tunnel to Loch Awe, which is in diameter and long. =Reservoir= The Cruachan Reservoir is above Loch Awe, and is contained by a dam long. The reservoir has a catchment area of , and is capable of holding of energy. Environmental restrictions meant that the dam had to have a \\"clean\\" structure, so the operational equipment is located within the dam wall itself. The penstocks are a pair of tunnels, long and inclined at 56¬∞ from the horizontal with a diameter, which then bifurcate into four steel lined long, diameter shafts. The penstocks underwent a major inspection and refurbishment in 2003. Tourist attraction The power station was listed by the conservation organisation DoCoMoMo as one of the sixty key monuments of post- war Scottish architecture. In November 2012, the power station received the Institution of Mechanical Engineers' Engineering Heritage Award. A visitor centre, refurbished in 2009, is situated at the outflow to Loch Awe and receives around 50,000 visitors a year. The power station houses a three- section modernist mural in wood, plastic and gold leaf by English artist Elizabeth Falconer. The mural includes Celtic crosses, pylons, mythical beasts, and men of industry. The first section depicts the mythical Cailleach Bheur, who guarded the spring underneath the mountain. The middle panel commemorates fifteen workers killed when the roof of the turbine hall collapsed, and the final section shows the station working.

Ward history The parish of Yardley was included within Birmingham County Borough from 1911. The Birmingham ward was created in 1911 from part of the parish (which also created Sparkhill and Yardley wards). The electorate steadily climbed from 4,972 in 1911 to 17,333 in 1939. The boundary changes to wards of 1934, saw Acocks Green ward lose its western area to Sparkhill ward and its southern portion to a new created Hall Green ward. After the war the electorate again jumped to 24,556 in 1945 and climbed again until in 1949 it stood at 26,242. In the boundary changed of 1949/1950 the area south of Warwick Road was lost to Fox Hollies ward, and additional areas in Hay Mills and South Yardley (the northern boundary was the Coventry Road) were added. This moved the area covered substantially northwards. In the 1950 election the electorate had reduced to 16,412. By the 1961 election the electorate had reduced to 14,390 and so the boundary changes of 1961/1962 once again saw the ward expanding. It took a small triangle of territory from Fox Hollies, and expanded northwards from the Coventry Road to Hob Moor Road. The electorate at the 1962 election was up to 20,570. A further expansion of the boundaries was required at the changes in 1981/1982, and resulted in the loss of the area around Greet in the west of the ward, but the addition of areas north of Hob Mooor Road and south of Blakesley Road. The electorate increased from 19,133 in 1981 to 21,125 in 1982. The boundary changes in 2003/2004 resulted in major changes, which saw the abolition of Fox Hollies ward and the creation of a South Yardley ward. Acocks Green ward therefore moved south to take substantial electors from Fox Hollies ward south of the Warwick Road, and restored the Grand Union canal as the northern boundary. Parliamentary Representation The parish of Yardley was part of the Worcestershire Eastern Division from 1832 until 1918. At the boundary changes for the 1918 election the parishes and its City Borough wards were incorporated within Birmingham constituencies. Acocks Green ward became part of Birmingham Moseley constituency in 1918, and the electorate steadily grew from 41,546 in 1918 until it reached 101,169 at the 1935 election. In 1945 a small number of the very biggest constituencies were divided and Acocks Green joined Hall Green ward in the newly created Birmingham Acocks Green seat. Birmingham Acocks Green constituency was short lived and in the wholesale boundary changes that preceded the 1950 election, the ward was joined by Fox Hollies and Yardley wards in a Birmingham Yardley seat. Once again this seat only had a short life, although it remained as Birmingham Yardley the wards which made up the seat were changed for the 1955 election to Acocks Green, Sheldon and Yardley. This time the seat was more settled and was left alone at the changes for the 1974, 1983 and 1997 boundary changes. In 2010 the seat was enlarged, following the loss of a Birmingham constituency, and included Stechford & Yardley North, together with the South Yardley and Sheldon wards. Politics From its creation Acocks Green ward was generally a Conservative (or Liberal Unionist) seat, but occasional gains by Independents disrupted the pattern during the 1920s. In 1945 Labour won the seat (plus a by-election) to give it representation for the first time. However, in 1946 the Tories regained the seat, and held on to it until 1952, when Labour won again. The seat was now more marginal and Labour won in 1954, 1956, 1958, 1963 and 1971. The all out elections of 1973 (for the new Birmingham Metropolitan Borough), produced, as may have been expected, a split result, with two Tories and one Labour councillor. The Tories won all the elections for the ward in the 1970s, but then lost to Labour in 1980. The boundary changes prior to the 1982 election once again produced a split result, again two Tories and one Labour councillor. The redrawn seat and the general demographics of the city meant that the new ward was a better bet for Labour and they duly won all the elections, until the Conservatives' good year of 1987, but that was a one off and Labour once again won in 1988. However everything was all about to change, and in 1990 the Liberal Democrats seized the seat. John Hemming, who was later to become the MP for the Yardley constituency, won for the first time. The Liberal Democrats had won the ward at every election until 2011, when it swung strongly back to Labour. Labour gained a second seat in 2012, but the Liberal Democrats held their remaining seat in the 2014 elections.

It is a stiff, erect shrub with hairy, rust-coloured new growth and which recovers from fire from a lignotuber. It has dull green, leathery, prickly, holly-like leaves and long sprays of cream flowers, usually after fire. Description Lomatia ilicifolia is a stiff, erect shrub which grows to a height of and has its young foliage and flower buds covers with rust-coloured hairs. The leaves are dull green, leathery and holly-like, mostly glabrous and egg-shaped to lance-shaped or elliptic. They are long, wide, have sharp teeth along their edges and a prominent network of veins. The flowers are arranged on the ends of the stems in a spike-like panicle or raceme long, each flower on a stalk long. The flowers are white or cream-coloured, long and more or less glabrous. Flowering occurs from November to February, usually following fire the previous summer, and is followed about three months later by the fruit which is a dark brown, leathery follicle long containing about ten winged seeds.Lomatia ilicifolia after fire in Bunyip State Park in Victoria Hybrids with L. myricoides, L. silaifolia and L. fraseri occasionally occur where these species grow near L. ilicifolia. Taxonomy and naming Lomatia ilicifolia was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown from a specimen collected near Port Phillip. The description was published in Transactions of the Linnean Society of London. The specific epithet (ilicifolia) is derived from the Latin words ilex, ilicis meaning \\"holm-oak, a genus of the holly family\\" and folium meaning \\"leaf\\". Distribution and habitat Native holly is widespread and locally common in south-eastern Victoria where it grows in heath or woodland, sometimes in montane forests, from the Otway Ranges eastward to Gippsland. In New South Wales it grows in sclerophyll forest on the coast and nearby ranges south of Moss Vale. Ecology Native holly attracts nectar-feeding butterflies. Use in horticulture This lomatia is a hardy, slow-growing plant with interesting foliage, well-displayed flowers and attractive fruit. It is frost-tolerant and grows in full sun or partial shade.

The Hall is operated by the non-profit Newark Performing Arts Corporation (NPAC). Design and construction Originally built in 1925 by the Shriners at a cost of more than $2 million as Salaam Temple and colloquially known as The Mosque, the four-story building has been Newark Symphony Hall since 1964. The interior features Greek and Egyptian motifs, marble columns, a crystal chandelier, gold-leaf fret work and two-columned side promenades. The neo-classical building was designed by Frank Grad, a prominent Newark architect, whose work includes the Lefcourt Newark Building and many others downtown. The 3,500-seat main concert hall is named for Sarah Vaughan, a native Newarker, and is renowned for its acoustics. Newark Stage is a 200-seat black box theater used by theatrical productions. The Terrace Ballroom is used for receptions. The Studio is a rehearsal space. The Dance Studio is home to one of three facilities in the state used by the school of the Garden State Ballet, founded in 1951.Garden State Ballet History During its early years the theater received the patronage of Mrs. Parker O. Griffith, with a foundation supported by the Griffith Piano Company.

In 1995, 200 women from the 29 former Soviet Union and satellite nations travelled 8000 kilometres aboard a half-kilometre-long train from Warsaw via Mongolia to Beijing for the UN 4th Global Conference On Women. The train was sponsored by the UNDP and was the brainchild of UNDP executive Leueen Miller who used the train as a means both to transport and to train delegates to the Global Conference on Women from regions which never before had representation. The train journey became known as ‚ÄòThe Beijing Express‚Äô. On board the Beijing Express, a 12-member working group was created from the 200 delegates and chaired by the UK delegate Lesley Abdela. Trainers and experts from many nations, including the UK, USA, Canada, Israel, Japan and Turkey, presented workshops on human rights, negotiating skills, conflict mediation and conflict resolution, how to change world trade agreements and create economic policies to suit the world's women - even courses in English, computer skills and networking through e-mail. Lesley Abdela was recruited by UNDP's Leueen Miller and sponsored by the British Council and UK FCO to conduct democracy skills workshops aboard the Beijing Express Approaching Beijing, the delegates affirmed the following declaration developed by the working group. 1) The New '-ism' Neither Communism nor Capitalism has worked well for the majority of women in the world. We believe the new ‚Äòism‚Äô will come from a new approach to world economics. Many economic policies have been disastrous for women. It is often women who bear the brunt of economic restructuring policies made by organisations who too often overlook the way their policies could impact on millions of women. Under both Communism and Capitalism the quality of people's lives is all too often sacrificed for the goal of wealth creation. Human development should not be sacrificed in the name of economic growth but rather economic growth should be used as a tool to help people achieve a healthy and creative life. 2) White Scarves, Not Blue Helmets (This heading is symbolic - in certain Islamic countries, when a woman throws down her white scarf no person must pass. This has been used on occasion to stop men fighting) The present system of peace-making and negotiations dominated by senior men at governmental levels has patently failed and is now discredited. We want women's full participation in conflict prevention, resolution and peace- keeping. Therefore, we want women's organisations and Non-Governmental Organisations from all sides in all future peace talks and working with governments on developing and expanding ‚ÄòPreventive Diplomacy‚Äô. 3) 'Hot Spot' Commission We want the United Nations‚Äô mandate to be expanded to include preventive diplomacy. As part of this we want a ‚ÄòHot Spot‚Äô Commission set up to try to prevent conflict where trouble is brewing. This commission, consisting of women and men, would be set up to intervene in conflict prevention, resolution and settlement. 4) Economic and Political Sanctions We want economic and political sanctions imposed on parties violating Human Rights - but humanitarian aid should be allowed. 5) Rape as a War Crime We want men who commit rape as a war crime to be brought to justice and prosecuted as war criminals. We believe this will only happen if women are included equally with men on committees responsible for bringing these men to trial. 6) Property Rights As Human Rights We want property rights recognised as Human Rights, and improved mechanisms for getting back property snatched away in conflicts. 7) Women's Equal Participation We want systems of national political and public life reformed to include women's equal participation with men in political, economic and international decision-making at all levels, from local to national to global. This means also providing training and encouragement for women to participate in politics and public life. 8) Favourable Government Policies Towards Women We want government policies favourable to women. Many policies developed by governments either ignore women's needs or actually harm women. We want governments in transition economies to show what impact their policies are having on women. This would be a way to get policy-makers to develop policies that are more women- friendly. 9) Gender Neutral Language We want governments and other entities to use gender-neutral language. 10) Government Financial Support We want governments to give financial support to women's groups. These voices must be heard. 11) Recognition of Unpaid Work We want women's unpaid work measured and recognised in economic arrangements such as pensions. Nearly 50% of the US$23 Trillion global output is provided by women's unpaid work. We need fairer sharing of the work and equality in the home. Sakiko Fukuda-Parr of the UNDP says, ‚ÄúWhen we get world leaders to recognise that 70% of the world‚Äôs GDP is unpaid work, they won‚Äôt say women working at home can‚Äôt qualify for pensions on an equal basis with men.‚Äù References http://www.undp.org/evaluation/documents/25.htm Category:United Nations documents Category:United Nations Development Programme Category:1995 documents Category:1995 in international relations ","title":"UNDP Beijing Express Declaration"},{"id":"28200608","text":"Raj Rishi College is a college in Alwar city in Rajasthan state of India.

Conclave After the death of Pope Clement X on 22 July 1676, the College of Cardinals convened in Rome to elect a successor. The college consisted of 67 members: 44 of them took part at the opening of the conclave, and the number rose to 63 when others finally arrived from abroad.S. Miranda: Papal Conclave, 1676 Seven of these cardinals had been created by Urban VIII, twelve by Innocent X, eight by Alexander VII, and nineteen by Clement IX and Clement X. Absent cardinals included Friedrich of Hessen and Pascal of Aragon. A list was already in circulation indicating possible papal candidates. Only Cardinal Benedetto Odescalchi was suitably \\"papabile\\" at the time of the conclave. Odescalchi had emerged as a strong candidate for the papacy after the earlier death of Pope Clement IX on 9 December 1669, but the French Government had vetoed his nomination. After the death of Clement X, King Louis XIV of France had again intended to use his royal influence against the election of Odescalchi, whom he viewed as sympathetic to Spain. But, seeing that his popularity had grown among the cardinals as well as the Roman people, he reluctantly instructed the cardinals of the French party to acquiesce in his candidacy. On the 1st ballot, held on 3 August 1676, Odescalchi received 14 votes. 13 other candidates remained in the running, with 25 abstentions. The number of candidates sank, but the vote on 20 September gave only 8 votes to Odescalchi. 19 votes were spread among cardinals Barberini, Rospigliosi and Alberizzi, while 30 cardinals abstained. Election of Innocent XI Finally on 21 September, Odescalchi was surrounded in the chapel of the conclave and proclaimed pope by acclamation rather than formal vote.The Triple Crown: An Account of the Papal Conclaves by Val√©rie Pirie.

He was expelled from Germany in June 1934 for his critical reporting of Nazism and his campaigning in support of the German Jews. In 1937, reporting from Shanghai on the Japanese invasion of China, he was shot and killed by a Japanese bullet. Biography =Early life= Born in 1903, (not 1894 as stated in John's Simpson's Unreliable Sources), Stephens was educated at Gresham's School in Norfolk and, later, at the University of Cambridge. After trying out in a couple of different professions, he settled on journalism.John Simpson, 'My History Hero', BBC History Magazine Vol 11, no 6, June 2010, p.98 =Foreign Correspondent for the Daily Express= As a foreign correspondent for the Daily Express, he reported from Vienna and Paris. At the end of 1933, he was sent to Berlin to replace Sefton Delmer. Unlike Delmer, who had tried to get close to Adolf Hitler's close associates to get good stories, Stephens examined the effects of the Nazi regime on ordinary people, especially the Jewish population. His articles, criticizing Nazism and uncovering the harsh conditions of the Jews, became increasingly prominent in the Daily Express. The Nazi authorities arrested him twice, before finally expelling him from Germany in June 1934. From London, he continued to write critical articles on the Nazis, until the Daily Express lost its enthusiasm for this.John Simpson, 'My History Hero', BBC History Magazine Vol 11, no 6, June 2010, p. 98 =Death= He subsequently joined the Daily Telegraph newspaper and was sent to report on the Second Italo-Abyssinian War, the Spanish Civil War, and the Japanese invasion of China. On 29 April 1937, in the Basque country, he was among the first reporters to enter the ruins of Guernica with the Nationalist forces. In the newspaper, he reported only that the town had been 'burned' but on Sunday 2 May he privately reported to the British Ambassador, Sir Henry Chilton, in Hendaye, that Guernica had been destroyed in an air-raid and these were German and Italian air tactics. He asked the ambassador not to use his name otherwise he would not be permitted to report from Franco's Nationalist headquarters, since their line was the Republicans had set fire to and blown up their own town.Herbert R. Southworth, Guernica! Guernica! A study of journalism, diplomacy, propaganda and history, University of California Press, 1977, p.61 & p.212 In China, he reported for the Daily Telegraph on the atrocities of the invading Japanese. According to John Simpson, he was killed on 18 November 1937, the last day of the Chinese army's stand in Shanghai. John Gittings, however, on his website www.johngittings.com, quotes Five Months of War (Shanghai: North-China Daily News & Herald, 1938), p. 133 as putting Stephens' death on 11 November. Gittings' quotation goes on to describe Stephens as having been shot while watching the fighting from a water tower, when a Japanese machine gunner unexpectedly raised his aim. The Japanese apologized, explaining that they had been shooting at snipers on nearby roof-tops. His chauffeur, Bernhard Arp Sindberg, was with him at the time of his death at the water tower. Bernhard would later save over 6,000 Chinese during the Nanking Massacre. A friend of Stephens', O'Dowd Gallagher from the Daily Mail, wrote the story of Stephens' death and sent it to the Daily Express.John Simpson, 'My History Hero', BBC History Magazine Vol 11, no 6, June 2010, p. 98http://www.johngittings.com/id65.html (On the other hand, the biographer of Edgar Snow says that O.D. Gallagher was himself working for the Daily Express and sent the story of Stephen's death to the Daily Telegraph.)Edgar Snow: a biography by John Maxwell Hamilton, LSU Press, 2003, p.102 Reporting Style John Simpson, who researched Stephens for his book Unreliable Sources: How the Twentieth Century was Reported, calls Stephens a 'fearless correspondent', who 'stood out for his objective reporting'. He says his journalism was 'arresting, colourful', he 'was a genuine hero of 20th-century reporting', and that he 'refused to do his reporting from the safety of his office. He always preferred to go and see what was happening for himself. It earned him Beaverbrook's highest praise, and a much-increased salary; and in the end it cost him his life.' He 'believed that it was his duty' to report on the plight of the Jews living under Nazi rule.John Simpson, 'My History Hero', BBC History Magazine Vol 11, no 6, June 2010, p. 98 References Category:1894 births Category:1937 deaths Category:Alumni of the University of Cambridge Category:British male journalists Category:People educated at Gresham's School Category:Daily Express people Category:The Daily Telegraph people ","title":"Philip Pembroke Stephens"},{"id":"28200718","text":"Lamb and Flag or Lamb & Flag may refer to: *The insignia of the Middle Temple *Pub names#Religious ‚Äì a religious pub name **Lamb & Flag (Oxford) ‚Äì a pub in Oxford **Lamb and Flag, Covent Garden ‚Äì a pub in Covent Garden, London See also *Lamb of God ","title":"Lamb and Flag"},{"id":"28200724","text":"The Lovat Hotel is a hotel in Fort Augustus, at the southern end of Loch Ness in Scotland, originally built in the 1860s.

It is a strongly regular graph with parameters srg(27, 16, 10, 8). Construction 221 polytope. This symmetric projection contains 2 rings of 12 vertices, and 3 vertices coinciding at the center. The intersection graph of the 27 lines on a cubic surface is a locally linear graph that is the complement of the Schl√§fli graph. That is, two vertices are adjacent in the Schl√§fli graph if and only if the corresponding pair of lines are skew.. The Schl√§fli graph may also be constructed from the system of eight-dimensional vectors :(1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0), :(1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1), and :(‚àí1/2, ‚àí1/2, 1/2, 1/2, 1/2, 1/2, 1/2, 1/2), and the 24 other vectors obtained by permuting the first six coordinates of these three vectors. These 27 vectors correspond to the vertices of the Schl√§fli graph; two vertices are adjacent if and only if the corresponding two vectors have 1 as their inner product.. Alternately, this graph can be seen as the complement of the collinearity graph of the generalized quadrangle GQ(2,4). Subgraphs and neighborhoods The neighborhood of any vertex in the Schl√§fli graph forms a 16-vertex subgraph in which each vertex has 10 neighbors (the numbers 16 and 10 coming from the parameters of the Schl√§fli graph as a strongly regular graph). These subgraphs are all isomorphic to the complement graph of the Clebsch graph.. Note that Cameron and van Lint use an alternative definition of these graphs in which both the Schl√§fli graph and the Clebsch graph are complemented from their definitions here. Since the Clebsch graph is triangle-free, the Schl√§fli graph is claw-free. It plays an important role in the structure theory for claw-free graphs by . Any two skew lines of these 27 belong to a unique Schl√§fli double six configuration, a set of 12 lines whose intersection graph is a crown graph in which the two lines have disjoint neighborhoods. Correspondingly, in the Schl√§fli graph, each edge uv belongs uniquely to a subgraph in the form of a Cartesian product of complete graphs K6 \\\\square K2 in such a way that u and v belong to different K6 subgraphs of the product. The Schl√§fli graph has a total of 36 subgraphs of this form, one of which consists of the zero-one vectors in the eight-dimensional representation described above. Ultrahomogeneity A graph is defined to be k-ultrahomogeneous if every isomorphism between two of its induced subgraphs of at most k vertices can be extended to an automorphism of the whole graph. If a graph is 5-ultrahomogeneous, it is ultrahomogeneous for every k; the only finite connected graphs of this type are complete graphs, Tur√°n graphs, 3 √ó 3 rook's graphs, and the 5-cycle. The infinite Rado graph is countably ultrahomogeneous. There are only two connected graphs that are 4-ultrahomogeneous but not 5-ultrahomogeneous: the Schl√§fli graph and its complement. The proof relies on the classification of finite simple groups.; ; . See also *Gosset graph - contains the Schl√§fli graph as an induced subgraph of the neighborhood of any vertex.

Born in Kolkata, West Bengal, he migrated to Dhaka, East Bengal after the Partition period in 1960 and started his singing career. He is known as East Pakistan's Ahmed Rushdi because his singing style is inspired by Ahmed Rushdi. He was awarded Ekushey Padak in 2005 by the Government of Bangladesh and Bangladesh National Film Award for Best Male Playback Singer for his performance in the film Kokhono Megh Kokhono Bristi (2003). Career Bashir Ahmed was born in Calcutta in 1939. He was accepted as a pupil by Ustad Vilayat Hussain at the age of 15. Later, he came to Bombay, and became a student of Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan. Ahmed performed along with Geeta Dutt. Around the 1960s, when the film producer and owner of Gulistan Cinema Hall, Dossani invited Talat Mahmood and Ahmed to East Pakistan to perform, after their tour of Chittagong and Mymensingh, Mahmood returned to India but Ahmed decided to stay back. In Dhaka, his mentor and brother-in-law, Ishrat Kalkatvi introduced him to Robin Ghosh. Kalkatvi was writing songs for the film Talash (1963), although eventually, Suroor Barabankvi contributed more songs to the film. Ghosh was making tunes for the film. Ahmed sang some numbers for Talash, including the soft romantic one, titled \\"Kuch Apni Kahiye Kuch Meri Suniye, Yeh Sham Yeh Tanhai Yun Chup To Na Rahiye\\". Ahmed sang another song titled Main Rickshawalla Matwala. He had another duet in the film, \\"Tum Bhi Haseen Dil Bhi Jawan\\". Ahmed was also a poet and a lyricist, with a pseudonym B. A. Deep. Film-maker, Mustafiz, they contacted Bashir and asked him to write a song for his film, Saagar (1965 film), which he did, titled Ja dekha pyar tera, and sang it too. Similarly in Robin Ghosh's another lilting offering, Karwan, in 1964, Bashir wrote and sang Jab Tum Akele Hoge Hum Yaad Aayenge. He wrote film songs, as B. A. Deep, and also continued to sing as Bashir Ahmed for films like Saagar, Karwan, Indhan, Milan (1964 film), Kangan, Darshan (1967), Soye nadiya Jaage Paani (1967) and Jahan Baje Shehnai (1968). The songs from the films were Yeh Sama Pyara Pyara, Yeh Hawaein Thandi Tthandi (singer Mala), (Yeh mausam yeh mast nazare, pyar karo to inse karo), (Tumhare Liye Iss Dil Mein Itne Mohabbat Hai, Itne Mohabbat Kaun Karega Kahan Paoge Kis Dil Mein Hoge), (Din Raat Khayalon Mein Tujhe Yaad Karoonga, Par Naam Tera Leke Main Aawaz Na Doonga), (Hum Chale Chhor Kar Teri Mehfil Sanam, Dil Kahin Na Kahin To Behal Jayega), (Gulshan Mein Baharon Mein Tu Hai), and (Chun Liya Ik Phool Ko), with Madam Noor Jahan. In 1971, when the situation worsened in Pakistan, he was not encouraged in the industry as music directors considered him a pale version of Ahmed Rushdi (who remained the greatest singer in the history of Pakistani cinema) and the film Hill Station's songs, namely Mera Dil Na Jaane Kabse Tera Pyar Dhoondta Hai and Mere Seene Par Sar Rakhdo remain his only contributions in this period. A film that was made on the Dhaka Debacle in the late 1970s, called Sangtarash, also included his numbers, namely Bol Zara Kuch Duniya Wale and Mukhre Mein Chand, but the film, despite pleadings of the film-maker to the military regime of Zia, remained unreleased. So, he went back to Bangladesh in 1975 and continued his music career there. Personal life and death Ahmed was married to Meena Bashir (d. 2014), a singer. Together they had a daughter, Humayra and a son, Raja Bashir. Ahmed died on 19 April 2014, aged 74 at his residence in Mohammadpur, Dhaka, Bangladesh. He had been suffering from various diseases including cancer.

Planned and built from 1952 to 1957, it is notable as the first planned racially integrated development in Philadelphia and among the first in the United States. The developer, Morris Milgram, a leader of the open housing movement, required that 55 percent of the homes be sold to whites, and 45 percent to non-whites.\\"Black, White and Golden. Greenbelt Knoll residents celebrate 50 years of historical significance,\\" by Gwen Shaffer, Philadelphia Weekly, June 20, 2007. The first house sold in 1956 for $20,000.

The simple wood-frame homes were designed in a Modernist style by the architectural firm of Montgomery & Bishop in consultation with architects Louis Kahn and Harry Duncan and landscape architect Margaret Lancaster Duncan. Greenbelt Knoll won several awards for design excellence. For example, the American Institute of Architects, House and Home, Better Homes and Gardens, and the National Broadcasting Corporation bestowed its Homes for Better Living award on the development. Also, Philadelphia Mayor Richardson Dilworth, an ardent advocate of exceptional planning and design, conferred a City of Philadelphia Tribute on Montgomery & Bishop; he gave the tribute \\"for the design of Greenbelt Knoll Homes, which ... brought new standards of contemporary residential architecture to Philadelphia.\\" Notable residents The original residents included Milgram himself; Robert N.C. Nix, Sr., the first African American to represent Pennsylvania in Congress; Pulitzer Prize‚Äìwinning African-American playwright Charles Fuller, who grew up here; the Rev.

History Designed and built by Dr. Alan Abrey in an old quarry site, the Umgeni River Bird Park was opened in April 1984. The park was owned privately by a group of bird lovers who wanted to educate others about birds from around the world. It was run by Alan Abrey until his retirement in 1997, and in those years the artwork for the park (guidebook illustrations, park maps, and so forth) were done by his daughter Robyn Abrey. Floods in 1987 washed away the road in front of the park, and resulted in the temporary evacuation of the birds to Abrey's home on higher ground. By 1989, the park was home to over 4,500 birds of 400 different species, and was given the ‚ÄúPremier Durban Attraction‚Äù award by the Durban Tourism Board. Construction of the Free Flight Bird Show arena was started in 1995, with the venue staging its first show in 1996. The park was purchased by Tsogo Sun in 1997, with the new owners agreeing to uphold the park's \\"Inspire to Conserve\\" philosophy. Tsogo Sun closed the park at the end of August 2009 because it was not financially viable. The Regency Foundation Network agreed to raise the R4.5 million necessary for the purchase, and the City will take over the R3 million per year operating expenses. The Park was reopened in June 2010. Exhibits Set in a landfilled and landscaped former quarry, the park includes several natural waterfalls. Paths for visitors wind through three aviaries and past other aviaries and open exhibits. A viewing window in the nursery lets visitors see how the birds are hatched and raised. Attractions The Free Flight Bird Show, opened in 1996, features birds from North and South America, Africa, Indonesia, and Australia, and emphasizes conservation. Birds in the show includes owls, cranes, hornbills, macaws, kookaburras, toucans, vultures, in an open-air auditorium. The show is staged twice daily, weather permitting. Conservation The park breeds 17 of the 24 threatened bird species in its collection. The park is involved with the South Africa Crane Working Group in breeding and then releasing the wattled crane. The birds are hand-reared using a glove puppet, and are then released near Dullstroom. Wattled cranes are listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, and there are only about 8000 in the wild.

He was a prominent political figure in the south of Ireland and was of Royalist and Jacobite sympathies. He was also a member of the Irish Cotter family of Norse- Gaelic origins. He was born around 1630, the second son of Edmond Fitz Garrett Cotter of Anngrove and Elizabeth Connell of Barryscourt, was knighted in 1685‚Äì1686, and died in 1705. Career =Agent of the Crown= James Cotter attached himself to the Royalist cause in the Civil Wars, and family tradition has him fighting for Charles II at the Battle of Worcester in 1651.If this is true he was lucky to escape capture, as Irish soldiers fighting in England were generally executed out of hand if they were captured by the Parliamentarians. Cotter was probably part of King Charles' military entourage when in exile and on his restoration to the throne in 1660 was a lieutenant in a foot (infantry) regiment.√ì Cu√≠v, p. 141 Exempted from the general pardon of persons who had taken arms against the monarchy in the recent wars were the \\"regicides\\" ‚Äì those who had been instrumental in the trial and execution of Charles I. A number of the regicides fled the country to escape trial and were declared traitors and outlaws. James Cotter founded his career in royal service by organising and carrying out the assassination of one of the regicides, John Lisle, in Switzerland (at Lausanne, 14 September 1664). Another regicide, Edmund Ludlow, was also targeted but escaped assassination. The Dictionary of National Biography, amongst other sources, states that Cotter carried out the killing under the pseudonym Thomas Macdonnell.Lee, Sidney (1903), Dictionary of National Biography Index and Epitome, p. 781 (also main entry xxxiii 341) However, in his biographical essay √ì Cu√≠v dismisses this, stating that Cotter and his accomplices, Miles Crowley and John Rierdan (both Irish gentlemen fallen on hard times), were quite open about the incident. They were, indeed, carrying out a royal and judicial warrant and were acting entirely within English law.They were breaking the local law of the Canton of Berne, hence the clandestine nature of the act. They were all rewarded by the English crown on their return and their rewards were officially recorded. Crowley fired the shot that killed Lisle, who was attacked in a churchyard, whilst Cotter and Rierdan fought off Lisle's guards.√ì Cu√≠v, pp. 139‚Äì143 =Colonial service= Following this incident Cotter was made a captain, and in 1666 went to the West Indies commanding a company in a newly-raised regiment of foot. In 1667 he commanded 700 men in an unsuccessful attack on the island of St Christopher, which resulted in his capture by the French. In 1680 he was promoted to colonel and appointed Deputy-Governor of the island of Montserrat; in 1681 he was made the island's Governor.√ì Cu√≠v, pp. 148‚Äì150 ‚Äì the island was heavily settled by the Irish, who made up a majority of the non-slave population. A proportion of the Irish were indentured servants and not far from being slaves themselves. With a royal pension and the profits from his West Indian governorship James Cotter became very wealthy and he bought out the interests of most of his immediate family in his father's former lands. He further extended his holdings in the Cork area by new purchases of land. =James II and the Williamite War in Ireland= King James II It is likely that James Cotter was an intimate of James II and may have served at sea with the king when the king was Duke of York, and an admiral, in the war against the Dutch of 1665. King James is reported to have familiarly referred to Cotter as \\"Shaymus Bwee,\\" S√©amus Buidhe in Irish. In June 1685 Cotter is recorded as a Lt. Colonel serving in Sir William Clifton's Regiment of Foot. James Cotter is believed to have been knighted by King James in 1685 following the Battle of Sedgemoor. The earliest official reference to Cotter as a knight occurs in 1686, which supports this timing; the records of the occasion of the dubbing are no longer extant.√ì Cu√≠v, pp. 154‚Äì155 James II had converted to Roman Catholicism before he succeeded to the throne, the birth to him of a son and heir who would be raised a Catholic precipitated the Glorious Revolution of 1688, and James fled England; where his Protestant daughter Mary, and son-in-law William III, came to power. In order to retrieve his fortunes King James landed in Ireland in March 1689 with French troops, initiating the Williamite War in Ireland. At this time Sir James Cotter, a Catholic like his king, was made commander of the Jacobite forces in Cork, and he was also returned as the first member of the Irish Parliament for the city of Cork. Cotter is said to have entertained King James at his house in Anngrove in 1689 and was reputedly promised an elevation to the peerage as a marquis.Journal of the Cork Historical and Archaeological Society, 1937, p. 29. Cotter commanded \\"Clare's Dragoons,\\" described as one of the finest of the Jacobite cavalry regiments, and was involved in a skirmish at Lisnaskea, where his force was ambushed. On 11 February 1690 Cotter was appointed Governor of the City of Cork, and in April was empowered to collect taxes from the whole of County Cork. Following King James' defeat at the Battle of the Boyne, at the start of the campaign of 1691, Sir James Cotter was made Brigadier General in command of all the Jacobite forces in counties Cork, Kerry, Limerick and Tipperary. Cotter won two clashes with the Williamite forces but was ultimately defeated in the Battle of Bottlehill, at Ballymagooly\\"The Parliamentary gazetteer of Ireland\\", A. Fullarton, 1846, p. 269. near Mallow, on 29 April 1691.√ì Cu√≠v, pp. 155‚Äì157 During the time of his military and civil authority Sir James Cotter treated the Protestant landowners well, not allowing his troops to despoil their property or for acts of reprisal to occur. He was rewarded for his moderation when, following the surrender of the Jacobite forces under the Treaty of Limerick, the support of his Protestant neighbours allowed him to retain his property and lands in full, despite legal attempts to force his forfeiture.√ì Cu√≠v, pp. 157‚Äì158 =Later life= The area around Cork showing Great Island (Inismore) once owned by the Cotters, and Carrigtwohill the burial place of Sir James Fitz Edmond Cotter. In the last years of his life he was regarded as the natural leader of the Catholic community of Cork; he devoted time and resources to patronising Irish literature and protecting Roman Catholic clergy, including John Sleyne Bishop of Cork and Cloyne, from the authorities.√ì Cu√≠v, pp. 158‚Äì159 Following his death in 1705 he was buried in his family's burial vault at Carrigtwohill, a vault he had built to hold his father's remains. Cultural significance Sir James Cotter was, in the style of previous generations of Irish chieftains, a great patron of poetry and other writings in the Irish language, with many poems about, or dedicated to, the Cotters by poets such as D√°ibh√≠ √ì Bruadair, Uilliam Mac Cairte√°in, Uilliam Ruadh Mac Coitir (a fellow Cotter), Se√°n Cl√°rach Mac Domhnaill and √âamonn do V√°l surviving. Domhnall √ì Colm√°in included much biographical material concerning Sir James Cotter in his tract P√°rliament na mBan. Family Sir James Cotter married twice. His first marriage, to Mary daughter of Sir William Stapleton, was without issue; his second wife was Ellen Plunkett daughter of Matthew, 7th Lord Louth. His eldest son, James, inherited his wealth and patronage of the Catholic population of Cork, but not his moderation or astute political instinct and ended his life on the gallows. His other children were: Laurence, Mary, Alice and Monica. He is the patrilinear ancestor of the Cotter baronets of Rockforest in County Cork. Notes =Works cited= *√ì Cu√≠v, B.

Altava and the Roman \\"Cohors II Sardorum Altava, according to historian Lawless, was a vicus that achieved independent status from the castrum-fort of the garrison and had a huge Forum and an important pagan temple, later converted into a Christian church (showing the growing presence of Christianity between Berbers. The Roman settlement had an area of nearly 13 hectares and was surrounded by farms.Lawless, R. Mauretania Caesartiensis: anarcheological and geographical survey Section: The Roman Civilian Sites. p.122-195 Emperor Diocletian reorganized the Roman Empire in 298 AD and later withdrew from the area of Volubilis, the Rif mountains in northern Morocco and the western Algerian Atlas mountains after the Crisis of the 3rd Century. Berber rulers created a small independent kingdom there, centered on the capital Altava and the fully Romanised city of Volubilis. From the 7th century Byzantine historians usually called it the Kingdom of Altava. After the Vandal invasion in 429 AD, Altava became the capital of an independent Berber state. This Mauro-Roman kingdom was situated near Mauretania Caesariensis and Mauretania Tingitana, at some distance from the Vandal nucleus. Although a Berber polity, it borrowed the sociocultural, military and religious structure of the Roman Empire. Villaverde Vega, No√©: \\"El Reino mauretoromano de Altava, siglo VI\\" (The Mauro- Roman kingdom of Altava) p.355 Between 550 and 578 AD, Altava served as the capital of the independent Christian Berber kingdom of Garmul. The last time the kingdom of Altava was cited historically was in connection with a campaign of Gennadius, a magister militum sent by the Eastern Roman Empire. He defeated the Berbers and the ruler of Altava in 578 AD and his small kingdom was probably incorporated to the Byzantine Empire.Martindale et al. \\" The Prosopography of the later Roman Empire\\" Vol.III We have no historical records about Altava in the seventh century, but it is also conceivable that the kingdom of Altava (or at least a small section of it) lasted until its conquest by the Arabs around 700 AD.Philippe S√©nac et Patrice Cressier : \\"Histoire du Maghreb m√©di√©val VII - XI √®me si√®cle\\" Armand Colin.

The first song \\"Pudhiya Manidha\\" was the introduction song for Vaseegaran and Chitti (both played by Rajinikanth) and also appeared in the opening credits. It was choreographed by Prabhu Deva with his Bharata Natyam trained assistant Ajeesh dancing for the robot. \\"Kadhal Anukkal\\", again choreographed by Prabhu Deva, is a love song picturised on Vaseegaran and Sana (played by Aishwarya Rai). The song was completely shot from Len√ß√≥is Maranhenses National Park in northeastern Brazil. \\"Irumbile Oru Irudhaiyam\\", which marked the singing debut of Lady Kash and Krissy in Tamil cinema,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/music/news-and- interviews/Kashins-on- rap/articleshow/6774517.cms?referral=PMhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/speednewsshow/6814493.cms was choreographed by Remo D'Souza and was picturised as a club dance number between Chitti and Sana. \\"Chitti Dance Showcase\\", a short and mostly instrumental song was choreographed by Shobi and was picturised on Vaseegaran, Chitti and Sana. \\"Arima Arima\\" was set in Ramoji Rao Film City, Hyderabad and was choreographed by Prabhu Deva. It was picturised on Chitti, his robot army and Sana. According to the director S. Shankar, art director Sabu Cyril and cinematographer R. Rathnavelu, picturising this song was the most challenging part of the whole film. The song also features two robotic lions, the creation of which, according to Sabu Cyril, is a professional secret. In an interview, Ratnavelu said, \\"This film has been a big challenge right from the start till the patchwork. But the most challenging part for me was shooting the climax song, Arima Arima, which will be the USP of the film. The song was shot in a set in Hyderabad in 2008. I had to perceive in 2008 what would be in vogue now. So, that was a real challenge and that has come out really well.\\" The most notable song in terms of picturisation, \\"Kilimanjaro\\", is picturised on Rajinikanth and Aishwarya Rai singing a duet with a host of tribal dancers in the background. The song sequence was filmed at Machu Picchu in Peru, making it the first Indian video to be picturised from the protected heritage site. According to official sources, there were interventions from the Indian government to grant permission for the filming, which was denied to many international projects, such as Quantum of Solace (2008). It was choreographed by Raju Sundaram. The last song, \\"Boom Boom Robo Da\\", shot from Himachal Pradesh and Chennai, was choreographed by Dinesh and picturised on Vaseegaran, Sana and Chitti. Reception The soundtrack has received generally positive reviews and on the second day of release, the album was on top of the US iTunes Top 10 World Albums chart, making it the first Indian album to reach the spot. In the United Kingdom, Enthiran ranked third place on iTunes and by the following day occupied the top spot successfully. In Australia, Enthiran ranked on the top spot by 5 August. The soundtrack has topped the Indian charts too. The first five positions was defended by Enthiran songs for more than three months. \\"Kadhal Anukkal\\" topped the charts for more than eight weeks. The Hindi version, \\"Pagal Anukan\\", peaked at #4 position in the weekly charts.Planet Bollywood weekly charts The audio is said to have created history and have registered a record breaking sale in the Indian audio market. =Critical response= Tamil version The soundtrack also received positive critical responses. The Hindu commented on the album that \\"With its blend of melody, trance and rhythm, Enthiran ‚Äì The Robot sounds like a winner\\". Chennai online stated that \\"The entire album gives an upbeat electro sense and wings to our imaginations. The music is convinced to grow on you, if not an instant hit.\\" A review by Music Aloud said, \\"While the soundtrack of Enthiran has enough fodder to delight a connoisseur, it remains to be seen how much its sophistication will appeal to the masses, who are after all Rajinikanth's primary target.\\" Behindwoods reviewed the music saying, \\"Yes, it exasperates you when you listen for the first time. But as you listen again, you realize that though Rahman gives this album a crisp metallic touch in keeping with the theme of the story, he still remains faithful to his Carnatic roots in a touching way. Watch how cleverly he varies the feel of the normal duets and robo-based duets. The lyrics are interesting too. If the listener shakes off his conditioned thinking while listening to this album, he is in for a treat.\\" Pavithra Srinivasan of Rediff commented that, \\"Enthiran is, in fact, a perfect superstar album. Where the collection does manage to veer from the usual, Rahman has managed to add his own quirky, creative notes to the songs.\\" Hindi version The Hindi version received notably mixed responses, with most of the reviewers criticising Swanand Kirkire's lyrics. Bollywood Hungama rated the album 1.5 out of 5 saying, \\"Robot disappoints. While Rahman himself hasn't come up with anything exceptional, something which is expected from him film after film; it's the lyrics that are chief culprit here. It is clear that a lot has been lost in translation here, literally so, as the song dubbing Tamil to Hindi just doesn't work here.\\" Glamsham published a positive review saying, \\"Robot is stylishly packed sci-fi musical entertainer, exuding out multifaceted classy acts from the maestro. Its herculean effort to compile and compose a set of situational soundtracks with that extra trendy grace and poise but Robot delivers all with style, thanks to A.R Rahman's ever-reliable expertise.\\" Rediff rated the Hindi version 2.5 on 5 and commented that Robot is not Rahman's best, to say the least. The Times of India commented that \\"On the whole, the music of Robot does not appeal. They may suit the script of the sci-film, but the audio is not impressive.\\" Track listing = Tamil = = Telugu = = Hindi =  Album credits  =Backing vocals= Dr. Narayanan, Raqeeb Alam, R.

It is designated by Cadw as a Grade II* listed building, and is under the care of the Friends of Friendless Churches. It stands adjacent to a farmyard in the Lleyn Peninsula and is on the old pilgrims' route to Bardsey Island. History The church dates from the medieval period, with the fabric in the east end dating from the 15th century. It was much rebuilt in 1840, but rather than the Gothic-style restoration usual at the time, the interior retained its Georgian style. It was vested with the charity the Friends of Friendless Churches in 2009, who hold a 999-year lease with effect from 20 October 2009. Since then repairs have been undertaken, including the reintroduction of wooden tracery in the windows in its original form, designed by Graham Holland. Architecture St Mary's is constructed in stone with a slate roof. At the west end is a gabled single bellcote. The door is on the north side. In the north and south walls are two two-light windows with wooden Y-tracery. The east window is larger, also with two lights and tracery that is probably in concrete. There is no west window. In the interior, the walls are plastered and the roof trusses are whitewashed. The floor is paved with quarry tiles. The fittings date from the 19th century and are made in pine that has been painted and grained. They include box pews, open back pews, benches, and a three-decker pulpit. The pulpit is octagonal, with a single candle-holder and a reading desk. Above the pulpit is a sounding board, also octagonal, and decorated on its underside with an eight-ray sun pattern. The font is medieval and consists of a rough stone bowl on a whitewashed pier. The bell is dated 1894.

It is located within the Bled Derrag area in the corner between the forests of Chaoun and Boumedienne, separated from the high plateau by the Taguensa and Djebel Azzeba. The area is bordered by mountains or two sides and the steppe on the third. Boumediene is located to the north of Derrag (1,648 m), Chaoun to the west (1.804 m) and Jebel Azzeba (1,386 m) and Tagensa (1,710 m) to the north east. Located in the Ouarsenis mountain region, much of the land is sloped and hence unfavourable to mechanised farming and susceptible to erosion. Water sources in the area are limited (A√Æn Endis, the largest river, has a flow of 6 litres per second at low water). Drinking water is available in some areas, but tends to be calcareous. Other areas lack drinking water resources. History The region of Bled Derrag was attached to the mixed commune of Theniet El Had at the beginning of colonisation. It was created from the colonial village of Letourneux in 1891. This area then passed under the authority of the mixed-commune of Boghari until 1956, when it became a fully functioning commune separated from Siouf. In 1963, it was integrated into the newly created municipality of Aziz. The municipality was later revived under the name Derrag in 1984.

He was named by Forbes magazine in 2015 as one of five scientists in the world most likely to become the next Albert Einstein.Forbes: \\"The Next Einstein May Be A 27-Year-Old Iranian Woman\\"  Black holes as doorways  Pop≈Çawski's approach is based on the Einstein‚ÄìCartan theory of gravity which extends general relativity to matter with intrinsic angular momentum (spin). Spin in curved spacetime requires that the affine connection cannot be constrained to zero and its antisymmetric part, the torsion tensor, must be a variable in Hamilton's principle of stationary action which gives the field equations. Torsion gives the correct generalization of the conservation law for the total (orbital plus intrinsic) angular momentum to the presence of the gravitational field, but also modifies the Dirac equation for fermions. Gravitational effects of torsion on fermionic matter are significant at extremely high densities which exist inside black holes and at the beginning of the Universe. Pop≈Çawski theorizes that torsion manifests itself as a repulsive force which causes fermions to be spatially extended and prevents the formation of a gravitational singularity within the black hole's event horizon. Because of torsion, the collapsing matter on the other side of the horizon reaches an enormous but finite density, explodes and rebounds, forming an Einstein-Rosen bridge (wormhole) to a new, closed, expanding universe. Analogously, the Big Bang is replaced by the Big Bounce before which the Universe was the interior of a black hole. This scenario generates cosmic inflation, which explains why the present Universe at largest scales appears spatially flat, homogeneous and isotropic. It may explain the arrow of time, solve the black hole information paradox, and explain the nature of dark matter. Torsion may also be responsible for the observed asymmetry between matter and antimatter in the Universe. The rotation of a black hole could influence the spacetime on the other side of its event horizon and result in a preferred direction in the new universe. Pop≈Çawski suggests that the observed fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background might provide evidence for his hypothesis.  Education  Pop≈Çawski received his M.S. degree in astronomy from the University of Warsaw (1999), and his Ph.D. degree in physics from Indiana University (2004), where he later worked as a researcher and lecturer in physics. Since 2013, he has been a senior lecturer in the Department of Mathematics and Physics at the University of New Haven.

Since 1960 Mante had a great influence on the German color photography. He was in second generation a Bauhaus student and transformed the ideas of the famous masters of the Bauhaus into photography. His text books on composition and color design are known worldwide.  Artistic Work  Harald Mante received his early education at the Werkkunstschule Wiesbaden, where he took painting classes from Vincent Weber. There, he got first introduced to the ideas of the German ¬ªBauhaus¬´. In 1960 he purchased his first camera, financed by delivering newspapers. He successfully participated in several photography contests in Germany. Finally, in 1964, after a three-month trip to Ireland, he decided to turn professional. In the following years, leading magazines such as Stern, Twen, Bild der Zeit, and Epoca published his work. In 1969, he published his first books on \\"Composition and Color Design\\" which was based on the fundamental principles of color design developed by famous painters such as Kandinsky, Klee, and Itten. In 1971, Harald Mante began teaching at the Gesamthochschule Wuppertal, and went to Dortmund University of Applied Art and Sciences in 1973 where he held a teaching position as full Professor for \\"Free and Experimental photography\\". Mante was invited as visiting professor in 1978 from the University of Saskatchewan (Saskatoon, Canada) and in 1989 from the Rochester Institute of Technology and the Parsons School of Design New York City. He continued to work as a Photographer on a freelance basis throughout his academic career. In these years, his work revolved around themes like \\"space and time\\", \\"reflections\\", and \\"self- shadows\\" and he published numerous books and journal articles. In 1988, Harald Mante and Eva Witter started a major art project called \\"Bildr√§ume (Image spaces) ‚Äì Diaphane Metamorphosen von Schl√∂ssern in Europa\\" a black-and-white photographic work combining exterior and interior spaces of European castles on multiple exposures. In 1993, a second project \\"Weitsichten\\" (looking into the distance together) was initiated by the couple. In 2001, Harald Mante retired from his teaching position in Dortmund, but remained active, both as a fine art photographer and as an educator, teaching classes at the \\"Altenakademie Dortmund\\" and at the \\"European Art Academy\\" in Trier, as well as numerous workshops and seminars throughout the year.

The taxon Pupilla pratensis has long been neglected in the malacological literature, or considered a morphologically weakly defined ecophenotype ‚Äì found in wet, calcareous habitats ‚Äì of the variable Pupilla muscorum. The form, however, represents a distinct species, which has recently been shown in a study combining morphological, ecological and molecular data by von Proschwitz et al. (2007, 2009).von Proschwitz T., Schander C., Jueg U. & Thorkildsen S. (2007). \\"Pupilla pratensis (Clessin, 1871) a distinct species in the form group of Pupilla muscorum (Linnaeus, 1758) (Gastropoda, Pulmonata, Pupillidae)\\". In: Jordanes K., Van Houtte N., Van Goethem J. & Backeljau T. (eds). World Congress of Malacology Antwerp, Belgium 15‚Äì20 July 2007. Abstracts. pp. 235-236. Pupilla pratensis was misidentified as either Pupilla muscorum or Pupilla alpicola before 2009. However, based on some 2012 preliminary molecular analyses, it seems that Pupilla pratensis and Pupilla alpicola are geographical subspecies of a single, more widely distributed species.  Description  The shell of this species is dark to brown, translucent and thin, with fine and distinct growth lines, 6-7.5 whorls with deep suture, outline elongate and broad, aperture rounded with weakly developed lip, usually toothless, or with weak parietal and occasionally a palatal tooth, sometimes with weak cervical callus. The height of the shell is 3.5-4.5 mm. The width of the shell is 1.85-2.05 mm. Pupilla pratensis differs from Pupilla muscorum, with which it often lives sympatrically, in its thinner, larger and broader shell, darker and less variable colour and weaker apertural lip. The shell of Pupilla pratensis is larger ‚Äì especially in diameter (1.86‚Äì2.06 mm), but often also in height (3.48‚Äì4.54 mm) ‚Äì and the number of whorls (6.0‚Äì7.5) is usually greater compared to that of Pupila muscorum. The form is cylindrical in both species, but in Pupilla muscorum the last whorls converge rather smoothly towards the apex; in Pupilla pratensis the convergence is somewhat more abrupt, giving the apex a blunt appearance. The whorls are usually more vaulted in Pupilla pratensis, and the suture is somewhat deeper. The colour of the shell varies from brown to brown-grey in both species, but Pupilla pratensis is often more of a darkish chestnut brown. In Pupilla muscorum the colour is more variable, ranging from reddish brown to horny grey. The shell surface is nearly smooth in both species. It appears thinner in Pupilla pratensis, in which it is sometimes slightly translucent. The growth-lines are very fine in Pupilla muscorum and somewhat coarser in Pupilla pratensis. The apertural lip is often rather weakly developed in Pupilla pratensis in contrast to Pupilla muscorum, in which it is thicker and more pronounced. The apertural teeth are more weakly developed in Pupilla pratensis, and always arise directly from the apertural walls, never from a callus (as is sometimes the case in Pupilla muscorum). A weakly developed parietal tooth is rather frequently present, often together with a very weak, simply indicated palatal, but the mouth is often completely toothless. It should be remarked, that in some samples from western and northern Norway some specimens of Pupilla muscorum seem to be larger than in Swedish and German populations, and hence in size close to Pupilla pratensis ‚Äì this requires further studies. Distribution Due to the fact that Pupilla pratensis has been overlooked, its distribution is only fragmentarily known. A wide, but scattered distribution, mainly in calcareous areas in Central, Northern and Western Europe is to be expected. So far, scattered localities are, known from Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Slovakia and Great Britain. In Europe, Pupilla pratensis seems to have a Northern Atlantic distribution, which does not overlap with the distribution of Pupilla alpicola which in Europe is mainly limited to the Alps and Carpathians. It occurs in the following countries: * Norway: Hedmark County, Oppland County, Nordland County In Norway Pupilla pratensis has been found in three isolated sites in the SE part of the country (Hedmark and Oppland counties) and two somewhat more to the north, in Nordland County. * Sweden - In Sweden it is locally not uncommon in suitable habitats in calcareous districts throughout the country, from Sk√•ne in the south to Lapland in the north. * Denmark * Ireland * Scotland, Great Britain - found in 2013Killeen I.

The type locality is Dinkelscherben near Augsburg, Bavaria, Germany. Pupilla pratensis probably also occurs in Austria, Switzerland, Hungary and England.  Ecology  Pupilla pratensis is typical habitat specialist. It is a pronounced hygrophilous species, inhabiting open, richer, often calcareous moist and wetland habitats. In Scandinavia it occurs in calcareous fens and meadows. The character of the sites in SE Norway (calcareous fen, sloping wetlands with springs) is in good accordance with this and with the habitats of Pupilla pratensis in Sweden; where it occurs as a typical species of open calcareous fens or wet, moist calcareous meadows. In Nordland County, Norway the habitats are of a different type, calcareous, rocky slopes close to the sea. Probably the wet climate in the western, coastal Norway makes it possible for the species to widen its ecological occurrence. Unfortunately, this habitat type, treeless calcareous fens, is very rare, mostly isolated and nowadays highly threatened by draining and successional changes after the cessation of regular mowing and grazing. Therefore, the records are very important for nature conservation and much attention should be paid to extant populations. The species‚Äô ecology is similar to that of Pupilla alpicola.

Named after the Coree tribe, they extend from Ocracoke Inlet to Cape Lookout, and consist of two low-relief narrow islands, North Core Banks and South Core Banks, and, since September 2011, two smaller islands. New Drum Inlet, Old Drum Inlet and Ophelia Inlet now separate the islands. The Core Banks are now uninhabited. However, Portsmouth, at the north end of the North Core Banks, was once a substantial port, and Cape Lookout Village, about one and half miles south of the Cape Lookout Lighthouse, contains the historic Lookout Life-Saving Station, a U.S. Coast Guard Station, and several island homes. Access Islands can be reached by two vehicle ferries. One ferry crosses Core Sound from Atlantic to North Core Banks, and another crosses the sound from Davis to South Core Banks. There are no roads on the islands: vehicles use the beach and four wheel drive tracks. Passenger ferries also take tourists from Harkers Island to the Cape Lookout area at the south end of South Core Banks.Cape Lookout National Seashore: Ferry Services Portsmouth Island, on which Portsmouth Village stands, is a tidal island accessible from North Core Banks at most states of the tide. History The Cape Lookout Coast Guard Station, Cape Lookout Light Station, and Cape Lookout Village Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Geography  John White showing Core Banks. The geography of the Core Banks has changed since the mid 19th century. At that time South Core Banks was connected to the Shackleford Banks. Over the years inlets have closed and opened in the barrier islands. From north to south these inlets have been Whalebone Inlet, now closed, which separated Portsmouth Island from the Core Banks, Swash Inlet (closed), Old Drum Inlet (closed in 1971 and reopened by Hurricane Irene in 2011), New Drum Inlet (opened by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1971), Ophelia Inlet (opened by Hurricane Ophelia in 2005 page 12), Cedar Inlet (closed) and Barden Inlet (opened by a hurricane in 1933, separating Shackleford Banks from South Core Banks).Barrier Island Ecology of Cape Lookout National Seashore, NPS Scientific Monograph No.9, Chapter 3 From northeast to southwest, the islands are located in the Townships of Portsmouth, Atlantic, Sea Level, Stacy, Davis, Smyrna, and Harkers Island, all in Carteret County. Climate According to the Trewartha climate classification system, Core Banks, North Carolina has a humid subtropical climate with hot and humid summers, cool winters and year-around precipitation (Cfak). Cfak climates are characterized by all months having an average mean temperature > 32.0 ¬∞F (> 0.0 ¬∞C), at least eight months with an average mean temperature ‚â• 50.0 ¬∞F (‚â• 10.0 ¬∞C), at least one month with an average mean temperature ‚â• 71.6 ¬∞F (‚â• 22.0 ¬∞C) and no significant precipitation difference between seasons. During the summer months in Core Banks, a cooling afternoon sea breeze is present on most days, but episodes of extreme heat and humidity can occur with heat index values ‚â• 100 ¬∞F (‚â• 38 ¬∞C). Core Banks is prone to hurricane strikes, particularly during the Atlantic hurricane season which extends from June 1 through November 30, sharply peaking from late August through September. During the winter months, episodes of cold and wind can occur with wind chill values < 10 ¬∞F (< -12 ¬∞C). The plant hardiness zone in Core Banks is 8b with an average annual extreme minimum air temperature of 15.3 ¬∞F (-9.3 ¬∞C). The average seasonal (Dec-Mar) snowfall total is < 2 inches (< 5 cm), and the average annual peak in nor'easter activity is in February. Ecology According to the A. W.

According to placenames, it was a Nakh language, akin to the language of the historical Malkh nation, as well as modern Chechen, Ingush and Batsbi, and possibly others.Jaimoukha, Amjad. The Chechens: A Handbook. Routledge Curzon: Oxon, 2005. Examples of placenames The capital of the √àrs (which was later turned into a fortress by Urartu) was called √àribuni (later turned into and used as a fortress by the Urartian state). Amjad Jaimoukha argued that \\"buni\\" is from a Nakh root, meaning shelter or home (giving rise to the modern Chechen word bun, a cabin, or small house). According to him, Erebuni meant \\"the home of the √àrs\\". It corresponds to modern YerevanSee However, this theory is not accepted by mainstream linguists and is considered problematic, namely because Chechen \\"bun\\" initially derives from the Armenian word buyn (’¢’∏÷Ç’µ’∂) for \\"nest\\" or \\"lair\\", from Proto-Indo-European *b ∞euH-no-, from *b ∞euH- (‚Äúto be; to grow‚Äù).

In the Georgian Chronicles, Leonti Mroveli refers to Lake Sevan as \\"Lake Ereta\\". The name of the Arax is also attributed to the √àrs. It is also called the Yeraskhi. The Armenian name is \\"Yeraskhadzor\\" (which Jaimoukha identifies as √àr + khi a Nakh water body suffix + Armenian dzor gorge). However, according to Urartologist Paul Zimansky, Hurro-Urartian -khi is a plural/tribal denotation and not a hydronym, rendering Jaimoukha's theory incorrect.

(USACMH) during World War II after the German U-boat attacks of 1942 on the Caribbean Basin in conjunction to Operation Z. Early years During the early years, Puerto Rico played a leading role as the operations center in the Antilles Screen against German U-boats, whose attacks reached an alarming peak in 1942 with the sinking of 336 ships in the Caribbean area. Ships sailing from South American ports carried such strategic products as gasoline, oil derivatives, and bauxite for aluminum production, and their losses were serious. Puerto Rico provided support for U.S. naval forces charged with controlling the Caribbean; it served as a base for air protection for ships, other outposts in the region, and the approaches to the Panama Canal; and it was an important link in the transport and ferrying route for aircraft, personnel, and cargo going to Africa and Middle East. On May 1942, U-boats sunk 56 ships totaling more than 248,000 tons of shipment in the space of 4 months all throughout the Caribbean Sea Frontier west of the shipping control line. By the middle of the month, 22% of the bauxite fleet had been destroyed, 20% of the ships in the Puerto Rican run had been lost, and of 74 vessels allocated to the Army for the month of 17 July had already been sunk.B.d.U. War Logs, 1 Jan 42 ‚Äì 30 Jun 42; Memo, Gen Marshall for Admiral King, 19 Jun 42, quoted in Ernest J. King and Walter M. Whitehill, Fleet Admiral King: A Naval Record (New York: W. W. Norton and Company, Inc., 1952) p. 455; CDC Monograph, Antisubmarine Activities in the Caribbean Defense Command 1941-46, pp. 37-43, 52 Formation Anxious at the beginning of World War II to avoid raising fears of the U.S. expansion in the hemisphere through the creation of military bases in Latin America, President Roosevelt concentrated instead on strengthening defenses at both ends of the U.S. Canal Zone, and establishing an air base and other military installations on the island of Puerto Rico, the major U.S. territory in the Caribbean Basin. In the President's opinion, expressed in a bill that failed to pass in the U.S. Senate in 1943, the chain of islands running in a great arc from New Orleans to the shoulder of South America, enclosing the Caribbean Basin, formed a vast natural shield for the Panama Canal, suited in distance and conformation to the uses of the military plane. And of this island shield, Puerto Rico is the center. Order 10 General Order No. 10 read: > The Headland Castle at Old San Juan will be named Fort Brooke in memory of > United States Army Major General John Rutter Brooke from Pennsylvania, > better known as \\"John Ruller\\" during the American Civil War between 1861 and > 1865 and the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War of 1898. Description Fort Brooke was located in Fort San Felipe del Morro, a Spanish colonial fort. It consisted of offices for technicians, observers, military staff and police, music band members, motor pool workers and medical personnel. Officers' quarters were constructed along the road leading to the Castle surrounded by an Officers' Club, one swimming pool, the Bachelor Officers' Quarters (BOQ) and one outdoor cinema on top of a golf course. Observation posts, communications centers and underground installations were also added in the sector. Due to declining maritime losses in the Atlantic as the war progressed, the base saw little action in the later war years, and became home to a number of sporting and leisure activities. Transformation into a hospital On 31 August 1944, the United States Department of War issued General Order No. 71 which transformed the Ballaj√° station into the Fort Brooke Hospital installation. Armed Forces Examination and Induction Station Puerto Ricans drafted to the United States Armed Forces during the Korean War and the Vietnam War reported to the Armed Forces Examination and Induction Station (AFEIS) at Fort Brooke for screens and processes before being sent to active duty. In 1970 Armed Forces Examination and Induction Station at Fort Brooke was redesignated as the Armed Forces Examining and Entrance Station. In 1978 the station moved to a new facility in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico near the Fort Buchanan Army base and became a Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS). On January 1, 1982 the center was redesignated as MEPS San Juan. In 2013 the Military Entrance Processing Station moved to a new location at Millennium Park Plaza in Guaynabo.

It lies in the Gulf of Arzew, with a harbor protected by two rocky capes. =Dunes= Macta dunes 1975. The area of coastal dunes is limited: to the north by the sea; To the east by the cliff and hill of the marabout of Sidi Mansour; To the south by the national road from Oran to Mostaganem to the bridge of the Macta, then by the river La Macta; To the west by the mouth of this river \\"(Simonneau and Santa, 1951). This mouth has since been clogged and a new junction with the sea was made through the dune cordon near the bridge of La Macta. \\"The area of this area is about 180 ha. The vegetation is characterized mainly by the size of the stands of the Ocrea on the coastal dunes and by the extreme variety of the flora on the right bank of the river La Macta. The halophilic and heliophilic species grow there with the littoral species \\"(Simonneau and Santa, 1951). As the authors have already pointed out, the forest horizon is severely degraded east of these dunes (sparse, mutilated, ...). In October 1983, scientists from the National Agronomic Institute (Algeria), the universities of Li√®ge, Gembloux (Belgium), Nijmegen (Holland), and the Royal Institute of Natural Sciences of Belgium contacted, The Algerian authorities (in particular the Wali of the Wilaya of Mostaganem). Name Called \\"Port of the Pilgrims\\" by the Algerians, it is possible that the French name of \\"Port aux Poules\\" comes from an erroneous translation due to the phonetic and graphic similarity in Arabic of the words \\"pilgrims\\" (ÿ£ŸÑÿ≠ÿ¨ÿßÿ¨), \\"al-hajƒÅj\\" and \\"chickens\\" (ÿßŸÑÿØÿ¨ÿßÿ¨) \\"ad-dajƒÅj\\". Another hypothesis is an allusion to chickens frequenting the Macta River, behind the dunes of Marsat El Hadjadj. As a third hypothesis, it could simply come from the Roman name of the ancient port which occupied the gulf, whose name was Paulus, named after a high dignitary of the Roman Empire. History =Modern History= After the decree of the National Assembly of 19 September 1848 establishing agricultural colonies in Algeria, the convoy of volunteers No. 2 arriving at Arzew on 2 November 1848 was destined for the center of Saint Leu and its annexes, of which Port To the Chickens. When in 1853, the agricultural colony of Saint Leu passes under civil administration, Port aux Poules is still attached to it. In 1854, the prefect of Oran commissioned the study of the establishment of a population center in the place called Porto Paulo, near the Macta bridge. The site already had a few European families, was a staging and bivouac place used by the military, was frequented by many fishermen and was already an active and attractive shopping center. The project was finally adopted in 1877, but it will take time to materialize on the ground. In 1879, Saint Leu was erected as a full-function commune, but Port aux Poules remained attached to it. Later from the 1930s, most of the inhabitants of the neighboring village of Bethioua settled in Port aux Choules because of the development of oil refineries along the beach. It was a very ancient dwelling site, of which many Roman ruins are still in excellent state of conservation. The region of Bethioua is known for its population of Berber origin which bears the name of the place. The official construction of the village according to the well-ordered rectangular plans of the time dates back to 1883, but will soon overflow its original framework.

The ship was excavated and its timber immersed in preservation tanks at the University of Haifa, undergoing a seven-year process of impregnation by heated polyethylene glycol (PEG). In March 1999, the boat was reassembled and transferred to a dedicated wing built at the Hecht Museum, on the grounds of the university. The boat has provided researchers with insights into ancient methods of shipbuilding and the evolution of anchors. Discovery and excavation In the autumn of 1985, Ami Eshel, a member of Ma'agan Michael, discovered the wreck while diving off the coast of the kibbutz, 35 km south of Haifa. 75 metres off the coast Eshel spotted rocks uncharacteristic of the Levantine coast next to pieces of wood and pottery sherds, and alerted the Israel Antiquities Authority and the Centre for Maritime Studies at the University of Haifa. Preliminary exploration of the wreck revealed pottery dating the ship to the 5th century BC as well as a great deal of submerged wood in an excellent state of preservation, encouraging further exploration. In 1987 a University of Haifa team led by Elisha Linder received a permit to excavate the site. They enlisted the help of Jay Rosloff, a hull specialist from Institute of Nautical Archaeology at Texas A&M; University. As the boat lay in shallow waters, deep, excavators had to deal with difficult working conditions caused by the surge. Sand continuously drifted into the excavation trench and water clarity was poor. A horseshoe trench dredged around the site did little to ameliorate these problems, and conditions were seldom safe enough for both the crew and the unearthed wood. In the three seasons of work, totalling 160 days, only 32 days were actually spent excavating the ship and its contents. The small size of the site meant that no more than three pairs of divers could work on the ship at any one time. Violin-shaped box found on the boat The excavators first removed the ship's ballast, pulling the stones to shore on a sled tied to a van. The ballast was revealed to be composed of the three lithological groups: metamorphic, magmatic and sedimentary rock. The first, composing 65 percent of the total, was blueschist apparently originating from Euboea. Gabbro rocks found were revealed to originate in the Kouris River of southern Cyprus. Most of the boat was buried deep enough in the sand to be isolated from the aerobic conditions that would have degraded the wood and the seawater and its corrosive effect on metals. It was subsequently superbly preserved. Exploration started at the stern and moved forward. Only a few feet of the hull were excavated, mapped and photographed at a time, to prevent wave damage to exposed sections. Several of the planks had to be sawed or broken for removal, transportation and conservation, especially as prolonged underwater exposure might have caused significant damage. The preserved hull is 37 feet (11.25 metres) long and 13.1 feet (4 metres) wide, with an estimated displacement weight of 20 tons, over 12 of which was ballast. The keel consists of a single timber 25 feet (8.5 metres) long, 4.5 inches (11 cm) wide and 6.25 inches (16 cm) high. The hull was constructed primarily of Aleppo pine, except for the tenons and the false keel which were made of oak. The wood shows no sign of shipworm damage nor the wear characteristic of lengthy use, leading the excavators to believe the ship may have sunk on its maiden voyage or not long afterwards. Artifacts recovered from the wreck include an olivewood box in the shape of a heart or leaf and with a swivel top and a pair of violin-shaped boxes. All were probably used for cosmetics or jewelry. Also found were a collection of woodworking tools, a large number of treenails and tenons, plus a whetstone. Seventy pottery vessels, many of them complete, were found in the wreck. These include jugs, plates, lamps, a cooking pot, a water jar, several storage jars, decorated amphorae, miniature juglets and black glazed ware. Most are attributed to Cyprus, but some may have originated in Greece or the Palestinian coast.Lyon, 1993. Also located among the wreck were remnants of food, including grape, fig, olive and barley. These appear to originate in the eastern Mediterranean, most likely southwest Turkey and adjacent islands, and indicate that the boat sank during the summer. Other organic material includes a woven basket and a large amount of rope. The copper nails used in construction of the ship were revealed to be made of copper mined in northwest Cyprus. Ship anchor Dating from a time of peak Phoenician maritime activity, the boat was initially thought to be Phoenician.Linder, 1992. In view of its construction and contents it was later deemed most likely to be Cypriot, perhaps related to a Cypriot centre at nearby Dor. =Anchor= The ship's one-armed anchor, made from oak and with a lead-filled stock, was discovered off the ship's starboard bow, with the remains of rope still attached. The anchor's body, from head through shank to arm, was carved from a single timber, as was the stock. The wood used in its construction was identical to the one used on the ship's tenons, suggesting it was made by the same carpenters or shipwrights as the boat itself. A tooth made of copper had almost entirely corroded away.Rosloff, 1991. Significance The discovery of the ship provided researchers with insights into the development of ancient shipbuilding. The ship displays many similarities to other ancient ships such as the Kyrenia ship, but also important differences in size, construction methods and material, and ballast. Beside offering clues to the evolution of anchors, the Ma'agan Michael anchor is also the first complete one-armed ancient wooden anchor ever discovered. Although absent from iconographic and literary source, maritime archaeologist Gerhard K√§pitan had already suggested their existence in the 1970s. The discovery not only confirmed this variety existed but that it was neither crude nor restricted to small craft. Preservation and display Ship, anchor and ballast on display All finds and ship components retrieved from the sea were immediately placed in fresh-water tanks. From there the timber was transferred to permanent preservation tanks in the University of Haifa, where the timber went through a seven-year process of impregnation by heated polyethylene glycol (PEG) to enhance dimensional stability by replacing the water in the cells.Shalev et al, 1999. Completed in 1996, the wood was then left to season until March 1999, when it was transferred to a dedicated wing built at the Hecht Museum, on the university grounds. The reassembled boat is currently on display along with selected finds including the anchor, ropes, woodworking tools, ornamental wooden boxes and pottery from the wreck. Replica The replica of the old ship at the Israel Shipyards is lifted before it is lowered into the water On March 17, a replica of the boat was launch, by the University of Haifa and the Israel Antiquities Authority, at Haifa Bay.

Technology  = Light coding technology = PrimeSense's depth acquisition was enabled by \\"light coding\\" technology. The process coded the scene with near-IR light, light that returns distorted depending upon where things are (Structured light). The solution then used a standard off-the-shelf CMOS image sensor to read the coded light back from the scene using various algorithms to triangulate and extract the 3D data. The product analysed scenery in 3 dimensions with software, so that devices could interact with users. = Products =  PrimeSense system on a chip (SoC)  The CMOS image sensor worked with the visible video sensor to enable the depth map provided by PrimeSense SoC's Carmine (PS1080) and Capri (PS1200) to be merged with the color image. The SoCs performed a registration process so the color image (RGB) and depth (D) information was aligned properly. The light coding infrared patterns were deciphered in order to produce a VGA size depth image of a scene. It delivered visible video, depth, and audio information in a synchronized fashion via the USB 2.0 interface. The SoC had minimal CPU requirements as all depth acquisition algorithms ran on the SoC itself.  PrimeSense sensors  * Carmine 1.08 * Carmine 1.09 (short range) * Capri 1.25 (embedded) PrimeSense embedded its technology in its own sensors, the Carmine 1.08 and Carmine 1.09. Capri 1.25, touted by the company as the world's smallest 3D sensor, debuted at International CES 2013.  PrimeSense middleware  PrimeSense developed NiTE middleware which analyzed the data from hardware and modules for OpenNI providing gesture and skeleton tracking. They were released only as binaries. According to the NiTE LinkedIn page: \\"Including computer vision algorithims, NiTE identifies users and tracks their movements, and provides the framework API for implementing natural- interaction UI controls based on gestures.\\" The system could then interpret specific gestures, making completely hands-free control of electronic devices a reality.

He worked in many genres including genre scenes of interiors with merry companies and gallery paintings, history painting, still life and portraiture.Charles Emmanuel Biset at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Life Charles Emmanuel Biset was born on 26 December 1633 in Mechelen as Karel Emmanuel Biset. He was the son of the decorative painter Joris Biset who had trained under Michiel Coxie III, a grandson of the great Renaissance painter Michiel Coxie. Charles Emmanuel Biset likely trained under his father. Portrait of a Musician He worked in Mechelen from about 1640 until the early or mid-1650s. He was subsequently active in Paris where he is presumed to have worked for the court. Thereafter he is recorded for a while in Brussels before moving to Antwerp. Here he was active from 1661 to 1687. He became a master in Antwerp's Guild of Saint Luke in 1662 and was its dean in 1674. He was also appointed a director of the Academy of Antwerp.Ad. Siret, BISET, Charles-Emmanuel in: Biographie nationale de Belgique, Volume 2, pp. 439‚Äì440 He married in 1662 with the painter Maria van Uden who was the daughter of the landscape painter Lucas van Uden. After her death in 1665, he began a relationship with her sister Anna. In 1670 he married Anna Cleymans. Their children were the painters Jan Andreas (also called Jan Baptist) and Jan Karel Biset. He enjoyed the patronage of Juan Domingo de Zu√±iga y Fonseca, Count of Monterrey, and later the Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands for whom he may have worked on a quasi-exclusive basis for a while. In 1687 he is recorded in Breda. It is possible he stayed there for the rest of his life while visiting Antwerp occasionally. The last record of his life dates to 28 September 1693 when he was in Antwerp. The place and date of his death are not clear but he is believed to have died between 28 September 1693 and 1713. He was the master of his nephew Jan Anthonie Coxie, who was the son of his sister Joanna and fellow Mechelen painter Jan Coxie.Jan Anthonie Coxie at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Biset was highly regarded as an artist in his time as is attested by the fact that both the early Flemish biographer Cornelis de Bie and the Dutch biographer Jacob Campo Weyerman included him in their artist biographies. Work =General= The Legend of William Tell shown to the Antwerp Schutterij of St Sebastian Biset was a very versatile artist and the range of his work is very diverse: he painted genre scenes with merry companies, gallery paintings, portraits, history paintings and still lifes. Because of this diversity and the specific genres and themes he worked in, it is believed he may have received some training from Gonzales Coques who also painted in such diverse areas. Biset is regarded by some art historians as a follower of Coques.Peter C. Sutton, The Age of Rubens, Museum of Fine Arts, 1993, p. 391 In fact, some works now ascribed to Biset were formerly attributed to Coques. This is for instance the case with the composition A Family Seated at a Table in an Elegant Garden Exterior (Sotheby's, 6 December 2006 in New York, lot 7), which was originally regarded as a collaboration between Gonzales Coques and some specialist artists such as Peeter Gijsels and Wilhelm Schubert van Ehrenberg but is regarded by the RKD specialists as entirely by Biset‚Äôs hand.Charles Emmanuel Biset, Portret van een familie op een terras voor een zuilenportico, 1670-1675 at the Netherlands Institute for Art History As was the custom in Antwerp in the 17th century Biset regularly collaborated with other painters who were specialists in a particular genre. Collaborations with the landscape painters Philips Augustijn Immenraet and Cornelis Huysmans and the architecture painter Wilhelm Schubert van Ehrenberg are recorded. =Portraits= Biset painted individual as well as family and group portraits, including merry companies. The Hermitage collection holds a beautiful Portrait of a Musician. It depicts a musician standing next to a column with some sheet music and a theorbo and viola da gamba resting against the column. The figure dressed in black is set off against the velvet curtain behind him. A stool placed next to the musician indicates that he has just finished or is about to commence a musical performance.Charles Emmanuel Biset, Portrait of a Musician at the Netherlands Institute for Art History A Family Seated at a Table in an Elegant Garden Exterior The headmen of the Antwerp schutterij De Oude Voetboog are known to have ordered a group portrait from Biset.Bert Timmermans, Patronen van patronage in het zeventiende-eeuwse Antwerpen: een elite als actor binnen een kunstwereld, Amsterdam University Press, 2008, p. 245 It is likely that this work is the large composition referred to as The Legend of William Tell shown to the Antwerp Schutterij of St Sebastian. This work, which is now in the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, was made for the hall of the Antwerp schutterij pursuant to a contract made before a notary on 28 April 1672. The work is a collaboration with Philips Augustijn Immenraet and Wilhelm Schubert van Ehrenberg.De legende van Willem Tell vertoond aan het Antwerps Sint-Sebastiaansgild at the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium The architecture is painted by Wilhelm Schubert van Ehrenberg and the landscape by Philips Augustijn Immenraet and the rest by Charles Emmanuel Biset. The composition uses the tale of William Tell to create a group portrait of the leading members of the schutterij.The Legend of William Tell shown to the Antwerp Schutterij of St Sebastian at Balat The Portrait of a family in an interior (Sold at Christie's on 19 April 2007 in New York, lot 31) was originally attributed to Gerard Pietersz van Zijl but is now attributed to Biset.Charles Emmanuel Biset, Portrait of a family in an interior at the Netherlands Institute for Art History This composition follows the model of the merry companies with its informal setting which includes children and musicians. A less informal rendering of the same subject is in the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Nantes.Charles Emmanuel Biset (Attr.), Portrait of a family in an interior at the Netherlands Institute for Art History =Genre scenes= Genre subjects involving indoor scenes of playing persons were quite popular in Flemish and Dutch painting in the 17th century and in particular among the so-called Caravaggists. Biset painted similar genre scenes an example of which is his composition the Tric-trac players (Statens Museum for Kunst). Tric-trac players The composition shows an interior with two standing men playing tric-trac and three onlookers. One of the onlookers is engaged in a lively exchange with a maid who is handing him a glass of wine. A young male servant is pouring drinks for the company at a table on which also food is placed including oysters, a few of which have fallen on the floor. The overall setting seems to point to a company that is actively enjoying itself but may be on the verge of losing control. =Gallery paintings= Biset worked also in the genre of the 'gallery paintings'. The 'gallery paintings' genre is native to Antwerp where Frans Francken the Younger and Jan Brueghel the Elder were the first artists to create paintings of art and curiosity collections in the 1620s.Susan Merriam, Seventeenth Century Flemish Garland Paintings. Still Life, Vision and the Devotional Image, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2012 Gallery paintings depict large rooms in which many paintings and other precious items are displayed in elegant surroundings. The earliest works in this genre depicted art objects together with other items such as scientific instruments or peculiar natural specimens. The genre became immediately quite popular and was followed by other artists such as Jan Brueghel the Younger, Cornelis de Baellieur, Hans Jordaens, David Teniers the Younger, Gillis van Tilborch and Hieronymus Janssens. The art galleries depicted were either real galleries or imaginary galleries, sometimes with allegorical figures.Marr, Alexander (2010) 'The Flemish 'Pictures of Collections' Genre: An Overview', Intellectual History Review, 20: 1, 5‚Äì25 Interior of an Imaginary Picture Gallery An example of Biset's work in this genre is the Interior of an Imaginary Picture Gallery (Alte Pinakothek, Munich) dated to 1666. This composition falls into the category of allegorical picture galleries, which can be considered a sub-category of the imaginary art gallery type. This composition depicts a large imaginary gallery in which are present a number of persons admiring and scrutinizing artworks and, on the right hand side, figures representing gods and allegorical figures. Wilhelm Schubert van Ehrenberg painted the architecture as well as the ceiling (which is made up of copies of Rubens' works for the Carolus Borromeuskerk in Antwerp) (later destroyed in a fire). The figures are believed to be by Charles Emmanuel Biset. The painting is a collaboration with each of the individual painters whose work is depicted in the painting and have signed their own work: Theodoor Boeyermans (Daughters of Cecrops and Erychtonius), Pieter Boel (Animal Piece), Jan Cossiers (Diana and Actaeon), Cornelis de Heem (Fruit Still Life), Robert van den Hoecke (Winter Landscape), Philips Augustijn Immenraet (Italianate Landscape), Jacob Jordaens (Gyges and Kandaules and Allegory of Painting), Pieter Thijs (Adoration of the Shepherds), Lucas van Uden (Landscape) and the monogrammists missed PB (Fish Still Life) and PVI or PVH (Satyr and Nymph).Interior of an Imaginary Picture Gallery at the Netherlands Institute for Art History This type of painting can be regarded as a carefully crafted advertisement of the present talent and past legacy of the Antwerp school of painting.Nadia Sera Baadj, Monstrous creatures and diverse strange things\\": The Curious Art of Jan van Kessel the Elder (16261679), A dissertation submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (History of Art) in The University of Michigan, 2012 =Still lifes= Still life with books and a skull A number of still lifes with books are attributed to Biset. These still lifes stand in a tradition of vanitas still lifes with books that was popular in Flemish and Dutch still life painting in the 17th century. An example is the Still life with books and a skull (Sold at Alain Truong, 18 December 2008 in Paris). The composition depicts a table on which rest a number of writing implements, some sealed letters and old books. On top of one book which is opened and appears to be handwritten rests a human skull. The message of the work appears to be that human endeavours as expressed in personal writings are futile as death is the ultimate outcome. =Book illustrations= Biset provided some designs for illustrations for a number of publications in Antwerp. This includes the book on mushrooms by the priest Franciscus van Sterbeeck entitled Theatrum fungorum oft het toneel der campernoelien ... vergaedert ende beschreven door Franciscus van Sterbeeck, which was published by Joseph Jacobs in Antwerp in 1675 and by the same author and publisher the Citricultura oft Regeringhe der uythemsche boomen te weten oranien, citroenen, limoenen, granaten, laurieren en andere on the cultivation of non-native trees, published in 1682 in Antwerp.Theatrum fungorum oft het toneel der campernoelien ... vergaedert ende beschreven door Franciscus van Sterbeeck at Flandrica.be Citricultura oft Regeringhe der uythemsche boomen te weten oranien, citroenen, limoenen, granaten, laurieren en andere at Flandrica.be References External links * Category:Flemish Baroque painters Category:Flemish history painters Category:Flemish genre painters Category:Flemish still life painters Category:Members of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke Category:People from Mechelen Category:Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp) faculty Category:1633 births Category:1690s deaths ","title":"Charles Emmanuel Biset"},{"id":"28202006","text":"A√Øn Babouche is a town and commune in Oum El Bouaghi Province, Algeria.

Short second generation reads have also been used to correct errors that exist in the long third generation reads. In bioinformatics, hybrid genome assembly refers to utilizing various sequencing technologies to achieve the task of assembling a genome from fragmented, sequenced DNA resulting from shotgun sequencing. Genome assembly presents one of the most challenging tasks in genome sequencing as most modern DNA sequencing technologies can only produce reads that are, on average, 25-300 base pairs in length.Pop, M. (2009). Genome assembly reborn: recent computational challenges. Brief Bioinform, 10(4), 354-366. doi: 10.1093/bib/bbp026.

This assembly is computationally difficult and has some inherent challenges, one of these challenges being that genomes often contain complex tandem repeats of sequences that can be thousands of base pairs in length.Alkan, C., Sajjadian, S., & Eichler, E. (2011). Limitations of next-generation genome sequence assembly. Nature Methods, 8. These repeats can be long enough that second generation sequencing reads are not long enough to bridge the repeat, and, as such, determining the location of each repeat in the genome can be difficult.Koren, S., Harhay, G., Smith, P., Bono, J., Harhay, D., Mcvey, S., . . . Phillippy, A. (2013). Reducing assembly complexity of microbial genomes with single-molecule sequencing. Genome Biology. Resolving these tandem repeats can be accomplished by utilizing long third generation sequencing reads, such as those obtained using the PacBio RS DNA sequencer. These sequences are, on average, 10,000-15,000 base pairs in length and are long enough to span most repeated regions.http://blog.pacificbiosciences.com/2014/10/new-chemistry-boosts- average-read.html Using a hybrid approach to this process can increase the fidelity of assembling tandem repeats by being able to accurately place them along a linear scaffold and make the process more computationally efficient. Genome Assembly =Classical Genome Assembly= The term genome assembly refers to the process of taking a large number of DNA fragments that are generated during shotgun sequencing and assembling them into the correct order such as to reconstruct the original genome.Motahari, A.

The scaffolding approach can be useful if the genome of a similar organism has been previously sequenced. This process involves assembling the genome of interest by comparing it to a known genome or scaffold. De novo genome assembly is used when the genome to be assembled is not similar to any other organisms whose genomes have been previously sequenced. This process is carried out by assembling single reads into contiguous sequences (contigs) which are then extended in the 3‚Äô and 5‚Äô directions by overlapping other sequences. The latter is preferred because it allows for the conservation of more sequences.Cerdeira, L. T., Carneiro, A. R., Ramos, R. T. J., de Almeida, S. S., D'Afonseca, V., Schneider, M. P. C., . . . Silva, A. (2011). Rapid hybrid de novo assembly of a microbial genome using only short reads: Corynebacterium pseudo tuberculosis I19 as a case study. Journal of Microbiological Methods, 86(2), 218-223. doi: 10.1016/j.mimet.2011.05.008. The de novo assembly of DNA sequences is a very computationally challenging process and can fall into the NP-hard class of problems if the Hamiltonian-cycle approach is used. This is because millions of sequences must be assembled to reconstruct a genome. Within genomes, there are often tandem repeats of DNA segments that can be thousands of base pairs in length, which can cause problems during assembly. Although next generation sequencing technology is now capable of producing millions of reads, the assembly of these reads can cause a bottleneck in the entire genome assembly process. As such, extensive research is being done to develop new techniques and algorithms to streamline the genome assembly process and make it a more computationally efficient process and to increase the accuracy of the process as a whole. =Hybrid Genome Assembly= The workflow of a typical hybrid genome assembly experiment using second- and third-generation sequencing technologies.

Optimizing hybrid assembly of next-generation sequence data from Enterococcus faecium: a microbe with highly divergent genome. BMC Syst Biol, 6 Suppl 3, S21. doi: 10.1186/1752-0509-6-S3-S21 One hybrid approach to genome assembly involves supplementing short, accurate second-generation sequencing data (i.e. from IonTorrent, Illumina or Roche 454) with long less accurate third generation sequencing data (i.e. from PacBio RS) to resolve complex repeated DNA segments.English, A. C., Richards, S., Han, Y., Wang, M., Vee, V., Qu, J. X., . . . Gibbs, R. A. (2012). Mind the Gap: Upgrading Genomes with Pacific Biosciences RS Long-Read Sequencing Technology. PLoS ONE, 7(11). doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0047768 The main limitation of single-molecule third- generation sequencing that prevents it from being used alone is its relatively low accuracy, which causes inherent errors in the sequenced DNA. Using solely second-generation sequencing technologies for genome assembly can miss or lead to the incomplete assembly of important aspects of the genome. Supplementation of third generation reads with short, high-accuracy second generation sequences can overcome these inherent errors and completed crucial details of the genome. This approach has been used to sequence the genomes of some bacterial species including a strain of Vibrio cholerae.Bashir, A., Klammer, A. A., Robins, W. P., Chin, C. S., Webster, D., Paxinos, E., . . . Schadt, E. E. (2012). A hybrid approach for the automated finishing of bacterial genomes. Nature Biotechnology, 30(7), 701-+. doi: 10.1038/nbt.2288 Algorithms specific for this type of hybrid genome assembly have been developed, such as the PacBio corrected Reads algorithm. There are inherent challenges when utilizing sequence reads from various technologies to assemble a sequenced genome; data coming from different sequencers can have different characteristics. An example of this can be seen when using the overlap-layout-consensus (OLC) method of genome assembly, which can be difficult when using reads of substantially different lengths. Currently, this challenge is being overcome by using multiple genome assembly programs. An example of this can be seen in Goldberg et al. where the authors paired 454 reads with Sanger reads. The 454 reads were first assemble using the Newbler assembler (which is optimized to use short reads) generating pseudo reads that were then paired with the longer Sanger reads and assembled using the Celera assembler.Goldberg, S. M., Johnson, J., Busam, D., Feldblyum, T., Ferriera, S., Friedman, R., . . . Venter, J. C. (2006). A Sanger/pyrosequencing hybrid approach for the generation of high-quality draft assemblies of marine microbial genomes. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 103(30), 11240-11245. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0604351103 Hybrid genome assembly can also be accomplished using the Eulerian path approach. In this approach, the length of the assembled sequences does not matter as once a k-mer spectrum has been constructed, the lengths of the reads are irrelevant.Pevzner, P. A., Tang, H., & Waterman, M. S. (2001). An Eulerian path approach to DNA fragment assembly. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 98(17), 9748-9753. doi: 10.1073/pnas.171285098 Practical approaches = Hybrid error correction and de novo assembly of single-molecule sequencing reads= The authors of this study developed a correction algorithm called the PacBio corrected Reads (PBcR) algorithm which is implemented as part of the Celera assembly program. This algorithm calculates an accurate hybrid consensus sequence by mapping higher accuracy short reads (from second generation sequencing technologies) to individual lower accuracy long reads (from third- generation sequencing technologies). This mapping allows for trimming and correction of the long reads to improve the read accuracy from as low as 80% to over 99.9%. In the best example of this application from this paper, the contig size was quintupled when compared to the assemblies using only second- generation reads. This study offers an improvement over the typical programs and algorithms used to assemble uncorrected PacBio reads. ALLPATHS-LG (another program that can assemble PacBio reads) uses the uncorrected PacBio reads to assist in scaffolding and for the closing of gaps in short sequence assemblies. Due to computational limitations, this approach limits assembly to relatively small genomes (maximum of 10Mbp). The PBcR algorithm allows for the assembly of much larger genomes with higher fidelity and using uncorrected PacBio reads. This study also shows that using a lower coverage of corrected long reads is similar to using a higher coverage of shorter reads; 13x PBcR data (corrected using 50x Illumina data) was comparable to an assembly constructed using 100x paired-end Illumina reads. The N50 for the corrected PBcR data was also longer than the Illumina data (4.65MBp compared to 3.32 Mbp for the Illumina reads). A similar trend was seen in the sequencing of the Escherichia coli JM221 genome: a 25x PBcR assembly had a N50 triple that of 50x 454 assembly. =Automated finishing of bacterial genomes= This study employed two different methods for hybrid genome assembly: a scaffolding approach that supplemented currently available sequenced contigs with PacBio reads, as well as an error correction approach to improve the assembly of bacterial genomes. The first approach in this study started with high-quality contigs constructed from sequencing reads from second-generation (Illumina and 454) technology. These contigs were supplemented by aligning them to PacBio long reads to achieve linear scaffolds that were gap-filled using PacBio long reads. These scaffolds were then supplemented again, but using PacBio strobe reads (multiple subreads from a single contiguous fragment of DNA Ritz, Anna, Bashir, Ali, & Raphael, Benjamin J. (2010). Structural variation analysis with strobe reads. Bioinformatics, 26(10), 1291-1298. doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btq153 ) to achieve a final, high-quality assembly. This approach was used to sequence the genome of a strain of Vibrio cholerae that was responsible for a cholera outbreak in Haiti.Abrams, J. Y., Copeland, J. R., Tauxe, R. V., Date, K. A., Belay, E. D., Mody, R. K., & Mintz, E. D. (2013). Real-time modelling used for outbreak management during a cholera epidemic, Haiti, 2010-2011. Epidemiology and Infection, 141(6), 1276-1285. This study also used a hybrid approach to error-correction of PacBio sequencing data. This was done by utilizing high-coverage Illumina short reads to correct errors in the low-coverage PacBio reads. BLASR (a long read aligner from PacBio) was used in this process. In areas where the Illumina reads could be mapped, a consensus sequence was constructed using overlapping reads in that region. One area of the genome where the use of the long PacBio reads was especially helpful was the ribosomal operon. This region is usually greater than 5kb in size and occurs seven time throughout the genome with an average identity ranging from 98.04% to 99.94%. Resolving these regions using only short second generation reads would be very difficult but the use of long third generation reads makes the process much more efficient. Utilization of the PacBio reads allowed for unambiguous placement of the complex repeated along the scaffold. =Using only short reads= An example of a De Bruijn graph that would be used for genome assembly. The nodes represent the sequence of the contigs being used for assembly. This study employs a hybrid genome assembly approach that only uses sequencing reads generated using SOLiD sequencing (a second-generation sequencing technology). The genome of C. pseudotuberculosis was assembled twice: once using a classical reference genome approach, and once using a hybrid approach. The hybrid approach consisted of three contiguous steps. Firstly, contigs were generated de novo, secondly, the contigs were ordered and concatenated into supercontigs, and, thirdly, the gaps between contigs were closed using an iterative approach. The initial de novo assembly of contigs was achieved in parallel using Velvet, which assembles contigs by manipulating De Bruijn graphs, and Edena, which is an OLC-based assembler Comparing the assembly constructed using the hybrid approach to the assembly created using the traditional reference genome approach showed that, with the availability of a reference genome, it is more beneficial to utilize an hybrid de novo assembly strategy as it preserves more genome sequences. =Using high throughput short and long reads = The authors of this paper present Cerulean, a hybrid genome assembly program that differs from traditional hybrid assembly approaches.Deshpande, V., Fung, E., Pham, S., & Bafna, V. (2013). Cerulean: A hybrid assembly using high throughput short and long reads. Algorithms in Bioinformatics, 8126, 349-363. Normally, hybrid assembly involved mapping short high quality reads to long low quality reads, but this still introduces errors in the assembled genomes. This process is also computationally expensive and require a large amount of running time, even for relatively small bacterial genomes. Cerulean, unlike other hybrid assembly approaches, doesn‚Äôt use the short reads directly, instead it uses an assembly graph that is created in a similar manner to the OLC method or the De Bruijn method. This graph is used to assemble a skeleton graph, which only uses long contigs with the edges of the graph representing the putative genomic connection between the contigs. The skeleton graph is a simplified version of a typical De Bruijn graph, which means that unambiguous assembly using the skeleton graph is more favourable than traditional methods. This method was tested by assembling the genome of an ‚Äò‚ÄôEscherichia coli‚Äô‚Äô strain. First, short reads were assembled using the ABySS assembler. These reads were then mapped to the long reads using BLASR. The results from the ABySS assembly were used to create the assembly graph, which were used to generate scaffolds using the filtered BLASR data . The advantages of cerulean are that it requires minimal resources and results in assembled scaffolds with high accuracy. These characteristics make it better suited for up-scaling to be used on larger eukaryotic genomes, but the efficiency of cerulean when applied to larger genomes remains to be verified. Future prospectives The current challenges in genome assembly are related to the limitation of modern sequencing technologies. Advances in sequencing technology aim to develop systems that are able to produce long sequencing reads with very high fidelity but, at this point, these two things are mutually exclusive. The advent of third-generation sequencing technology is expanding the limits of genomic research as the cost of generating high quality sequencing data is decreasing.http://www.ddw-online.com/enabling-technologies/p211492-dna- sequencing:towards-the-third-generation-and-beyondspring-13.html The idea of using multiple sequencing technologies to facilitate genome assembly may become an idea of the past as the quality of long sequencing reads (hundreds or thousands of base pairs) approaches and exceeds the quality of current second generation sequencing reads. The computational difficulties that are encountered during genome assembly will also become a concept of the past as computation efficiency and performance increases. The development of more efficient sequencing algorithms and assembly programs is needed to develop more effective assembly approaches that can tandemly incorporate sequencing reads from multiple technologies. Many of the current limitations in genomic research revolve around the ability to produce large amounts of high quality sequencing data and to assemble entire genomes of organisms of interest. Developing more effective hybrid genome assembly strategies is taking the next step in advancing sequence assembly technology and these strategies are guaranteed to become more effective as more powerful technologies emerge.

The game contains characters loosely based on, and named after, characters in the Faust legend, as well as several fairy tales. Gameplay Plot The setting of Knights Contract is in a fictional Europe during the Middle Ages, with dark fantasy characteristics, involving witchcraft, sorcery, and otherworldly monsters. A superstitious hatred for witches is the norm for society. As a result, people employ witch-hunters and witch-executioners. The game follows Heinrich Hofmann, an experienced witch- executioner plagued by a curse, and a young woman named Gretchen, who is the reincarnation of a witch Heinrich executed under the orders of Dr. Faust. In what initially seems an act of revenge for her execution, Gretchen curses Heinrich with immortality. At the same time, Dr. Faust, the game's main antagonist, creates hordes of monsters that terrorize the world. The mad scientist is responsible for the deaths of Gretchen and her fellow witches. Gretchen, intending to protect humanity, decides to confront the menace directly, by joining forces with the cursed executioner, Heinrich. The now- immortal Heinrich is forced to protect the mortal Gretchen from danger, in hopes of undoing the curse and defeating Dr. Faust. Development The title was announced in the May 20 issue of Famitsu. A trailer for the game was shown at E3 2010.

But Jorge, an imaginative boy, recreates the story, based in the present time and with somewhat futuristic elements. In each passage of the story, the father appears, telling the story to Jorge, and two thought bubbles: one with the passage imagined by the father, illuminated with sepia tones to give the idea of antiquity, and the other is the story imagined by Jorge, illuminated in full color. The shapes of the thought bubbles and the expressions of Jorge and his father are also important.  Awards  *National Award ‚ÄúCuadro de Honor‚Äù [Honor Roll] of Children's Literature.

Brandt, who had been Reich Commisser for Health and Sanitation, was indicted with 22 other Nazi doctors and SS officers. The Tribunal found him guilty on all four counts charging him with conspiracy in aggressive wars, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and membership in the criminal SS organization. Among those criminal acts was his participating in and consenting to using concentration camp inmates as test subjects in medical experiments. The SS Medical Corps was a formation within the SS of professional doctors who provided medical services for the SS, including experiments on and the development of different methods of murdering prisoners. Members of the SS Medical Corps also served on the front with the Waffen-SS as support personnel practicing field expedient medicine on wounded members of the SS. Formation The first units of the SS Medical Corps began to appear in the 1930s. Small divisions of SS personnel designated to medical duties were known initially as the Sanit√§tsstaffel. These formations were originally small units under the command of local SS leaders. After 1931, the SS formed a headquarters office known as Amt V, which was the central office for SS medical units. At this same time, a special SS unit was formed known as the R√∂ntgensturmbann SS-HA, or the Hauptamt X-Ray Battalion. This formation comprised 350 full-time SS personnel who toured Germany offering X-ray diagnostics to any SS member. While the R√∂ntgensturmbann was an independent office, the local Sanit√§tsstaffel were under dual command of both the SS Medical Office (Amt V), and the leaders of the various SS-Sturmbann and Standarten. Within each SS-Sturmbann (battalion), there existed one company of SS personnel whose duty was to serve as medical support personnel to the rest of the SS battalion. Eventually these supporting units became the SS Medical Corps. When the Nazis came to national power in 1933, the SS was reorganized and an office of the SS Surgeon General was established. Commanded by an SS-Obergruppenf√ºhrer, the SS Surgeon General was a member of the personal staff of the Reichsf√ºhrer-SS, with the SS Medical Corps, as a whole, losing the status of a headquarters office. This was an important development in changing the nature of service for members of the SS Medical Corps. By 1935, the SS Medical Corps was considered an \\"auxiliary duty\\", and all members of the medical corps were also attached to regular SS formations. To denote medical corps status, the SS authorized a serpent crest to be worn on the collar patches of SS unit insignia. Because SS Medical Corps members could now serve in any branch of the SS, this expansion allowed medical professionals to join every SS office and participate in a variety of duties. Exploitation and murder A damaged German Magirus-Deutz in 1945 at Kolno, Poland. Kolno was a transfer point for new victims deported from ≈Å√≥d≈∫ to Che≈Çmno extermination camp. According to eyewitnesses, similar vans were used by the SS for mobile gassing, with the exhaust fumes diverted into the sealed rear compartment. Between 1935 and 1938, the SS Medical Corps began to serve a more sinister purpose, with SS doctors assigned to concentration camps where they engaged in a variety of indescribably cruel human medical experiments. SS doctors were called upon in 1936 to assist with Germany's euthanasia program against the mentally disabled and physically handicapped in a program known confidentially as Operation T4. For example, they helped develop the first methods of gassing patients using carbon monoxide from the exhaust fumes of lorries (vans). Stemming from a secret memorandum signed into effect by Hitler authorizing the killing of \\"useless eaters\\" and people considered an economic burden on German society on 9 October 1939, Operation T4 eventually evolved into the Law for Euthanasia for the Incurably Ill. According to historian G√∂tz Aly, the first commandants of the death camps at Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka came out of Operation T4 and \\"were on its payroll.\\" In 1938, the SS formed its own Medical Academy in Berlin to train medical personnel and physicians who would serve with the SS-VT, the forerunner of the Waffen-SS. Doctors serving with the Waffen-SS were highly trained both in medical skills and combat tactics with many such doctors receiving high combat awards. During the war's progression, the Waffen-SS had a continuously developing structure for physicians which was highly complex, so sometime in August 1943, Himmler united all the medical branches of the SS and placed them under the command of Reicharzt-SS Ernst-Robert Grawitz, much like the Surgeon-General of the army. Oftentimes personnel in the medical units of the SS performed duties not typically associated with traditional medicine as their primary responsibility once the war began was nothing less than the institutionalized medical genocide of anyone considered an enemy of the Nazi regime. People deemed inferior or undesirable became human guinea pigs and were exploited for scientific research by SS doctors as they conducted inhumane medical experiments at the camps. Human medical experiments, the most notorious of which occurred at Dachau concentration camp and Auschwitz reached their zenith during the war. Such experiments ranged from vivisections, sterilization experiments, infectious disease research, freezing experiments, as well as many other excruciating medical procedures often performed without anesthetic. During this period of time one of the most infamous SS doctors, Doctor Josef Mengele, served as Head Medical Officer of Auschwitz and was responsible for the daily gas chamber selections as well as brutal experiments (including those on human twins). May 1944 - Jews from Carpathian Ruthenia arrive at Auschwitz-Birkenau Another function that SS doctors served was to maximize the economic utility of slave labor at the concentration camps, aiding the SS industry and the Nazi cause through the exploitation of people and resources. Along those lines in December 1942, SS- Gruppenf√ºhrer Richard Gl√ºcks (Inspector of Concentration Camps) sent a directive to the camp doctors telling them that, \\"The best doctor in a concentration camp is that doctor who holds the work capacity among inmates at its highest possible level. He does this through surveillance and through replacing [the sick or injured] at individual work stations. . . Toward this end it is necessary that the camp doctors take a personal interest and appear on location at work sites.\\" Nuremberg trials In 1945, after the surrender of Germany, the SS was declared an illegal criminal organization at the Nuremberg trial. SS doctors, in particular, were marked as war criminals due to the wide range of human medical experimentation which had been conducted during World War II as well as the role SS doctors had played in the gas chamber selections of the Holocaust. Later charges were brought against SS intellectuals and SS physicians by the German state. Many SS doctors, however, were never brought to justice with such figures as Josef Mengele escaping to Argentina while still other SS doctors returned to civilian practice in Germany under assumed names and in some cases, even their original identities. In the former East Germany for instance, Hermann Voss became a respected anatomist, while Eugen Wannenmacher obtained a post as a professor at the University of M√ºnster and Mengele's former sponsor and mentor, Dr. Otmar Freiherr von Verschuer, continued operating his medical practice.

Grigorieva signed with Gibson's music label, and the two began production on her first music album. She composed all songs on the album. Gibson served as co-writer on the song, \\"Say My Name,\\" and recorded four music videos for the album's release. The album was positively received by the media, including ABC News and Reuters. IndieLondon gave the album a rating of 4 out of 5.  Musician  Grigorieva was born in Saransk, Russia. Her parents were music professors. She grew up in Ukraine, and at the age of 15 moved to Moscow to attend university to learn piano. She said of her experience of learning music as a child, \\"Diplomas were everything. It wasn't unusual for students to play ten hours a day. Our skin would start to crack. We'd literally have bleeding fingers.\\" Grigorieva finished conservatoire studies in Kazan, and moved to London where she continued her studies and taught music to others. After studying at the Royal College of Music, she moved to the United States and spent time living in New York City and Los Angeles, California. She taught music in the U.S., and patented a technique of instructing music notation to children. Grigorieva composed and performed music, and produced works for theatre and advertisements. A 2006 song she wrote, \\"Un Dia Llegara\\", became popular on the Josh Groban album, Awake; this garnered her recognition as a songwriter.  Production  Grigorieva had signed with Gibson's music label prior to the album's release. The music project was made by the film production company Icon Entertainment, owned by Gibson. She wrote all of the songs on the album, and received a credit as producer with Gibson listed as executive producer. Grigorieva explained the choice of title for the album, in an interview with IndieLondon, \\"Well, one of the tracks on the album is called Beautiful Heartache ... everybody has a heartbreak at some point in their lives. It‚Äôs how you deal with it that‚Äôs important. So, I guess I was drawn to that notion for the album title.\\" In an interview with The Times, she commented, \\"I'm very lucky they offered me the chance to follow my dreams, but also to allow me to produce my own album, which is hardly ever offered to first-time artists. He believes in me that much. I'm really blessed ... It's the most incredible gift that Mr Gibson could have given me.\\" She acknowledged to the Herald Sun that it was helpful to have Gibson's production company assist with her music career, \\"If you think about it, every talent needs a serious push and help from somebody who is stronger, because it's pretty much impossible for anybody to succeed in this industry. So I've become very lucky, and I'm very grateful. You don't control the situations or the people you meet. I did not plan this. I'm just doing what I've always been doing. It's not like I've changed my goals at all.\\" Gibson contributed lyrics to multiple tracks on the album. The track, \\"Say My Name\\", was co-written by Grigorieva and Gibson. Grigorieva described \\"Say My Name\\", stating, \\"It is naked, intimate, raw emotion. It is the first and one of the simplest songs on the album, but also one of the most intimate.\\" She characterized it as, \\"little more than piano and voice as if it is a cry from the soul\\". Gibson provided guest vocals for two tracks on the album. Grigorieva stated of Gibson's singing on the album, \\"Mel is an incredible artist. He has a great voice. He is a visionary. He enabled me to produce this, for my music to live.\\" Gibson served as director of four music videos intended to accompany the release of the album. The music videos were filmed over a seven-day period in Mexico. Grigorieva stated of working with Gibson as a music video director, \\"I kept asking him, 'Please, give me directions!' I said, 'You can yell at me if you want to'. But he said, 'No, you're doing just fine. You're a good actor'. He was very much into his own world, painting pictures with the camera.\\" In describing the music videos, she observed, \\"They're like dramatic miniature films a whirlpool of different, exciting, bright images.\\" Grigorieva toured to promote her album, during October 2009. The first single from the album, \\"Say My Name\\", was released in June 2009 on the website People.com as a listening exclusive. Beautiful Heartache was released on November 2, 2009. It was made available in 2009 on iTunes, and via download on the musician's official website, at www.oksana.fm.  Contents  Beautiful Heartache was marketed as \\"grown-up, piano-led pop, heavy on classical motifs\\". The first single released for the album was titled, \\"Say My Name\\". A music video for the second single released from the album featured Grigorieva on the piano, as well as portraying an assistant to a knife-thrower. The album includes a title track, \\"Beautiful Heartache\\", with lyrics including: \\"I love the way you wear your skin.\\" The music video for the track, \\"Beautiful Heartache\\", focused on a tango theme.  Reception  ABC News reported that Beautiful Heartache garnered the singer \\"rave reviews\\" from music critics. Reuters commented of the album, \\"'Beautiful Heartache' features a collection of wistful love songs, blending shimmering string arrangements with pop and jazz-influenced arrangements that showcase Grigorieva's soulful voice.\\" In a review of the album, Jack Foley of IndieLondon gave it a rating of 4 out of 5, and observed, \\"throughout, she displays a keen ear for melody, for honest emotional simplicity and classic values. She‚Äôs well worth taking the time to check out\\". The track from the album co-written with Mel Gibson, \\"Say My Name\\", was not generally well received by music critics, and received negative comments from listeners at the website E! Online.

It was written by Luis Pescetti, Argentine writer and musician, whose works are mainly intended for children. The book was adapted to the theater by Barbara Raimondi. Publication history The book was published in 1998 by Alfaguara in its orange series for children 10 years and older, appearing in Argentina, Mexico and other countries in South America. Two years later it was issued by the same publisher in the \\"Alfaguay\\" collection exclusively for Spain. Two versions of the book have been issued, the first in 1998 illustrated by O'Kif (1998), and the second in 2008 illustrated by Pablo Fernandez. The Pablo Fernandez version of the book includes 4-mini posters, and was issued as part of a set with the other Natacha books that he illustrated on the tenth anniversary of the first appearance of Natacha. The book was published in the United States by Santillana in 2008 (). Synopsis Natacha has a mother who invents tales of monsters, a friend Pati, who with Natacha are \\"The Pearl Girls\\" and a dog, Rafles, a little destroyer. Natacha is a girl who never tires of asking questions. Her curiosity, which is shared by her friend Pati, drives her parents and other adults to despair. Sometimes they have to count to ten to calm down. In this book Natacha helps to cook by making a chocolate cake, but in place of the main ingredient she uses mud. During a film she asks her mother so many questions that she cannot follow the plot. In other chapters she writes a poem, but needs her mother's help with spelling. Her mother tells her stories about monsters of the night and her dog \\"Rafles\\" meets various disasters. Miscellaneous Natacha is, along with El ciudadano de mis zapatos (The citizen of my shoes), one of the works by Luis Pescetti that have been adapted to theater. The Argentine Director Barbara Raimondi faithfully adapted the book to a play, apart from changing Natacha's best friend from Pati (Patricia) to Patri (Patrick) and adding stories to link the episodes together. Natasha's name was taken from a student who was taught by the author (he taught music in preschool and primary), who was just as curious and inquisitive. The other characters and situations in the book were taken from the author's experiences as a child. He used the phrase \\"I'm going somewhere to do something ...\\" in infancy and quoted it on his recordings and in his radio program Hola Luis. This is the only book by Luis Pescetti that was translated into Catalan, issued only in Spain. The Catalan book is called La Nataixa. The tenth anniversary of publication of the first edition of Natacha was celebrated in July 2007. The author and the publisher put on a series of concerts by Luis Pescetti called \\"Useless to insist\\". The poster proclaims \\"10 years of Natacha\\" and is framed with Natacha's characteristic pigtails and fringe.

It has been designated by Cadw as a Grade I listed building, and is under the care of the Friends of Friendless Churches. It is Grade I listed because of its \\"exceptional interior\\" including a 15th-century rood-loft and \\"rare pre-Victorian box pews and fittings\\". The church stands in a churchyard that is almost circular, and is surrounded by a bank and the traces of a ditch. History The first record of a church on the site is in 1254. However the present church dates mainly from the 15th century and it was probably originally dedicated to Saint Cyfyw. The Monmouthshire author and artist, Fred Hando, records this dedication in his Journeys in Gwent, published in 1951. It was declared redundant in 1999. The charity the Friends of Friendless Churches holds a 999 year lease with effect from 19 November 1999. Since then repairs have been carried out to the exterior. Architecture St David's is constructed in stone rubble and has stone tile roofs. Its plan consists of a nave and chancel, with a west porch. On the east gable is a cross finial, and on the west gable is a bellcote. The bellcote has two triangular openings; the bells were dated 1598 and 1688, but only one of these was still present by 1999. On the south side of the church are three windows in Perpendicular style; there are no windows on the north side. The east window has three lights. At the east end of the nave on each side is a buttress, and there is a Tudor arched door on the south wall of the chancel. The church has a \\"remarkable unrestored interior with 18th-century fittings\\". Its floor slopes downwards from the west. The walls are plastered and whitewashed; the pointed chancel arch is also plastered. The frame and the front of the loft of the original 15th-century rood screen are still present. The architectural historian John Newman records this as an \\"important medieval survival\\". There is a set of pre-Victorian box pews. These include a large squire's pew, above which is a monument to William Jones who died in 1829. The pulpit is five-sided, and the communion rail is supported by turned balusters. There are stone benches along the east wall and a small, damaged piscina in the south wall. The font is square on a square base. On the floor of the nave and the chancel, and on the north wall, are memorial slabs.

The term and title was used unofficially. They were never officially recognized as a separate branch of the SS. Austrian SS members were seen as regular personnel and they served in every branch of the SS. History With Kaltenbrunner (on the far left), Heinrich Himmler talks to camp commander, Franz Ziereis, during an official visit to Mauthausen concentration camp in 1941. Austrian Gauleiter August Eigruber (wearing a pre-war Allgemeine SS uniform) accompanies them along with other SS officials. The term \\"Austrian SS\\" is often used to describe that portion of the SS membership from Austria, but it was never a recognized branch of the SS. In contrast to SS members from other countries, who were grouped into either the Germanic-SS or the Foreign Legions of the Waffen-SS, Austrian SS members were regular SS personnel. It was technically under the command of the SS in Germany, but often acted independently concerning Austrian affairs. The Austrian SS was founded in 1930 and, by 1934, was acting as a covert force to bring about the Anschluss with Germany, which occurred in March 1938. Early Austrian SS leaders were Ernst Kaltenbrunner and Arthur Seyss-Inquart. Austrian SS men were organized under the same manner as the Allgemeine-SS, but operated as an underground organization, in particular after 1936 when the Austrian government declared the SS an illegal organization. Kaltenbrunner, for example, repeatedly made trips to Bavaria to consult with Himmler and Heydrich. Hiding on a train and on a ship that traveled to Passau, he would return with money and orders for Austrian comrades. Kaltenbrunner was arrested for a second time in 1937, by Austrian authorities on charges of being head of the illegal Nazi Party organisation in Upper Austria. He was released in September. One of the largest formations of the Austrian SS was the 11th SS-Standarte operating out of Vienna. After 1938, when Austria was annexed by Germany, the Austrian SS was folded into SS-Oberabschnitt Donau with the 3rd regiment of the SS- Verfugungstruppe, Der F√ºhrer, and the fourth Totenkopf regiment, Ostmark, recruited in Austria shortly thereafter. Mauthausen was the first concentration camp opened in Austria following the Anschluss. Starting with a single camp at Mauthausen, the complex expanded over time and by the summer of 1940 Mauthausen had become one of the largest labour camp complexes in the German-controlled part of Europe, with four main subcamps at Mauthausen and nearby Gusen, and nearly 100 other subcamps located throughout Austria and southern Germany, directed from a central office at Mauthausen. In Vienna, the Hotel Metropole was transformed into Gestapo headquarters in April 1938. With a staff of 900 (80 per cent of whom were recruited from the Austrian police), it was the largest Gestapo office outside of Berlin. An estimated 50,000 people were interrogated or tortured there. Thereafter, the people would be deported to concentration camps throughout the German Reich. The Gestapo in Vienna was headed by Franz Josef Huber, who also served as chief of the Central Agency for Jewish Emigration in Vienna. Although its de facto leaders were Adolf Eichmann and later Alois Brunner, Huber was still responsible for the mass deportation of Austrian Jews. Austrian SS members served in every branch of the SS, including Nazi concentration camps, Einsatzgruppen, and the Security Services. Political scientist David Art of Tufts University notes that Austrians comprised 8 per cent of the Third Reich's population and 13 percent of the SS; he states that 40 per cent of the staff and 75 per cent of commanders at death camps were Austrian. Besides Eichmann, who was one of the major organisers of the Holocaust, Amon G√∂th was another infamous Austrian-SS member. He became the commandant of the Krak√≥w-P≈Çasz√≥w concentration camp in P≈Çasz√≥w (who was portrayed in the film Schindler's List by Ralph Fiennes).

It is a primarily demersal fish, dwelling in the riverbeds of the above basins and in Stanley Pool. During spawning season, females can be found in open water.  Biology  The slender lungfish has an anguilliform body, much like an eel. The body of the slender lungfish is generally brown; young of the species oftentimes have black spots throughout the body, however adults generally lose these spots as they age. Like all African lungfish the slender lungfish is an obligate air-breather and is capable of aestivation; however, it generally does not aestivate.  Reproduction  Spotted lungfish nests are generally found in June through October. During this time period the male makes a nest and buries it in mud, not unlike the marbled lungfish mating behavior. He guards both eggs and larvae during this time. The female does not take care of the young but rather during this time can be found open water in rivers within its range.

The \\"question\\" at stake surrounded whether King Leopold III could return to the country and resume his constitutional role amid allegations that his actions during World War II had been contrary to the provisions of the Belgian Constitution. It was eventually resolved by the abdication of Leopold in favour of his son Baudouin in 1951. The crisis emerged from the division between Leopold and his government, led by Hubert Pierlot, during the German invasion of 1940. Leopold, who was suspected of authoritarian sympathies, had taken command of the Belgian Army at the outbreak of war. Considering his constitutional position as commander-in-chief to take precedence over his civil role as head of state, he refused to leave his army and join the Belgian government in exile in France. Leopold's refusal to obey the government marked a constitutional crisis and, after having negotiated the surrender to the Germans on 28 May 1940, Leopold was widely condemned. During the subsequent German occupation, Leopold was held under house arrest in his palace where he was praised for stoically sharing the suffering of ordinary Belgians. Shortly before the Allies liberated the country in 1944, he was deported to Germany by the Nazis. With Belgium liberated but the king still in captivity, his brother, Prince Charles, Count of Flanders, was elected regent. The king was declared officially \\"unable to rule\\" in accordance with the constitution. With the country divided along political lines over whether the king could ever return to his functions, and with the left wing dominant politically, Leopold went into exile in Switzerland. In 1950, a national referendum was organised by a new centre-right government to decide on whether Leopold could return. Although the result was a victory for the Leopoldists, it produced a strong regional split between Flanders, which was broadly in favour of the king's return, and Brussels and Wallonia which generally opposed it. Leopold's return to Belgium in July 1950 was greeted with widespread protests in Wallonia and a general strike. The unrest culminated in the killing of four workers by police on 30 July. With the situation fast deteriorating, on 1 August 1950 Leopold announced his intention to abdicate. After a transition period, he formally abdicated in favour of Baudouin in July 1951. Background =Monarchy and the constitution= Leopold I Belgium gained its independence from the United Netherlands in 1830 and was established as a popular and constitutional monarchy under a bicameral parliamentary democracy. A liberal Constitution was written in 1831 which codified the responsibilities and restrictions imposed on the monarch. Although the King, as head of state, was prevented from acting without the approval of a government minister, he was allowed full control of military matters in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief. Which responsibility would take precedence if they became incompatible was left ambiguous and this uncertainty would lie at the heart of the Royal Question. The first king, Leopold I, accepted the terms of the Constitution but attempted to use its ambiguities to subtly increase his own powers. This was continued by his successors, although with little real success. =King Leopold III= Leopold III came to the throne in 1934 after his father, Albert I, died in a mountaineering accident. Albert, known as the \\"Knight King\\" (roi-chevalier or koning-ridder), had been hugely popular in Belgium after commanding the Belgian army during World War I (1914‚Äì18) while much of the country was under German occupation. Leopold's reign was marked by economic crisis in the wake of the Great Depression, and political agitation by both far-left and far- right parties. Amid this period of crisis, Leopold attempted to expand the powers of the monarch. He was widely suspected of holding authoritarian and right-wing political views. From 1936, Leopold was a strong supporter of Belgium's \\"independence policy\\" of political neutrality in the face of Nazi Germany's increasingly aggressive territorial expansion. German invasion and occupation, 1940‚Äì44 Belgian Propaganda Poster from King Leopold III with title \\"28 May 1940, Halt, Sire We will never forget this\\" in response to the Battle Of Belgium. On 10 May 1940, German forces invaded neutral Belgium without a formal declaration of war. Leopold headed immediately to Fort Breendonk, the headquarters of the Belgian army near Mechelen, to take control of the army. He refused to address the Belgian parliament beforehand, as Albert I had famously done at the outbreak of World War I. The speed of the German advance, using the new Blitzkrieg approach, soon pushed the Belgian army westwards despite British and French support. On 16 May, the Belgian government left Brussels. =Break between King and Government= A modern view of the Kasteel van Wijnendale, where the final meeting between Leopold and the Belgian government took place on 25 May 1940 Soon after the outbreak of war, the King and Government began to disagree. While the Government argued that the German invasion had violated Belgian neutrality and made Belgium one of the Allies, Leopold argued that Belgium was still a neutral country and had no obligations beyond defending its borders. Leopold opposed allowing British and French forces into Belgian territory to fight alongside Belgian troops, as a breach of its neutrality. On 25 May 1940, Leopold met senior representatives of his Government for a final time at the Kasteel van Wijnendale in West Flanders. The meeting is frequently cited as the start of the Royal Question and the moment of the decisive break between King and Government. Four ministers of the Government were present: Hubert Pierlot, Paul-Henri Spaak, Henri Denis and Arthur Vanderpoorten. By the time of the meeting, against the backdrop of the bloody Battle of the Lys, the Belgian government was preparing to continue the fight against Germany from exile in France. They urged the King to join them, following the examples of Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands and Charlotte, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg. The King rejected their arguments and hardened his own position. He refused to leave Belgian territory and his army in Flanders at any cost. The ministers suspected that Leopold's aides were already negotiating with the Germans. The meeting broke up with no agreement and the Belgian Government left for France. Leopold negotiated a cease-fire with the Germans on 27 May 1940, and the Belgian armed forces officially surrendered the following day. Leopold became a prisoner of war and was placed under house arrest at the Royal Palace of Laeken, near Brussels. Furious that the King had both ignored the government and negotiated a surrender without consulting them, Pierlot gave an angry speech on Radio Paris, condemning the King and announcing the Government's intention to continue fighting alongside the Allies. French politicians, notably Paul Reynaud, blamed Leopold for the growing disaster of the Battle of France and angrily condemned him as a \\"criminal king\\" (roi-f√©lon). =Leopold during the German occupation= With the Belgian surrender on 28 May 1940, Belgium was placed under German occupation and a military administration was established under General Alexander von Falkenhausen to govern the country. Belgian civil servants were ordered to remain at their posts in order to ensure the continued functioning of the state and to attempt to protect the population from the demands of the German authorities. With France's defeat and the installation of the pro-German Vichy regime, it was widely believed that Germany was about to win the war. Leopold was hailed as a \\"martyr\\" or a symbol of national resilience, in contrast to a Government that appeared to place its ideology above the interests of the Belgian people. On 31 May 1940, the senior representative of the Catholic Church in Belgium, Cardinal Jozef-Ernest van Roey, circulated a pastoral letter calling for all Belgians to unite around the King. Other figures in the King's entourage, particularly the authoritarian socialist Henri de Man, believed that democracy had failed and that the end of the war would see the King as the ruler of an authoritarian Belgian state. Modern view of the Royal Palace of Laeken, where Leopold was detained during the occupation Imprisoned, the King continued to follow his own political programme. He believed that after the German victory a \\"New Order\\" would be established in Europe and that, as the senior Belgian figure in occupied Europe, he could negotiate with the German authorities. Leopold corresponded with Adolf Hitler and tried to organise a meeting with him. Hitler remained uninterested and distrustful of the King, but on 19 November 1940 Leopold succeeded in gaining an unproductive audience with him at Berchtesgaden. Popular support for Leopold in Belgium declined sharply in December 1941 when news of Leopold's remarriage to Lilian Baels was made public. The marriage was deeply unpopular with the Belgian public. The image of the \\"prisoner-king\\" (roi prisonnier), sharing the suffering of the Belgian prisoners of war, was undermined and his popularity fell sharply, especially in Wallonia, the home of the majority of the Belgian prisoners still detained. Popular opinion also turned on the king for his perceived unwillingness to speak out against German occupation policies. Amid German defeats against the Russians on the Eastern Front after 1942, the King prepared for the end of the war. He ordered the preparation of a document, known as the Political Testament (Testament Politique), which would justify his behaviour under the occupation and detail his interventions on behalf of Belgian prisoners of war and deported workers. Leopold however continued to condemn the action of the Belgian government in exile (based in London after October 1940). On 7 June 1944, following D-Day, he was deported to Germany. He was finally liberated by American forces on 7 May 1945. Regency and the early crisis, 1944‚Äì49 =Leopold declared \\"unable to reign\\", 1944= Prince Charles, Count of Flanders, who was installed as regent in 1944 After the Allied landings in Normandy, Allied troops advanced eastwards and crossed the Belgian frontier on 1 September 1944. German forces offered little resistance and, by 4 September, the Allies were in control of Brussels although the last occupied parts of Belgian territory were only liberated in February 1945. On 8 September 1944, the government in exile returned to Brussels and was greeted with general indifference. Although the King was no longer in the country, his Political Testament was presented to the returned Government as he had wished, and was soon circulated publicly. At the same time, a copy was presented to the British king, George VI, and was seen by the Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden. The text reignited the divisions within the Government which had been largely hidden since earlier in the war. Since the King was still in German custody, there was no opposition to the creation of a regency in his absence. On 20 September 1944, a meeting of both Chambers of Parliament was called. Article 82 of the Constitution was invoked, declaring the King \\"unable to reign\\" (dans l'impossibilit√© de r√©gner). Leopold's reclusive brother, Prince Charles, Count of Flanders, was elected regent and took the oath the following day. Further action on the Royal Question was pushed aside by more pressing economic and political issues that occupied most of the Government's time. With Belgium under partial Allied military administration until the restoration of the government services, British hostility to Leopold's return also complicated the issue. =Political recovery and revival of the Royal Question= Soon after the liberation, Belgium began a period of rapid economic recovery and the process of political reconstruction began. The traditional party system had been torn apart by the war and occupation. The two major ideological blocks proceeded to create their own parties: socialists created the Belgian Socialist Party (PSB‚ÄìBSP), while Catholics and conservatives created the Christian Social Party (PSC‚ÄìCVP). The biggest change in early post-liberation politics was the surge of support for the Communist Party of Belgium, which became the third party in Belgian politics until 1949, temporarily displacing the Liberal Party. The Walloon Movement also re-emerged after the war, promoting the culture and economic interests of the French-speaking areas in the south. The period saw major reform of trade unions following the creation of the first large unified union, the General Labour Federation of Belgium (F√©d√©ration g√©n√©rale du Travail de Belgique or Algemeen Belgisch Vakverbond, FGTB‚ÄìABVV), in April 1945 with 248,000 members nationwide. By 1947, however, the political structure of the Belgian state had stabilised. Pregny, Switzerland where Leopold spent the years 1945 to 1950 in exile Under the early regency, both the Pierlot and subsequent Achille Van Acker governments attempted to avoid confronting the issue of Leopold's return despite calls from Communists, some Socialists and trade unionists for the King's abdication in April and May 1945. Soon after the King's liberation, Van Acker and a government delegation headed to Strobl, Austria to negotiate with Leopold. At a series of meetings between 9 and 11 May 1945, Van Acker insisted that the King publicly announce his support for the Allied cause and his commitment to parliamentary democracy. No agreement was reached. In the meantime, Leopold took up residence in Pregny (near Geneva) in Switzerland under the pretext that heart palpitations made further negotiations or thoughts of return to political life impossible. In Belgium, political debate about the Royal Question continued and grew after the war, and remained a polemical topic in the popular press, notably in the Francophone newspaper Le Soir. In the general election of 1949, the PSC‚ÄìCVP campaigned on a pro-Leopold royalist platform. The results reshaped the political landscape; the Communists were routed and the PSB‚ÄìBSP lost seats to both the Liberals and Catholics. The Catholics gained a new majority in the Senate and a plurality in the Chamber of Representatives, their best results since the war. Gaston Eyskens took over as Prime Minister at the head of a Liberal-Catholic coalition. Both parties in the government (and Leopold himself) supported a referendum on the King's return, which became the focus of political attention. Culmination of the crisis, 1950 =Referendum of March 1950= Belgian Propaganda Poster about King Leopold III with title \\"My Destiny will be yours\\" Published in 1950 in response to the royal question . The Eyskens government agreed to a national referendum, known as the \\"popular consultation\\" (consultation populaire or volksraadpleging), which was scheduled for 12 March 1950. It was the first such vote in Belgian history and was intended to be advisory. Campaigning was vigorous on both sides, with little disruption to the polls, despite the contentious nature of the subject. The results of the referendum were indecisive. Leopold's return won a 58 per cent majority in the national vote, with majorities in seven of the nine provinces. However, the vote was heavily divided by region. In Flanders, 72 per cent voted in favour of Leopold's return, but in the arrondissement of Brussels, the Leopoldists won only a minority of 48 per cent. In Wallonia a mere 42 per cent voted for the restitution of the King. The final results, in percentages by province, were: The result confirmed the worries of some, including Spaak, that the vote would not be sufficiently decisive in either direction and could divide the country along regional and linguistic lines. On 13 March, Eyskens traveled to Pregny to attempt to encourage Leopold to abdicate. Paul Van Zeeland and Spaak attempted to broker a new agreement by which Leopold would abdicate in favour of his son. On 15 April 1950, Leopold announced that he was willing to temporarily delegate his authority. Many within the PSC‚ÄìCVP realised that, despite the referendum's result, their party's lack of a parliamentary majority would undermine their ability to build a national reconciliation around the King as long as their Liberal coalition partners and Socialist opponents were unwilling to accept the King's return. =Leopold's return to Belgium= On 29 April 1950, Charles dissolved parliament pending fresh elections. His intention was probably to prevent the formation of a PSC‚ÄìCVP government under Van Zeeland, a staunch Leopoldist, which would lead to the return of the King without further discussion. The following election produced an absolute PSC‚ÄìCVP majority in both Chamber and Senate, and a new single- party government under Jean Duvieusart was formed. One of the first acts of the Duvieusart government was to introduce a bill bringing the \\"impossibility to reign\\" to an end. On 22 July 1950, Leopold returned to Belgium for the first time since June 1944 and resumed his functions. =General strike and abdication= Gr√¢ce-Berleur, near Li√®ge, commemorating the four workers shot dead by Belgian police on 30 July 1950 In 1949, the FGTB‚ÄìABVV voted a special budget of ten million Belgian francs to establish a Committee of Common Action (Comit√© d'action commune) aimed at supporting strike action taken in event of the King's return. The union took the lead in the opposition which emerged in the summer of 1950. Andr√© Renard, a Walloon trade union leader, called for \\"insurrection\\" and \\"revolution\\" in the newspaper La Wallonie shortly after the King's return in July 1950. Modern historians have noted that \\"the smell of revolution was on the air\\" as Walloon nationalists called for the immediate secession of Wallonia and the creation of a republic. The general strike of 1950 began in the coal mining centres of Hainaut and quickly spread. Workers were soon on strike across Wallonia, Brussels, and, to a lesser extent, Flanders. The port of Antwerp was one of the key sites affected and the country was virtually paralysed. On 30 July, four workers were shot dead by the Gendarmerie at Gr√¢ce-Berleur, near Li√®ge and the violence intensified. Staunch Leopoldists in the Government called for a stronger stance but found themselves in a minority, even in the PSC‚ÄìCVP. Frustrated at the lack of progress, the Government threatened to resign en masse. As the situation escalated, the National Confederation of Political Prisoners and their Dependents (Conf√©d√©ration nationale des prisonniers politiques et des ayants droit, Nationale Confederatie van Politieke Gevangenen en Rechthebbenden, or CNPPA‚ÄìNCPGR), the organisation representing political prisoners detained during the German occupation, offered to act as intermediaries between the different parties because of their respected status. The CNPPA‚ÄìNCPGR succeeded in persuading both the King and the Government to reopen negotiations which resumed on 31 July. In the afternoon on 1 August, Leopold publicly announced his intention to abdicate in favour of his eldest son, Baudouin, to avoid further bloodshed. Baudouin, at the age of 19, became regent, with the title of \\"prince royal\\" on 11 August 1950. Accession of Baudouin, 1951 King Baudouin, photographed in 1960, who succeeded Leopold in 1951 Leopold's abdication message of 1 August 1950 was premised on a reconciliation in the person of his eldest son over the course of a year. Baudouin was seen by most parties as an acceptable alternative candidate. Under a law of 11 August, executive powers were transferred to Baudouin in advance of the official abdication. Leopold formally abdicated on 16 July 1951. His son succeeded him the following day. =Assassination of Julien Lahaut= On 11 August 1950, as Baudouin was taking the oath of allegiance to the Constitution in front of the Parliament, an unidentified individual in the Communist benches shouted \\"vive la r√©publique!\\" (\\"Long Live the Republic!\\"). The interruption caused outrage. It was widely suspected that the culprit was Julien Lahaut, the noted Communist leader who had been one of the leading opponents of Leopold's return. A week later (18 August), Lahaut was shot dead by an unidentified assassin outside his house in Seraing, near Li√®ge. The murder shocked the Belgian public and an estimated 200,000 people attended Lahaut's funeral. Although no-one was ever prosecuted for the murder, it was widely attributed to clandestine Leopoldist militia like the Ligue Eltrois or the Bloc anticommuniste belge who operated with the knowledge of the security services. Aftermath and significance In the aftermath of the Royal Question, national priorities shifted to other political questions. On 17 September 1950, the government of Joseph Pholien announced its intention of dispatching Belgian volunteers to fight in the Korean War. Negotiations about the European Defence Community followed and, by the mid-1950s, Belgium was immersed in a new political crisis, known as the Second School War, surrounding the secularisation of education. In August 1960 Baudouin informed Prime Minister Gaston Eyskens that he did not have confidence in his government and asked for his resignation. Eyskens refused and challenged the King to invoke Article 65 of the Constitution and unilaterally revoke his ministerial mandate. Fearing that such an action would reopen the Royal Question, Baudouin yielded. Modern historians describe the Royal Question as an important moment in Belgian recovery after World War II. The opposition between Leopoldists and anti-Leopoldists led to the re-establishment of Socialist and Catholic political parties from before the war. The Question was also an important moment in the Belgian linguistic conflict. It also put an end to the federalisation of Belgian institutions which might exacerbate the regional tensions exposed by the Royal Question. In addition, the perceived failure of the PSC‚ÄìCVP to realise Flemish demands for the return of Leopold helped to strengthen support for the Flemish nationalist Volksunie party after 1954. In Wallonia, the legacy of trade union and socialist political mobilisation during the general strike paved the way for a left-wing revival of the Walloon Movement, eventually witnessed in the Belgian general strike of 1960‚Äì1961. The Lahaut assassination was not solved, and it remains contentious as the only political murder in Belgian history apart from the death of the socialist politician Andr√© Cools in 1991. Leopoldists were suspected, but no individual was prosecuted in the aftermath. An enquiry by historians Rudy Van Doorslaer and Etienne Verhoeyen named an alleged culprit. A final report, commissioned by the Belgian government, was submitted in 2015.
