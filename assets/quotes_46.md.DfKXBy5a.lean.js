Anatomy The annular ligament is attached by both its ends to the anterior and posterior margins of the radial notch of the ulna, together with which it forms the articular surface that surrounds the head and neck of the radius. The ligament is strong and well defined, yet its flexibility permits the slightly oval head of the radius to rotate freely during pronation and supination. The head of the radius is wider than the bone's neck, and, because the annular ligament embraces both, the radial head is \\"trapped\\" inside the ligament which thus acts to prevent distal displacement of the radius. Superiorly, the ligament is supported by attachments to the radial collateral ligament and the fibrous capsule of the elbow joint. Inferiorly, a few fibres attached to the neck of the radius support a fold of the synovial membrane without interfering with the movements at the joint. The fibrocartilage on the upper part of the ligament is continuous with the hyaline cartilage of the radial notch. At the posterior attachment the ligament widens to reach above and below the radial notch. A thickened band which extends from the inferior border of the annular ligament below the radial notch to the neck of the radius is known as the quadrate ligament. Clinical significance Children who have not finished fusing their proximal radial epiphyseal plate may suffer dislocations of this joint, called pulled elbow or Nursemaid's elbow. This frequently happens when parents sharply jerk their children by their arms, e.g. the act of grabbing a child away from traffic.

The species was described in 1908 by John Muirhead Macfarlane based on a specimen collected from the island of Nias, which lies off the western coast of Sumatra. It appears to be closely related to both N. longifolia and N. sumatrana, and the former is possibly a heterotypic synonym of this taxon.Clarke, C.M. 2001. Nepenthes of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. Botanical history The type specimen of N. beccariana was collected by Italian explorer Elio Modigliani during an 1886 expedition to Nias,van Steenis-Kruseman, M.J., et al. 2006. Cyclopaedia of Malesian Collectors: Elio Modigliani. Nationaal Herbarium Nederland. an island located approximately 120 km from the port town of Sibolga in Sumatra. It is designated as E.Modigliani s.n. and is specimen FI-HB 7485 at the Herbarium Beccarianum in Florence, Italy.Schlauer, J. 2006. Nepenthes beccariana. Carnivorous Plant Database. The type specimen consists of fragments of three leaves and three pitchers (two rosette pitchers and one upper pitcher) and is in a damaged state, with the leaves separated from the stem in such a way that their form of attachment is unknown. Nepenthes beccariana was formally described by John Muirhead Macfarlane in his 1908 monograph, \\"Nepenthaceae\\". It is named in honour of Italian naturalist Odoardo Beccari. Macfarlane's description includes a line drawing of N. beccariana, showing a leaf blade, a lower pitcher, and an upper pitcher. It has been suggested that the upper pitcher in this illustration actually represents a composite, with features of both lower and upper pitchers. Twenty years later, B. H. Danser synonymised the taxon with N. mirabilis in his seminal monograph, \\"The Nepenthaceae of the Netherlands Indies\\". With regards to the taxonomic status of N. beccariana, Danser wrote:Danser, B.H. 1928. The Nepenthaceae of the Netherlands Indies. Bulletin du Jardin Botanique de Buitenzorg, Série III, 9(3–4): 249–438. > N. tubulosa and N.

Illustration of N. beccariana from Macfarlane's 1908 monograph However, Danser never saw the type specimen of N. beccariana; his inclusion of the taxon within N. mirabilis was based solely on herbarium material. In their 1997 monograph, \\"A skeletal revision of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae)\\", Matthew Jebb and Martin Cheek included N. beccariana as a synonym of N. mirabilis, having not examined the type specimen either.Jebb, M.H.P. & M.R. Cheek 1997. A skeletal revision of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae). Blumea 42(1): 1–106. The authors retained this synonymy in their 2001 monograph, \\"Nepenthaceae\\".Cheek, M.R. & M.H.P. Jebb 2001. Nepenthaceae. Flora Malesiana 15: 1–157. In 2000, Jan Schlauer and C. Nepi examined the type specimen of N. beccariana and noted significant differences between it and N. mirabilis, suggesting that it should be restored as a distinct species.Schlauer, J. & C. Nepi 2000. Notes on Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae). II. Lectotypification of names based on material represented in the Herbarium Beccarianum. Webbia 55: 1–5. In Nepenthes of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia, Charles Clarke agreed that N. beccariana appears to be distinct from both N. mirabilis and N. sumatrana, but noted that if N. beccariana is found to be conspecific with N. longifolia, the latter taxon would become a heterotypic synonym of the former.Clarke, C.M. 2006. Introduction. In: Danser, B.H. The Nepenthaceae of the Netherlands Indies. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. pp. 1–15. Description The stem of N. beccariana is glabrous and 10 to 12 mm wide. A lower pitcher of N. cf. beccariana with sympatric N. ampullaria and N. gracilis Leaves are subcoriaceous and petiolate. The lamina or leaf blade is elliptic-lanceolate to obovate in shape. It is up to 40 cm long by 9 cm wide. The petiole is 7 to 10 cm long and winged. It is semi-amplexicaul, with the lower wings being slightly expanded. Tendrils are 25 to 35 cm long. Rosette and lower pitchers are up to 18 cm long by 5 cm wide. The peristome is up to 15 mm wide. The pitcher lid or operculum is ovate-cordate and up to 7 cm long by 5 cm wide. A filiform, club-shaped spur up to 15 mm long is inserted near the base of the lid. The cylindrical upper pitchers are larger than their lower counterparts, growing to 30 cm high by 6 cm wide. Flowers and fruits are unknown. No forms or varieties of N. beccariana have been described. Ecology Nepenthes beccariana is known with certainty only from the type locality on the island of Nias, where the type specimen was collected. This population has not been knowingly observed since its discovery by Modigliani and no photographs of it are known to exist.McPherson, S.R. & A. Robinson 2012. Field Guide to the Pitcher Plants of Sumatra and Java. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. Plants that resemble N. beccariana and may be conspecific with it grow along the road from Sibolga to Tarutung in North Sumatra. This unidentified taxon is sympatric with N. ampullaria, N. gracilis, N. rafflesiana, N. reinwardtiana, and N. tobaica. A putative natural hybrid with N. sumatrana has been recorded. The conservation status of N. beccariana has not been formally assessed and it is not listed on the 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.Nepenthes. 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. IUCN 2006. Retrieved on 9 May 2008. Related species Nepenthes beccariana is closely related to N. longifolia and N. sumatrana, and may be conspecific with the former. The extent of the variation in N. beccariana and N. longifolia is unknown, making them difficult to circumscribe. Observations of N. beccariana at the type locality would need to be carried out to resolve this taxonomic confusion. Despite sharing a number of morphological features with N. sumatrana, N. beccariana is difficult to confuse with this species. Nepenthes sumatrana is distinguished by its infundibular upper pitchers (versus cylindrical in N. beccariana), which have a raised section at the front of the peristome. In addition, the ovoid lower pitchers of N. sumatrana have orbicular lids, as opposed to the ovate operculum of N. beccariana. The unidentified taxon (N. cf. beccariana) that grows along the road from Sibolga to Tarutung is similar to N. longifolia, but is atypical of the species. It differs from the type form of N. longifolia in that the petioles are not decurrent into a pair of wings over the internodes and some of the hairs lining the leaf margins are caducous. The plants also differ in ecology; the unidentified taxon grows in both exposed sites and amongst dense vegetation, while N. longifolia is generally found in dense forest.

The taxon originally named N. junghuhnii by John Muirhead Macfarlane has never been formally published (Henry Nicholas Ridley's N. junghuhnii is a heterotypic synonym of N. singalana). In 1994, taxonomist Jan Schlauer described N. junghuhnii as a \\"rather dubious species based on insufficient specimens\\".Schlauer, J. 1994. NEPENTHES comments for Flora Malesiana.

Šuto Orizari is also the name of the urban neighbourhood where the municipal seat is located. It consists of a council and mayor. Šuto Orizari covers 7.48 km² and had 17,357 inhabitants in 2002. It is the second smallest municipality of Skopje behind Čair and the least populated. Created ex-nihilo after the 1963 Skopje earthquake to relocate Romas who had lost their house, Šuto Orizari remains the only municipality in North Macedonia with a Romani majority. In 2002, they represented almost 80% of the population, which also included small numbers of Albanians and ethnic Macedonians. Šuto Orizari is the only local administrative unit in the world to have adopted Romani as an official language. History For much of its history, Šuto Orizari was a small village in the country, as were neighbouring Butel and Vizbegovo. Its name derives from orizar (оризар), the Macedonian word for paddy field. It is only after the 1963 Skopje earthquake that the area became urbanised. Through the 20th century, Skopje had greatly expanded: while it had only 41,000 inhabitants in 1921, it had reached 166,870 in 1961. As a result, the area around Šuto Orizari was slowly becoming part of the city. Before the earthquake, most of Skopje's Romani community lived in areas close to the Old Bazaar. The largest one is Topaana, located close to the fortress and home to Roma people since at least the 14th century. Built in cheap materials, Topaana and the other Roma settlements were severely damaged by the earthquake which destroyed around 80% of the whole city. Thanks to international aid, the reconstruction started quickly after the earthquake. Local authorities took the opportunity to rebuild Skopje as a functional and modern city, privileging large blocks of flats and dividing Skopje into areas dedicated to specific uses. As they also had to build new accommodation for the large Roma minority, they first considered the reconstruction as a way to assimilate them and resolve unemployment and sanitary problems that concerned that population. Most of the Roma population refused to live in the new buildings and authorities eventually decided to give them a specific neighbourhood where they could build the houses they wished. The first buildings to appear were iron shacks donated by the United States. They were planned for temporary use, but some still remain more than 40 years after the earthquake. Most of the Romani community of Šutka is still facing unemployment and hard living conditions, although some of them manage to build large houses with the money they get as seasonal workers in Western Europe. The Roma houses in Šutka are built with solid materials and have fenced gardens. The area does not give the same impression of marginality as do older Romani neighbourhoods such as Topaana. Šuto Orizari became a distinct municipality in 1996. Geography Šuto Orizari Šuto Orizari is located to the North of central Skopje, at approximately 5 km of Macedonia Square. The municipality is at the northern edge of the urban unit \\"Skopje encompasses ten municipalities (Aerodrom, Butel, Čair, Centar, Gazi Baba, Gjorče Petrov, Karpoš, Kisela Voda, Saraj, Šuto Orizari), which all have a mayor, a municipal council and the same prerogatives as other municipalities in the country.\\" and comprises some agricultural land. To the south, Šuto Orizari is bordered by Butel, another municipality of Skopje. To the north, it is bordered by Čučer-Sandevo, a rural municipality. The municipality comprises three distinct settlements: Šuto Orizari proper, Dolno Orizari and Gorno Orizari. The first is an urban neighbourhood forming part of the urban unit and located inside the Skopje bypass. The second is a small village which comprised only 454 inhabitants in 2002. It is located north of the bypass. Gorno Orizari is located between Šuto Orizari proper and the rest of the city. The municipality is separated from the rest of Skopje by the Serava, a small river tributary to the Vardar, by Slovenia boulevard and by the Skopje-Pristina railway. The nearest train station is Skopje-Sever (\\"Skopje-North\\"), located in Butel. To the west Šuto Orizari is bordered by the village of Vizbegovo, and to the east by the Butel cemetery, the largest in Skopje. Demographics Entrance to the town market Šuto Orizari is the only municipality in the country where Romani make up a majority of the population. Out of a total population of 17,357 in the 2002 census, 13,311 people (76.6%) were of Roma ethnicity. Other significant ethnic groups include Albanians (2,594 or 14.9%) and Macedonians (962 or 5.5%). During the recent conflict in Kosovo many Romani refugees found shelter here. The overwhelming majority of the inhabitants are Muslims. Most of the Romani population originates from the relocation of families after the 1963 Skopje earthquake. They were later followed by many other families coming from Skopje and other towns in North Macedonia. Romani language is spoken in a large number of dialects and several ones coexist in Skopje. They usually correspond to a single area (Topaanli, Barutči, Gilanska, Prištivačija, etc.) but as the Romani population in Šutka came in recent times and from many neighbourhoods, several dialects are used there and tend to assemble. According to the 2002 census, the exact composition of the population was: * Šuto Orizari Municipality (17,357 inhabitants): ** 13,311 (76.6%) Romani ; ** 2,594 (14.9%) Albanians ; ** 962 (5.5%) Macedonians ; ** 138 Bosniaks ; ** 55 Turks ; ** 44 Serbs ; ** 253 other. * Šuto Orizari settlement (15,353 inhabitants): ** 13,201 Romani ; ** 1,205 Albanians ; ** 481 Macedonians ; ** 138 Bosniaks ; ** 49 Turks ; ** 34 Serbs ; ** 245 other. * Gorno Orizari village (454 inhabitants): ** 444 Macedonians ; ** 9 Serbs ; ** 1 other. * Dolno Orizari village (1550 inhabitants): ** 1389 Albanians ; ** 110 Romani ; ** 37 Macedonians ; ** 6 Turks ; ** 1 Serb ; ** 7 other. Politics A political party office in Šuto Orizari The municipality of Šuto Orizari was founded in 1996 following a law on local administration. The creation of a Romani municipality was a move to further emancipate and empower Romani people in the Republic of North Macedonia. At first, many of its inhabitants were skeptical of the project, as they feared the local budget would be too low to run the municipality properly. The first mayor, Nezdet Mustafa, was elected together with his council in autumn 1996 and the municipality became effective in January 1997. As anywhere in the Republic of North Macedonia, Macedonian is the official language. As an ethnic minority forms more than 20% of the population, its language is also official in the municipality, thus both Romani and Macedonian are official languages in Šuto Orizari. Albanian is also spoken, but is not an official language. The mayor of the municipality, Kurto Dudush, is Romani. In 2009, the Government of the Republic of North Macedonia took further measures to enlarge inclusion of Romani in the education process. The cornerstone of a government-funded secondary school for Šuto Orizari was laid on 10 February 2009, an investment worth 1.6 million euros. Culture As it is the largest Romani settlement in North Macedonia, Šuto Orizari is home to several cultural institutions dedicated to Roma people. There are for instance a cinema and an amateur theatre company, Theater Roma. It was also home to the Phralipe theatre company, founded in 1970 and a pioneer in Romani theatre, before it moved to Germany in 1990. Šuto Orizari is the set of two films: Time of the Gypsies by Emir Kusturica (1988) and The Shutka Book of Records by Aleksandar Manic (2005).

It resulted in the death of several hundred Amerindians, Roman Catholic priests connected with the mission of San Francisco de los Arenales, the Spanish Governor José de León y Echales and all but one member of his party. Amerindians tied to the Church's encomienda at the mission at Arena revolted, killing the priests and desecrating the church. They then ambushed the governor and his party, who were on their way to visit the church. Among those killed in the governor's party was Fr.Juan Mazien de Sotomayor, O.P., missionary priest to the Nepuyo villages of Cuara, Tacarigua and Arouca. One member of the governor's party managed to escape the attackers and returned to San Jose where he raised the alarm. Aftermath The rebels hastily buried the bodies of the monks, threw the governor's body into the river and headed for the coast. They were pursued by the Spaniards who overtook them at Comcal and drove them to Cocal. Many dived into the sea in preference to being captured. Eighty four rebels were captured and sixty one of them were shot. The surviving indigenes were interrogated via torture. Many of the tortured revealed that they were often beaten by the priests for not attending church services. The twenty two identified as ringleaders were hanged on 14 January 1700 at San José de Oruña, the capital of the colony, and their dismembered bodies displayed. The women of the tribe were distributed among the Spanish households as servants. Miracles In April 1701 a party set out to recover the bodies of the Capuchin monks. According to the official history of the Capuchins, written by Fr. Mateo de Anguiano in 1704, the ground was still wet with fresh blood, and the bodies of the monks were uncorrupted, bleeding from their wounds when they were moved. The bodies were taken to the main church where they lay in state for nine days. In 1885 Dominican Fr. Cothonay claimed to have found the site of the Mission of San Francisco de los Arenales. In addition to physical evidence he cited Amerindian traditions that on Holy Thursday and Good Friday every year, \\"remarkable things happened\\" and some claimed to have heard voices, talking and singing, a priest saying Mass and people praying.

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif claimed that the Institute for Science and International Security's analysis of satellite imagery was lies. In August 2015, the IAEA announced that a small extension to an existing building seems to have been built in Parchin. On 20 September 2015, Director-General Yukiya Amano of the IAEA went to Parchin, along with Director of Safeguards Tero Varjoranta, to obtain clarifications on the nuclear activities of the site. The next day, Amano professed satisfaction with the samples taken by the Iranians themselves and handed over to the IAEA under \\"established procedures\\". IAEA experts were not physically present during the sampling, but Amano said the procedure meets \\"strict agency criteria\\" that ensure \\"the integrity of the sampling process and the authenticity of the samples.\\" What follows is a verbatim quote of the IAEA report on the September 2015 visit to Parchin: =2015 proof of nuclear weapons programme= In June 2016, IAEA investigators reported to the Wall Street Journal that they had found in December 2015 traces of uranium at the Parchin facility, establishing the first physical evidence of a nuclear weapons programme at the missile complex site, which was nicely displayed in the reference article by satellite photograph. = 26 June 2020 explosion = In the early morning of 26 June 2020, an explosion occurred close to the military base in Parchin. According to the Defense ministry spokesman Davoud Abdi, it was due to \\"a gas leak\\" at a \\"gas storage facility\\" near the base. In news that was released the next day by the Associated Press, Sentinel-2 satellite images show signs of a vast blackened area in the hills located next to the ammunitions facility and the cruise missile factory at Khojir missile base, which is evidence of an explosion and fire that lit up the night sky in Tehran. On 29 June, the New York Times accused the Iranian government of lying that the blast happened at Parchin, because satellite photographs show the explosion happened at the adjacent Khojir missile production facility. Collaborations There have been reports of collaborations between Parchin and Imam Hossein University. References External links * Timeline of Iran's Nuclear Activities – The Iran Primer.

An account of the Nepenthes species of Vietnam. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 45(3): 93–101. Nepenthes smilesii can tolerate an extended dry season and is most common in open, sandy savannah and grassland. The specific epithet smilesii refers to plant collector Frederick Henry Smiles, who made the first known collection of this species. Botanical history Nepenthes anamensis is a heterotypic synonym of N. smilesii. Its conservation status appears as Data Deficient on the IUCN Red List. Nepenthes smilesii was referred to as N. anamensis throughout most of the 20th century. Further confusion resulted from the erroneous labelling of N. smilesii plants as N. thorelii in the horticultural trade. In Pitcher Plants of the Old World, Stewart McPherson lists N. mirabilis f. smilesii and N. mirabilis var. smilesii as synonyms of N. smilesii, but Marcello Catalano considers these to represent normal forms of N. mirabilis. Description Nepenthes smilesii is a climbing plant growing to a height of 5 m. Its leaves are sessile and coriaceous (leathery) in texture. They are very narrowly linear, reaching 40 cm in length while only up to 4 cm wide. Ecology In Kirirom National Park, Cambodia (~700 m asl) Nepenthes smilesii has a widespread distribution throughout Indochina. It has been recorded from Cambodia, northeastern Thailand, southern Laos, and western Vietnam. The species occurs across a wide range of altitudes, being recorded from elevations of 16–1500 m above sea level, although it is more typically found at around 800 m. Nepenthes smilesii is notable among the Indochinese Nepenthes for experiencing extreme lows of temperature. Individual specimens of a natural hybrid between N. smilesii and N. mirabilis have been recorded from Cambodia.Mey, F.S., L.H. Truong, D.V. Dai & A.S. Robinson 2011.

Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. pp. 104–131. Related species Nepenthes smilesii appears most closely allied to N. kongkandana and may be difficult to distinguish from that species. It differs primarily in the shape of its laminae, which are linear to lanceolate with an acute apex, as opposed to obovate with an acuminate apex in the latter. Nepenthes smilesii also differs in having shorter tendrils and a narrower peristome. Notes :a.Nepenthes anamensis is pronounced . The specific epithet is derived from Annam, a former territory in central Vietnam. References Further reading * Beveridge, N.G.P., C. Rauch, P.J.A. Keßler, R.R. van Vugt & P.C. van Welzen 2013.

Readings are made at each kilometer above sea level, up to the extent of the troposphere (i.e., between 8 and 17 km above mean sea level). Above this level there is inadequate water vapor present to produce a radar \\"bounce.\\" The data synthesized from wind direction and speed is very useful to meteorological forecasting and timely reporting for flight planning. A twelve-hour history of data is available through NOAA websites. Principle Orientation of the beams in the case of a three tilted wind profiler In a typical implementation, the radar or sodar can sample along each of five beams: one is aimed vertically to measure vertical velocity, and four are tilted off vertical and oriented orthogonal to one another to measure the horizontal components of the air's motion. A profiler's ability to measure winds is based on the assumption that the turbulent eddies that induce scattering are carried along by the mean wind. The energy scattered by these eddies and received by the profiler is orders of magnitude smaller than the energy transmitted. However, if sufficient samples can be obtained, then the amplitude of the energy scattered by these eddies can be clearly identified above the background noise level, then the mean wind speed and direction within the volume being sampled can be determined. The radial components measured by the tilted beams are the vector sum of the horizontal motion of the air toward or away from the radar and any vertical motion present in the beam. Using appropriate trigonometry, the three-dimensional meteorological velocity components (u,v,w) and wind speed and wind direction are calculated from the radial velocities with corrections for vertical motions. Radar wind profiler A radar wind profiler. plotted wind from a profiler. Reflectivity data obtained as a byproduct on a typical radar wind profiler. Pulse-Doppler radar wind profilers operate using electromagnetic (EM) signals to remotely sense winds aloft. The radar transmits an electromagnetic pulse along each of the antenna's pointing directions. A UHF profiler includes subsystems to control the radar's transmitter, receiver, signal processing, and Radio Acoustic Sounding System (RASS), if provided, as well as data telemetry and remote control. The duration of the transmission determines the length of the pulse emitted by the antenna, which in turn corresponds to the volume of air illuminated (in electrical terms) by the radar beam. Small amounts of the transmitted energy are scattered back (referred to as backscattering) toward and received by the radar. Delays of fixed intervals are built into the data processing system so that the radar receives scattered energy from discrete altitudes, referred to as range gates. The Doppler frequency shift of the backscattered energy is determined, and then used to calculate the velocity of the air toward or away from the radar along each beam as a function of altitude. The source of the backscattered energy (radar “targets”) is small-scale turbulent fluctuations that induce irregularities in the radio refractive index of the atmosphere. The radar is most sensitive to scattering by turbulent eddies whose spatial scale is ½ the wavelength of the radar, or approximately 16 centimeters (cm) for a UHF profiler. A boundary-layer radar wind profiler can be configured to compute averaged wind profiles for periods ranging from a few minutes to an hour. Boundary-layer radar wind profilers are often configured to sample in more than one mode. For example, in a “low mode,” the pulse of energy transmitted by the profiler may be 60 m in length. The pulse length determines the depth of the column of air being sampled and thus the vertical resolution of the data. In a “high mode,” the pulse length is increased, usually to 100 m or greater. The longer pulse length means that more energy is being transmitted for each sample, which improves the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the data. Using a longer pulse length increases the depth of the sample volume and thus decreases the vertical resolution in the data. The greater energy output of the high mode increases the maximum altitude to which the radar wind profiler can sample, but at the expense of coarser vertical resolution and an increase in the altitude at which the first winds are measured. When radar wind profilers are operated in multiple modes, the data are often combined into a single overlapping data set to simplify postprocessing and data validation procedures. Radar wind profilers may also have additional uses, for example in a biological context to complement large-scale bird monitoring schemes. Sodar wind profiler The TRITON transportable SODAR system used to measure wind profiles from Second Wind. Alternatively, a wind profiler may use sound waves to measure wind speed at various heights above the ground, and the thermodynamic structure of the lower layer of the atmosphere. These sodars can be divided in mono-static system using the same antenna for transmitting and receiving, and bi-static system using separate antennas. The difference between the two antenna systems determines whether atmospheric scattering is by temperature fluctuations (in mono-static systems), or by both temperature and wind velocity fluctuations (in bi-static systems). Mono-static antenna systems can be divided further into two categories: those using multiple axis, individual antennas and those using a single phased array antenna. The multiple-axis systems generally use three individual antennas aimed in specific directions to steer the acoustic beam. One antenna is generally aimed vertically, and the other two are tilted slightly from the vertical at an orthogonal angle. Each of the individual antennas may use a single transducer focused into a parabolic reflector to form a parabolic loudspeaker, or an array of speaker drivers and horns (transducers) all transmitting in-phase to form a single beam. Both the tilt angle from the vertical and the azimuth angle of each antenna are fixed when the system is set up. The vertical range of sodars is approximately 0.2 to 2 kilometers (km) and is a function of frequency, power output, atmospheric stability, turbulence, and, most importantly, the noise environment in which a sodar is operated. Operating frequencies range from less than 1000 Hz to over 4000 Hz, with power levels up to several hundred watts. Due to the attenuation characteristics of the atmosphere, high power, lower frequency sodars will generally produce greater height coverage. Some sodars can be operated in different modes to better match vertical resolution and range to the application. This is accomplished through a relaxation between pulse length and maximum altitude.

Life and work He was born in Blayney, New South Wales, and grew up in West Wyalong where his father worked as bank manager. His observances of life in depression era country Australia were to become important to his later writing, and in particular to the folk tales for which he became famous in the 1940s and 1950s. Stivens served in the army during the second world war, on the staff of the Australian Department of Information. He moved to England after the war and was press officer at Australia House in London until 1950. Upon his return to Australia he became a tireless worker for the rights of authors based on the work he had observed from the Society of Authors in England. He was Foundation President of the Australian Society of Authors, in 1963Goodwin (1986) p. 307, 164 and was involved in the creation of the Public Lending Right in 1975. He was also a keen semi-amateur naturalist, producing an important work in that discipline, The Incredible Egg from 1974, and having published numerous articles in major American natural journals. He gave up writing in the mid 1970s in favour of art, and from 1974 he painted a substantial amount of his time, earning a small retrospective in the magazine, Australian Art in the late 70s. Stivens was widely read through the forties and fifties, with his stories being heavily anthologized and included in many school readers of the time. He won the Miles Franklin Award for best Australian novel in 1970 for A Horse of Air and was winner of the Patrick White Award for 1981 for his contribution to Australian literature. In 1994, he was honoured with a Special Achievement Award in the NSW Premier's Literary Awards. Stivens also wrote under a number of stories and many newspaper articles under the pseudonyms Jack Tarrant, John Sidney, Sam Johnson and L'Arva Street. Stivens died in Sydney on 15 June 1997 after many years of domesticity in Lindfield, NSW, with Juanita Cragen, to whom he left his literary estate. On her death in 2007, Juanita left the estate to the Australian Society of Authors as the Dal Stivens Bequest. His papers are now held by the National Library of Australia in Canberra.

Ruritanian romance is a genre of literature, film and theatre comprising novels, stories, plays and films set in a fictional country, usually in Central or Eastern Europe, such as the \\"Ruritania\\" that gave the genre its name. Such stories are typically swashbuckling adventure novels, tales of high romance and intrigue, centered on the ruling classes, almost always aristocracy and royalty,John Clute and John Grant, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, p. 826 although (for instance) Winston Churchill's novel Savrola, in every other way a typical example of the genre, concerns a revolution to restore rightful parliamentary government in the republican country of Laurania. The themes of honor, loyalty and love predominate, and the works frequently feature the restoration of legitimate government after a period of usurpation or dictatorship. History of the genre Romantic stories about the royalty of a fictional kingdom were common, for instance Robert Louis Stevenson's Prince Otto (1885). But it was the great popularity of Anthony Hope's The Prisoner of Zenda (1894) which set the type, with its handsome political decoy restoring the rightful king to the throne, and resulted in a burst of similar popular fiction, such as George Barr McCutcheon's Graustark novels (1901–27) and Frances Hodgson Burnett's The Lost Prince (1915), Edgar Rice Burrough's _The Mad King_ of Lutha (1914), and other homages.Prisoner of Zenda In children's literature, the 1938-39 The Adventures of Tintin comic King Ottokar's Sceptre eschewed literal romance, but is an adventure about foiling a plot to depose the king of Syldavia. Literary critic John Sutherland says Eric Ambler brought the Ruritarian romance to \\"its highest pitch\\" with his 1939 novel The Mask of Dimitrios.Sutherland, John. Bestsellers: A Very Short Introduction, Oxford University Press (2007), p. 113 The genre was widely spoofed and mocked. George Bernard Shaw's Arms and the Man (1894) parodied many elements. Dorothy Sayers's Have His Carcase (1932) featured as the murder victim a man deceived by his murderers because of his foolish belief in his royal ancestry, fed by endless reading of Ruritanian romances. The Marx Brothers film Duck Soup (1933) is set in a bankrupt Freedonia. Antal Szerb's Oliver VII (1943) features a monarch of a fictional Central European state who plots a coup against himself and then flees to Venice in order to experience the life of an ordinary person. In the satire The Mouse That Roared (1955), the Duchy of Grand Fenwick attempts to avoid bankruptcy by declaring war on the United States as a ploy for gaining American aid. In Vladimir Nabokov's Pale Fire (1962), the main narrator has the delusion of being the incognito king of a \\"distant northern land\\" who romantically escaped a Soviet-backed revolution. Revised version in In the comic film The Great Race (1965), rally driver Professor Fate (played by Jack Lemmon) is the double of the Crown Prince of the tiny kingdom of Carpania. The popularity of the genre declined after the first part of the twentieth century. Aside from the change in literary taste, the royalist elements of Ruritanian romances became less plausible as many European monarchies receded even from memory, and their restorations grew less likely. Many elements of the genre have been transplanted into fantasy worlds, particularly those of fantasy of manners and alternate history. The science fiction writer Andre Norton first reached success with a 1934 Ruritanian novel, The Prince Commands.John Clute and John Grant, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy p. 827 Although \\"Ruritania\\" originally referred to a contemporary country, the idea has been adapted for use in historical fiction. A subgenre of this is historical romance, such as Jennifer Blake's Royal Seduction and its sequel Royal Passion; both are set in the nineteenth century and feature Prince Rolfe (later King) and his son Prince Roderic respectively, of the fictional Balkan country of Ruthenia. (Ruthenia is a genuine geographic name, identifying an area of eastern Europe somewhat to the north of the Balkan peninsula, in the Carpathian mountains, but is not an independent country.) Other Ruritanian settings in fiction The Grand Budapest Hotel, a 2014 comedy film written and directed by Wes Anderson, is set in the fictional nation of Zubrowka, a central European alpine state teetering on the outbreak of war. In 2015 James Dunford Wood's Continental with Juice imagined a scenario in which the modern- day Ruritania (a recent ex-Soviet republic) is bankrupt after the European debt crisis. Refused a loan by Germany's Chancellor Merkel, the country is forced to consider resurrecting the monarchy via the long-defunct Elpherg dynasty, in order to earn tourist dollars. Avram Davidson's Doctor Eszterhazy stories are set in a fictitious ramshackle Balkan empire resembling Austria- Hungary, but with Ruritanian characteristics. Ursula K. Le Guin set a number of short stories and a novel in the fictitious Eastern European land of \\"Orsinia\\",; ; and which has been identified as being simultaneously Ruritanian and naturalistic. Hayao Miyazaki's animated film The Castle of Cagliostro is set in the fictional country of Cagliostro, inspired by Riviera and Monaco. https://www.locusmag.com/2003/Reviews/Ward08_Miyazaki.htmlhttps://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/20/movies/film- anime-japanese-cinema-s-second-golden-age.html The Student Prince, an operetta, also adapted several times to film, has as its protagonist the heir apparent to the fictitious kingdom of Karlsberg who is sent away to the University of Heidelberg where he falls in love with a bar maid.

They are known for their strong phototropism response and helical growth of the sporangium. The best studied species is Phycomyces blakesleeanus. Asexual reproduction Phycomyces can reproduce via extension of mycelia, or by production of spores either asexually or sexually. The asexual cycle includes the formation of spore containing sporangia borne on the top of sporangiophores that may extend 10 to 15 cm above the surface of the fungal colony from which they emerged. The long filamentous sporangiophores respond to divergent environmental signals including light, gravity, wind, chemicals and adjacent objects. The sporangia contain vegetative spores with one to six haploid nuclei. These spores when dispersed can establish new colonies. Sexual reproduction Phycomyces have two mating types that are indistinguishable morphologically. The sexual cycle is thought to occur by the following steps. Two hyphae of different mating type encounter each other, and their tips undergo a septation event to produce gametangia. Gametangia are haploid multinuclear cells equivalent to gametes. The two gametangia fuse to form an immature zygospore. Initially the developing zygospore contains thousands of nuclei contributed by the gametangia. During the course of zygospore maturation and dormancy, lasting several months, most nuclei are degraded. It is thought that ordinarily two surviving nuclei, one from each parent, fuse to form a diploid cell which then undergoes meiosis to form haploid meiotic products. These then reproduce by mitotic divisions leading to the formation of a sporangium structure (germosporangium) that develops out from the zygospore. The germosporangium contains spores (germspores) that have one to six haploid nuclei like those in the vegetative sporangium.

The Chess Club, Dance Club, Gay-Straight Alliance, Robotics Club, Cyber Patriots, Christian Club, Physics Club, Peer Tutoring, Knitting Club, HOSA (Health Occupation Students of America), Interact Key Club, and Debate Club are a few other well-ran extracurricular clubs at the school. 11 Advanced Placement and many more honors courses are offered, with more coming soon. A.P. Courses offered include Psychology, Biology, Physics, Chemistry, AB/BC Calculus, American Literature and Language, Spanish Language, Music Theory, World History, U.S. History, and Economy and Government. All A.P. classes offer highly vigorous A.P. exams that can award students with up to 5 college credits. Many of LHS' A.P. teachers are praised for their proficiency in education and the care that they have for their students. Lincoln High School is 107 years old, thus having a rich history in Performing Arts and Music Education. Dance Classes, Theater and Drama, Marching Band, Symphonic Band, a Winter Color Guard program, and a traveled choir program are a few of the fine arts offered. Guitar, Piano and college level A.P. Music Theory are also taught by Music Directors David Hill and Cindy Hagman. In addition to this, there are several visual art classes, including ceramics. There is an extensive pathway of engineering electives funded and instituted by Project Lead the Way, and an extensive pathway of electives in Medical Sciences, Technology, and Agriculture. There is also a wood shop class, a diesel class, a welding class, essentials of technology, media and communication, digital audio, weight training, and more. Lincoln High School has updated its curriculum in keeping with the California Common Core Standards.  Concert, Elite, and Select choirs  = Choral Music Programs: Directed by Cindy Hagman =  Concert Choir  The Lincoln High School Concert Choir is the entry level choir at Lincoln High School, as it is open for enrollment for 9th-12th graders. The average class size is around 50 students, Although there is no prior musical knowledge required, students enrolled in this choir class will learn how to sing rhythms as well as basic musical sight reading. The Concert Choir performs at least once a semester at the Winter and Spring Concerts, usually performing a variety of music.  Elite Choir  The Lincoln High School Elite Choir is an audition-only choir at the high school. Though it is open to all grades, the majority of this class consists of grades 10-12. This higher level choir consists of around 50-60 talented students. The Elite Choir has a well- developed presence throughout the town as well as worldwide, as the choir performs regularly around the surrounding neighborhoods, as well as taking yearly spring trips to scenic destinations. Notably, the Elite Choir traveled in June 2016 to Prague, Czech Republic; Vienna and Salzburg, Austria; and Munich, Germany and performed in the esteemed St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna. Previously, the Elite Choir performed at the well-known Carnegie Hall with multiple other choirs. During the 2016-2017 school year, the Elite Choir will be performing at a competition in Disneyland. Music that has been previously performed by the Elite Choir includes \\"Seal Lullaby\\" by Eric Whitacre, \\"Daniel, Daniel Servant of the Lord\\" arranged by Undine S. Moore, and \\"Shut De Do\\" by Randy Stonehill.  Select Choir  The Lincoln High School Select Choir consists of a handful of members only taken from the Elite Choir (usually section leaders) and performs throughout the community at fundraisers and other events. The Select Choir is known colloquially as the \\"Traveling Choir\\", as the members of this choir have been seen performing in groups of varying sizes at many events, at one point up to 8 in one week. The Select Choir meets for an hour or more every week, as this is not a class offered at Lincoln High School, but rather an extracurricular type activity.  Marching, Pep, Concert and Jazz Bands and Color Guard  = Instrumental Music Programs: Directed by Mr. David Hill =  Marching Band, Pep Band, and Color Guard  The Lincoln High School Fighting Zebra Marching Band is a field band, parade band and color guard that participates in competitions throughout the Central Valley. The 2014-15 season saw about 85 members including two drum majors and 10 color guard. The 2013-14 season's show was \\"Mary Poppins\\", 2014-15 was \\"From the Darkness\\", and the 2015-16 season's show was \\"Anyway the Wind Blows\\", a compilation of Queen songs including the world- renowned \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\". Competitions have been attended in Stockton and at Folsom, Del Oro, and Oakmont High Schools. The marching band has a large hometown presence, performing at every home football game and marching parades throughout the year. The marching band also functions as a pep band during football and basketball games, constantly filling the stands with enthusiasm, cheering, and playing pep tunes such as \\"Land of 1000 Dances\\", \\"Zarathustra\\", \\"Go Big Blue\\", \\"ABC\\" by The Jackson 5. Some pieces performed are arranged by the band members themselves. The Star Spangled Banner is played before each game's beginning, and the drum-line often plays cadences than cause spontaneous outbreaks of dancing. Color guard enhances the visuals of the marching band. Rifle, saber, flag and ribbon techniques are taught to members of guard, and there is also a winter guard that's not affiliated with the marching band. Those who are not in marching band may join winter guard. The band has a two-week, nine hour pre-season in July that teaches new musicians how to march and allows the band to learn the drill and music. Weekly sectionals allow each instrument section to focus completely on their own music and to work on memorizing the show. Night Rehearsals are also scheduled to perfect the drill and the small details. Joining a marching band requires tremendous practice, focus and determination, and daily practices are held before school for an hour. All this practice and perfecting is well worth the time because being in a marching band is one of the most fun, most challenging, and most rewarding lifestyles that can be engaged in at a high school. Many of LHS' graduates continue on to play in college, join Drum Corps International, and/or pursue careers in music. Music is a lifestyle - and we're glad that LHS has such a great music program that fosters individual growth and self-improvement. The Marching Band's 2016 theme is \\"The Sounds of Liberty\\". The drill and music are based on the events of World War II and are arranged by Mr. Albert Medina of Glen Edwards Middle School.  Concert Band and Symphonic Band  The Lincoln High School Concert Band takes over when Marching Season ends, and students are introduced to more challenging, traditional music. The concert band has about six concerts a year, including a Christmas concert in December, District Band Day (a concert with all of the bands in the Western Placer Unified School District) in mid-March, a solo/ensemble concert in April, concerts in February and May, and graduation in early June. The ensemble also performs on their spring trips to places like Disneyland, California Adventure, San Francisco and the Pacific Western Concert Band Festival at the University of the Pacific. Throughout the year the band performs at rallies and other sporting events. Most recently, the band performed at the Pacific Western Concert Band Festival (hosted by Dr. Eric Hammer) and received a review clinic/conductor's adjudication, watched other bands perform, and attended special-interest classes like conducting, music therapy, afro-Cuban percussion, a campus tour, yoga, and others. To end the festival, UOP's wind ensemble performs, which inspires many of the attending musicians. The band next traveled to San Francisco to tour The California Academy of Sciences and Fisherman's Wharf. Symphonic Band is a course for more advanced players in the music program. Music will meet the California Advanced Standards, and daily practice will be expected. In addition to their own concerts, Symphonic Band may compete in competitions and other events.  Jazz Band  Lincoln High's Jazz Band is a daily zero- period class during Semester 2. Students are taught advanced improvisation and swing skills, and have many opportunities throughout the season for solos, duets, trios, and other arrangements. The jazz band performs three concerts a year, in addition to providing entertainment at local events and fundraisers. All members of the jazz band are in concert band or marching band.

German journalist and poet. Known for his völkisch worldview, he has been seen as a harbinger of Nazi anti- Semitism.Roderick Stackelberg, \\"Bartels, Adolf\\", in Antisemitism : a historical encyclopedia of prejudice and persecution, edited by Richard S. Levy. ABC-CLIO, Santa Barbara, 2005, (p. 59-60). Bartels was born at Wesselburen, in Holstein, and educated at Leipzig and Berlin. An artisan's son, Bartels studied literature. After 1895 a free-lance journalist in Weimar, he gained a reputation as a Hebbel scholar. In 1897 he wrote a history of German literature that was marked by racist evaluations and rabid antisemitism; it became a pioneering work for National Socialist literary reviews. According to Bartels, even authors whose names sounded Jewish, who wrote for the \\"Jewish press\\", or who were friendly with Jews were \\"contaminated with Jewishness\\". The noblest task of völkisch cultural policy would therefore be a radical de-Jewing of the arts, and thus the \\"salvation of National Socialist Germany\\" (; 1924). Bartels led a successful campaign to prevent the unveiling of a statue of Heinrich Heine in 1906. After World War One, Bartels' work experienced an upsurge in popularity, with his followers forming the Bartelsbund (Bartels Society) to promote his ideas; the Bartelsbund later merged with Erich Ludendorff's Tannenbergbund group. Bartels' work achieved \\"quasi-official\\" status in Nazi Germany, and Hitler personally awarded Bartels the Adlerschild medal, Nazi Germany's highest civilian honour, in 1937. Bartels died in Weimar on 7 March 1945. Bartels's further literary productions included Die Dithmarscher (1898), a historical novel based on his native region advocating ruralism, which sold over 200,000 copies by the 1920s,Richard J. Evans, The Coming of the Third Reich. 2004, Penguin Books, London. (p. 122). and Martin Luther (1903); these books are largely forgotten today.

It was designed by the Venezuelan architect Carlos Raúl Villanueva and was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2000. The Ciudad Universitaria de Caracas is considered a \\"masterpiece\\" of architecture and urban planning, and greatly influenced Venezuelan architecture. Villanueva oversaw design from the end of the Second World War, and oversaw the campus construction for 20 years. He gave his skills and also vision of design principles to it, and it remains the only university campus designed by a single architect in the 20th century that has received cultural heritage recognition by UNESCO. The campus comprises a variety of different environments; its northern half is a Botanical Garden, with extensive sports facilities at its east, west and south. There are many different areas of the campus separated by Faculty and School, including Sciences, Architecture, Humanities, and Medicine. These converge in the center of the campus at the Tierra de nadie — green space and woodland pertaining to no discipline — and the Plaza Cubierta complex of shared buildings and the titular museum of permanent modern art features. Though elements of the campus face both natural and deliberate deterioration, it remains a landmark of Venezuela, and maintains its excellence in design and planning. It has been included on the 2010 and 2014 lists of the World Monuments Fund for special preservation efforts.  Construction and design planning Video of locations around the campus in 2019 The campus and buildings of UCV are considered to be Villanueva's masterpiece. Built on the site of the old Hacienda Ibarra (which originally belonged to Simon Bolívar's family) and connected to the new city center at Plaza Venezuela, the project required a massive undertaking in both urban planning and architectural design. The selected location gave Villanueva a unique opportunity to apply his conscious integration of art and architecture on a grand scale. This vast urban complex of about 2 km2 included a total of forty buildings and it became one of the most successful applications of Modern Architecture in Latin America. Villanueva worked closely with all the artists who contributed with their oeuvres and personally supervised the project for over 25 years until the late 1960s when his deteriorating health forced him to leave some buildings in the design stage. After the death of Juan Vicente Gómez, urban renewal became a large focus; Caracas saw \\"extraordinary urban-renewal plans\\", including Villanueva's \\"Synthesis of Arts\\" architecture, beginning with the El Silencio complex in the city center.:56 Though the campus is unlikely to be seen as an urban project by modern definitions, it is seen as among the grand architecture that put Caracas on the map and helped to promote tourism and migration.:57 In 1939, commissioned groups began the new urban planning of Caracas, but \\"bureaucratic obligations\\" restricted this to Libertador municipality.:55 The government of President Isaías Medina Angarita bought the Hacienda Ibarra in 1942, in order to expand the university beyond the limited space it had at the Saint Francis Covent. Shut down several times throughout the 1940s, the planning of the campus resumed towards the end of the Second World War.:55 Construction began in 1944, and was continuous until 1967.:57-59, 355 University City is an example of one of Villanueva's \\"museographic\\" spaces, which take the qualities of museums and apply them to public places.:350 Villanueva visited France in 1944 and again in 1948, gaining inspiration for the artistic and architectural design of the campus. In 1944 he had done the first studies and a tentative plan. Villanueva altered his designs in 1949; he was able to redesign and complicate the process because of the economic and political situation he and Venezuela were in, wanting to do so for personal and professional reasons.:355 The University City is also a model city, which supposedly brought into reality urban visions of utopia.:360 The first buildings erected included the medical complex. In 1949 the initial designs were changed, with the stadiums being built in 1950 and inaugurated in 1951. The stadiums construction signaled a new phase in developing the Conjunto Central (Central Complex) of the campus.:355 The campus construction was initiated at its western end, where it has a symmetrical design along its east–west axis. When the Central Complex began construction, the symmetry was not applied, Villanueva instead initiating his synthesis of the arts for this part of the campus design. 1000px Botanical Garden Laguna Venezuela in August 2016, with water lilies (left); Parque Central is behind The Caracas Botanical Garden is within the campus, and contains a large collection of international plants. Over its history, it has featured species from Central and South America, Africa, and Asia. The greatest number of plants that the Botanical Garden has housed was 2,500; these belonged to over 200 species, half of which were native to the country. The Palmetum of the center at one point held 4,000 specimens of 250 species. The gardens were opened in 1952 and occupy 70 hectares, including the Henri Pittier Library and National Herbarium. Like other areas of the campus, neglect has caused the upkeep of the gardens to suffer. Lack of irrigation and parasitic species has caused plants to die and the beauty of the gardens to deteriorate. Events that have impacted the health of the gardens include the 2010 El Niño drought, the invasion of the Giant African snail, thefts of groundskeeping equipment, electrical blackouts, and other financial issues restricting the care and management of the facilities. According to staff in August 2019, no water had entered the gardens' pipes since the middle of January 2019. A volunteering plan was created to bring in personal water and manually irrigate the plants. =Lake Venezuela= The Venezuela Lagoon is the largest body of water on the campus, and takes the shape of the country it is named for. By 2018, the lagoon was reported to have lost half its water; the native Santa Cruz (Victoria amazonica) water lilies, which were 8ft across and strong enough to hold people, had died out. Other lagoons in the gardens are completely dry.  Plaza Cubierta and Tierra de nadie complex  Historical aerial view of the Central Complex The Conjunto Central (Central Complex) of the University City houses many academic, administrative, and social buildings, as well as some of the campus's more famous artworks. The Plaza Cubierta is an indoor-outdoor space designed as an \\"open museum\\", combining art into the environment and architecture into art, and is considered one of the most important artistic and cultural works of the country. It also connects many different buildings in the Central Complex.:356-358 Villanueva wanted the Plaza Cubierta to be the heart of the campus, the physical and cultural center, being inspired by halls and city center plazas in Europe. It was inaugurated with the attached Aula Magna on 2 March 1954.:359 Buildings connected by the Plaza Cubierta include the main library, the rectory offices, the Federation of Students Center (students' union), the Aula Magna, the Paraninfo, and the concert hall (Sala de Conciertos). Of these, and all Villanueva's works, the Aula Magna is considered the \\"consummate example of synthesis\\".:356 The Plaza Cubierta is noted for having perforated walls, sections of open roof, and a series of ramps linking elements, giving it a feeling of flow. In 2013, an open library incentive was initiated in the covered walkways of the Plaza Cubierta, as an art project and to promote book-sharing and enjoyment of the campus recreational spaces. Jim visits the University City in Assignment: Venezuela. He parks in what is now a pedestrian plaza. The Rectory Plaza was intended to be a car park, and was built in 1952. However, too many people wanted to use it, becoming overpopulated with cars, and so it closed to cars in or after February 1958. The Rectory building of UCV contains offices of university and student management, including the office for the current Rector and the Federation of Students Center (Students' union). Where there was a post office for the university is now a Bank of Venezuela location. The Rectory Plaza contains large murals, and the UCV Clock Tower. The Modernist art is not only historically renowned, but was used to the benefit of propaganda in the 1956 American film Assignment: Venezuela, trying to encourage oil workers to move to Maracaibo. Jim is taken on a tour of Venezuela, and arrives at the then newly built campus in an imported car, admiring the murals and statues.:97-98 In the film, he arrives in what would become Rectory Plaza, when it was still a car park. Behind the buildings of the Rectory Plaza, and jutting out from the main body of the Plaza Cubierta, is the Paraninfo. This is a small performing arts space, with large stained-glass windows. The Plaza Cubierta is an open space with waving concrete-covered walkways. Several artworks are open-air, with gaps designed in the concrete to spotlight them. The Aula Magna is located between the main plaza elements of the Plaza Cubierta and the University's main library building. The interior of the hall is considered artistically and architecturally significant, especially its most notable feature, Alexander Calder's acoustic 'clouds', which serve both aesthetic and practical functions. They contributed to the science of interior space acoustics. The concrete shell-shaped building exterior is also architecturally significant. It has been named the \\"most important auditorium\\" at the university. The current director of the hall is Trina Medina, with the assistant director Rosario Silva Prieto. Beyond the Aula Magna are the Sala de Conciertos and the Central Library. The entrance to the Sala de Conciertos is within the covered hallways that connect the spaces, marked by a large yellow mural; another predominantly yellow mural marks the back of the Sala de Conciertos, visible in the Tierra de nadie. The library features a distinct red tile design on its exterior. On an eastern wall it has a large stained- glass window designed by Fernand Léger. Separating the Plaza Cubierta from the academic buildings and sporting facilities to the east is the Jorge Rodríguez Plaza, more commonly known as the Tierra de nadie (English: No-man's land). The Tierra de nadie is a public space that is one of the green spaces in the University City of Caracas. It takes its name because it is an area that belongs to none of the faculties that surround it. Maciá Pintó describes the functional and artistic design of the Plaza Cubierta as: Sports facilities The Olympic (right) and University (left) Stadiums in 1953 The Olympic Stadium of the university is one of the design elements specifically highlighted by UNESCO. It is primarily an association football stadium, and the home ground of Caracas F.C.; it has seats for almost 24,000 people. As well as the football pitch, the Olympic Stadium contains a full size running track and spaces for athletic field events, including jumping tracks and sandpits. It also hosts rugby games. The Covered Gymnasium is also public space that is run by the university. It is at the far northern end of the university campus, with the exception of the Botanical Garden, and is noted for its shape and peculiar roof. It also features a giant mural, marking the edge of the campus by the freeway, featuring important historical figures of Venezuela. The Estadio Universitario is a baseball stadium, next to the Olympic Stadium, and is the home field of two teams. It can hold just over 25,000 people.Panorama of Estadio Universitario de Caracas Panorama of the Olympic and diving pools Artwork Several artworks placed on the campus had been pre-fabricated and needed adjustment to fit either physically or aesthetically. Some of these works include Arp's Berger des nuages, Laurens's L'Amphion, Pevsner's Projection dynamique dans l'espace au 30° degré, and Lobo's Maternidad. Most other works were designed in a process from afar, with heavy conversation between artist and architect, but some murals were created on-site, including the works of Léger and Vasarely.:359 The international artists who contributed to the campus include: Hans Arp and Sophie Taeuber-Arp, André Bloc, Alexander Calder, Wifredo Lam, Henri Laurens, Fernand Léger, Baltasar Lobo, Antoine Pevsner, and Victor Vasarely. Venezuelan artists involved include: Miguel Arroyo, Armando Barrios, Omar Carreño, Carlos González Bogen, Pedro León Castro, Mateo Manaure, Francisco Narváez, Pascual Navarro, Alirio Oramas, Alejandro Otero, Héctor Poleo, Braulio Salazar, Jesús-Rafael Soto, Víctor Varela, Oswaldo Vigas, and Lisbhet Mariela Ojeda D'Elía. World Heritage Site The central complex of the university The campus was designated a World Heritage Site in 2000. It was designated under cultural criteria for being a masterpiece of architecture and urban planning on the part of Villanueva, being an outstanding example of practical and aesthetic architecture, and for being exemplary of early 20th Century movements art and architecture, and demonstrating their ideals. UNESCO describes it specifically as \\"an outstanding example of the Modern Movement in architecture\\" and adds that \\"[t]he university campus integrates the large number of buildings and functions into a clearly articulated ensemble, including masterpieces of modern architecture and visual arts, such as the Aula Magna with the \\"Clouds\\" of Alexander Calder, the Olympic Stadium, and the Covered Plaza.\\" The site did not have an associated retrospective Statement of Outstanding Universal Value in 2000 when it was inscribed, with one drafted by the Venezuelan state approved in 2013. Though acknowledging that the integrity of the site is maintained in the architectural principles of Villanueva and the overall spirit of the design, the WHS program has concerns that the reinforced concrete of the structures — something that identifies the campus with architectural advances of its time — has deteriorated in the years since construction; that being prone to social unrest could provoke damage to the site; that soil erosion poses a threat to the space; and that massive student expansion opens the campus up to more deterioration and destruction, as do works undertaken to partition and reassign spaces of the campus without consideration of the architecture the works can change design and significance of, deteriorating the combined ensemble of the entire campus and working against the spirit of Villanueva's project. However, UNESCO adds that no works have compromised the authenticity or the value of the campus. There are bodies with the purpose of creating plans to protect the site, but UNESCO reports that these are disjointed and do not work together, advising that the Cultural Heritage Institute right down to COPRED — the university's Consejo de Preservación y Desarrollo (Council of Preservation and Development) — and the separate management interface of the Jardín Botánico, as well as the regional offices of Venezuela responsible for the area at different levels of government, need to coordinate. It was also recommended that a buffer zone be initiated to the south and west of the site to protect from urban developments threatening the site.

Following a successful reunion tour in 1996, the band released a new album in 2005. History Formed in Montreal in the late 1960s as Les Gants blancs, the band went through a variety of names (including \\"7e Invention\\", \\"Grandpa & Company\\", \\"Offenbach Pop Opera\\" and \\"Offenbach Soap Opéra\\") before settling on Offenbach in 1970. The band initially consisted of vocalist and lyricist Pierre Harel, guitarist Johnny Gravel, organist and singer Gerry Boulet, bassist Michel Lamothe (son of country singer Willie Lamothe) and drummer Denis Boulet (Gerry's brother). Offenbach Soap Opera released their debut self-titled album, Offenbach Soap Opéra, in 1971. Although the band's material was primarily in French, that album also included three English songs, \\"No Money No Candy\\":, \\"Bulldozer\\" & \\"High But Low\\" Denis Boulet left the band in 1972, and was replaced by Roger (Wezo) Belval. In November of that year, the band performed a \\"Mass for the Dead\\" at St. Joseph's Oratory, which was released on album as Saint-Chrone de néant. In 1973, Pierre Harel left the band to pursue a career as a filmmaker and the band toured France. They were based there for the next two years as they toured Europe extensively. Several performances from this era were documented in the concert film \\"Tabarnak\\", directed by Claude Faraldo. In 1975, the band returned to Montreal. Lamothe and Belval left in 1977 and were replaced by Norman Kerr on bass and Pierre Lavoie on drums; Jean Millaire also joined the band that year as a second guitarist, but left within the year and was replaced briefly by Doug McCaskill, then permanently by John McGale. Kerr and Lavoie departed in 1978, and were replaced by Breen Leboeuf on bass and Robert Harrisson on drums. In 1976, the band recorded its first of two English albums, Never Too Tender, and toured across Canada to promote it. They subsequently released three more French albums, Offenbach, Traversion and \\"En Fusion\\", before their second English language album, Rock Bottom, was released in 1980. Traversion won the band its first Félix Award for rock album of the year in 1979. In 1979 Offenbach toured Quebec with the Vic Vogel Big Band. A recording of their concert at the St. Denis Theatre was issued in 1980 as Offenbach en fusion, which won the Félix Award for rock album of the year in 1980. The band also received Félix Awards in 1980 as group of the year and for show of the year, the latter honoring a concert on April 3 in which Offenbach became the first Québécois band ever to headline at the Montreal Forum. In 1982, Harrison left the band and was replaced by Pat Martel. The band released three more albums of new material, as well as the live album À fond d'train (documenting a successful tour with Plume Latraverse), Gerry Boulet recorded his first solo album in 1985 and started planning a solo career. The band performed final shows at the Colisée de Québec and the Montreal Forum that year; the Montreal concert was released on album as Le Dernier show and as a concert film. Post-breakup The musicians involved in Offenbach each pursued solo projects through the next decade. Boulet released two solo albums before his death in 1990. Leboeuf and McGale released a project together as Buzz Band; Leboeuf subsequently released several albums as a solo artist, after taking part in the hugely successful promotional tournée of Céline Dion's Incognito album (1987–1988). McGale released one solo album, entitled \\"Bridges\\", as well as collaborations with Dan Bigras, Julie Masse, Isabelle Boulay and Toyo. Harel, Lamothe and Belval formed the new band Corbach to capitalize on the history and popularity of both Offenbach and Corbeau. Gravel formed the band Patriotes, and Martel played with pop singer Carole Ann King. In 1992, the band's back catalogue began to be remastered and rereleased on compact disc, and several of their albums once again hit Quebec's pop charts in the new format. Reunion In 1996, McGale, Gravel and Leboeuf reunited as Offenbach Inc. for a reunion tour. Due to Boulet's death, they selected Martin Deschamps, who had recently won Quebec's L'Empire des futures stars competition, as the band's new vocalist. They toured extensively for two years, and released a greatest hits compilation in 1999. A second volume of hits followed in 2002. In 2005, the band released Nature, which consisted of acoustic versions of their classic hits. It also includes one new song \\"L'amour est cruel\\" (Love is cruel). The music was written by Gravel in the 1980s and the words were later added by Deschamps. A concert at Montrteal's \\"Bell Center\\" on April 1, 2005, marked the 25th anniversary of Offenbach's first Forum show. In January 2007, Leboeuf was announced as the new bassist for April Wine, replacing the departed Jim Clench. As of 2012, the band is still touring and performing shows all over Quebec as well as in Ontario, New Brunswick and France. WIth the addition of new band members, fans continue to appreciate the music during their performances and have voiced their appreciation for keeping the music alive after the passing of its former leader on numerous occasions. The band's current line up consists of: * John McGale: Vocals, Guitar, Saxophone and Flute * Johnny Gravel: Guitar * Ghyslain Robidas: Lead Vocals * Michel Landry: Vocals and Drums * Domenic Romanelli: Bass * Eric Sauvé: Hammond B3 Organ and Piano In 2018 Offenbach released \\"Renaissance\\" the first disc of new material in 33 years.

It encompasses some of the world’s highest peaks and largest glaciers. Internationally renowned for mountaineering, rock climbing and trekking opportunities, it covers an area of about 10,000 sq. km and contains the greatest concentration of high mountains on earth. It has four peaks over 8,000 m including K2 (8611 m), Gasherbrum-I (8068 m), Gasherbrum-II (8035 m) and Broad Peak (8051 m), and sixty peaks higher than 7,000 m. The park was placed on the World Heritage Site Tentative List in 2016. Features The Central Karakoram National Park is the highest national park in the world and the largest protected area in Pakistan. It covers about in the Central Karakoram mountain range. It varies in altitude from above sea level to the summit of chogori K2, the world's second highest mountain at . There are three other mountains over , Gasherbrum I (), Gasherbrum II () and phalchanri Broad Peak (), and sixty mountains over . The park also includes the Baltoro, Panmah, Biafo and Hispar glaciers and their tributary glaciers and is considered to be one of the most beautiful national parks in Pakistan. In 2013 it was stated that the exact boundaries of the park were unclear because, twenty years after its formation, the park still lacked a management plan. At the time of its creation in 1993, four coordinates were provided to delineate the boundaries of the park. The International Union for Conservation of Nature put forward a proposed management plan in 1994, but that was not approved at the time. A management plan should cover all aspects of the park including such things as forestry, mining, other natural resources, tourism, grazing land and waste management, and without an appropriate plan, the park could not be properly administered. In February 2015, a management plan for the park was finally established, following a year-long consultation period with stakeholders and local communities. The plan covers ten sectors: wildlife, vegetation, aromatic/medicinal plants and non-wood forest products, pastures and livestock, agriculture, mining, water, tourism, local communities involvement and research. The park is divided into two zones; the core zone, occupying about , comprises the mountain peaks, glaciers and high level mountain areas, and their fragile ecosystem; the buffer zone comprises around of mainly lower-lying areas around human settlements where unsustainable activities take place, and corridors providing access to different parts of the core zone. A study of the size of the glaciers in the park, made using Landsat images over the decade 2001 to 2010, shows that the ice cover is substantially unchanged. This demonstrates the fact that the Karakoram region is bucking the trend for glaciers to retreat that is happening elsewhere; this is known as the \\"Karakoram anomaly\\". Ecological zones The park has several distinct ecological zones, each with its own natural vegetation which is closely related to the climate and topography; in general, the area has low precipitation and experiences humid westerly winds. The villages are in the valley bottoms where wheat, maize and potatoes are grown, and pomegranate and apricot trees thrive. The lower slopes consist of \\"alpine dry steppes\\". They have gravel and moraine soils and support sparse grass and scrub. The \\"sub-alpine scrub zone\\" is found beside rivers and streams, in gullies and ravines. It consists of bushes and small deciduous trees and provides browsing for livestock and wild ungulates. Higher up there is the \\"alpine meadows and alpine scrub zone\\" which has high pasture and open coniferous forest and is only available for grazing in summer. Above this are permanent snowfields and cold desert areas which occupy the zone, and here there are isolated patches of stunted grass and hardy, low vegetation. Flora and fauna Mountain weasel (Mustela altaica) Some valleys are dominated by communities of West Himalayan spruce, Himalayan white pine and Pashtun juniper, including some pure stands of P. smithiana. Smaller shrubs and plants associated with these communities include sea wormwood, Astragalus gilgitensis, Fragaria nubicola, Geranium nepalensis, Kashmir balsam, Thymus linearis, white clover, Rubus irritans, Taraxacum karakorium and Taraxacum affinis. On some east and south-facing slopes, common sea buckthorn is the dominant shrub, often associated with Berberis lyceum, and on some east-facing slopes at higher altitudes there are communities dominated by Rosa webbiana and Ribes orientale. Other herbaceous plants growing on the sparse grassland, especially in gullies and ravines, are Salix denticulata, Mertensia tibetica, Potentilla desertorum, Juniperus polycarpus, alpine bistort, Berberis pachyacantha and Spiraea lycioides. Larger mammals found in this region include the Marco Polo sheep (Ovis ammon polii), the markhor (Capra falconeri), the ibex (Capra ibex) and the urial (Ovis orientalis vignei). The snow leopard (Panthera uncia) preys on these, and also on the pikas, hares and gamebirds found here. Other predators include the mountain weasel (Mustela altaica), the beech marten (Martes foina), the brown bear (Ursos arctos), the Asian black bear (Selenarctos thibetanus), the Turkestan lynx (Lynx lynx isabellinus), the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and the Tibetan wolf (Canis lupus filchneri). The number of bird species present is low. The robin accentor (Prunella rubeuloides) and black-throated thrush (Turdus ruficollis) overwinter here, and vultures, birds of prey, rosefinches (Carpodacus spp.), Himalayan monals (Lophophorus impejanus) and Güldenstädt's redstarts (Phoenicurus erythrogaster) remain throughout the year, though they may move to somewhat lower elevations in winter. There are three species of lizard in the park but no amphibians. The Trango Towers offer some of the largest cliffs and most challenging rock climbing in the world. Climbing Expeditions come each year to this area of the Karakorum to ascend the massive peaks, climb rocky crags and big sheer rock walls, and trek. Most expeditions visit the region in July and August, but some come as early as May and June, and September can be good for lower altitude climbing. One celebrated climbing area is Trango Towers, a group of some of the world tallest rock towers, situated in the park close to the route used to trek to the K2 base camp. Every year, a number of expeditions from all parts of the world visit the area to climb these most challenging granite towers.

The two Virginia portions of Route 311 are maintained by the Virginia Department of Transportation, with the exception of the city-maintained portion within Salem. The West Virginia segments are maintained by the West Virginia Division of Highways. SR 311 is a Virginia Byway north of SR 419. Route description View north along SR 311 at SR 18 in Paint Bank Route 311 begins at an intersection with US 11 (College Avenue) in the independent city of Salem. The state highway, which is maintained by the city within the city limits, heads north as Thompson Memorial Drive, a four-lane divided boulevard that intersects US 460 (Main Street) and passes to the east of Roanoke College. Route 311 leaves the city limits of Salem at its partial cloverleaf interchange with I-81, entering Roanoke County. North of I-81, the state highway reduces to two lanes and curves to the northeast into the community of Hanging Rock, where the highway meets the northern terminus of SR 419 (Electric Road). Route 311 turns left onto Catawba Valley Drive and leaves the Roanoke Valley by following Mason Creek through a gap between Fort Lewis Mountain to the west and Brushy Mountain to the east. Route 311 heads north into Mason Cove, a narrow valley between Fort Lewis Mountain and Catawba Mountain, before turning northwest and ascending Catawba Mountain, on top of which the highway intersects the Appalachian Trail. The state highway descends into the valley of Catawba Creek and passes through the community of Catawba, where the highway intersects SR 779 (Catawba Creek Road) and SR 785 (Blacksburg Road), which form the main highway along the valley. Route 311 has a short ascent to McAfee Gap, enters Jefferson National Forest, and curves to the north between Cove Mountain to the west and North Mountain to enter Craig County. View north along WV 311 at WV 3 in Sweet Springs Route 311 descends into the valley of Craig Creek, which the state highway follows northeast around the edge of Sinking Creek Mountain to the northwest, passing through the hamlet of Abbott.

The northern terminus is at a junction with NY 12 in the Lewis County village of Lyons Falls. NY 46 and NY 294 are also present in the immediate area of the route's southern terminus. NY 12D was originally assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to most of what is now NY 12 between Boonville and Lowville. The alignments of both routes between the two locations were swapped , placing NY 12D on its current alignment from Boonville to Potters Corners (in the Town of West Turin) and on NY 26 between Potters Corners and Lowville. The overlap between NY 12D and NY 26 remained in place until the 1970s when NY 12D was realigned onto its current routing between Potters Corners and Lyons Falls, replacing then-New York State Route 337\\\\. Route description Southern terminus of NY 12D at NY 12 in Lowville NY 12D begins at an intersection with NY 12 at the southeastern edge of the village of Boonville in northern Oneida County. While NY 12 bypasses the village to the east, NY 12D heads northwest into the village on Main Street. At Schuyler Street, NY 12D bears west for one block to Post Street, where it intersects the northern terminus of NY 46\\\\. The eastern terminus of NY 294 is located one block to the south at the junction of Post and Ford Streets. NY 12D, meanwhile, turns north at Post Street and follows the street out of the village and through the town of Boonville to the Lewis County town of Leyden. Within Leyden, NY 12D passes through largely rural terrain with the exception of a pair of roadside communities: the hamlet of Talcottville on the Sugar River, a tributary of the nearby Black River, and the community of Locust Grove at the intersection of NY 12D and Locust Grove Road. The route crosses into West Turin roughly later, where it intersects NY 26 at Potters Corners. NY 26 turns north here to follow the right-of-way of NY 12D; however, NY 12D turns northeast onto the right-of-way of NY 26 toward Lyons Falls. Near the western edge of the village, NY 12D passes over NY 12 with no access between the two. The connection is made a short distance to the southeast via McAlpine and Cherry Streets, which NY 12D follows to terminate at NY 12. History In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route 27, an unsigned legislative route that initially extended from Forestport to Alexandria Bay via Boonville, Lowville, and Watertown. From Boonville to Lowville, Route 27 utilized what is now NY 12D and NY 26. When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, the segment of legislative Route 27 between Boonville and Lowville via Potters Corners was designated as part of NY 12. An alternate route of NY 12 between Potters Corners and Lowville via Lyons Falls was assigned NY 12D as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York.Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book, 1930–31 and 1931–32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931).

Originally, NY 12 entered Lyons Falls on Franklin Street and followed Center and McAlpine Streets through the village before leaving the area on Cherry Street. NY 12 was rerouted onto its current alignment around the western edge of Lyons Falls in the late 1940s; however, NY 337 was not truncated nor rerouted to meet the new path of NY 12\\\\. Instead, NY 337 was initially extended eastward along the former alignment of NY 12 on McAlpine Street to a new terminus at Center Street.

The law mandated that nearly every resident of Massachusetts obtain a minimum level of insurance coverage, provided free and subsidized health care insurance for residents earning less than 150% and 300%, respectively, of the federal poverty level (FPL) and mandated employers with more than 10 full-time employees provide healthcare insurance. The law was amended significantly in 2008 and twice in 2010 to make it consistent with the federal Affordable Care Act. Major revisions related to health care industry price controls were passed in August 2012, and the employer mandate was repealed in 2013 in favor of the federal mandate (even though enforcement of the federal mandate was delayed until January 2015). Because Mitt Romney was the governor of Massachusetts at the time, the law has colloquially been called Romneycare, a reference to the nicknaming of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as \\"Obamacare\\". Among its many effects, the law established an independent public authority, the Commonwealth Health Insurance Connector Authority, also known as the Massachusetts Health Connector. The Connector acts as an insurance broker to offer free, highly subsidized and full-price private insurance plans to residents, including through its web site. As such it is one of the models of the Affordable Care Act's health insurance exchanges. The 2006 Massachusetts law successfully covered approximately two-thirds of the state's then-uninsured residents, half via federal-government-paid-for Medicaid expansion (administered by MassHealth) and half via the Connector's free and subsidized network-tiered health care insurance for those not eligible for expanded Medicaid. Relatively few Massachusetts residents used the Connector to buy full-priced insurance. After implementation of the law, 98% of Massachusetts residents had health coverage. Despite the hopes of legislators, the program did not decrease total spending on healthcare or utilization of emergency medical services for primary care issues. Background The healthcare insurance reform law was enacted as Chapter 58 of the Acts of 2006 of the Massachusetts General Court; its long form title is An Act Providing Access to Affordable, Quality, Accountable Health Care. In October 2006, January 2007, and November 2007, bills were enacted that amended and made technical corrections to the statute (Chapters 324 and 450 of the Acts of 2006, and chapter 205 of the Acts of 2007).For text of the laws, provided by The General Court of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts  * * The movement to reform Massachusetts healthcare insurance regulations and market between 2004 and 2006 was driven by multiple issues, not all of which were clearly an issue or directly related to then and now most critical issues of rising costs: # A six-year-old federal-government waiver as to how Massachusetts administered its Medicaid program was expiring. Unless the waiver was extended or amended, a large number of people would lose Medicaid coverage as the state reverted to Federal regulations. # Reforms made in 1997 to the portion of the insurance market that related to the individual purchase of insurance had failed. In 2000, over 100,000 Massachusetts residents (about 1.5% of the population) were covered by individually purchased insurance but the number had dropped to under 50,000 by the time of the reform debate. # As illustrated in the state report referenced in the previous sentence, the price of insurance that covered about 600,000 people in the small group market (about 10% of the population) was rising faster than the prices for the vast majority of the non-senior-citizen population, most of which were – and still are – covered by self-insured group insurance from large employers (self-insured plans are not subject to state regulation). # There was a widespread feeling that emergency rooms were misused for non- emergency medical care (the misuse was and is undeniable, not unique to Massachusetts, and continues; the relation to healthcare insurance or lack of it was less clear and apparently did/does not exist). # The taxes that fed the state's \\"free care pool\\", which covered uninsured emergency room visits as well as uninsured hospital admissions (as well as funding community health centers), consistently underfunded the pool and had to be raised almost annually (with differences made up by appropriations from general revenue). The combination of issues four and five was dubbed by Romney and others the free-rider problem although subsequent to the passage of the law, it is argued that the free-rider problem did not really exist. Almost all people who did not have insurance could not afford it, but since they were still using the good it is considered free riding. # Advocacy groups wanted a long list of non-traditionally covered (e.g., vision care) or under-covered (e.g., mood- altering pharmaceuticals) healthcare procedures and goods mandated. # Large employers—even large employers that were self-insured—were increasingly dropping health insurance as an employee benefit and/or restricting it to full-time employees such that the \\"take up rate\\" of healthcare insurance by employees was dropping. However, the drop in take-up rate actually accelerated after passage of the law although there is no demonstrable relationship between the law's passage and the accelerated drop. Allegedly because of their lack of health insurance, uninsured Massachusetts residents commonly utilize emergency rooms as a source of primary care. The United States Congress passed the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) in 1986. EMTALA requires hospitals and ambulance services to provide care to anyone needing emergency treatment regardless of citizenship, legal status or ability to pay. EMTALA applies to virtually all hospitals in the U.S but includes no provisions for reimbursement. EMTALA is therefore considered an \\"unfunded safety net program\\" for patients seeking care at the nation's emergency rooms. As a result of the 1986 EMTALA legislation, hospitals across the country faced unpaid bills and mounting expenses to care for the uninsured. In Massachusetts, a pool of over $1 billion in 2004/2005, funded by a tax on paying hospital customers and insurance premiums, known as the Uncompensated Care Pool (or \\"free care pool\\"), was used to partially reimburse hospitals and health centers for these ED expenses. A much larger portion of the pool was used for non-ED hospital care for the uninsured and for other care at Community Health Centers. It was predicted that implementation of the 2006 Massachusetts healthcare insurance reform law would result in almost complete elimination of the need for this fund. In 2006, MIT economics professor Jonathan Gruber predicted that the amount of money in the \\"free care pool\\" would be sufficient to pay for reform legislation without requiring additional funding or taxes. Reform coalitions In November 2004, political leaders began advocating major reforms of the Massachusetts health care insurance system to expand coverage. First, the Senate President Robert Travaglini called for a plan to reduce the number of uninsured by half. A few days later, Governor Romney announced that he would propose a plan to cover virtually all the uninsured. At the same time, the ACT (Affordable Care Today) Coalition introduced a bill that expanded MassHealth (Medicaid and SCHIP) coverage and increased health coverage subsidy programs and required employers to either provide coverage or pay an assessment to the state. The coalition began gathering signatures to place their proposal on the ballot in November 2006 if the legislature did not enact comprehensive health care reform, resulting in the collection of over 75,000 signatures on the MassACT ballot proposal. The Blue Cross Blue Shield Foundation sponsored a study, \\"Roadmap to Coverage,\\" to expand coverage to everyone in the Commonwealth. Attention focused on the House when then-Massachusetts House Speaker Salvatore DiMasi, speaking at a Blue Cross Blue Shield Foundation Roadmap To Coverage forum in October 2005, pledged to pass a bill through the House by the end of the session. At the forum, the Foundation issued a series of reports on reform options, all of which included an individual mandate. At the end of the month, the Joint Committee on Health Care Financing approved a reform proposal crafted by House Speaker DiMasi, Committee co-chair Patricia Walrath, and other House members. The state faced pressure from the federal government to make changes to the federal waiver that allows the state to operate an expanded Medicaid program. Under the existing waiver, the state was receiving $385 million in federal funds to reimburse hospitals for services provided to the uninsured. The free care pool had to be restructured so that individuals, rather than institutions, received the funding. Then-U.S. Senator Edward Kennedy (D-MA) made a special effort to broker a compromise between the Republican Governor and the Democratic State Legislature. Legislation In Fall 2005, the House and Senate each passed health care insurance reform bills. The legislature made a number of changes to Governor Romney's original proposal, including expanding MassHealth (Medicaid and SCHIP) coverage to low-income children and restoring funding for public health programs. The most controversial change was the addition of a provision which requires firms with 11 or more workers that do not provide \\"fair and reasonable\\" health coverage to their workers to pay an annual penalty. This contribution, initially $295 annually per worker, is intended to equalize the free care pool charges imposed on employers who do and do not cover their workers. On April 12, 2006, Governor Romney signed the health legislation. He vetoed eight sections of the health care legislation, including the controversial employer assessment. He vetoed provisions providing dental benefits to poor residents on the Medicaid program, and providing health coverage to senior and disabled legal immigrants not eligible for federal Medicaid. The legislature promptly overrode six of the eight gubernatorial section vetoes, on May 4, 2006, and by mid-June 2006 had overridden the remaining two. Statute The enacted statute, Chapter 58 of the Acts of 2006, established a system to require individuals, with a few exceptions, to obtain health insurance. Chapter 58 had several key provisions: the creation of the Health Connector; the establishment of the subsidized Commonwealth Care Health Insurance Program; the employer Fair Share Contribution and Free Rider Surcharge; and a requirement that each individual must show evidence of coverage on their income tax return or face a tax penalty, unless coverage was deemed unaffordable by the Health Connector. The statute expanded MassHealth (Medicaid and SCHIP) coverage for children of low income parents and restores MassHealth benefits like dental care and eyeglasses. The legislation included a merger of the individual (non-group) insurance market into the small group market to allow individuals to get lower group insurance rates. The process of merging the two markets also froze the market for such insurance for a short period in April–May 2010 as the current government tried to keep the leading non-profit insurers, which insure over 90% of the residents, in the state from raising premiums for small businesses and individuals. Eventually the state's non-partisan insurance board ruled that the government did not have the actuarial data or right to freeze the premiums. Five of the non-profit insurers then settled for slightly lower premium increases than they had initially requested rather than litigate further. The sixth litigated and won the right to implement all its original increases retroactively. Payment rates were supposed to be increased to hospitals and physicians under the statute but that has not happened. The statute also formed a Health Care Quality and Cost Council to issue quality standards and publicize provider performance.Report from Massachusetts Secretary of Health and Human Services, Timothy Murphy, to the Massachusetts General Court, \\"Chapter 58 Implementation Update\\" (June 12, 2006). =Commonwealth Health Insurance Connector Authority= The Health Connector is designed as a clearinghouse for insurance plans and payments. It performed the following functions: *It administers the ConnectorCare program for low- income residents (up to 300% of the FPL) who do not qualify for MassHealth and who meet certain eligibility guidelines. *It offers for purchase health insurance plans for individuals who: **are not working, **are employed by a small business (less than 50 employees) that uses the Health Connector to offer health insurance. These residents will purchase insurance with pre-tax income. **are not qualified under their large employer plan, **are self- employed, part-time workers, or work for multiple employers, *It sets premium subsidy levels for ConnectorCare. *It defines \\"affordability\\" for purposes of the individual mandate. =Employer taxes= Employers with more than ten full-time equivalent employees (FTEs) must provide a \\"fair and reasonable contribution\\" to the premium of health insurance for employees.2006 Mass. Act Chp. 58, sec. 47 Employers who do not will be assessed an annual fair share contribution that will not exceed $295 per employee per year. The fair share contribution will be paid into the Commonwealth Care Trust Fund to fund Commonwealth Care and other health reform programs. The Division of Health Care Finance and Policy defined by regulation what contribution level meets the \\"fair and reasonable\\" test in the statute. The regulation imposes two tests. First, employers are deemed to have offered \\"fair and reasonable\\" coverage if at least 25% of their full-time workers are enrolled in the firm's health plan. Alternatively, a company meets the standard if it offers to pay at least 33% of the premium cost of an individual health plan. For employers with 50 or more FTEs, both standards must be met, or 75% of full-time workers must be enrolled in the firm's health plan. Regulatory and analytic information is available on the Division's website. There was an additional Free Rider Surcharge assessible to the employer.2006 Mass. Acts Chp. 58, sec. 44 This surcharge is different from the fair share contribution. The surcharge is applied when an employer does not arrange for a pre-tax payroll deduction system for health insurance (a Section 125 plan, or a \\"cafeteria plan\\"), and has employees who receive care that is paid from the uncompensated care pool, renamed in October 2007 as the Health Safety Net. =Individual taxes= Residents of Massachusetts must have health insurance coverage under Chapter 58.2006 Mass. Acts Chp. 58, sec. 12 Residents must indicate on their tax forms if they had insurance on December 31 of that tax year, had a waiver for religious reasons, or had a waiver from the Connector. The Connector waiver can be obtained if the resident demonstrates that there is no available coverage that is defined by the Connector as affordable. In March 2007, the Connector adopted an affordability schedule that allows residents to seek a waiver. If a resident does not have coverage and does not have a waiver, the Department of Revenue will enforce the insurance requirement by imposing a penalty. In 2007, the penalty was the loss of the personal exemption. Beginning in 2008, the penalty is half the cost of the lowest available yearly premium which will be enforced as an assessed addition to the individual's income tax. =Young adult coverage= Beginning July 2007, the Connector offered reduced benefit plans for young adults up to age 26 who do not have access to employer-based coverage. =Changes to the law= In 2008 and 2010, much more substantive changes were made to the law, one of the most important of which was to begin an open enrollment period for those receiving subsidized health insurance and anyone buying insurance, including those paying full price, as an individual. Prior to that 2010 change, under the Massachusetts law, residents buying healthcare insurance individually could do so at any time, even—theoretically—as being admitted to a hospital or entering an emergency room. This led to a gaming of the system and research by the state said this gaming added 1–2% to premium costs, which were continuing to rise for other reasons as well. Given the continuing overall rise in premiums post Massachusetts 2006 healthcare insurance reform, the major goal of the 2012 amendment was to introduce price controls on health care itself; it is not directly related to healthcare insurance as are the earlier legislative actions. Starting in 2014, Commonwealth Care insurance (and Commonwealth Choice insurance for those not receiving subsidies) has been replaced by insurance compatible with the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Among other differences, consistent with PPACA, the out of pocket spending limits and deductibles are higher under similarly priced (after a PPACA tax credit) PPACA-consistent insurance than the superseded Massachusetts insurance law. To try to compensate for these higher limits and deductibles, the Commonwealth funded an additional insurance program called Connectorcare, by which residents who previously would have qualified for Commonwealth Care can get very similar benefits for about the same price. Implementation The implementation of healthcare insurance reform began in June 2006, with the appointment of members of the Connector board and the naming of Jon Kingsdale, a Tufts Health Plan official, as executive director of the Connector. On July 1, MassHealth began covering dental care and other benefits, and began enrolling children between 200% and 300% of the poverty level. The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services approved the state's waiver application on July 26, 2006, allowing the state to begin enrolling 10,500 people from the waitlist for the MassHealth Essential program, which provides Medicaid coverage to long-term unemployed adults below the poverty line. In 2006, the Division of Health Care Finance and Policy issued regulations defining \\"fair and reasonable\\" for the fair share assessment. The regulations provide that companies with 11 or more full-time equivalent employees will meet the \\"fair and reasonable\\" test if at least 25 percent of those employees are enrolled in that firm's health plan and the company is making a contribution toward it. A business that fails that test may still be deemed to offer a \\"fair and reasonable\\" contribution if the company offers to pay at least 33 percent of an individual's health insurance premium. Also effective in 2006, the Connector Board set premium levels and copayments for the state subsidized Commonwealth Care plans. Premiums will vary from $18 per month, for individuals with incomes 100–150% of the poverty line, to $106 per month for individuals with incomes 250–300% of poverty. The Connector approved two copayment schemes for plans for people 200–300% of poverty. One plan will have higher premiums and lower copayments, while a second choice will have lower premiums and higher copayments. Four managed care plans began offering Commonwealth Care on November 1, 2006. Coverage for people above 100% of poverty up to 300% of poverty began on February 1, 2007. As of December 1, 2007, around 158,000 people had been enrolled in Commonwealth Care plans. Initial bids received by the Connector showed a likely cost for the minimum insurance plan of about $380 per month. The Connector rejected those bids, and asked insurers to propose less expensive plans. New bids were announced on March 3, 2007. The Governor announced that \\"the average uninsured Massachusetts resident will be able to purchase health insurance for $175 per month.\\" But plan costs will vary greatly depending on the plan selected, age and geographic location, ranging from just over $100 per month for plans for young adults with high copayments and deductibles to nearly $900 per month for comprehensive plans for older adults with low deductibles and copayments. Copayments, deductibles and out-of-pocket contributions may vary among plans. The proposed minimum creditable coverage plan would have a deductible no higher than $2,000 per individual, $4,000 per family, and would limit out-of- pocket expenses to a $5,000 maximum for an individual and $7,500 for a family. Before the deductible applies, the proposed plan includes preventive office visits with higher copayments, but would not include emergency room visits if the person was not admitted. The new plan covered abortions (both elective and medically necessary) in the heavily Catholic state. Outcomes prior to ACA The number of uninsured Massachusetts residents dropped from about 6% in 2006 to about 2% in 2010, before increasing to between 3–4% in 2012. The United States Census Department shows a higher percentage of uninsured for the same years but a similar trend line. Both trend lines mirror the approximately 400,000 residents added to the rolls of the insured in 2006/2007 via an expansion in Medicaid eligibility rules and the subsidization of the Commonwealth Care insurance program. A 2011 view of the data, released by the state in 2013, shows the number of people receiving employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) in Massachusetts decreased by approximately 500,000 people (about 8% of the state population) since the enactment of the Massachusetts health insurance law in 2006. The latest U.S. Census data on health care insurance types in Massachusetts was released in September 2012, and also illustrates the long-term decrease in ESI, and an increase in public, free and subsidized insurance. In the early years of the implementation of the law, approximately 2% of those eligible were determined not to have had access to affordable insurance, and a small number opted for a religious exemption to the mandate. Approximately 1% of taxpayers were determined by the Commonwealth to have had access to affordable insurance during tax year 2009 and had to pay an income tax penalty instead. Comparing the first half of 2007 to the first half of 2009, spending from the state's Health Safety Net Fund dropped 38–40% as more people became insured, before increasing in later years. The Fund—which replaced the Uncompensated Care Pool or Free Care—pays for medically necessary health care for those who do not have health insurance. According to the DHCFP in a report dated September 2011, \\"Total Health Safety Net (HSN) payments increased by 7% in the first six months of Health Safety Net fiscal year 2011 (HSN11) compared to the same period in the prior year while demand increased by 10%. Demand represents the amount that providers would have been paid in the absence of a funding shortfall. Because HSN11 demand is expected to exceed HSN11 funding, hospital providers experienced a $38 million shortfall during the first six months of HSN11.\\" Versus the same period two years earlier, HSN spending plus demand has increased 20% The reduced state Health Safety Net payments anticipated (but not realized) that by reducing the number of uninsured people, Commonwealth Care would reduce the amount of charity care provided by hospitals. In a subsequent story that same month, The Boston Globe reported that Commonwealth Care faced a short-term funding gap of $100 million and the need to obtain a new three-year funding commitment from the federal government of $1.5 billion. By June 2011, enrollment was projected to grow to 342,000 people at an annual expense of $1.35 billion. The original projections were for the program to ultimately cover approximately 215,000 people at a cost of $725 million. According to the DHCFP, 89,000 people bought healthcare insurance directly as of June 2009, up from 40,000 in June 2006. The number of people with group insurance in Massachusetts held steady at around 4,400,000 since passage of the health care reform law, according to the DHCFP. One outcome has been the unavailability of coverage by many insurers previously doing business in Massachusetts. A study published in The American Journal of Medicine, \\"Medical Bankruptcy in Massachusetts: Has Health Reform Made a Difference?\\", compared bankruptcy filers from 2007, before reforms were implemented, to those filing in the post-reform 2009 environment to see what role medical costs played. The study found that: 1) From 2007 to 2009, the total number of medical bankruptcies (defined as due to unpaid medical bills or to loss of income due to illness, with no distinction between those causes) in Massachusetts increased by more than one third, from 7,504 to 10,093; and 2) Illness and medical costs contributed to 59.3% of bankruptcies in 2007 and 52.9% in 2009. The researchers note that the financial crisis beginning in 2008 likely contributed to the increased number of bankruptcies, and Massachusetts' increase in medical bankruptcies over the 2007–2009 period was nevertheless below the national average rate of increase. Still, the researchers explain that health costs continued to go up over the period in question, and their overall findings are \\"incompatible with claims that health reform has cut medical bankruptcy filings significantly.\\" A 2015 study found that the law had \\"modest effects\\" on costs of outpatient care for people who were already insured. According to a 2016 study in the American Economic Journal, the reform \\"reduced the amount of debt that was past due, improved credit scores, reduced personal bankruptcies and reduced third-party collections.\\" The authors note that the \\"results show that health care reform has implications that extend well beyond the health of those who gain insurance coverage.\\" In 2010, The Boston Globe reported that more than a thousand people in Massachusetts had \\"gamed\\" the mandate/penalty provision of the law since implementation by choosing to be insured only a few months a year, typically when in need of a specific medical procedure. On the average, the Globe reported, these part-time enrollees were paying $1,200–$1,600 in premiums over a few months and receiving $10,000 or more in healthcare services before again dropping coverage. A study conducted by the Urban Institute and released in December 2010 by the Massachusetts Division of Health Care Finance and Policy stated that as of June 2010, 98.1 percent of state residents had coverage. This compared to 97.3 percent having coverage in the state in 2009 and 83.3 percent having coverage nationwide. Among children and seniors the 2010 coverage rate was even higher, at 99.8 percent and 99.6 percent respectively. The breakdown of insurance coverage consisted of that 65.1 percent of state residents being covered by employers, 16.4 percent by Medicare, and 16.6 percent via public plans such as Commonwealth Care. The state's Secretary of Health and Human Services, JudyAnn Bigby, said, \\"Massachusetts' achievements in health care reform have been nothing short of extraordinary. With employers, government and individuals all sharing the responsibility of reform, we continue to have the highest insurance rate in the nation.\\" In June 2011, a Boston Globe review concluded that the healthcare overhaul \\"has, after five years, worked as well as or better than expected.\\"Brian C. Mooney ‘RomneyCare’ – a revolution that basically worked The Boston Globe June 26, 2011 A study by the fiscally conservative Beacon Hill Institute was of the view that the reform was \\"responsible for a dramatic increase in health care spending,\\" however.BHI Study: Massachusetts Health Care Reform drives up insurance costs both public and private Beacon Hill Institute July 2011 In 2012, the Blue Cross Foundation of Massachusetts funded and released research that showed that the 2006 law and its subsequent amendments – simply in terms of measuring the state-budget effect on the uncompensated care pool and funding subsidized insurance had cost approximately $2 billion in fiscal year 2011 versus approximately $1 billion in fiscal year 2006. Some of this doubling in cost was funded by temporary grants and waivers from the United States federal government. The Blue Cross funded research did not address the increased costs in premiums for employers and individuals or other market dynamics – such as increased providers' costs and increased co- pays/deductibles – necessary to meet minimum creditable coverage standards that were introduced in Massachusetts by other parts of the 2006 legislature and its resulting regulations. Separate research on Premiums and Expenditures found that fully adjusted premiums per member per month (PPMPM) for Massachusetts residents covered by comprehensive private insurance policies (approximately two thirds of the state population) increased approximately 9% in both 2009 and 2010 for subscribers in the \\"merged market\\", 7% in the midsized group market, and 5.4% in the large group market. These premium increase do not reflect actual resident experience particularly in the merged market because Massachusetts regulations allow age and other rating factors (e.g., even if premiums were held flat for 55-year-olds living on Cape Cod in construction work from year to year, the 55-year-old in 2009 would pay 10% more in 2010 for the same policy, possibly with lesser benefits). During the years before the changes in the state law related to the enactment of the federal PPACA, the state still used the free care pool—renamed the Health Safety Net—both as originally intended and to fund the subsidies for free (under 150% of FPL) and almost free (151–300% of FPL) networked health care insurance. In addition the state spent a substantial amount of general revenue on the insurance reform. Based on the combination of the increased Health Safety Net tax, general revenue (state income and sales taxes were increased 20%) and smaller additional taxes, the cost of the reform reached about 2% of the state's annual budget in fiscal year 2013, which ended June 30, 2013, up from 1.5% in fiscal 2011. Data following enactment of mandatory insurance showed total emergency visits and spending continued to increase, and low- severity emergency visits decreased less than 2%; researchers concluded, \\"To the extent that policymakers expected a substantial decrease in overall and low-severity ED visits, this study does not support those expectations.\\" http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/07/04/emergency_room_visits_grow_in_mass/ Other analysis concluded that preventable ED visits were reduced 5-8% for non- urgent or primary care ED visits relative to other states. A more complete report released in January 2012 found between 2006 and 2010 emergency department visits and non-urgent visits had dropped 1.9 and 3.8% respectively. A 2014 study found that the law was associated with \\"a small but consistent increase\\" in ED use in the state. A 2014 study found that the reform was associated with \\"significant reductions in all-cause mortality and deaths from causes amenable to health care.\\" =Transition to ACA= At the point of the implementation of PPACA in 2014, of those citizens acquiring insurance through pre-ACA Massachusetts Health Connector plans, approximately 100,000 Massachusetts residents who received free or highly subsidized CommonWealth Care insurance, were expected be needed to be moved to Medicaid. The number of available plans under the Affordable Care Act that will offer service beginning on January 1, 2014, rose to more than 100 from just under 100 in 2013. The open enrollment period of the insurance marketplace, during which citizens may re-enroll or purchase, lasted from 1 October 2013 to 31 March 2014, but those who did not re-enroll by December 15, were to have no insurance coverage in January 2014 (unless they were among the 100,000 moved to Medicaid). Health plans were anticipated to be offered by the following providers: Ambetter from CeltiCare, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts (which did not participate in the prior Massachusetts health care insurance program), Boston Medical Center HealthNet, Fallon Community Health Plan, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, Health New England, Minuteman Health, Neighborhood Health Plan (a new plan following the co-op model introduced with PPACA), Network Health, and Tufts Health Plan. At the start of the Affordable Care act open enrollment at the end of 2013, there was a major technical failure, and the MA Health Connector Software did not work at all. To handle this problem, a special temporary Medicaid was set up, and given to over 320,000 people at no immediate cost to them, who would have under normal ACA procedures gotten either a traditional Medicaid, an ACA expanded Medicaid, or an ACA on-exchange plan. The MA Health Connector was functional starting at open enrollment for 2015, though problems were still widely reported. Outcomes following transition to ACA According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, in 2019 the state's uninsured rate was about 3%, which at the time was the lowest in the country. Legal challenges =Fountas v. Dormitzer= A legal challenge was filed in the Superior Court of Essex County, contesting the fine imposed for a citizen's failure to get health insurance as well as the fine imposed for a failure to provide information on a tax return as to whether that citizen had health insurance. The judge dismissed the case upon a motion filed by an assistant to Attorney General Martha Coakley for failure to state a case upon which relief can be granted. A petition for a writ of mandamus to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC), ordering Essex Superior Court to vacate this dismissal on procedural grounds, the failure to provide trial by jury in a dispute over property as requested by the plaintiff, was denied by Associate Justice Spina. An appeal was then filed with the Massachusetts Appeals Court. A later petition for a writ of mandamus with the SJC was also denied, this time by Chief Justice Ireland. The Appeals Court then heard the appeal and declined to send the case back to Essex Superior Court for trial by jury based on their belief that no facts needed to be determined and therefore trial by jury in this case was not a protected right under either the US or Massachusetts Constitutions. The SJC declined to hear any further appeals.

At first, this makes Scratchy faster and stronger, allowing him to circle the earth several times in the time it takes Itchy to almost reach the finish line. However, the exertion takes its toll on Scratchy, and his heart literally explodes mere feet/centimetres away from the finish line. The final scene shows Itchy on the winner's stand, holding Scratchy's head. 500 Easy Pieces Title pun: Five Easy Pieces Simpsons episode: Butterfinger commercial.

It was a launch title for the Game Boy Advance. The game's sequel, GT Advance 2: Rally Racing, was released on June 30, 2002 in North America. GT Advance features forty-five Japanese cars and places the player in races on thirty-two tracks. Due to positive reaction to the game in Japan, THQ purchased publishing rights for the North American and European releases to the game after a reported bidding war, and added in a controversial password save system into the game to cut costs. The game was received with mostly positive reviews from critics that praised the game for its fun gameplay, but THQ was criticized by most reviewers for adding passwords to the game when the Japanese version had battery-backed saves. Gameplay GT Advance Championship Racing is a customizable experience, including 48 cars from 8 car manufacturers, and 32 courses. Some of the cars featured in the game are exclusively found in Asia, such as the Nissan Cube. The courses vary between paved and dirt roads, requiring the player to adapt their driving to meet the conditions of the course they're driving on. The game's championship mode features four levels of play, three cups of varying levels, and an unlockable \\"kart racing mode\\". Upgrades earned through gameplay can be added to the player's car, and in some cases, they can change the physical appearance of the vehicle. The game contains multiplayer support, allowing two people to play against each other using a Game Link Cable. Controls are simple, with the A and B buttons controlling the player's gas and brakes respectively. The R and L buttons shift the car up or down a gear in manual control, and the D-Pad controls the car's steering. The game requires the player to master the powerslide technique to skid around corners and to reduce their lap time. =Graphics= A car powerslides through a turn. The roads in the game are painted on a flat plane, which allows the game to progress at a smooth rate, but makes it harder for the player to see upcoming turns in the road. The problem can be remedied by playing through a track multiple times to gain familiarity with the turns in a course. The cars are rendered through sprite frames, giving the impression of 3D graphics in the game. =Save system= The Japanese version of the game, Advance GTA, had save support. However, THQ pulled the battery RAM out of the North American and European releases of the game, and utilized passwords to save data instead. The system forces players of the North American and European releases to enter a sixteen digit code consisting of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols into the game to retrieve their data. Many critics blamed THQ for what was perceived to be a cost-cutting measure. It was the only major change from the Japanese version of the game. Development MTO began development on GT Advance Championship Racing about a year before the release of the game in Japan. The game was first announced on August 18, 2000, under the name of Pocket GT Advance. With the exception of a new password save system, tweaking was kept to a minimum for the North American version of the game. The choice was made in the Japanese version to use mostly English in the game so it would be playable outside Japan. The Japanese version of the game, Advance GTA, was praised by critics and the anticipation for the North American and European releases of the game grew. A reported bidding war between United States publishing companies to release the game in the US began after the positive feedback from the Japanese version. It was reported a month afterwards that THQ had gained the publishing rights for the game's North American and European releases. Reception GT Advance Championship Racing received \\"favorable\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of 26 out of 40. Critics garnered praise for its overall gameplay, but the inclusion of a password save system by THQ into the North American and European releases was heavily criticized. IGNs Craig Harris praised the high quality graphics engine and the entertaining powerslide system, but observed that with regards to the password system, \\"... some players (myself included) just might throw their hands up in disgust with what THQ has done to the game.\\" GameSpot observed that \\"GT Advance is, at its core, a very robust and graphically impressive racing game.\\" Despite praising the gameplay, however, GameSpot recommended that players buy a Japanese import version of the game instead, since it was in English and included a battery save feature. Eurogamer wrote that even though GT Advance was hampered by passwords, \\"... you should definitely own GT Advance one way or another, as current gripe excepted; it's a sterling example of handheld racing done properly.\\" Responding to criticisms of the password save system, THQ later re-instated the battery save feature into the two sequels of the game, GT Advance 2: Rally Racing, and GT Advance 3: Pro Concept Racing.

It has subsequently been revised in 1974, 1983, 1988 and 2002. Parts of the TA Luft have been adopted by other countries as well. In 1974, 10 years after the TA Luft was first established, the German government enacted the \\"Federal Pollution Control Act\\" (Bundes-Immissionsschutzgesetz). It also has subsequently been amended a number of times, the last of which was in 2002.Complete text of the Federal Air Pollution Control Act Although the first version of the TA Luft existed 10 years before the enactment of the \\"Federal Pollution Control Act\\", it is often called the \\"First General Administrative Regulation\\" pertaining to the \\"Federal Pollution Control Act\\". The German government created the Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (Bundesministerium für Umwelt, Naturschutz und Reaktorsicherheit) in June, 1986 and it is now responsible for implementing the TA Luft regulation under the \\"Federal Air Pollution Control Act\\". Overview The TA Luft is a comprehensive air pollution control regulation that includes: * A discussion of the scope of the TA Luft application, which is to review applications for licenses to construct and operate new industrial facilities (or altered existing facilities) and to determine whether the proposed new or altered facilities will comply with the requirements of the TA Luft and the requirements of other air pollutant emission regulations promulgated under the Federal Pollution Control Act. * Air pollutant emission limits for dust, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, hydrofluoric acid and other gaseous inorganic fluorine compounds, arsenic and inorganic arsenic compounds, lead and inorganic lead compounds, cadmium and inorganic cadmium compounds, nickel and inorganic nickel compounds, mercury and inorganic mercury compounds, thallium and inorganic thallium compounds, ammonia from farming and livestock breeding operations, inorganic gases and particulates, organic substances and others. * Emission limits may also be set for hazardous, toxic, carcinogenic or mutagenic substances as part of the TA Luft review procedures. * Other limits or requirements related to stack heights (for flue gases or other process vents) and for storing, loading or working with liquid or solid substances. * Various requirements for sampling measuring and monitoring emissions. * Listing of the industries subject to the requirements of the TA Luft, such as mining, electric power generation, glass and ceramics, steel, aluminum and other metals, chemical plants, oil refining, plastics, food, and others. *Annex 3 is devoted to guidelines on: how the atmospheric dispersion modeling required during the TA Luft review is to be performed, and the acceptable type of dispersion model to be used. In essence, the modeling must be in accordance with the VDI Guidelines 3782 Parts 1 and 2, 3783 Part 8, 3784 Part 2, and 3945 Part 3.The VDI web site The full text of the TA Luft is available on the Internet. AUSTAL2000 AUSTAL2000 is an atmospheric dispersion model for simulating the dispersion of air pollutants in the ambient atmosphere. It was developed by Ingenieurbüro Janickehttp://www.austal2000.de/en/history.html in Dunum, Germany under contract to the Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety. Although not named in the TA Luft, it is the reference dispersion model accepted as being in compliance with the requirements of Annex 3 of the TA Luft and the pertinent VDI Guidelines. It simulates the dispersion of air pollutants by utilizing a random walk process (Lagrangian simulation model) and it has capabilities for building effects, complex terrain, pollutant plume depletion by wet or dry deposition, and first order chemical reactions. It is available for download on the Internet free of cost.Austal2000 download web site Austal2000G is a similar model for simulating the dispersion of odours and it was also developed by Ingenieurbüro Janicke. The development of Austal 2000G was financed by three German states: Niedersachsen, Nordrhein-Westfalen and Baden-Württemberg.

The theory has a preferred reference frame and hence violates Lorentz invariance. History Einstein-aether theories were popularized by Maurizio Gasperini in a series of papers, such as Singularity Prevention and Broken Lorentz Symmetry in the 1980s. In addition to the metric of general relativity these theories also included a scalar field which intuitively corresponded to a universal notion of time. Such a theory will have a preferred reference frame, that in which the universal time is the actual time. The dynamics of the scalar field is identified with that of an aether which is at rest in the preferred frame. This is the origin of the name of the theory, it contains Einstein's gravity plus an aether. Einstein aether theories returned to prominence at the turn of the century with the paper Gravity and a Preferred Frame by Ted Jacobson and David Mattingly. Their theory contains less information than that of Gasperini, instead of a scalar field giving a universal time it contains only a unit vector field which gives the direction of time. Thus observers who follow the aether at different points will not necessarily age at the same rate in the Jacobson–Mattingly theory. The existence of a preferred, dynamical time vector breaks the Lorentz symmetry of the theory, more precisely it breaks the invariance under boosts. This symmetry breaking may lead to a Higgs mechanism for the graviton which would alter long distance physics, perhaps yielding an explanation for recent supernova data which would otherwise be explained by a cosmological constant. The effect of breaking Lorentz invariance on quantum field theory has a long history leading back at least to the work of Markus Fierz and Wolfgang Pauli in 1939. Recently it has regained popularity with, for example, the paper Effective Field Theory for Massive Gravitons and Gravity in Theory Space by Nima Arkani-Hamed, Howard Georgi and Matthew Schwartz. Einstein-aether theories provide a concrete example of a theory with broken Lorentz invariance and so have proven to be a natural setting for such investigations. In 2004, Eling, Jacobson and Mattingly wrote a review of the status Einstein aether theory as of 2004. The action The action of the Einstein aether theory is generally taken to consist of the sum of the Einstein–Hilbert action with a Lagrange multiplier λ that ensures that the time vector is a unit vector and also with all of the covariant terms involving the time vector u but having at most two derivatives. In particular it is assumed that the action may be written as the integral of a local Lagrangian density :::S=\\\\frac{1}{16\\\\pi G_N}\\\\int d^4x\\\\sqrt{-g}\\\\mathcal L where GN is Newton's constant and g is a metric with Minkowski signature. The Lagrangian density is ::\\\\mathcal L=-R-K^{ab}_{mn} abla_a u^m abla_bu^n-\\\\lambda (g_{ab}u^au^b-1). Here R is the Ricci scalar, abla is the covariant derivative and the tensor K is defined by ::K^{ab}_{mn}=c_1g^{ab}g_{mn}+ c_2\\\\delta^a_m\\\\delta^b_n +c_3\\\\delta^a_n\\\\delta^b_m+c_4u^au^bg_{mn}. Here the ci are dimensionless adjustable parameters of the theory. Solutions =Stars= Several spherically symmetric solutions to ae-theory have been found. Most recently Christopher Eling and Ted Jacobson have found solutions resembling stars and solutions resembling black holes. In particular, they demonstrated that there are no spherically symmetric solutions in which stars are constructed entirely from the aether. Solutions without additional matter always have either naked singularities or else two asymptotic regions of spacetime, resembling a wormhole but with no horizon. They have argued that static stars must have static aether solutions, which means that the aether points in the direction of a timelike Killing vector. =Black holes and potential problems= However this is difficult to reconcile with static black holes, as at the event horizon there are no timelike Killing vectors available and so the black hole solutions cannot have static aethers. Thus when a star collapses to form a black hole, somehow the aether must eventually become static even very far away from the collapse. In addition the stress tensor does not obviously satisfy the Raychaudhuri equation, one needs to make recourse to the equations of motion. This is in contrast with theories with no aether, where this property is independent of the equations of motion. Experimental constraints In Universal Dynamics of Spontaneous Lorentz Violation and a New Spin-Dependent Inverse-Square Law Force Nima Arkani-Hamed, Hsin-Chia Cheng, Markus Luty and Jesse Thaler have examined experimental consequences of the breaking of boost symmetries inherent in aether theories. They have found that the resulting Goldstone boson leads to, among other things, a new kind of Cherenkov radiation. In addition they have argued that spin sources will interact via a new inverse square law force with a very unusual angular dependence. They suggest that the discovery of such a force would be very strong evidence for an aether theory, although not necessarily that of Jacobson, et al.

He wrote for music hall and the musical stage, often in partnership with R. P. Weston. Lee was born 11 June 1880 in Ravensthorpe, Yorkshire, England. He and Weston became partners in 1915. They were prolific songwriters thanks to their workman-like attitudes. They reportedly wrote a song a day.Russell, Dave. Popular Music in England, 1840-1914: A Social History, Manchester University Press, 1997, p 109. Ultimately, they wrote more than 2000 songs including 75 skits, pantomimes, and sketches.Halliwell, Leslie. Halliwell's Who's Who in the Movies, 15th edition, HarperCollins, 2003. They worked together in Weston's house in Twickenham, Middlesex. The duo also wrote music for film, including the book and lyrics for O-kay for Sound, a 1937 film. Much of their music was written specifically for actors Sydney Howard and Stanley Holloway both noted comedians of the 1920s and 1930s. These included \\"Splinters in the Air\\" for Howard and \\"Squibs\\" for Holloway. Among Lee's most endearing tunes is \\"Knees Up Mother Brown\\", which is traditionally associated with Cockney culture. This was written in 1938 in collaboration Robert Weston's son, Harris, after Robert's death in 1936. In 1938, Lee and Harris Weston co-wrote the hit stage revue These Foolish Things which starred The Crazy Gang and the Sherman Fisher Girls. The same year Lee contributed to the musical The Fleet's Lit Up. Lee died 23 January 1946 in Llandudno, Wales. He is interred at Great Orme, Llandudno. Select filmography (as writer) * Yes, Madam?

A junior world champion (C-4 1000 m) in 1993, he won two senior world championship gold medals with Thomas Zereske in the C-2 200 m sprint in 1997 and 1998. They also competed at the Sydney Olympics in 2000, placing fifth in the C-2 500 m final. In 2002 Gille won the only C-1 world championship medal of his career. He crossed the line in fourth place in the C-1 200 m final in Seville, Spain, but was later awarded the bronze medal after Ukrainian Dmytro Sablin tested positive for cannabis. Of more significance for the future however was the formation that year of a new C-2 partnership with 19-year-old Tomasz Wylenzek. They finished third in the European Championships and seventh in the C-2 500 m in Seville. Two years later they won a surprise gold medal in the C-2 1000m. Gille wore a black armband in memory of his former partner Thomas Zereske who had died earlier that summer. In 2005 Gille and Wylenzek completely dominated the C-2 event. A clean sweep of medals (200 m, 500 m and 1000 m) at the European Championships in Poznań, Poland, in May was followed by two golds (500m and 1000m) at the World Championships in Zagreb. 2006 proved a disappointment after the highs of the previous two years. Replaced by Stefan Holtz and Robert Nuck as Germany's C-2 500 m representatives, they were therefore unable to defend their European and world titles over that distance. They also lost their other titles in competition, coming away with just two silver medals at the major championships (European C-2 1000 m and world C-2 200 m), compared with the five golds of 2005.

Crack was the first standalone password cracker for Unix systems and (later) the first to introduce programmable dictionary generation. Crack began in 1990 when Alec Muffett, a Unix system administrator at the University of Wales Aberystwyth was trying to improve Dan Farmer's 'pwc' cracker in COPS and found that by re-engineering its memory management he got a noticeable performance increase. This led to a total rewrite which became \\"Crack v2.0\\" and further development to improve usability. Public Releases The first public release of Crack was version 2.7a, which was posted to the Usenet newsgroups alt.sources and alt.security on 15 July 1991. Crack v3.2a+fcrypt, posted to comp.sources.misc on 23 August 1991, introduced an optimised version of the Unix crypt() function but was still only really a faster version of what was already available in other packages. The release of Crack v4.0a on 3 November 1991, however, introduced several new features that made it a formidable tool in the system administrators arsenal. * Programmable dictionary generator * Network distributed password cracking Crack v5.0a released in 2000 did not introduce any new features, but instead concentrated on improving the code and introducing more flexibility, such as the ability to integrate other crypt() variants such as those needed to attack the MD5 password hashes used on more modern Unix, Linux and Windows NT systems. It also bundled Crack v6 - a minimalist password cracker and Crack v7 - a brute force password cracker.  Legal issues arising from using Crack  Randal L. Schwartz, a notable Perl programming expert, in 1995 was prosecuted for using Crack on the password file of a system at Intel, a case the verdict of which was eventually expunged. Crack was also used by Kevin Mitnick when hacking into Sun Microsystems in 1993. Programmable dictionary generator While traditional password cracking tools simply fed a pre-existing dictionary of words through the crypt() function, Crack v4.0a introduced the ability to apply rules to this word list to generate modified versions of these word lists. These could range from the simple (do not change) to the extremely complex - the documentation gives this as an example: : X<8l/i/olsi1so0$= : Reject the word unless it is less than 8 characters long, lowercase the word, reject it if it does not contain both the letter 'i' and the letter 'o', substitute all i's for 1's, substitute all o's for 0's, and append an = sign. These rules could also process the GECOS field in the password file, allowing the program to use the stored names of the users in addition to the existing word lists. Crack's dictionary generation rule syntax was subsequently borrowed and extended by Solar Designer for John the Ripper. The dictionary generation software for Crack was subsequently reused by Muffett to create CrackLib, a proactive password checking library that is bundled with Debian and Red Hat Enterprise Linux-derived Linux distributions. Network distributed password cracking As password cracking is inherently embarrassingly parallel Crack v4.0a introduced the ability to use a network of heterogeneous workstations connected by a shared filesystem as parts of a distributed password cracking effort. All that was required for this was to provide Crack with a configuration file containing the machine names, processing power rates and flags required to build Crack on those machines and call it with the -network option.

Description This species is variable and may represent more than one species. It grows to about 30mm in length and is brown, grey or black above, often with scattered red spots. It is normally strongly marbled black and white on the ventral surface, however in some areas this marbling can be faint. There is always an orange, red or yellow patch in the armpits. This patch varies from yellow to orange between sites. At the Jervis Bay region this patch is always yellow, this may be a result of hybridisation with the Dendy's toadlet (Pseudophryne dendyi) which has a strong yellow patch in the armpits. There is also a yellow/orange patch or raised bump on the back of the thigh.  Behaviour and ecology  This species inhabits areas that are likely to be inundated after rain. This can be anything from coastal swamps, creeks, temporary ponds/roadside ditches in forest, cleared land, heathland and even sub-alpine areas. When threatened, the Bibron's toadlet will often lie on its back, unresponsive, pretending to be dead. This performance had been reported to last for up to an hour. =Reproduction= The males attract the females by making a grating \\"ark\\" noise from a concealed area, in mud, under rocks or damp leaf litter. They normally call after heavy rain or when water is available, they call all year round but normally from February to June at temperatures as low as . The species is polyandrous, with each female mating with several males. The female visits up to eight males, mates with each, and deposits eggs in the shallow nest he has dug. The female moves on and the male tends the nest. The nest, which may contain moist leaf litter or sphagnum moss, floods during rain. The eggs hatch and the tadpoles develop in the water. If no sufficient rain happens soon after laying the eggs can remain unhatched for many weeks, with the tadpoles developing inside. The nest must stay wet so the eggs remain moist, but not too wet or they will be washed away. Female frogs that mate with more males, thus depositing eggs in more nest sites, are more likely to have some young survive.  Sources  * Anstis, M. 2002. Tadpoles of South-eastern Australia.

He was a North Carolina state senator and a media magnate. He was a member of the Democratic Party. His son-in-law is former US Representative Robert Pittenger (R-NC). Bahakel was born to a poor Lebanese family in Birmingham, Alabama on April 12, 1919. He helped pay his way through law school at the University of Alabama by doing sports play-by-play and other announcing duties at Tuscaloosa's WJRD radio, a sideline that made him question his goals to become a lawyer. He practiced law for six months, but the lure of the microphone was too strong. He and a friend put up $12,500 each and launched a radio station in Kosciusko, Mississippi. Within a year, Bahakel bought out his partner and found that one of the best investments in business was an hour spent talking to customers over a cup of coffee. He went on to build radio stations from scratch in Greenwood, Mississippi, Kingsport, Tennessee, and Roanoke, Virginia. One of his larger-market radio purchases was WDOD-FM, Chattanooga and its now-defunct counterpart, WDOD, and later WDEF and WDEF-FM, also Chattanooga, all still owned by Bahakel Communications. As the era of television dawned in the 1950s, Bahakel tried his hand in this new fad as well, and founded WABG-TV in Greenwood, the Mississippi Delta's first TV station, in 1959. Bahakel later acquired stations in Charlotte, North Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina (WCCA-TV), and Montgomery, Alabama. Bahakel was instrumental in bringing the Charlotte Hornets National Basketball Association franchise to Charlotte in 1987. He was a primary investor in the team and was the guarantor of the $32 million loan for the franchise fee to bring the team to Charlotte. Bahakel ran unsuccessfully as a Democrat for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1970, losing to incumbent Republican Charles R. Jonas. Bahakel served in the North Carolina Senate from 1972 until 1976. Bahakel died at his home in Charlotte on April 20, 2006, at the age of 87.

The district contains the Astore Valley (with the town of Astore) and is bounded to the west by Diamer District (from which it was separated in 2004), to the north by Gilgit District, to the east by Skardu District and to the south by Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Neelum District of Kashmir. The valley A way leading to Astore The Astore valley has an area of 5,092 km² and an altitude of . The valley has an approximately of glacier cover.Sher Muhammad, Lide Tian, Asif Khan, Early twenty-first century glacier mass losses in the Indus Basin constrained by density assumptions, Journal of Hydrology, Volume 574, 2019, Pages 467-475 The nearest glacier after entering the valley is Harcho MUHAMMAD, S., TIAN, L., & NÜSSER, M.

Elsevier Inc., 187, pp. 505–512. doi: 10.1016/j.rse.2016.10.034.  Accessibility  Astore is connected to Gilgit which is well connected by air with Islamabad and by road with Islamabad/Rawalpindi, Skardu and Chitral. It connects it with the Indian held Kashmir, Northwest connects with Azad Kashmir, in the East it connects with the Skardu, in the West it connects to outskirts of Chilas. There are two ways to access to Astore, first is via Deosai from Skardu city, but it is can not be use from November to June due to heavy snowfall and second way, for all seasons, is via Jaglot from Gilgit city. History According to the Imperial Gazetteer of India, around 1600: Climate Astore valley has a moderate climate during summer. In winter it can snow up to 2 to 3feet (60-90;cm) in the main valleys and up to 4-5;feet (100;150;cm) in the mountains. In Mirmalik valley it snows up to in February. Languages The main language spoken in the valley is Shina. Urdu, which is the National language of Pakistan, is the second most frequently spoken language. There are the different dialects of Shina spoken in the region. Since Astore has a history of modest tourist traffic in the summer months, local guides and police in Tarashing or Astore may speak some English.  Education  According to the Alif Ailaan Pakistan District Education Rankings 2015, Astore is ranked 32 out of 148 districts in terms of education. For facilities and infrastructure, the district is ranked 114 out of 148 and the first lady Governor of Pakistan (Gilgit-Baltistan) Dr. Shama Khalid belonged to Astore District. Transport There were some negative perceptions in past due to rough mode of transport but nowadays there are paved roads connecting Gilgit and Islamabad through the Karakorum Highway. Landslides and rockfall may be an issue in some areas of the Indus Valley. There is a permanent road through Gilgit as well as seasonal road access via Deosai Plateau to Skardu. Here you can obtain all types of vehicles (Jeeps, taxis, wagons, SUVs) and hire jeeps and SUVs at affordable prices. The most used vehicles are Jeeps and SUVs with a local preference for Pajeros and Landcruisers.

In Morton's time, this wasting disease was termed consumption, or by its Greek name of phthisis. Recognition of the many possible symptoms of this infection belonging to a single disease was not until the 1820s and it was J.L. Schönlein in 1839 who introduced the term \\"tuberculosis\\". Life He was born in Worcestershire, England and, having trained at Oxford's Magdalen Hall, elected to enter the Church, becoming Vicar of Kinver in Staffordshire. With his refusal to acquiesce to the Act of Uniformity 1662 following the Restoration of Charles II, he was forced to resign. His whereabouts for the following eight years are unclear, although he probably travelled to Holland. Reappearing in 1670, he was awarded doctorate of medicine by Oxford University. Works His landmark paper Phthisiologica, seu exercitationes de phthisi libris comprehensae. Totumque opus variis histories illustratum was published in Latin in 1689, with an English translation appearing in 1694. A second English edition was published in 1720. Its significance is partly due to the disease receiving little study by other doctors of the time despite it being a major cause of death; accounting for over 18% all deaths in the City of London in 1700. The paper is also significant in that it also contains the first recognised medical descriptions of the wasting condition now known as Anorexia Nervosa. Medicine of that time was deferential to the ideas of Galen and so Morton understandably mistook tubercles for being caused by glandular degenerations; mycobacterium tuberculosis not being identified until 1882 by Robert Koch.

Antill is best known for not stopping the futile charges on the Turkish lines at The Nek in the Gallipoli Campaign in August 1915, during which four waves of attackers barely got \\"over the top\\" before being cut down by Turkish fire. The ANZAC forces suffered a 60% casualty rate, most having been cut down en masse just feet from their own trenches. He later command the 3rd Light Horse Brigade in the final months of the Gallipoli Campaign, and then during the early part of the Sinai and Palestine campaign. In August 1916, he was offered command of the 2nd Infantry Brigade and commanded the brigade briefly on the Western Front, until his health deteriorated and he was evacuated to England in November 1916. In early 1917, Antill took over command of the embryonic 16th Infantry Brigade, but this formation was disbanded before it was fully formed and Antill ultimately did not see action again. He returned to Australia in late 1917. He retired from the military in 1924 with the rank of honorary major general. In retirement, he co-wrote a play about William Redfern, called The Emancipist. He died in 1937 from cancer. Early life and career Antill was born on 26 January 1866 at the family estate of Jarvisfield, in Picton, New South Wales. His parents were John Macquarie Antill (1822–1900) and Jessie Hassall Campbell (1834–1917); he was the second of their surviving sons. Antill attended Sydney Grammar where he was a member of the school's cadet unit, and after completing his education he became a surveyor. His older brother Robert Henry Antill (1859–1938) became a pastoralist and coroner. His sister was Elisabeth Ann Antill (1871–1927) who married Brigadier General Harry Lassetter in 1891, and survived the sinking of the in 1915. He was a keen sportsman in his youth, and was an accomplished fencer and boxer. In 1887, Antill became a member of the local militia. Two years later, he took command of a squadron of the New South Wales Mounted Rifles that he helped to raise in Picton, and from 19 January 1889 he served in this unit with the rank of captain. Under orders from Major General Edward Hutton, the commander of the New South Wales Military Forces, Antill undertook a temporary detachment to the British Army, serving with them in India in 1893, where he was attached firstly to the 1st Battalion, Devonshire Regiment and then to the 2nd Dragoon Guards. He completed this in 1894, and was given a permanent commission as a captain in the New South Wales military. Military career =Boer War= In late 1899, Antill was promoted to the rank of major. As part of New South Wales' contribution to the Boer War, he was placed in command of 'A' Squadron, New South Wales Mounted Rifles, and sent overseas. Antill was present during the Battle of Paardeberg, which took place on 18 February 1900. He also took part in securing Pretoria and other operations unil he returned to Australia in January 1901. Two months later, he returned to South Africa, this time serving as the second-in-command of the 2nd New South Wales Mounted Rifles. With this force, he took part in the capture of a Boer convoy under the command of Fedinandus Potgier at the River Vaal. For service in South Africa, Antill was Mentioned in Despatches twice, was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in 1901,London Gazette: (Supplement) no. 27306, page 2697, 19 April 1901 and achieved the brevetted rank of lieutenant colonel. After returning to Australia, Antill married Marion Wills-Allen in Sydney, on 24 October 1901; the couple had two children. Remaining in the regular forces, he then undertook an instructional role between 1902 and 1904, and then served as Governor General, Henry Northcote's aide de camp between 1904 and 1906. He returned to civilian life in Picton until 1911 when he took up the role of Commandant of the Instructional Staff Schools, based in Albury, New South Wales. In 1913, his marriage broke down. His wife had moved to England, and he applied for a divorce, which was finalised the following year. By April, he had been promoted to the rank of permanent lieutenant colonel. =First World War= In October 1914, Antill volunteered for overseas service with the Australian Imperial Force. As a regular officer, he was assigned to the 3rd Light Horse Brigade as brigade major, under the command of Colonel Frederic Hughes. He departed for the Middle East on 25 February 1915 on the Transport A16 Star of Victoria, reaching Egypt where the brigade undertook further training. In May, the light horsemen were sent to Anzac Cove as dismounted reinforcements; initially, Antill's brigade undertook mainly defensive duties. However, in an effort to break the deadlock they were committed to the August Offensive. During the fierce fighting at The Nek, Antill, now in temporary command of the brigade, refused a request from the commander of the 10th Light Horse, Lieutenant Colonel Noel Brazier, to cancel the third wave. Hughes had gone forward to observe the attack, leaving Antill in charge. Due to a communications breakdown, Antill believed Hughes had gone forward to lead the brigade forward and therefore ordered the attack to continue. Part of the fourth wave also went over the top, before Brazier and some officers from the 8th Light Horse Regiment reached Hughes in time to call off any further waves. Out of around 500 men committed to the attack, more than half became casualties, with 234 being killed and 138 wounded. Most of those that were killed, died within only a few metres of the Australian trench line having come under heavy, unsuppressed fire. Antill took over temporary command of the brigade in September 1915 when Hughes became sick and had to be evacuated. Antill remained in command of the brigade until December 1915, when the decision was made by the British high command to evacuate the peninsula. The 3rd Light Horse Brigade were among last troops to withdraw from the position on 20 December 1915. On 1 January 1916, after the light horse units had returned to Egypt, Antill was promoted to the permanent rank of colonel, and temporary rank of brigadier general. He was also confirmed in his position as commander of 3rd Light Horse. The brigade was placed in the rear and for a time undertook defensive duties along the Suez Canal, occupying No. 2 Section of the defences. On 5 August, after an Ottoman force attacked at Romani, Antill's brigade joined the rest of the ANZAC Mounted Division east of the canal. They arrived too late to take part in the initial fighting although they were later committed to following up the withdrawing Turkish troops. During the Battle of Bir el Ard, Antill's brigade penetrated the Turkish flank and overran the defensive position at Hamisah, taking some 425 prisoners. While reforming after the engagement his regiments began receiving shell fire, and Antill ordered a withdrawal to Nagid, remaining overnight. Antlll's actions removed his brigade from action, and delayed his divisional commander, Major General Harry Chauvel, by several hours that proved costly in terms of consolidating the initial gains. Only days after Romani, General William Birdwood sent a message requesting Antill take command of an infantry brigade on the Western Front. Antill accepted the offer, and relinquished command of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade to Brigadier General John Royston on 9 August. On arrival in Europe, Antill was given command over the 2nd Infantry Brigade, taking over in September and overseeing operations around Ypres and on the Somme. However, Antill became ill and had to be evacuated to England in November 1916. He returned to duty on 20 March 1917 at which time he assumed command of the 16th Infantry Brigade, which was being raised within the new 6th Division. The brigade was ultimately disbanded without seeing action, and Antill's health deteriorated. As a result, the medical review board refused to clear him for active duty. After failing his final medical examination he ceased his command on 20 September 1917. He returned to Australia shortly afterwards. For his service during the First World War, Antill was created a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1916. Post-war and later life On his return to Australia, Antill's appointment to the AIF was terminated in December 1917 and he returned to the permanent forces. He subsequently assumed the role of Assistant Adjutant General in 1918. Later that year, he took over as Commandant of the 5th Military District, in South Australia. He held this position until 1921, when he took up the role of Chief Instructor at the Training Depot, based in Liverpool, New South Wales. On 26 January 1924, Antill retired from the military, with the honorary rank of major general. In retirement, he lived in Jarvisfield, Manly and then Dee Why, and undertook a variety of hobbies including gardening, and sports. In 1936, he co-authored a play called The Emancipist with Rose Antill de Warren, about William Redfern. The final years of his life were spent in ill health, as he was diagnosed with cancer. Antill died on 1 March 1937 at the age of 71. He was cremated. In summarising Antill's character, his biographer Rex Clark in the Australian Dictionary of Biography describes Antill as: Ross Mallett's \\"General Officers of the First AIF\\" describes him in the following terms: References External links * Antill war diary, 1915–1916 / John Macquarie Antill held at the State Library of New South Wales, viewed 23 November 2013.

Her current research extends her longstanding critical engagement with the field of human-computer interaction to the domain of contemporary war fighting, including problems of ‘situational awareness’ in military training and simulation, and in the design and deployment of automated weapon systems. At the center of this research is the question of whose bodies are incorporated into military systems, how and with what consequences for social justice and the possibility for a less violent world. Suchman is a member of International Committee for Robot Arms Control and the author of the blog dedicated to the problems of ethical robotics and 'technocultures of humanlike machines' Before coming to Lancaster, she worked for 22 years at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center, where she held the positions of Principal Scientist and Manager of the Work Practice and Technology research group. Suchman is a graduate of the University of California, Berkeley, obtaining her BA in 1972, MA in 1977, and Doctorate in Social and Cultural Anthropology in 1984. While at Berkeley, she wrote her dissertation on the work practices of accountants. She studied procedural office work to understand how it was similar to and different from a program, assumptions around the work, and how the work informed the design of these systems. Research Suchman's early research was heavily influenced by ethnomethodology, a subfield of sociology that argued that people create meaningful action by improvising based on their social and environmental resources. Suchman's book, Plans and Situated Actions: The Problem of Human- machine Communication (1987), provided intellectual foundations for the field of human-computer interaction (HCI). She challenged common assumptions behind the design of interactive systems with a cogent anthropological argument that human action is constantly constructed and reconstructed from dynamic interactions with the material and social worlds. The theory of situated cognition emphasises the importance of the environment as an integral part of the cognitive process. She has made fundamental contributions to ethnographic analysis, conversational analysis and Participatory Design techniques for the development of interactive computer systems. An updated version of the book was published in 2007. This second edition, called Human-Machine Reconfigurations: Plans and Situated Action, included five new chapters exploring developments in the field of computing and social studies technology since the mid-1980s. Specifically, Suchman addressed the relationship and interactions between humans and machines with a focus on the idea of human- like machines. Her later research is dedicated to problems of autonomy and control in human-technology interaction with emphasis on autonomous weapon systems . Professional affiliations In 1988, Suchman served as the Program Chair for the Second Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work. She also served as the Program Chair for the first Conference on Participatory Design of Computer Systems. Between 1982 and 1990, Suchman was on the board of directors of the Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, a group she helped to form. Suchman is currently a member of the International Committee for Robot Arms Control. In addition, she serves as a Collaborating Editor for Social Studies of Science. Suchman is also affiliated with numerous academic institutions. She served as president of the Society for Social Studies of Science from 2016-2017. She has served as a Visiting Senior Research Fellow with King's College London's Work, Interaction and Technology Research Group and as an Adjunct Professor for the Interaction Design and Work Practice Laboratory at Sydney's University of Technology. Suchman currently serves as an Adjunct Professor at the IT University of Copenhagen in Denmark. Publications *Suchman, L.

Tinazzi was on the French side of the tunnel, from where he donned breathing equipment and drove into the tunnel on his BMW K75 motorcycle in an attempt to save people trapped in the tunnel; after finding unconscious truck driver Maurice Lebras, who was too heavy to be loaded on his motorcycle, he dragged him to a refuge station in the tunnel, where both were killed by smoke or flames. Tinazzi was in radio contact with the Italian side for over an hour before succumbing to the intense heat, which caused his motorcycle to melt into the pavement. Having died trying to save another man, Tinazzi was lauded as a hero, buried with honors, and posthumously awarded Italy's Medaglia d'Oro al Valore Civile.Medaglia d'Oro al Valore Civile He was also given a special gold medal by the motorcycle sport governing body Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM).

During World War II Wilson served with the United States Army Air Forces from 1942 to 1945 in England, France, and Italy. He was inducted into military service as a private and left active duty as a captain. After the war Wilson returned to the Plain Dealer as a reporter, covering a variety of assignments and winning numerous awards for his work. Among the variety of posts Wilson held were those of police beat reporter, general assignment reporter, City Editor, State Editor, Transportation Editor, Business Editor and finally the above mentioned Managing Editor. He left the Plain Dealer in 1973. In 1971 The Plain Dealer was one of five entries recommended by the jury for a Pulitzer Prize in public service. Wilson, along with fellow Plain Dealer staff members David Hopcraft, Richard Zimmerman, Robert Burdock, Richard Widman and Donald Barlett, contributed to the stories. Wilson's sister, Mary Hirschfeld, was also a career journalist employed by The Plain Dealer from approximately 1929 to 1990, working for the paper to the age of 81. Mary died in 1991. While she covered many reporting and feature writing assignments Mary will probably be best remembered for her \\"Mary Hears\\" society column and specialty in covering Latin American affairs. * As cited in an essay by Dennis Dooley entitled \\"The Man of Tomorrow and the Boys of Yesterday\\" within the book (on page 30) \\"Superman at Fifty - The Persistence of a Legend!\\" edited by Dennis Dooley and Gary Engle, copyright 1987 by Octavia Press of Cleveland, Ohio.

He served as head of the London-based Administrative Headquarters for the Australian Imperial Force during much of the First World War, finishing the conflict as a brigadier general. Early life and business career Anderson was born on 6 August 1865 in The Mint, Sydney, the son of a policeman. After attending Sydney Grammar School, he worked at the Bank of New Zealand. Initially working in New Zealand, he was made manager of a branch of the bank upon his return to Sydney.Walsh, 1979, pp. 62–63 Anderson was a member of the militia, having been commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1886. He was later promoted to lieutenant in 1891. However, the day after being promoted to captain in April 1894, he resigned his commission although remained in the reserves. Anderson later worked in local government from 1897 to 1900, firstly as Sydney's treasurer and then as town clerk. He then turned his hand to commerce and entered partnership in Allen Taylor & Co. Ltd, a timber and shipping merchant. Successful in this endeavour, he was later a royal commissioner on the sugar industry. First World War In 1915, Anderson provided advice on the re-organisation of the paymaster's branch of the Defence Department, struggling to cope with the expansion of the military as a result of the war, and which was subsequently implemented by the Minister of Defence, George Pearce.Scott, 1941, p. 277 He also reported on the management of certain government departments. Late that year, Anderson was appointed deputy quartermaster general of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF), then based in Egypt. Brought in to implement business practices to the organisation of AIF logistics, he was made a colonel and successfully improved supply arrangements and established rest camps for soldiers on leave. When the AIF shifted to the Western Front in 1916, he relocated to London as commander of the Australian Administrative Headquarters. Within a few months, he had re- negotiated the supply and accounting arrangements then in place with the War Office for maintaining and supplying the AIF.Bean, 1941, pp.173175 Anderson's work in this capacity was such that by the end of the year, he had been promoted to brigadier general and recommended for appointment as a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George by the AIF commander, General Sir William Birdwood. His award was duly gazetted in January 1917, and within a few months, he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George. His work in London completed, Anderson returned to Australia in late 1917, with stops in Egypt and France. In 1918, he chaired a commission in New Zealand on defence department expenditure. Later life After the war, Anderson advised the New South Wales government in relation to financial and commercial matters. He was also an advisor to the Commonwealth treasury. He gradually became an important part of the business community in Sydney, becoming involved as a chairman or director in a number of businesses. His wife, Jean, whom he married in 1891, gradually became seriously ill and died in December 1928. Anderson himself died at his home on 30 December 1940, survived by seven children.

The modern game of association football originated with mid-nineteenth century efforts among local football clubs to standardize the varying sets of rules, culminating in formation of The Football Association in London, England in 1863. The rules drafted by the association allowed clubs to play each other without dispute and which specifically banned handling of the ball (except by goalkeepers) and hacking during open field play. After the fifth meeting of the association a schism emerged between association football and the rules played by the Rugby school, later to be called rugby football. Football has been an Olympic sport ever since the second modern Summer Olympic Games in 1900.  The Football Association  During the early-mid nineteenth century, different sets of rules for football began to be drawn up in schools, universities, and clubs. The first such set of rules to be published was that of Rugby School in 1845, followed by Eton College in 1847. During the 1850s, many clubs unconnected to schools or universities were formed throughout the English-speaking world, to play various forms of football. Some came up with their own distinct codes of rules, most notably the Sheffield Football Club, formed in 1857, which led to formation of a Sheffield Football Association in 1867. According to the recollections of Henry Charles Malden, a set of rules was created for use at the University of Cambridge in 1848, drawing features from the different public school games. A later set of \\"Cambridge Rules\\" from 1856 survives in a copy at Shrewsbury School.Curry and Dunning (2015), p. 73 Harrow School team of 1867. During the early 1860s, there were increasing attempts in England to unify and reconcile the various football games that were played in the public schools as well in the industrial north under the Sheffield Rules. In 1862, J. C. Thring, who had been one of the driving forces behind the original Cambridge Rules, was a master at Uppingham School and issued his own rules of what he called \\"The Simplest Game\\" (aka the Uppingham Rules). In early October 1863, a new set of \\"Cambridge Rules\\" was drawn up by a seven-member committee representing former pupils of Eton, HarrowShrewsbury, Rugby, Marlborough and Westminster. Ebenezer Cobb Morley, a solicitor from Hull, wrote to Bell's Life newspaper in 1863, proposing a governing body for football. Morley was to become the FA's first secretary (1863–66) and its second president (1867–74), but is particularly remembered for drafting the first Laws of the Game at his home in Barnes, London, that are today played the world over. For this, he is considered not just the father of the Football Association, but of Association Football itself. Public schools such as Charterhouse and Westminster School were influential in forming the new rules, at both schools the pupils' surroundings meant they were confined to playing their football in the cloisters, making the rough and tumble of the handling game that was developing at other schools such as Rugby impossible, and necessitating a different code of rules. Forest School was also influential in formulating the new rules, being present at the fifth meeting of the F.A. on 1 December 1863, and having several members at the influential Forest Club.Adrian Harvey: Football: The First Hundred Years, 2005 During the formulation of the rules of Association Football in the 1860s representatives of Charterhouse and Westminster pushed for a passing game, in particular rules that allowed forward passing (\\"passing on\\"). Other schools (in particular Eton College, Shrewsbury School and Harrow) favoured a dribbling game with a tight off-side rule. It is claimed that Stoke Ramblers were formed in 1863 when former pupils of Charterhouse School formed a football club while apprentices at the North Staffordshire Railway works in Stoke-on-Trent. By 1867 the Football Association had chosen in favour of the Charterhouse and Westminster game and adopted a \\"loose\\" off-side rule that permitted forward passing.Marples, Morris. A History of Football, Secker and Warburg, London 1954, page 150 On the evening of 26 October 1863, representatives of several football clubs in the Greater London area met at the Freemasons' Tavern on Long Acre in Covent Garden. This was the first meeting of The Football Association (FA). It was the world's first official football body and for this reason is not preceded with the word English. The first meeting resulted in the issuing of a request for representatives of the public schools to join the association. With the exception of Thring at Uppingham, most schools declined. In total, six meetings of the FA were held between October and December 1863. Committee member J. F. Alcock, said: \\"The Cambridge Rules appear to be the most desirable for the Association to adopt.\\" After the third meeting, a draft set of rules were published by the FA. However, at the beginning of the fourth meeting, attention was drawn to the recently published Cambridge Rules of 1863. The Cambridge rules differed from the draft FA rules in two significant areas; namely running with (carrying) the ball and hacking (kicking opposing players in the shins). The two contentious FA rules were as follows: Old Etonians v Blackburn Rovers match. Illustration by S.T. Dadd, c. 1871 At the fifth meeting a motion was proposed that these two rules be removed from the FA rules. Most of the delegates supported this suggestion but F. W. Campbell, the representative from Blackheath and the first FA treasurer, objected strongly. He said, \\"hacking is the true football\\". The motion was carried nonetheless and — at the final meeting — Campbell withdrew his club from the FA. After the final meeting on 8 December the FA published the \\"Laws of Football\\", the first comprehensive set of rules for the game later known as association football. The game also came to be called \\"soccer\\" as a shortening of \\"Association\\" around the same time as Rugby football, colloquially referred to as \\"rugger\\", was developing as the main ball carrying version of English football, and \\"soccer\\" remains a common descriptor in countries with other prominent football codes today. These first FA laws contained elements that are no longer part of association football, but which are still recognisable in other games (e.g. Rugby Union and Australian rules football): for instance, if a player first touched the ball behind the opponents' goal line, his side was entitled to a \\"free kick\\" at goal, from that point and fifteen yards [approximately 14 metres] in front of the goal line; and a player could make a catch and claim a \\"mark\\", which entitled him to a free kick from or behind that point (see Laws 7 and 8 respectively). The laws of the game agreed on by the FA members stipulated a maximum length and breadth for the pitch, the procedure for kicking off, and definition of terms, including goal, throw in, offside. Passing the ball by hand was still permitted provided the ball was caught \\"fairly or on the first bounce\\". Despite the specifications of footwear having no \\"tough nails, iron plates and gutta percha\\" there were no specific rule on number of players, penalties, foul play or the shape of the ball; captains of the participating teams were expected to agree on these things prior to the match. =Foundations of a competition= The laws laid down by the FA had an immediate effect, with Sheffield F.C. and Nottingham (now Notts County) playing an annual fixture on the FA code, among others. As more teams joined the code in the 1860s, the sport veered away from its origins in public schools, came to be played with round balls and by teams that had settled on 11 players each. The rule eliminating passing of the ball forwards by making all players in front of the ball 'offside' (much like in rugby today) was dropped. A Sheffield against London game in 1866 had allowed the FA to observe how the rules were affecting the game; subsequently handling of the ball was abolished except for one player on each team, the goalkeeper. A red tape was added between the two goalposts to indicate the top of the goal, and a national competition was proposed. 1867 saw the introduction of the first competition and oldest existing trophy in football, the Youdan Cup. =First FA Cup= Royal Engineers team who reached the first FA Cup final in 1872 On 20 July 1871, C. W. Alcock, a gentleman from Sunderland and a former pupil of Harrow School proposed that \\"a Challenge Cup should be established in connection with the [Football] Association\\", the idea that gave birth to the competition. At the first FA Cup in 1872, Wanderers and Royal Engineers met in the final in front of 2,000 paying spectators. Despite the Royal Engineers being the heavy favourites, one of their players sustained a broken collar bone early on and since substitutions had not yet been introduced, the Engineers played a man down for the rest of the match which they eventually lost 1–0. The FA Cup was a success and within a few years all of the clubs in England wanted to take part. To do so they had to accept the FA code, which led to the quick spread of a universal set of rules. These rules are the basis of which all association football rules today stem from. Sheffield F.C. (here pictured in 1876) is the oldest association club still active, having been founded in 1857 Later competitions saw the 'Gentleman' or Southerners dominate with Old Etonians, Wanderers, Royal Engineers and Oxford University who amongst them took 19 titles. Queens Park withdrew in the semi-finals of the 1873 cup (which due to the format being played that year meant that all the challengers to Wanderers' trophy played a competition for the right to throw down the gauntlet and play the holders, hence the full name FA Challenge Cup) because they had trouble raising travel expenses to pay for the constant trips to England, this directly led to the formation of the Scottish FA. However, despite this, Queens Park continued to participate in the FA Cup, reaching the final twice, before the Scottish FA banned Scottish clubs from entering in 1887. In 1872, Alcock purchased the Football Association Cup for £20. That year, fifteen clubs entered the competition. Queen's Park reached the semi- finals without playing due to withdrawals, but then after a goalless draw with Wanderers, were forced to withdraw as before the advent of penalties and extra time, they could not afford to come back to London for the replay. Wanderers won the cup outright in 1878 after what remains to this day one of only two hat tricks of wins ever. However they returned the cup to the FA in order for the competition to continue, on the condition that no other club could win the cup outright ever again. =First league= In 1888, William McGregor a gentleman from Perthshire and a director of Aston Villa F.C was the main force between meetings held in London and Manchester involving 12 football clubs, with an eye to a league competition. These 12 clubs would later become the Football League's 12 founder members. The meetings were held in London, the main concern was that an early exit in the knockout format of the FA Cup could leave clubs with no matches for almost a year, and if that happened, not only could they suffer heavy financial losses, but fans often didn't stick around for that long without a game, and instead went to other teams. Matters were finalised on 17 April in Manchester. McGregor had voted against the name The Football League, as he was concerned that it would be associated with the Irish Land League.\\"A History of Football\\", p.22 But this name still won by a majority vote and was selected. The competition guaranteed fixtures and members for all of its member clubs. The clubs were split equally among North and Midlands teams. It excluded Southern teams, who were still strictly amateur. A rival English league called the Football Alliance operated from 1889 to 1892. In 1892 it was decided to formally merge the two leagues, and so the Football League Second Division was formed, consisting mostly of Football Alliance clubs. The existing League clubs, plus three of the strongest Alliance clubs, comprised the Football League First Division. =First International= Drawing of the first international game by artist William Ralston The first international game was played in Scotland on 30 November 1872. Charles Alcock, who was elected to secretary of the FA at the age of 28, devised the idea of an international competition, inaugurating an annual Scotland-England fixture. In 1870 and 1871 he placed advertisements in Edinburgh and Glasgow newspapers, requesting players for an international between the two countries. The only response that he received stated: \\"devotees of the \\"association\\" rules will find no foemen worthy of their steel in Scotland\\"H>M. The Scotsman newspaper, 1 December 1870, page 12 For this reason the 1870 and 1871 matches were composed entirely of Scots living in England. Notably, however, Smith of the Queen's Park football club took part in most of the 1870 and 1871 international matches. As early as 1870, Alcock was adamant that these matches were open to every Scotsman [Alcock's italics] whether his lines were cast North or South of the Tweed and that if in the face of the invitations publicly given through the columns of leading journals of Scotland the representative eleven consisted chiefly of Anglo-Scotians ... the fault lies on the heads of the players of the north, not on the management who sought the services of all alike impartially. To call the team London Scotchmen contributes nothing. The match was, as announced, to all intents and purposes between England and Scotland\\".Charles W Alcock, The Scotsman newspaper, 28 November 1870, page 7 In 1872 the challenge was eventually taken up by Queens Park FC. The first international currently recognised as official by FIFA (which took place on 30 November 1872, Glasgow, Scotland) ended in a goalless draw between the two sides and thus, one of the most bitterly disputed fixtures in footballing history was born. The 2nd game between the two sides, on the 8 March 1873, ended 4–2 in favour of England, the Scots then went on to win the next game 2–1. The fourth game ended in a 2–2 draw after which the Scots enjoyed a 3-game winning streak. The first non-European international was contested on 28 November 1885, at Newark, New Jersey, between the US and Canada, the Canadians winning 1–0. =From amateurism to professionalism= Representation of a football match from the book Athletics and football, 1894 When football was gaining popularity during the 1870s and 1880s professionals were banned in England and Scotland. Then in the 1880s, soon after Wanderers disbanded, in the north of England, teams started hiring players known as 'professors of football', who were often professionals from Scotland (who were referred to at the time as the 'Scotch Professors'). This was the first time professionalism got into football. The clubs in working class areas, especially in Northern England and Scotland, wanted professional football in order to afford playing football besides working. Several clubs were accused of employing professionals. The northern clubs made of lower class paid players started to gain momentum over the amateur 'Gentleman Southerners'. The first northern club to reach the FA Cup final was Blackburn Rovers in 1882, where they lost to Old Etonians, who were the last amateur team to win the trophy. During the summer of 1885, there was pressure put on the Football Association to accept professionalism in English football, culminating in a special meeting on 20 July, after which it was announced that it was \\"in the interests of Association Football, to legalise the employment of professional football players, but only under certain restrictions\\". Clubs were allowed to pay players provided that they had either been born or had lived for two years within a six-mile radius of the ground. There were also rules preventing professional players playing for more than one club in a season, without obtaining special permission, and all professional players had to be registered with the F.A. Though English clubs employed professionals, the Scottish Football Association continued to forbid the practice. Consequently, many Scottish players migrated southward. At first the FA put residential restrictions in place to prevent this, but these were abandoned by 1889. In the inaugural season of the Football League (1888–89), champions Preston North End fielded ten Scottish professionals.Goldblatt, The Ball is Round, p. 57. One of the teams to benefit from the move of Scottish players to England, who were nicknamed the Scotch Professors, was Sunderland A.F.C. The club went professional in 1885, and the club recruited a number of Scotsmen the same year, their first internationally capped players.Days, p. 13. Founder James Allan left Sunderland in 1888 because of his dislike for the \\"professionalism\\" that had been creeping into the club, and subsequently formed Sunderland Albion.Days, p. 18. The wealthy miner Samuel Tyzack, who alongside and shipbuilder Robert Turnbull funded the now professional \\"team of all talents,\\" often pretended to be a priest while scouting for players in Scotland, as Sunderland's recruitment policy in Scotland enraged many Scottish fans. In fact, the whole Sunderland lineup in the 1895 World Championship was made from entirely Scottish players.https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/apr/25/even-when- sunderland-ruled-the-globe-club-world-cups-were-controversial On 5 April 1890, the Football League's founder, William McGregor, labelled Sunderland as \\"the team of all talents\\" stating that they had \\"a talented man in every position\\".Days, p21. Another team to benefit from the Scotch Professors was Preston North End, the first English team to win the Championship and Cup \\"double\\", which did so with a majority of their team being made up of Scottish players. https://www.nutmegmagazine.co.uk/issue-4/the-scottish-professors-and- their-role-in-footballs-first-invincibles/ The Scottish FA lifted its ban on professionalism in 1893, whereupon 560 players were registered as professionals. Early English women's teams, such as the Dick, Kerr's Ladies from Preston, were so popular that their matches raised money for charities. The first recorded women's football match, on 23 March 1895, was held in England between a northern and southern team. The fundraising matches continued, in spite of objections. A maximum wage was placed on players, players challenged this and came close to strike action in 1909, but it was not to be for another fifty years before the maximum wage was abolished. In 1921, women were banned from playing on FA league grounds. FA history states that this ban \\"effectively destroyed the game\\" in England for the next 40 years. Hakoah Vienna was probably the first non-British club to pay their players during the 1920s . In 1934 the Swedish club Malmö FF was relegated from the top division after it had been discovered that they paid their players, something that was not allowed in Swedish football at the time. =Wartime football= Between 1915 and 1919 competitive association football was suspended in England. Many footballers signed up to fight in the war and as a result many teams were depleted, and fielded guest players instead. The Football League and FA Cup were suspended and in their place regional league competitions were set up; appearances in these tournaments do not count in players' official records. Football spreads around the world =Continental Europe= The oldest club in continental Europe could be the Swiss club Lausanne Football and Cricket Club, founded 1860. Football was introduced in a Belgian school in Melle (near Ghent) in 1863. In the Netherlands the first football match was played in 1865 in Enschede. This was followed by the founding of Koninklijke HFC by Pim Mulier in 1879. The Koninklijke HFC was the first Dutch football club. Ten years later, in 1889, the Royal Dutch Football Association (the KNVB) was founded. Association football was introduced in the Danish club, Kjøbenhavns Boldklub (KB) by English residents, in Swiss club FC St. Gallen in 1879 and in Belgium Royal Antwerp FC in 1880. This makes KB, St. Gallen, Koninklijke HFC and Royal Antwerp FC the oldest still existing football clubs on Continental Europe. However, Royal Antwerp FC (nickname \\"The Great Old\\") is the only one that never merged with or into another club. The Danish Football Association was founded in 1889. Italian football was played in regional groups from its foundation in 1898 until 1929 when the Serie A was organised into a national league by the Italian Football Federation. La Liga, Spain's national league, had its first season in 1928, with its participants based on the previous winners of the Copa del Rey, which began in 1902. The modern German national league, the Bundesliga was late in foundation, especially for European countries, given it wasn't founded until 1963. The German Football Association was founded as early as 1900 with the first German football champions being Leipzig in 1903. However, prior to the formation of the Bundesliga, German football was played at an amateur level in a large number of regional leagues. = Portugal = The first organised game of football in Portugal took place in 1875 in Camacha, Madeira. Organised by the Madeira born Harry Hinton. The oldest surviving team in Portugal is Académica, which was founded in 1876. On 31 March 1914, the 3 regional associations that existed in Portugal (Lisbon, Portalegre and Porto), merged to create a national association called \\"a União Portuguesa de Futebol\\" which is the ancestor of the current national association \\"Federação Portuguesa de Futebol\\" which was formed on 28 May 1926. =South America= The first recorded football match in Argentina was played in 1867 by British railway workers at the Buenos Aires Cricket Club Ground.\\"140 años del primer partido de fútbol\\" by Eduardo Cántaro, 21 May 2007 The game was a blend of both association and rugby footballs, allowing the use of hands.A un siglo y medio del primer partido de fútbol en la Argentina y en Sudamérica by Oscar Barnade, Clarín, 20 Jun 2017 The first association football team in South America, Buenos Aires Football Club was created in Argentina that same year. The first country's league was the \\"Association Argentine Football\\" (AAF), founded in 1891 by F.L. Wooley. This league organized the first ever championship to take place in 1891, making Argentina's the oldest association football league outside mainland Great Britain although it only lasted for one season. Its successor, the Argentine Football Association was founded by Scottish schoolteacher Alexander Watson Hutton in 1893, remaining nowadays. In the 1870s an expatriate named John Miller who worked on the railway construction project in São Paulo together with some 3000 other immigrant families from the British Isles in the last decades of the 19th century, decided to send his young boy Charles William Miller to England for his education. In 1884 Charles aged 10 was sent to Bannisters school in Southampton. Charles was a natural footballer who quickly picked up the arts of the game. The football association was being formed at the time. Eton, Rugby, Charterhouse and other colleges all had developed their own rules to the game. As an accomplished winger and striker Charles held school honours that were to gain him entry first into the Southampton Club team and then into the County team of Hampshire. In 1892 a couple of years before his return to Brazil, Miller was invited to play a game for the Corinthians, a team formed of players invited from public schools and universities. On his return Miller brought some association football equipment and a rules book with him. He then went on to develop the new rules of the game amongst the community in São Paulo. In 1888, six years before his return, the first sports club was founded in the city, São Paulo Athletic Club. São Paulo Athletic Club won the first three years championships. Miller's skills were far and above his colleagues at this stage. He was given the honour of contributing his name to a move involving a deft flick of the ball with the heel \\"Chaleira\\". Charles Miller kept a strong bond with English association football throughout his life. Teams from Southampton and Corinthians Club came over to Brazil and played against São Paulo Athletic Club and other teams in São Paulo. One on occasion in 1910 a new local team was about to be formed after a tour of the Corinthians team to Brazil and Charles was asked to suggest a name for the team. He suggested they should call themselves after Corinthians. During the first years of the 20th century, several British clubs toured on South America, mainly Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil. Southampton was the first foreign club to tour the continent in 1904, followed by Nottingham Forest one year later. Those tours contributed to the spread and develop of football in the region, with some matches (such as the Alumni v South Africa) being attended by more than 10,000 spectators.A cien años de un triunfazo on Clarín, 24 June 2006 Those British teams trips lasted until 1929, with the Chelsea tour.South American Trip of Chelsea FC 1929 by Pablo Ciullini on RSSSF The Argentine Primera División is the oldest league in South America, being first held in 1891.Historia del Fútbol Amateur en la Argentina, by Jorge Iwanczuk. Published by Autores Editores (1992) - Moreover, Argentina became the first country outside the United Kingdom to establish a football league.\\"Salvation army\\", The Guardian, 4 June 2006 The Uruguayan Football Association was also establishedd in 1900. Both associations organised together the first Rioplatense club competitions in the region, starting with the Tie Cup in 1900.Cup Tie Competition at Historia y Fútbol website In 1988, São Paulo A.C. celebrated its centenary and the English Corinthian F.C. (that had first toured on Brazil in 1910)Corinthian FC Football Pioneers by Vince Cooper, 2 Oct 2017 went across again to play them at Morumbi Stadium. The end of the tour was against the local Corinthians Paulista team (which had taken its name from the English side) with former stars Sócrates and Rivelino amongst its players. This game was played at Pacaembu Stadium in São Paulo and true to Corinthian principles of good clean association football the score was 1 to 0 in favour of the locals when as agreed Socrates changed shirts to play alongside the English amateurs. This did not affect the score unfortunately although a largely packed stadium was cheering on for a drawn result. The Brazilian Football Confederation was founded in 1914, and the current format for the Campeonato Brasileiro was established in 1971. =United States= The first association football club in the United States was the Oneida Football Club of Boston, Massachusetts, founded in 1862. It is often said that this was the first club to play association football outside Britain. However, the Oneidas were formed before the English Football Association (FA); it is not known what rules they used and the club wound up within the space of a few years. According to Encyclopædia Britannica, the club is often credited with inventing the \\"Boston Game\\", which both allowed players to kick a round ball along the ground, and to pick it up and run with it. The first U.S. match known to have been inspired by FA rules was a game between Princeton and Rutgers in 1869, although the game included features such as extremely physical tackling and teams of 20 each. Other colleges emulated this development, but all of these were converted to rugby-oriented rules from soccer-oriented rules by the mid-1870s on, and they would soon become famous as early bastions of American football. (For more details see: History of American football and 1869 college football season.) Early football leagues in the U.S. mostly used the name football leagues: for example, the American Football Association (founded in 1884), the American Amateur Football Association (1893), the American League of Professional Football (1894), the National Association Foot Ball League (1895), and the Southern New England Football League (1914). However, the word \\"soccer\\" was beginning to catch on, and the St Louis Soccer League was a significant regional competition between 1907 and 1939. What is now the United States Soccer Federation was originally the U.S. Football Association, formed in 1913 by the merger of the American Football Association and the American Amateur Football Association. The governing body of the sport in the U.S. did not have the word soccer in its name until 1945, when it became the U.S. Soccer Football Association. It did not drop the word football from its name until 1974, when it became the U.S. Soccer Federation. Two further football leagues were started in the 1967, the United Soccer Association and the National Professional Soccer League. These merged to form the North American Soccer League in 1968, which survived until 1984. The NASL also ran an indoor league in the later years. Indoor soccer was a great success in the 1980s to the '90s, in part due to the input of the North American Soccer League. When the NASL folded, other leagues, including the Major Indoor Soccer League filled in to meet the demand. A new MISL exists today with seven teams operating in the 2013–2014 season. However, it is unrelated to the original MISL. The highest level of soccer in the United States is Major League Soccer, formed as a result of the U.S. hosting the 1994 FIFA World Cup. =FIFA= The need for a single body to oversee the worldwide game became apparent at the beginning of the 20th century with the increasing popularity of international fixtures. The English Football Association had chaired many discussions on setting up an international body, but was perceived as making no progress. It fell to seven other European countries to band together to form this association. FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association) was founded in Paris on 21 May 1904 - the French name and acronym persist to this day, even outside French-speaking countries. Its first president was Robert Guérin. FIFA presided over its first international competition in 1906, however it met with little approval or success. This, in combination with economic factors, led to the swift replacement of Guérin with Daniel Burley Woolfall from England, which had become a member association by that point. The next tournament staged the football competition for the 1908 Olympics in London was more successful, despite the presence of professional footballers, contrary to the founding principles of FIFA. Membership of FIFA expanded beyond Europe with the application of South Africa in 1909, Argentina in 1912 and the United States in 1913. FIFA however floundered during World War I with many players sent off to war and the possibility of travel for international fixtures severely limited. Post-war, following the death of Woolfall, the organisation fell into the hands of Alexander Bartholomew. The organisation had a new leader though after Bartholomew's death in 1919. It was saved from extinction, but at the cost of the withdrawal of the Home Nations, who cited an unwillingness to participate in international competitions with their recent World War enemies. In 1946 the four British nations returned. On 10 May 1947 a 'Match of the Century' between Great Britain and 'Rest of Europe XI' was played at Hampden Park in Glasgow before 135,000 spectators - Britain won 6–1. The proceeds from the match, coming to £35,000, were given to FIFA, to help re-launch it after World War Two. This was followed by FIFA's first post-war World Cup in 1950, held in Brazil. FIFA, meanwhile, continued to expand so that by the time of its fiftieth anniversary it had 84 members. =FIFA Men's World Cup= The first Football World Cup was played in Uruguay in 1930. In the first championship match between Argentina and Uruguay, the teams could not decide on a ball so they used Argentina's ball the first half and Uruguay's in the second. Many countries did not enter, but most of those that did came from the Americas. By 1950 however, European teams took interest, and the competition blossomed into the world's biggest footballing and sporting event. The South American Copa América was first contested in 1916 and preceded the World Cup. Decades later, other continental championships emerged - the AFC Asian Cup (1956), the African Cup of Nations (1957), the European Championship (1960), North America's Gold Cup (1991) Oceania's OFC Nations Cup (1996) and UEFA Nations League (2018). The Brazilian team is the most successful team in the World Cup, having won five times. The next most successful teams are Italy and Germany (three as West Germany) with four titles each, having won their latest honours in 2006 and 2014 respectively. Uruguay (last in 1950), Argentina (last in 1986) and France (last in 2018) have two titles each. =FIFA Women's World Cup= The FIFA Women's World Cup was inaugurated with the 1991 FIFA Women's World Cup, hosted in China, with 12 teams sent to represent their countries. Over 90,185 spectators attended the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup and nearly 1 billion viewers from 70 countries tuned in. By the 2003 FIFA Women's World Cup, 16 teams competed in the championship finals. Of the eight tournaments held to date (as of 2019), the United States (1991, 1999, 2015, 2019) is the most successful team with four titles; Germany (2003, 2007) have won the championship twice, and Norway (1995) and Japan (2011) have each won once. Women's confederations are the same as men's: Oceania (OFC), European (UEFA), North, Central America and Caribbean (CONCACAF), South American (CONMEBOL), Asian (AFC) and African (CAF).

Bush participates in a Panel on the American Competitiveness Initiative at Cisco Systems, Inc in San Jose, California, Friday, April 21, 2006. The American Competitiveness Initiative (ACI) is a federal assistance program intended to help America maintain its competitiveness through investment in research and development (R&D;) and education. The ACI’s focus is on programs that are likely to strengthen U.S. competitiveness by targeting funding to agencies that support research in the physical sciences. NASA, however, is not included in the ACI. In partnership with the private sector, state and local governments, and colleges and universities, the ACI hopes to promote new levels of educational achievement and economic productivity.  Background  In October 2005, the National Academies of Science released a report that revealed how U.S. technological leadership and export are currently under threat. As an example, the report cited that out of the 120 chemical plants built around the world worth $1 billion or more, one is constructed in the United States but 50 are in China. The organization stressed that \\"the scientific and technical building blocks of our economic leadership are eroding at a time when many other nations are gathering strength.\\" Three months after the publication of the report, ACI was announced in President George W. Bush’s State of the Union Address given on January 31, 2006.http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi- bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=2006_presidential_documents&docid;=pd06fe06_txt-11.pdf In his statement, the President said: \\"Our greatest advantage in the world has always been our educated, hard-working, ambitious people - and we are going to keep that edge.\\" The Initiative committed $5.9 billion ($1.3 billion in new Federal funding, and an additional $4.6 billion in R&D; tax incentives) in FY 2007 to increase investments in R&D;, strengthen education, and encourage entrepreneurship. Over ten years, the Initiative plans to commit $50 billion to increase funding for research and $86 billion for R&D; tax incentives.http://www.eda.gov/PDF/EDAUpdate_0206.html Key programs under the ACI include: * more rigorous math courses with new programs for elementary and middle school students and research-based instruction; * in-service development of new Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate teachers in schools that serve low-income families; and * preservice development for 30,000 math and science professionals who will become adjunct high school teachers.

Almeda was accredited by the Council for Distance Education Accreditation, the Interfaith Education Ministries (IEM), and the Association for Online Academic Excellence (AOAEX), none of which were recognized by the United States Department of Education or the Council for Higher Education Accreditation. Almeda University is widely regarded as a diploma mill. They were owned and operated by Pakistani software company Axact. History Almeda University was founded in 1997 as a distance learning program. From 2001 to 2016, the school awarded undergraduate degrees as well as masters and doctorate degrees based upon \\"life experience\\". Degrees were issued upon payment, with life experience assessments based on the word of the applicant. In addition to its degree programs, Almeda University also offered a wide selection of zero-credit courses intended for professional development. As of 2012, Almeda only had a mailing address in Boise, Idaho. Upon inspection, Bears' Guide says that it could not locate the physical address of the institution and was informed by reception that Almeda University was a \\"web only\\" institution.Bears' Guide to Earning Degrees by Distance Learning , John Bear, Maria Bear, (2003-01-01), pp.187 Ten Speed Press, 215. Richard Smith was Almeda's founding CEO. Academics Almeda University offered associate, bachelor's, master's and doctorate degrees using \\"Prior Learning Assessments” which evaluated a candidate’s life experience. Almeda University also offered several hundred non-degree technical and business courses and certification preparation programs by e-learning. Accreditation and recognition Legally, Almeda University was a corporation registered on the Caribbean island of Nevis. Almeda was listed as an accredited member of Interfaith Education Ministries and the Association for Online Academic Excellence, and claimed accreditation by the Council for Distance Education Accreditation; however, none of these were recognized by the United States Department of Education or the Council for Higher Education Accreditation. On its website, Almeda stated that its sources of accreditation were not recognized by the U.S. Department of Education, with the result that students could not receive U.S. federal loans or assistance under the GI Bill, and that Almeda degrees might not be recognized by academia or employers in some states. *Connecticut: In October 2001, the Connecticut Department of Higher Education ordered Almeda to cease offering degrees in Connecticut. In 2002, when an investigation showed that Almeda continued to advertise its programs in Connecticut, the Department of Higher Education sent a second cease and desist letter to Almeda and referred the issue to the Connecticut Attorney General for possible legal action. *Florida: In 2003, the Florida Department of Education entered into an agreement with Almeda requiring the institution to cease operating in the state. While Floridians could still get a degree from the online university, Almeda warned customers that its degrees might be invalid for public employment in Florida. *Texas: Almeda was listed on the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board list of \\"Institutions Whose Degrees are not recognized in Texas.\\" *Other States: Almeda's web site indicated that its degrees also might not be valid for public employment in Illinois, Oregon, New Jersey, North Dakota, Washington and Idaho. The Better Business Bureau additionally advised that residents of these states should potentially \\"consider the Almeda degree as a novelty item only\\". In January 2013, the city of Fraser, Michigan, sued Almeda and 99 other \\"John Doe\\" defendants alleging violations of the Michigan Authentic Credentials in Education Act. In January 2016, the Michigan Court of Appeals upheld one of these claims (barring the others due to the statute of limitations). Reception Almeda's academic standards have been criticized by a variety of education organizations. According to Bears' Guide to Earning Degrees by Distance Learning, Almeda College and University was a web-only university offering degrees based on an assessment of a candidate's \\"life experience\\". Bear noted that Almeda stated it was accredited by the Association for Online Academic Excellence, but that association itself was also unrecognized. In 2011 the U.S. News University Directory, operated by U.S. News & World Report, published an article about online education that favorably mentioned Almeda's master's degree program in psychology. Inside Higher Ed reported in June 2011 that the U.S. News website had removed the posting after being alerted that Almeda \\"was not recognized as an accredited degree-granting university by the U.S. Department of Education or any other mainstream accrediting agency\\". Website editors stated their commitment to \\"focus on accredited colleges and universities\\" and blamed an \\"editorial oversight\\" for the site's use of an Almeda press release.Steve Kolowich, Ranking the Online Colleges , Inside Higher Ed, June 30, 2011 In a 2017 CBC Marketplace episode investigating diploma mills, it was discovered that several people from across Canada had purchased degrees from Almeda and then passed them off as accredited degrees. Incidents In 2004 a CBS affiliate in Albany, New York, reported that one of their reporters filed an Almeda application for an associate degree on behalf of his dog, citing child care responsibilities and other requisite experience. Almeda initially granted the dog a \\"life experience\\" associate degree in childhood development based on the false and erroneous claims. Almeda later proclaimed in public response that the reporter perjured himself by creating a false identity. In 2006 a Naples, Florida police officer was forced to return a salary increase based on an Almeda degree. In addition, two other Naples police officers were temporarily terminated when an investigation showed that they received diplomas from Almeda. Both officers appealed the ruling, stating they had spoken to department administrators before submitting the credentials needed to verify that they qualified for the incentive program. In October 2006, both officers were reinstated with back pay, but both received 10-day suspensions and were required to take an ethics course. Similarly, in 2009, eight Washington state troopers who obtained degrees from Almeda had to relinquish educational incentive pay but avoided recrimination as prosecutors could not establish criminal intent.Sharon Pian Chan, Troopers with bogus degrees won't be charged, Seattle Times.

Located at the corners of 5th Street and Main Street in downtown Cedar Falls. = Founding = In 1846, Mrs. Jackson Taylor opened the first school in her home at Waterloo Road and East 13th Streets. Early residents recalled seeing parents escort their children to school because Native Americans living in the area were sighted in the woods near the Taylor home. Today, a light red marker commemorates the site of the Taylor home. In 1863, the old Central School was constructed to serve grades K-12 which occupied an entire city block. In the 1890s, the name was changed to Lincoln School. = First high school = In 1900, Cedar Falls High School was constructed as the first separate high school in Cedar Falls. The building was located where the Falls Recreation Center currently resides. An addition was added in 1914, and this building was used until 1953. = Current Facility = The current building, located at 1015 Division Street, was opened in 1954. The school has been partially remodeled, including a new English wing that completed construction in 2005.

There are three choirs offered for students during the school day: a select concert choir, a Women's choir, known as Treble Clef Choir, and Men's choir, known as Bass Clef Choir. A Vocal Jazz group is offered to students by audition. The choirs perform three concerts during the school year as well as participate in various festivals and contests throughout the year. Students are also encouraged to participate in all-state, solo/ensemble, and a variety of community functions throughout the year. The instrumental music department is led by Mr. Gerald Ramsey and Mr. Kyle Engelhardt. Marching band, two concert bands, two jazz bands, and pep band are offered to students throughout the year. Band students regularly earn top honors in all large ensemble categories at festivals, and also participate in all of the state-sanctioned festivals. In the 10–11 school year, Cedar Falls had 17 students, not counting one alternate, selected for All-State band. The orchestral music department is led by Ms Ann Osborne. String orchestra is offered throughout the year, and full orchestra (winds and percussion) is offered from mid-October through May. In addition, a chamber orchestra is formed for different concerts as needed. All of the orchestra groups have earned top marks at the IHSMA music festivals, and maintain a strong level of participation in all-state and solo/ensemble festival opportunities.  Athletics  The athletic teams are known as the Tigers. CFHS is a member of the Mississippi Valley Conference. Major rivals include the Waterloo West Wahawks and the Waterloo East Trojans. A budding rivalry on the gridiron is also enjoyed by fans of Cedar Falls and Iowa City High School. = State championships = The Tigers are considered to be an average representation of American high school football. Cedar Falls competes at the Class 4A (largest) level in the state of Iowa. Cedar Falls men's and women's swimming have dominated the state of Iowa. The Tigers hold numerous state championships. Under the direction of Coach Dick Marcussen, the women continue to be a power. Since the formation of the MVC in 1992, Cedar Falls has been the conference champion each year. The men are under new leadership after Marcussen resigned from his post as coach of the men. Both the men and women won state championships in the 2005 season. The team is now coached by Dana Pieffer, who led the team to their third state championship in 2006. Coach Marcussen returned for the 2007-2008 men's season, replacing Dana Pfeiffer. A string of championships in the 90s gave CFHS three wrestling titles, following titles won in 1968 and 1976. Cedar Falls bowling, women's basketball, men's cross country, among others have all won state championships since the late 1990s. The Cedar Falls Tiger Football team has had a decade of success, including several finals appearances, and one state championship class 4A in 1986. Led by coach Pat Mitchell, the Tigers have made playoff appearances in nine of the last ten years. Brad Remmert, a CF alum and former Iowa Hawkeye, has been named as the future successor to Mitchell. The Tigers are one of two teams in the state of Iowa that plays home games indoors. Contrary to other Tiger athletic squads, the football team has no black on the uniforms. On Thursday, February 17, 2011, Cassy Harkelman became the first female wrestler to win an Iowa state tournament match in the history of Iowa high school wrestling. She earned a 20-13 pre-tournament record at 112 pounds before receiving an opening-round default at the state tournament. Cassy was joined by another female wrestler in 2011 as the only female wrestlers to qualify for the state tournament since its inception by the Iowa High School Athletic Association in 1926.

The upperside of its wings are a bright reddish brown. Towards the centre of the wing are broad white spots. In flight, one can see a bright red brown butterfly with a white band forming a V shape. There are also a few white spots scattered on the wings. Its hindwings have crenulated margins.

Locally abundant, it is common from Sri Lanka to Maharashtra. It is rare in Gujarat and far more common in the Himalayas. Ecology The commander is generally found in forested regions having moderate to heavy rainfall. It usually keeps to low elevations, that is, up to into the hills. It is fond of open glades, roadsides and clearings in forests. It is abundant along watercourses in dry and moist deciduous forests. It is also found close to villages or wherever its larval host plant Mussaenda frondosa is found. It is most common in the post-monsoon months and winter. The commander can often be spotted basking with its wings pressed flat on exposed stones in streambeds. Individuals settle down on an exposed perch high up in the trees during the heat of the day. At this time it can be seen defending its territory and driving intruding butterflies away. This butterfly has a swift flight with rapid wingbeats and alternate spurts of smooth gliding. A powerful flier, it nevertheless flies for short distances at a time. Being wary, it maintains its distance and is best caught when engrossed in mud-puddling or feeding from flowers. It regularly visits flowers from low-lying herbs to high up in the trees. Though this is a mud-puddling species, in Borneo and probably elsewhere, adults do not visit carrion or old fruit to drink liquids.Hamer et al.

Frass chain of the commander caterpillar, used for defence =Caterpillar= The caterpillar is dirty brown with a chestnut tinge and dark brown splotches all over. The body also bears numerous processes which help to break up its outline. The behaviour of this caterpillar is very interesting in that it is one of the species of butterfly that makes long chains of frass. It eats up part of the leaf it is on and uses bits of leaves which are strung up with silk along with droppings. The caterpillar rests on the exposed mid-rib of a leaf after removing the leafy portions on the sides. This behaviour may be to dissuade ants from crossing over the chain of frass behind which the caterpillar rests. =Pupa= Before pupating, the caterpillar wanders around, often far away from the plant it fed on. It pupates among dried leaves and twigs. The pupa is brownish and rough in texture. It is angular with prominent wing expansions and bears flat processes on the head which curl together making a hole between them. It also has numerous lines and markings that make it look like a rolled up dried leaf. Footnotes References  * Hamer, K.C.; Hill, J.K.; Benedick, S.; Mustaffa, N.; Chey, V.K. & Maryati, M.

In mathematics, the spectral asymmetry arises in the study of elliptic operators on compact manifolds, and is given a deep meaning by the Atiyah-Singer index theorem. In physics, it has numerous applications, typically resulting in a fractional charge due to the asymmetry of the spectrum of a Dirac operator. For example, the vacuum expectation value of the baryon number is given by the spectral asymmetry of the Hamiltonian operator. The spectral asymmetry of the confined quark fields is an important property of the chiral bag model. For fermions, it is known as the Witten index, and can be understood as describing the Casimir effect for fermions. Definition Given an operator with eigenvalues \\\\omega_n, an equal number of which are positive and negative, the spectral asymmetry may be defined as the sum :B=\\\\lim_{t\\\\to 0} \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sum_n \\\\sgn(\\\\omega_n) \\\\exp (-t\\\\omega_n) where \\\\sgn(x) is the sign function. Other regulators, such as the zeta function regulator, may be used. The need for both a positive and negative spectrum in the definition is why the spectral asymmetry usually occurs in the study of Dirac operators. Example As an example, consider an operator with a spectrum :\\\\omega_n=n+\\\\alpha where n is an integer, ranging over all positive and negative values. One may show in a straightforward manner that in this case B(\\\\alpha) obeys B(\\\\alpha)= B(\\\\alpha +m) for any intger m , and that for 0<\\\\alpha<1 we have B(\\\\alpha)=1/2-\\\\alpha . The graph of B(\\\\alpha) is therefore a periodic sawtooth curve. Discussion Related to the spectral asymmetry is the vacuum expectation value of the energy associated with the operator, the Casimir energy, which is given by :E=\\\\lim_{t\\\\to 0} \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sum_n \\\\omega_n \\\\exp (-t\\\\omega_n) This sum is formally divergent, and the divergences must be accounted for and removed using standard regularization techniques.

The word \\"ataraxia\\" in the title is a Greek term for \\"tranquility\\", giving the title the combined meaning of \\"empty (or false) tranquility\\". The game also was ported to PlayStation Vita, and it includes full-voice acting, among other enhancements. This version was released in Japan on November 27, 2014. Plot The plot of Fate/hollow ataraxia is based 6 months after the events of Fate/stay night. Like its preceding counterpart, the story is set in Fuyuki City. Bazett Fraga McRemitz, a member of the Mages' Association and a master in the Fifth Holy Grail War, wakes on the fourth day of the Fifth Holy Grail war with a new servant, Avenger, and no memory of what happened to her beforehand. She and Avenger set off to fight and win the Holy Grail War. Meanwhile, Shirō Emiya lives a peaceful life with all of his friends from the Fifth Holy Grail War. After one of her experiments changes time and space, Rin Tohsaka leaves for the Mages' Association in England to fix things. The Servants sense a new danger while dark creatures appear soon afterward. Shirō, as a precaution, sets off to ensure nobody is in danger and instead finds himself frequently meeting a mysterious girl, Caren Ortensia. Both Bazett and Shirō find themselves in a time loop that lasts four days, beginning of the fourth day of the Fifth Holy Grail War. Each time they die or survive four days, they always awake on the first day of the loop, aware of what has happened to them since the first time loop began. Determined to end the loop, Bazett, Avenger, and Shirō fight to discover the truth behind what is causing the endless four days. Characters ; :The first of the three protagonists. A mage from the Knights of the Red Branch sent by the Mage's Association to fight the 5th War of the Holy Grail, born in Ireland as a descendant of old mage family of an unusual bloodline. She originally summoned Lancer (her childhood hero and later love interest), but was betrayed by her old colleague Kotomine and had her left arm with its Command Seals stolen. She was left for dead before she was discovered by Avenger, who created the time loop inside of Bazett's mind, so that she could stay alive from her fatal injuries. Bazett can directly fight and defeat Servants due to her family's combat-based magecraft and her ancestral Noble Phantasm: the sacred dagger Fragarach, which reverses time so that it always strikes first in response to her opponent's ultimate attack. She is mentioned very briefly in Fate/stay night but does not make an appearance. She is voiced by Hitomi Nabatame in Fate/tiger colosseum, Fate/unlimited codes, Carnival Phantasm, Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya (anime), and Fate/hollow ataraxia (PSVita). ; :A new and central character to the story, Caren is a member of the Church and works as a priestess. She is kind and forgiving to the point that she believes her only purpose in life is to help others, even if she is hurt in the process. She never blames the person who has hurt her and blames the act on demons who caused the person to commit the sin. Whenever she is at fault, she apologizes to God rather than the person. Despite her kindness, she has a love for teasing and exploiting others' emotional vulnerability. Upon discovery of an individual's weak spot, she enjoys bringing it out to light in front of all to witness. While this antagonizes many characters and causes much outrage and humiliation, she herself remains calm. Also, in spite of being a priestess, she has deliberately chosen to wear a revealing costume with no skirt to both increase her mobility and to seduce men. :As a member of the Church, Caren assists in exorcisms. Her body itself possesses an unusual property: if there is a person nearby who has been possessed by a demon, she will experience the same pain as the possessed person. As a result, exorcists employ her to act as a radar of sorts to find demons. This ability is most evident whenever she comes in proximity to the Servant Avenger as her body sprouts grotesque spikes. As a result of this power, she is always covered in bandages. She also experiences physical pain whenever people in proximity do evil things. In battle, she uses a red cloth of Magdala, which has the power to forcefully bind men. However, while the man is bound, no harmful physical attacks can be made against him or Magdala will be rendered useless. She is actually the daughter of Kotomine Kirei and hates him for abandoning her. In the epilogue, she has some interest in Shirou due to her close interactions with Avenger in the time loop, even painting him with oil to resemble the latter. She also wields control over Lancer, much to Bazett's dismay, as compensation for having saved Bazett, and refuses to return the Command Seals to Bazett unless she can have Bazett's current artificial hand, which the both of them have come to see as a sentimental reminder of Avenger. :She is voiced by Ami Koshimizu in Fate/tiger colosseum, the All Around Type-Moon Drama CD, Carnival Phantasm, Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya (anime) and Fate/hollow ataraxia (PSVita). ; :The 8th Servant, who was summoned in the 3rd war in lieu of a Berserker and another of the main protagonists. Avenger was originally a normal boy in the ancient middle east who, in a cruel twist of fate, was labeled as Angra Mainyu via a random lottery and was tortured until he died of old age so that he, as the embodiment of evil itself, could allow the other villagers to live free of sin and as a result became the first \\"Anti-Hero\\" to enter the Throne of Heroes, as well as becoming the model from which all martyrs within the Throne of Heroes stem from. He was later summoned as Avenger in the Third Grail War by the Einzbern in an attempt to cheat, but was the first to die (as he is not the actual Angra Mainyu, who had long since left for the Other Side of the World) and corrupted the Grail, as the belief of others had made him into All The World's Evils even though the Grail recognized him as a human with a wish it needed to fulfill (his own rebirth as Angra Mainyu), his presence within the Grail is what allows for the summoning of some of history and mythology's greatest villains and monsters as \\"heroes\\". He was released when Emiya Shirō and Saber utterly annihilated the Grail at the end of the Fifth Grail War and came across a dying Bazett and responded to her wish to live, by creating the time loop inside of Bazett's mind and created replicas of characters this dream world, but as he did not personally experience the Fifth Grail War, he instead recreated it using the Fifth's replica participants and with the Third Grail War's development as the base. He then took part in the loop using Emiya Shirō's body as a shell, allowing him to experience the peaceful daily life that Shirō experiences. He wields a pair of misshapen and brittle daggers in combat and his Noble Phantasm is \\"Verg Avesta\\" which reflects the pain caused by an opponent's attack back at them. He eventually decides to end the loop after realizing all the trouble he has caused and, with help from his new friends and allies, fights off the pieces of him that protect the Grail and ends the loop for good, but not before using the hidden crack that was opened in space-time of reality in real world made by Rin's copy of the Jeweled Sword of Zelretch by transfer and stabilize the timeline he helped create in the mind of Bazett, thus reviving the participants who died in the real Fifth Holy Grail War more than half a year ago (Masters and Servants, except Kotomine Kirei) and transferring the memories that Avenger did when he acted as Shirou for the true Shirou, so he can live and act on them (except the parts concerning Avenger and his remains as Shades so to hide his existence from Shirō) and so Shirō, Caren, and Bazett can live out whatever life they had made in this new timeline. He is voiced by Takuma Terashima in Fate/tiger colosseum, Fate/hollow ataraxia (PSVita), and Fate/Grand Order. ; :One of the three main protagonists in the story. Within this installment, Shirō experiences unexpected changes in personality and momentary lapses in memory, particularly related to his own skills. It is later revealed that this is because \\"Shirō\\" is connected to Avenger in some mysterious way, causing them to switch places when night falls, implying Avenger is either hiding in Shirō's body or is taking his form during the day, but forgets due to his \\"non-existence\\" being overwritten by the earth's laws. Once Shirō/Avenger discovers the truth, he becomes conflicted, as Shirō, with his naive sense of justice, wants to end the loop while Avenger wants to keep living his days out as Shirō, constantly repeating the cycle so that he can experience, by proxy, the life of a normal boy that he never had. When he finally convinces Bazett to finish the word loop, it is revealed that Shirou being possessed by Avenger was nothing more than a replica of Shirou that Avenger created to realize his personal desire, while the real Shirou and his friends were still present in the real world, in Fuyuki, after the events of Fifth Holy Grail War and having passed more than half a year. Once Avenger finally ends the loop and frees Bazett, before completely disappearing Avenger/Grail found the hidden crack that opened with the experiment caused by Rin to use the copy Zelretch's Jeweled Sword which she obtained with the help of Shirou and Illya six months after the Fifth Holy Grail War and using what was left of his power as Grail, Avenger corrected the slot and replaced the original timeline with the one he helped to create in Bazett's mind, thus reviving the Masters and Servants who died or disappeared (in the case of Saber) during the conflict (except Kotomine Kirei) and transferring the memories of all the times when the replicas of Fuyuki people who were present in the world loop made, including the true Shirou, so he and his friends would not be suspicious that the Masters and Servants who died more than half a year were killed really and making them think that they survived the end of Fifth Holy Grail War and living with them all this time, with the only people knowing all occurring being only Bazett, Caren, Illya, and Caster. In epilogue, the true Shirō is tricked into allowing Bazett and Caren stay at the Emiya household. ; :Saber is portrayed as having become more willing to open up and try and embrace her gender, rather than rejecting it as she did before, and engages in traditionally feminine tasks such as baking and is willing to wear more overtly feminine clothes (i.e. a bikini or a blouse) if it means impressing Shirō, as the lack of combat during the daytime and co-habitation with Rider and Rin has made Saber extremely self-conscious over her lack of femininity. She has also gained a taste for Japanese sweets, venturing out into town on her own to purchase them with the allowance Taiga gives her. She remains fiercely loyal to Shirō/Avenger and several times puts her life on the line (and loses it) to protect him. As she gets more in touch with her gender, Saber also begins to reveal more about her real personality: she is loyal and brave, but is also painfully shy and gets extremely jealous when other girls express interest in her master, such as when Shirō/Avenger has dinner with Sakura. If the player follows her character arc far enough, Saber will eventually confide in Shirō/Avenger that, while she loves living in Japan with him and their friends, she is beginning to feel homesick and wishes to return to England someday if only to visit, hoping that Shirō will come with her. Saber Alter also exists within her, and comes out whenever Saber's stray hair strand is pulled off, though it regenerates with time; Saber Alter is portrayed as the opposite of Saber, as she is blunt, loud, no-nonsense, and enjoys cheap, greasy fast food such as hamburgers. ; :In the first half of the game, Rin is in London. She returns in the second half with an apparently dramatic change in personality (specifically, a penchant for cosplaying as a miko or magical girls). However, she has also become an experienced mage, demonstrating this when she was the first to logically compose an explanation as to why time has been looping for four days and when she gives Shirō advice. In Fate/hollow ataraxia, she wields the Kaleidostick, another of Zeltretch's inventions which, when activated, transfers knowledge from an alternate version of its user into its current wielder, in addition to providing an ample source of Mana. However, the Kaleidostick dislikes its creator, and frequently manipulates its user into humiliating situations. Her tsundere personality is shown in greater detail here as seen in her interactions. She is shown to be very stingy, bossy and quite mischievous. She makes fun of Shirō several times. She has feelings for Shirō after watching him stubbornly attempting to do a high jump that he had no chance. Although she calls him an idiot, Rin admires Shirō for his tenacity and kind-heart. In Fate/hollow ataraxia, the Kaleidostick is responsible for transforming Rin into the magical girl Kaleido-Ruby. Rin is partially responsible for the current state of affairs in the universe of Fate/stay night. After 5th Holy Grail War was finished, she and Shirou's sister, Ilyasviel von Einzbern, were experimenting with creating a copy of the legendary Jeweled Sword of Zelretch and accidentally causing with that any outcome can be drawn in Fuyuki, which meant that at any time, the crack that Rin created by accident and was hidden somewhere in the reality of Fuyuki space-time could be used to alter reality and the timeline in which they were living and could be radically changed from overnight anytime. This is proved in the game's prologue, when the game starts and which is the same time the world loop created by Avenger ended to free Bazett his comatose for more than half a year, the reality that Shirou and his friends knew how finished the Fifth Holy Grail war and all Servants gone with the end of the war was completely changed when Avenger, using his last strength as Grail before disappearing completely, found that crack and corrected by transfer timeline effects that he had helped to create in the mind of Bazett when he was performing the world loop, caused the Fate, Unlimited Blade Works, and Heaven's Feel routes of the original visual novel to converge into a single timeline and then stabilized by seal that crack, resurrecting in the process the Masters and Servants (except Kotomine) who died in that conflict in the real world. ; :Sakura has developed greatly as a character. Sakura while still retaining her reticent nature throughout the game starts becoming a self confident and self sufficient person both as a magi and as a leader so much so that she even manages to scold Taiga into submission. Sakura has now become the captain of the school's Archery club where which she diligently leads with great skill under the tutelage of Ayako Mitsuzuri. Sakura has become one of the club's top archers to the point that it leads Taiga to believe they could win tournaments. Sakura now stays at the Emiya residence on weekends, holidays and special occasions while becoming the head of the Matou household having ousted Zouken for control. Rider had even said that both Shinji and Zouken are now afraid of her. Sakura continues to assist in cooking having become a sous chef of sorts to Shirou the primary chef of the household and maintaining the upkeep of the Emiya household. Sakura's specialty is apparently pastries beating every other cook in the game in this regard. She and Rin now have a great relationship truly becoming sisters, with Rin educating her in cooking and magecraft despite that Sakura maintains slight resentment and an inferiority complex towards Rin. When it comes to Shirou she still displays jealousy towards other women when Shirou pays them attention over her and continues to pampers and dotes him. Sakura's evil and sadistic side from the Heaven's Feel route of Fate/stay night only comes out every now and then as comic relief in the game. ; :Since the war, Rider has begun staying at the Emiya household, becoming the de facto adult and breadwinner of the home. She got a job at an antique store to bring some much needed income to the household and mocks Saber as being nothing more than a freeloader, though the two made up after Rider bought her some sweets. She has feelings for Shirō due to him being the first male in her life to treat her with care and respect and once had sex with him while he slept, using an illusion to disguise herself within his dreams and openly admitting that she was open to the idea of a polyamorous relationship between herself, Shirō, and Sakura. She, like Saber, is having trouble adjusting to the modern world and must have basic concepts such as apologizing explained to her at length. ;Other characters :While playing less prominent roles, all Masters and Servants of the 5th Holy Grail War from Fate/stay night appear again, with the exception of Kirei Kotomine and True Assassin, as they were never destined to survive the 5th Holy Grail War (with Kotomine having been cursed with an artificial heart in the 4th Holy Grail War and Fake Assassin not being able to coexist with True assassin).

Career Reitter finished his studies at Technical University of Budapest in 1833 and until 1844 worked on the mapping and study of the Tisza and Maros rivers. He also took part in the channelling of the Danube river. He had a major role in the capital's department of public works during the rebuilding of Budapest during the second half of the nineteenth century. As director he was largely responsible for the building of the city's quays, channelling of the riverbanks and the planning of the ring roads and axial roads, Andrássy út in particular. This was to become the most important thoroughfare in Pest. Its construction was first considered in 1871 and it opened to traffic in 1896 to coincide with the millenarian anniversary of the Magyars' arrival in the Carpathian Basin in 1896. Reitter planned the route to follow a major swampy branch of the Danube river, which swings eastward in a large arch from Danube to Danube over a distance of 4.141 meters. The canal passed through a suburban district of narrow streets and, at the time, Reitter also considered making the backwater into a navigable canal to improve the air quality and lessen pollution. However, a solid thoroughfare was agreed upon and its construction took place at the same time as that of Sugár út, latterly Andrássy Avenue. In 1865 Reitter became a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.

The film is an allegorical drama about an eight-year-old girl dealing with loss. Highly acclaimed, it received the Special Jury Prize Award at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival. Plot Eight-year-old Ana, stoic and quiet, approaches her father's bedroom. She hears a woman in bed with her father and confessing her love for him. Descending the stairs, Ana spies an attractive middle-aged woman hastily dressing and rushing from the bedroom to the front door of the darkened house. The woman and Ana exchange glances but do not speak. Once the woman has left, Ana enters her father's bedroom and finds the man dead, apparently from a heart attack. As if not really understanding the gravity of the situation, Ana unflappably takes away a half-full glass of milk, which she carries to the kitchen and cleans. In the kitchen, she sees her mother, who chides her for being up so late and sends her off to bed. Reality and fantasy swap places. The bizarre death of Ana's father, who is revealed to have been a senior Army officer, is real. The apparently banal appearance of the mother at the fridge, on the other hand, was in fact fantasized by the child. Ana's mother has already died of cancer; her image is only a fanciful illusion of the little girl's mind. Blaming her mother's illness and death on her father, Ana had dissolved a mysterious powder she believed to be a potent poison in his milk glass as a willful act of murder. Her belief in the power of the poison was thus confirmed when her father died. At her father's wake, Ana sees again the mysterious woman who fled her father's bedroom on the night of his death. The woman, Amelia, is the wife of her father's close friend and fellow military officer. Ana's satisfaction of having rid herself of her father's presence is short-lived, for her mother's sister, her Aunt Paulina, soon arrives to set the house in order. The all- female household is completed by the children's grandmother, mute and waiting for death in a wheelchair, and the feisty, fleshy housekeeper, Rosa. Ana takes refuge in the basement, where she keeps her powder, and where she is watched by an apparition of herself from twenty years in the future. The adult Ana, looking exactly like her mother, recounts her infancy. The little rituals of everyday life fill Ana's days during her summer vacation from school. Tortured by the memories of her mother's illness, Ana rebels against her aunt's authoritarian style, and in bouts of loneliness she variously imagines her mother's continued presence, or even her own suicide. Though diverted by the presence of her two sisters, Ana's only truly close companions are the family maid, Rosa, and her pet guinea pig, Roni, whom she discovers dead in his cage one morning. Ana's mother's painful death from cancer, her father's presumed murder, her guinea pig's death and her own imagined suicide weigh on the girl's mind. Ana even offers her grandmother the opportunity of dying and ridding herself from loneliness by providing her a spoonful of the poison. The old woman turns down Ana's offer and realizes that the powder is simply baking soda. The adult Ana explains child Ana's obsession with the powder: her mother once told her that it was a poison, so strong that one spoonful would kill an elephant. Adult Ana further explains her motivation in wanting to kill her father: \\"The only thing I remembered perfectly is that then my father seemed responsible for the sadness that weighed on my mother in the last years of her life. I was convinced that he, and he alone, had provoked her illness.\\" In a flashback, we see child Ana watching her parents on an occasion when her father came home late. Her mother pleas him to open up to her, to love her. He coldly accuses her of causing him grief to which she responds by crying out that she’s sickly and desires death, which he again discards as an attempt to change his behavior. Ana attempts to poison her aunt with the same powder. She repeats the preparation of milk with the substance, but awakens the next morning for the first day of school to find that Paulina is still alive. Ana and her two sisters leave the stifling family compound after one, Irene, tells her a vision from a dream she had of being put at the stake, \\"...y cuando me iban a matar, me desperté.\\" They march into the vibrant and noisy city, which they have been all but shut out from. The film ends with girls in black uniforms going to classes and then an aerial vision of Castilian and Aragonese Madrid. Cast Ana Torrent plays the lead character, Ana. She was already well known thanks to her starring role in the film El espíritu de la colmena (The Spirit of the Beehive) (1973) by Víctor Erice, made when she was seven years old. She followed Cría Cuervos with yet another memorable role in The Nest (1980) in which she played a thirteen-year-old in a relationship with an aging widower played by Héctor Alterio who here has the role of Anselmo, Ana's father. Geraldine Chaplin plays dual roles: Ana's mother, Maria, in which she speaks Spanish with an English accent and Ana as a young woman in which she is dubbed by actress Julieta Serrano. Chaplin was director Saura's common-law wife and muse at that time. She appeared in ten of his films.Stone, Spanish Cinema, p. 108 * Ana Torrent as Ana, 8 years old * Conchi Pérez as Irene, 11 years old * Maite Sánchez as Maite, 5 years old * Geraldine Chaplin as Ana's mother (Maria) and older Ana * Mónica Randall as Aunt Paulina * Florinda Chico as Rosa, a maid * Josefina Díaz as Ana's grandmother * Héctor Alterio as Anselmo, Ana's father * Mirta Miller as Amelia, Anselmo's mistress * Germán Cobos as Nicholas, Amelia's husband Title The title Cría Cuervos comes from the Spanish proverb, \\"Cría cuervos y te sacarán los ojos\\". This translates as, \\"Raise ravens, and they'll gouge your eyes out\\" and is generally used for someone who has bad luck in raising children, or raising them badly. It may also imply rebellious behavior or that every bad act will return to haunt you. The phrase \\"Cría cuervos y te sacarán los ojos\\" is said to originate with Don Álvaro de Luna of Castile during a hunting expedition. In the course of the hunt his party came across a beggar with terrible scarring in the place of eyes. The beggar explained that he had raised a raven for three years with affection and great care, but it attacked him one day, leaving him blind. The bon mot was Don Álvaro's reply.Stone, Spanish Cinema, p. 109 Cría Cuervos was originally released as Cría! in the United States and as Raise Ravens in the UK, but the original title Cría Cuervos is now used in both countries. Analysis This film was made during a period where Carlos Saura was considered one of the great opponents, along with other directors, of the Francoist Spain, with characters and themes in the film alluding to Saura's interpretations and criticisms of Franco-inspired truths. The film stresses the disparity between Ana's inner world of private traumas and the outer world of political realities and the Francoist State. Ana will cope with her guilt in both arenas. When asked to elucidate the nature of Ana's suffering, the director replied: \\"Cría Cuervos is a sad film, yes. But that's part of my belief that childhood is one of the most terrible parts in the life of a human being. What I'm trying to say is that at that age you've no idea where it is you are going, only that people are taking you somewhere, leading you, pulling you and you are frightened. You don't know where you're going or who you are or what you are going to do. It's a time of terrible indecision.\\"Stone, Spanish Cinema\\", p. 102 Reception Cría Cuervos was shot in the summer of 1975, as Spanish leader Francisco Franco lay dying, and premiered in Madrid's Conde Duque Theatre, on January 26, 1976.Criterion Collection essay by Paul Julian Smith Highly acclaimed, it received the Cannes film festival Special Jury Prize Award. The film became director Carlos Saura and producer Elías Querejeta's most commercially successful film up to that point, going on to become the sixth largest grossing Spanish film of 1976.D'Lugo, The Films of Carlos Saura, p. 138 The picture made a similar strong showing in foreign markets, including the United States where it solidified Saura's reputation as Spain's best internationally-known director of the 1970s. Today the film is considered a political and psychological masterpiece and a classic of Spanish Cinema. The film was selected as the Spanish entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 49th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences It was, however, nominated for Best Foreign Language Film by the U.S. National Board of Review. Music The film prominently features the pop song \\"Porque te vas\\" by Jeanette, an English-born singer, singing in Spanish, whose accented voice reminds Ana of her mother, as played by Geraldine Chaplin, who speaks Spanish with her English-accented voice. Despite an infectious rhythm the song has sad and poignant lyrics. The song expresses the fact that Ana has no understanding of death, only of absence.Stone, Spanish Cinema, p. 101 DVD release Cría Cuervos was released on DVD on August 14, 2007 in a two-disc special edition as part of the Criterion Collection. The film was released on Blu-ray in a Dual Format Edition on May 27, 2013 by the BFI.

Automobiles traveling southbound from Miami pay a toll of US$2.25 as of 2018; northbound traffic is not charged any toll. Tolls are collected via Sunpass; C-Pass transponders or cash are no longer accepted. Also known as (unsigned) State Road 913Florida Department of Transportation, Official Florida Transportation Map 1998 west of the toll plaza, the causeway's northbound continuation is a flyover ramp with forks to northbound Interstate 95 (unsigned SR 9A) and southbound South Dixie Highway (US 1/unsigned SR 5); the southbound continuation is Crandon Boulevard, which extends roughly five miles through the center of Key Biscayne, terminating near the Cape Florida Lighthouse in Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park. Named after Eddie Rickenbacker, the American World War I flying ace and founder and president of Miami-based Eastern Air Lines, the causeway provides access to the Miami Seaquarium, the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, MAST Academy, Virginia Key Park, and Miami Marine Stadium on Virginia Key, and to Crandon Park, the Village of Key Biscayne, and Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park on the island of Key Biscayne.  History  Rickenbacker Causeway Talk of a bridge to Key Biscayne, inspired by the bridges connecting Miami to Miami Beach, started in 1926. The northern two-thirds of Key Biscayne was owned by William John “W.J.” Matheson, who had established a coconut plantation on the island. In February 1926 Matheson entered into an agreement with land developer D. P. Davis to develop and re-sell the northern half of Key Biscayne, including all of what is now Crandon Park and about half of the present Village of Key Biscayne. Later in 1926 the City of Coral Gables incorporated with Key Biscayne included in its boundaries. There were dreams of a bridge to the island, making Key Biscayne the seaside resort for Coral Gables that Miami Beach had become for Miami. Obstacles to the project soon appeared. In March 1926 the U.S. government auctioned off some lots on Key Biscayne that had been retained when the rest of the island was transferred to the State of Florida. The Mathesons wanted to have clear title to all of their land, and determined to outbid other interested parties for the land. They ended up paying US$58,055 for a total of of land, a record price per acre for the auction of U.S. government land up to that date. Then, on September 18, 1926, the Great Miami Hurricane crossed over Key Biscayne on its way to Miami. While no lives were lost on the island, most of the buildings on Key Biscayne were destroyed or badly damaged, and many of the plantings were lost, including half of the coconut trees. D. P. Davis was not able to meet his end of the contract; he declared bankruptcy and then disappeared en route to Europe by ship. The Florida Land Boom was over, as were plans for a bridge. William Matheson died in 1930, leaving the island to his children. There was a flurry of interest in 1939, when the U.S. Navy approved a proposal to develop Virginia Key as an air base and sea port. There was even talk of putting an air base on the north end of Key Biscayne, as well. In 1940 William Matheson's heirs donated of land (including two miles (3.2 km) of beach on the Atlantic Ocean) on the northern end of Key Biscayne to Dade County to be used as a public park (Crandon Park). The county commissioner who negotiated the gift, Charles H. Crandon, had offered for the county to build a causeway to Key Biscayne in exchange for the land donation. Planning for the air and sea complex on Virginia Key was still proceeding, and construction on a causeway to Virginia Key started in 1941. The Attack on Pearl Harbor and the entry of the United States into World War II stopped all work on the causeway and the development of Virginia Key. After the war Crandon pushed on with the project. He got financier Ed Ball to buy $6 million worth of bonds financing the construction of the causeway. Land for the toll plaza and the causeway entrance was bought from the estate of James Deering. Fill dredged from the bottom of Biscayne Bay and dug from the mainland were used as both the road bed and public beach areas, both to the west of Virginia Beach and on the southern reaches of the island. In November 1947 the Rickenbacker Causeway – of bridges and of roadway on fill – finally opened.Blank, Joan Gill. 1996. Key Biscayne. . pp. 153-162. In the late 1960s and 1970s the sites along the Rickenbacker Causeway continued to increase in popularity. After increasing in the mid 1960 because of the American television series Flipper, attendance to the Miami Seaquarium soared in 1968 when it started to display Hugo, its first killer whale (two years later, Lolita became their second. The two killer whales performed together until Hugo's death in 1980). Shortly afterward, Planet Ocean, a themed tourist attraction, opened its doors. Newly integrated beaches were often crowded; the causeway near the drawbridge across the Intracoastal Waterway, and bridgeway near the mainland, became favorite fishing spots. But popularity had a price: by 1980 it became evident that the concrete and steel structures supporting the roadway west of Virginia Key needed replacement. Five years later, the high-rise William Powell Bridge and new bridging nearest the toll plaza were built and opened at a cost of $27 million. With exception of the drawbridge (which was removed) the old bridging was left intact to serve as fishing piers.Blank. p. 173. In 2011, the West Fishing Pier was demolished. Since the opening of the new bridge, the MAST Academy took over the site of the defunct Planet Ocean (the theme attraction closed in 1991); the Virginia Key site of the City of Miami's garbage dump became a Superfund site for cleanup; the beach at Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park was gaining in popularity; but the Miami Marine Stadium has been virtually abandoned and the Miami Seaquarium has had a series of setbacks, from being devastated by hurricanes Andrew (1992) and Wilma (2005) and being prevented from expanding by threats of legal action by the newly incorporated Village of Key Biscayne. On the other hand, the entire length of the causeway, plus Crandon Boulevard, have become part of a popular bicycling route from Key Biscayne to Florida City. = Cycling = According to the publication CityLab, Miami, Florida is not known as a bicycle-friendly city: It's listed as the fourth most dangerous city to bike in the U.S.; between 2010 and 2014, 47 people were killed cycling through the city. Florida is the state with most cyclist fatalities per capita in United States (the situation is just as bleak for pedestrians).https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2017/03/miami-cycling- bridge-bike-culture/519237/ Although bicycling is very popular on the Rickenbacker Causeway, no physical division between the cars and bikes exist. This lack of separation between bikes and cars, excessive speeds and driving under the influence has contributed to at least four fatalities since 2006. This has spurred many cyclists to push for better bike lanes and barriers to protect them from the high-speed traffic on the bridge. Architect, urban planner, and lifelong cyclist Bernard Zyscovich saw an opportunity to promote cycling as a more viable means of transportation in Miami and launched Plan Z for Miami. Plan Z For Miami envisions a separated, partly elevated cycle-track that would connect the mainland to the causeway, bridge replacement and roadway elevation to account for future sea level rise as well as a new 20-acre park on Virginia Key created by shifting the roadway north. This pro bono effort by Zyscovich was in response to the death of Aaron Cohen, one of the four cyclists hit by cars on the Rickenbacker Causeway.http://planzmiami.com/ It's necessary to clarify that Plan Z isn't just a bike path, although that's perhaps the most striking part of the proposal. As Zyscovich explains, the Rickenbacker Causeway urgently needs structural renovations, including more elevation to help it survive climate change. “There is sea level rise, there is the replacement of the bridge, there is a 20-acre new park,” says the architect. “The bicycle aspect is only one part of the bigger project. But bicycle safety is the basis for beginning to think about it.”http://www.builderonline.com/building/making-miami-a-haven- for-cyclists_c The Rickenbacker Causeway and Crandon Boulevard are Miami- Dade's most popular bike routes for avid cyclists.http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami- dade/article136115883.html The path would then run along the William Powell Bridge, providing an observation deck for viewing the Miami skyline, then continue on to Virginia Key. Zyscovich's plan also imagines a 20-acre waterfront park and beach at the entrance of Virginia Key, with a branch of paths connecting to Virginia Key Park, before continuing on to Key Biscayne. Zyscovich thinks that Plan Z can kickstart a cultural change in the city. The project could join two other proposed infrastructure projects, a linear park called the Underline and the Ludlam Trail, a rails-to-trail multi-use path. “I think that what we are presenting is a concept large enough to contribute to creating a network,” the architect says. “If we can implement Plan Z, the Underline, and the Ludlam Trail, we are going to have thousands of users that will then become the advocacy group to demand more bicycle infrastructure.”https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2017/03/miami-cycling- bridge-bike-culture/519237/ In May 2017, Miami Dade County reclaimed land on Rickenbacker Causeway to help keep the Plan Z For Miami plan alive reported The Miami Herald.http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami- dade/article149356879.html  References  Category:Roads in Miami Category:Key Biscayne, Florida Category:Roads in Miami-Dade County, Florida Category:Causeways in Miami-Dade County, Florida Category:Toll bridges in Florida Category:Intracoastal Waterway Category:Bridges completed in 1947 Category:Road bridges in Florida Category:Concrete bridges in the United States Category:1947 establishments in Florida ","title":"Rickenbacker Causeway"},{"id":"4861343","text":"Mike Jemison (born June 3, 1983 in Greencastle, Pennsylvania) is an American football player who last played running back for the Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League and running back for the Hamburg Sea Devils of NFL Europe .

United States was the first case decided by the Supreme Court involving a direct challenge to the constitutionality of an act of Congress, the Carriage Act of 1794 which imposed a \\"carriage tax\\". The Court engaged in the process of judicial review by examining the plaintiff's claim that the carriage tax was unconstitutional. After review, the Supreme Court decided the Carriage Act was constitutional. In 1803, Marbury v. MadisonMarbury v. Madison, 5 US (1 Cranch) 137 (1803). was the first Supreme Court case where the Court asserted its authority for judicial review to strike down a law as unconstitutional. At the end of his opinion in this decision, Chief Justice John Marshall maintained that the Supreme Court's responsibility to overturn unconstitutional legislation was a necessary consequence of their sworn oath of office to uphold the Constitution as instructed in Article Six of the Constitution. , the United States Supreme Court has held 176 Acts of the U.S. Congress unconstitutional.See Congressional Research Services' The Constitution of the United States, Analysis And Interpretation, 2013 Supplement, pp. 49–50. Judicial review before the Constitution Before the Constitutional Convention in 1787, the power of judicial review had been exercised in a number of states. In the years from 1776 to 1787, state courts in at least seven of the thirteen states had engaged in judicial review and had invalidated state statutes because they violated the state constitution or other higher law. The first American decision to recognize the principle of judicial review was Bayard v. Singleton, decided in 1787 by the Supreme Court of North Carolina's predecessor. The North Carolina court and its counterparts in other states treated state constitutions as statements of governing law to be interpreted and applied by judges. These courts reasoned that because their state constitution was the fundamental law of the state, they must apply the state constitution rather than an act of the legislature that was inconsistent with the state constitution.Prakash and Yoo, \\"The Origins of Judicial Review\\", 70 U. of Chicago Law Review, pp. 933–934. These state court cases involving judicial review were reported in the press and produced public discussion and comment.Prakash and Yoo, \\"The Origins of Judicial Review\\", 70 U. of Chicago Law Review, p. 936. Notable state cases involving judicial review include one in Virginia in 1782, Commonwealth v. Caton.The Judicial Branch of State Government: People, Process, and PoliticsJohn Marshall: Definer of a Nation Another was Trevett v. Weeden from Rhode Island. At least seven of the delegates to the Constitutional Convention, including Alexander Hamilton, John Blair Jr. George Wythe, and Edmund Randolph, had personal experience with judicial review because they had been lawyers or judges in these state court cases involving judicial review.Prakash and Yoo, \\"The Origins of Judicial Review\\", 70 U. of Chicago Law Review p. 939. Other delegates referred to some of these state court cases during the debates at the Constitutional Convention.For example, James Madison referred to \\"the judges who refused to execute an unconstitutional law\\" in a Rhode Island case. Elbridge Gerry noted that \\"in some states, the judges had actually set aside laws, as being against the constitution.\\" Farrand, The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, vol. 1, p. 97. The concept of judicial review therefore was familiar to the framers and to the public before the Constitutional Convention. Provisions of the Constitution The text of the Constitution does not contain a specific reference to the power of judicial review. Rather, the power to declare laws unconstitutional has been deemed an implied power, derived from Article III and Article VI.While the Constitution does not explicitly authorize judicial review, it also does not explicitly prohibit it, as did the Virginia Constitution of 1776. That Virginia Constitution said: \\"All power of suspending laws, or the execution of laws, by any authority, without consent of the representatives of the people, is injurious to their rights, and ought not to be exercised.\\" Virginia Constitution of 1776 via Avalon Project at Yale Law School. The provisions relating to the federal judicial power in Article III state: The Supremacy Clause of Article VI states: The power of judicial review has been implied from these provisions based on the following reasoning. It is the inherent duty of the courts to determine the applicable law in any given case. The Supremacy Clause says \\"[t]his Constitution\\" is the \\"supreme law of the land.\\" The Constitution therefore is the fundamental law of the United States. Federal statutes are the law of the land only when they are \\"made in pursuance\\" of the Constitution. State constitutions and statutes are valid only if they are consistent with the Constitution. Any law contrary to the Constitution is void. The federal judicial power extends to all cases \\"arising under this Constitution.\\" As part of their inherent duty to determine the law, the federal courts have the duty to interpret and apply the Constitution and to decide whether a federal or state statute conflicts with the Constitution. All judges are bound to follow the Constitution. If there is a conflict, the federal courts have a duty to follow the Constitution and to treat the conflicting statute as unenforceable. The Supreme Court has final appellate jurisdiction in all cases arising under the Constitution, so the Supreme Court has the ultimate authority to decide whether statutes are consistent with the Constitution.See Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. at 175–78. Statements by the framers of the Constitution regarding judicial review =Constitutional Convention= During the debates at the Constitutional Convention, the Founding Fathers made a number of references to the concept of judicial review. The greatest number of these references occurred during the discussion of the proposal known as the Virginia Plan. The Virginia Plan included a \\"council of revision\\" that would have examined proposed new federal laws and would have accepted or rejected them, similar to today's presidential veto. The \\"council of revision\\" would have included the President along with some federal judges. Several delegates objected to the inclusion of federal judges on the council of revision. They argued the federal judiciary, through its power to declare laws unconstitutional, already had the opportunity to protect against legislative encroachment, and the judiciary did not need a second way to negate laws by participating in the council of revision. For example, Elbridge Gerry said federal judges \\"would have a sufficient check against encroachments on their own department by their exposition of the laws, which involved a power of deciding on their constitutionality. In some states the judges had actually set aside laws, as being against the constitution. This was done too with general approbation.\\"See Luther Martin said: \\"[A]s to the constitutionality of laws, that point will come before the judges in their official character. In this character they have a negative on the laws. Join them with the executive in the revision, and they will have a double negative.\\"Farrand, The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, vol. 2, p. 76. Nathaniel Gorham also made comments along these lines. See These and other similar comments by the delegates indicated that the federal courts would have the power of judicial review. Other delegates argued that if federal judges were involved in the law-making process through participation on the council of revision, their objectivity as judges in later deciding on the constitutionality of those laws could be impaired.Delegates making these comments included Rufus King, Caleb Strong, Nathaniel Gorham, and John Rutledge. See Rakove, \\"The Origins of Judicial Review: A Plea for New Contexts\\", 49 Stanford Law Review at 1058. These comments indicated a belief that the federal courts would have the power to declare laws unconstitutional.The council of revision proposed in the Virginia Plan ultimately morphed into the Presidential veto. In its final form, the executive alone would exercise the veto, without participation by the federal judiciary. At several other points in the debates at the Constitutional Convention, delegates made comments indicating their belief that under the Constitution, federal judges would have the power of judicial review. For example, James Madison said: \\"A law violating a constitution established by the people themselves, would be considered by the Judges as null & void.\\"Ibid., p. 93. Delegates approving of judicial review also included James Wilson and Gouverneur Morris, among others. See Prakash and Yoo, \\"The Origins of Judicial Review\\", 70 U. of Chicago Law Review at 941–43. George Mason said that federal judges \\"could declare an unconstitutional law void.\\" However, Mason added that the power of judicial review is not a general power to strike down all laws, but only ones that are unconstitutional: > But with regard to every law however unjust, oppressive or pernicious, which > did not come plainly under this description, they would be under the > necessity as Judges to give it a free course. In all, fifteen delegates from nine states made comments regarding the power of the federal courts to review the constitutionality of laws. All but two of them supported the idea that the federal courts would have the power of judicial review.Prakash and Yoo, \\"The Origins of Judicial Review\\", 70 U. of Chicago Law Review, p. 952. The two delegates who disapproved judicial review, John Dickinson and John Mercer, did not propose a provision prohibiting judicial review. During the state ratification conventions, they acknowledged that under the final Constitution, the courts would have the power of judicial review. Prakash and Yoo, \\"The Origins of Judicial Review\\", 70 U. of Chicago Law Review, p. 943. Some delegates to the Constitutional Convention did not speak about judicial review during the Convention, but did speak about it before or after the Convention. Including these additional comments by Convention delegates, scholars have found that twenty-five or twenty-six of the Convention delegates made comments indicating support for judicial review, while three to six delegates opposed judicial review.Raoul Berger found that twenty-six Convention delegates supported Constitution review, with six opposed. Charles Beard counted twenty-five delegates in favor of judicial review and three against. One review of the debates and voting records of the convention counted as many as forty delegates who supported judicial review, with four or five opposed.Melvin, Frank, \\"The Judicial Bulwark of the Constitution\\", 8 American Political Science Review 167, 185–195 (1914). In their comments relating to judicial review, the framers indicated that the power of judges to declare laws unconstitutional was part of the system of separation of powers. The framers stated that the courts' power to declare laws unconstitutional would provide a check on the legislature, protecting against excessive exercise of legislative power.See Prakash and Yoo, \\"The Origins of Judicial Review\\", 70 U. of Chicago Law Review at pp. 931–32.James Madison at one point said that the courts' power of judicial review should be limited to cases of a judiciary nature: \\"He doubted whether it was not going too far to extend the jurisdiction of the Court generally to cases arising under the Constitution and whether it ought not to be limited to cases of a judiciary nature. The right of expounding the Constitution in cases not of this nature ought not to be given to that department.\\" Madison wanted to clarify that the courts would not have a free-floating power to declare unconstitutional any law that was passed; rather, the courts would be able to rule on constitutionality of laws only when those laws were properly presented to them in the context of a court case that came before them. See Burr, Charles, \\"Unconstitutional Laws and the Federal Judicial Power\\", 60 U. Pennsylvania Law Review 624, 630 (1912). No change in the language was made in response to Madison's comment. =State ratification debates= Judicial review was discussed in at least seven of the thirteen state ratifying conventions, and was mentioned by almost two dozen delegates. In each of these conventions, delegates asserted that the proposed Constitution would allow the courts to exercise judicial review. There is no record of any delegate to a state ratifying convention who indicated that the federal courts would not have the power of judicial review.See Prakash and Yoo, \\"The Origins of Judicial Review\\", 70 U. of Chicago Law Review at p. 965. For example, James Wilson asserted in the Pennsylvania ratifying convention that federal judges would exercise judicial review: \\"If a law should be made inconsistent with those powers vested by this instrument in Congress, the judges, as a consequence of their independence, and the particular powers of government being defined, will declare such law to be null and void. For the power of the Constitution predominates. Anything, therefore, that shall be enacted by Congress contrary thereto will not have the force of law.\\" In the Connecticut ratifying convention, Oliver Ellsworth likewise described judicial review as a feature of the Constitution: \\"This Constitution defines the extent of the powers of the general government. If the general legislature should at any time overleap their limits, the judicial department is a constitutional check. If the United States go beyond their powers, if they make a law which the Constitution does not authorize, it is void; and the judicial power, the national judges, who, to secure their impartiality, are to be made independent, will declare it to be void.\\" During the ratification process, supporters and opponents of ratification published pamphlets, essays, and speeches debating various aspects of the Constitution. Publications by over a dozen authors in at least twelve of the thirteen states asserted that under the Constitution, the federal courts would have the power of judicial review. There is no record of any opponent to the Constitution who claimed that the Constitution did not involve a power of judicial review.See Prakash and Yoo, \\"The Origins of Judicial Review\\", 70 U. of Chicago Law Review at pp. 973–75. After reviewing the statements made by the founders, one scholar concluded: \\"The evidence from the Constitutional Convention and from the state ratification conventions is overwhelming that the original public meaning of the term 'judicial power' [in Article III] included the power to nullify unconstitutional laws.\\"Barnett, Randy, \\"The Original Meaning of Judicial Power\\", 12 Supreme Court Economic Review 115, 138 (2004). =The Federalist Papers= The Federalist Papers, which were published in 1787–1788 to promote ratification of the Constitution, made several references to the power of judicial review. The most extensive discussion of judicial review was in Federalist No. 78, written by Alexander Hamilton, which clearly explained that the federal courts would have the power of judicial review. Hamilton stated that under the Constitution, the federal judiciary would have the power to declare laws unconstitutional. Hamilton asserted that this was appropriate because it would protect the people against abuse of power by Congress: In Federalist No. 80, Hamilton rejected the idea that the power to decide the constitutionality of an act of Congress should lie with each of the states: \\"The mere necessity of uniformity in the interpretation of the national laws, decides the question. Thirteen independent courts of final jurisdiction over the same causes, arising upon the same laws, is a hydra in government, from which nothing but contradiction and confusion can proceed.\\"Federalist No. 80 (June 21, 1788) Consistent with the need for uniformity in interpretation of the Constitution, Hamilton explained in Federalist No. 82 that the Supreme Court has authority to hear appeals from the state courts in cases relating to the Constitution.Federalist No. 82 (July 2, 1788) The arguments against ratification by the Anti-Federalists agreed that the federal courts would have the power of judicial review, though the Anti-Federalists viewed this negatively. Robert Yates, writing under the pseudonym \\"Brutus\\", stated: Judicial review between the adoption of the Constitution and Marbury =Judiciary Act of 1789= The first Congress passed the Judiciary Act of 1789, establishing the lower federal courts and specifying the details of federal court jurisdiction. Section 25 of the Judiciary Act provided for the Supreme Court to hear appeals from state courts when the state court decided that a federal statute was invalid, or when the state court upheld a state statute against a claim that the state statute was repugnant to the Constitution. This provision gave the Supreme Court the power to review state court decisions involving the constitutionality of both federal statutes and state statutes. The Judiciary Act thereby incorporated the concept of judicial review. =Court decisions from 1788 to 1803= Between the ratification of the Constitution in 1788 and the decision in Marbury v. Madison in 1803, judicial review was employed in both the federal and state courts. A detailed analysis has identified thirty-one state or federal cases during this time in which statutes were struck down as unconstitutional, and seven additional cases in which statutes were upheld but at least one judge concluded the statute was unconstitutional. The author of this analysis, Professor William Treanor, concluded: \\"The sheer number of these decisions not only belies the notion that the institution of judicial review was created by Chief Justice Marshall in Marbury, it also reflects widespread acceptance and application of the doctrine.\\"Treanor, \\"Judicial Review Before Marbury\\", 58 Stanford Law Review, p. 458. Several other cases involving judicial review issues reached the Supreme Court before the issue was definitively decided in Marbury in 1803. In Hayburn's Case, 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 408 (1792), federal circuit courts held an act of Congress unconstitutional for the first time. Three federal circuit courts found that Congress had violated the Constitution by passing an act requiring circuit court judges to decide pension applications, subject to the review of the Secretary of War. These circuit courts found that this was not a proper judicial function under Article III. These three decisions were appealed to the Supreme Court, but the appeals became moot when Congress repealed the statute while the appeals were pending.Five of the six Supreme Court justices at that time had sat as circuit judges in the three circuit court cases that were appealed. All five of them had found the statute unconstitutional in their capacity as circuit judges. In an unreported Supreme Court decision in 1794, United States v. Yale Todd,There was no official report of the case. The case is described in a note at the end of the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Ferreira, 54 U.S. (13 How.) 40 (1851). the Supreme Court reversed a pension that was awarded under the same pension act that had been at issue in Hayburn's Case. The Court apparently decided that the act designating judges to decide pensions was not constitutional because this was not a proper judicial function. This apparently was the first Supreme Court case to find an act of Congress unconstitutional. However, there was not an official report of the case and it was not used as a precedent. Hylton v. United States, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 171 (1796), was the first case decided by the Supreme Court that involved a challenge to the constitutionality of an act of Congress. It was argued that a federal tax on carriages violated the constitutional provision regarding \\"direct\\" taxes. The Supreme Court upheld the tax, finding it was constitutional. Although the Supreme Court did not strike down the act in question, the Court engaged in the process of judicial review by considering the constitutionality of the tax. The case was widely publicized at the time, and observers understood that the Court was testing the constitutionality of an act of Congress.Professor Jack Rakove wrote: \\"Hylton v. United States was manifestly a case of judicial review of the constitutionality of legislation, in an area of governance and public policy far more sensitive than that exposed by Marbury, and it was a case whose implications observers seemed to grasp.\\" See Rakove, \\"The Origins of Judicial Review: A Plea for New Contexts\\", 49 Stanford Law Review at 1039–41. Because it found the statute valid, the Court did not have to assert that it had the power to declare a statute unconstitutional.Justice Chase's opinion stated: \\"[I]t is unnecessary, at this time, for me to determine, whether this court, constitutionally possesses the power to declare an act of congress void, on the ground of its being made contrary to, and in violation of, the constitution.\\" In Ware v. Hylton, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 199 (1796), the Supreme Court for the first time struck down a state statute. The Court reviewed a Virginia statute regarding pre-Revolutionary war debts and found that it was inconsistent with the peace treaty between the United States and Great Britain. Relying on the Supremacy Clause, the Court found the Virginia statute invalid. In Hollingsworth v. Virginia, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 378 (1798), the Supreme Court found that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the case because of the jurisdiction limitations of the Eleventh Amendment. This holding could be viewed as an implicit finding that the Judiciary Act of 1789, which would have allowed the Court jurisdiction, was unconstitutional in part. However, the Court did not provide any reasoning for its conclusion and did not say that it was finding the statute unconstitutional.See Treanor, \\"Judicial Review Before Marbury\\", 58 Stanford Law Review, p. 547. In Cooper v. Telfair, 4 U.S. (4 Dall.) 14 (1800), Justice Chase stated: \\"It is indeed a general opinion—it is expressly admitted by all this bar and some of the judges have, individually in the circuits decided, that the Supreme Court can declare an act of Congress to be unconstitutional, and therefore invalid, but there is no adjudication of the Supreme Court itself upon the point.\\"Chase's statement about decisions by judges in the circuits referred to Hayburn's Case. =Responses to the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions= In 1798, the Kentucky and Virginia legislatures passed a series of resolutions asserting that the states have the power to determine whether acts of Congress are constitutional. In response, ten states passed their own resolutions disapproving the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions.Seven states formally rejected the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions and transmitted their rejections to Kentucky and Virginia (Delaware, Massachusetts, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, and Vermont). See . Three states passed resolutions expressing disapproval but did not transmit formal responses to Kentucky and Virginia (Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey). . The other four states took no action. Six of these states took the position that the power to declare acts of Congress unconstitutional lies in the federal courts, not in the state legislatures. For example, Vermont's resolution stated: \\"It belongs not to state legislatures to decide on the constitutionality of laws made by the general government; this power being exclusively vested in the judiciary courts of the Union.\\". The other states taking the position that the constitutionality of federal laws is a question for the federal courts, not the states, were New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, and Pennsylvania. The Governor of Delaware and a Committee of the Maryland legislature also took this position. The remaining states did not address this issue. Thus, five years before Marbury v. Madison, a number of state legislatures stated their understanding that under the Constitution, the federal courts possess the power of judicial review. Marbury v. Madison The Supreme Court's landmark decision regarding(Cranch) 137 (1803). Marbury was the first Supreme Court decision to strike down an act of Congress as unconstitutional. Chief Justice John Marshall wrote the opinion for a unanimous Court. The case arose when William Marbury filed a lawsuit seeking an order (a \\"writ of mandamus\\") requiring the Secretary of State, James Madison, to deliver to Marbury a commission appointing him as a justice of the peace. Marbury filed his case directly in the Supreme Court, invoking the Court's \\"original jurisdiction\\", rather than filing in a lower court.For a more detailed description of the case, see Marbury v. Madison. The constitutional issue involved the question of whether the Supreme Court had jurisdiction to hear the case.There were several non-constitutional issues, including whether Marbury was entitled to the commission and whether a writ of mandamus was the appropriate remedy. The Court's opinion dealt with those issues first, finding that Marbury was entitled to the commission and that mandamus was a proper remedy. See Marbury v. Madison. The Judiciary Act of 1789 gave the Supreme Court original jurisdiction in cases involving writs of mandamus. So, under the Judiciary Act, the Supreme Court would have had jurisdiction to hear Marbury's case. However, the Constitution describes the cases in which the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction, and does not include mandamus cases.Article III of the Constitution says: \\"In all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a state shall be party, the Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction. In all the other cases ... the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction.\\" The Judiciary Act therefore attempted to give the Supreme Court jurisdiction that was not \\"warranted by the Constitution.\\"Marbury, 5 U.S. at 175–176. Marshall's opinion stated that in the Constitution, the people established a government of limited powers: \\"The powers of the Legislature are defined and limited; and that those limits may not be mistaken or forgotten, the Constitution is written.\\" The limits established in the Constitution would be meaningless \\"if these limits may at any time be passed by those intended to be restrained.\\" Marshall observed that the Constitution is \\"the fundamental and paramount law of the nation\\", and that it cannot be altered by an ordinary act of the legislature. Therefore, \\"an act of the Legislature repugnant to the Constitution is void.\\"Marbury, 5 U.S., pp. 176–177. Marshall then discussed the role of the courts, which is at the heart of the doctrine of judicial review. It would be an \\"absurdity\\", said Marshall, to require the courts to apply a law that is void. Rather, it is the inherent duty of the courts to interpret and apply the Constitution, and to determine whether there is a conflict between a statute and the Constitution: Marshall stated that the courts are authorized by the provisions of the Constitution itself to \\"look into\\" the Constitution, that is, to interpret and apply it, and that they have the duty to refuse to enforce any laws that are contrary to the Constitution. Specifically, Article III provides that the federal judicial power \\"is extended to all cases arising under the Constitution.\\" Article VI requires judges to take an oath \\"to support this Constitution.\\" Article VI also states that only laws \\"made in pursuance of the Constitution\\" are the law of the land. Marshall concluded: \\"Thus, the particular phraseology of the Constitution of the United States confirms and strengthens the principle, supposed to be essential to all written Constitutions, that a law repugnant to the Constitution is void, and that courts, as well as other departments, are bound by that instrument.\\"Marbury, 5 U.S., pp. 178–180. Marbury long has been regarded as the seminal case with respect to the doctrine of judicial review. Some scholars have suggested that Marshall's opinion in Marbury essentially created judicial review. In his book The Least Dangerous Branch, Professor Alexander Bickel wrote: Other scholars view this as an overstatement, and argue that Marbury was decided in a context in which judicial review already was a familiar concept. These scholars point to the facts showing that judicial review was acknowledged by the Constitution's framers, was explained in the Federalist Papers and in the ratification debates, and was used by both state and federal courts for more than twenty years before Marbury, including the Supreme Court in Hylton v. United States. One scholar concluded: \\"[B]efore Marbury, judicial review had gained wide support.\\"Treanor, \\"Judicial Review Before Marbury\\", 58 Stanford Law Review at 555. See also Rakove, \\"The Origins of Judicial Review: A Plea for New Contexts\\", 49 Stanford Law Review at 1035–41. Judicial review after Marbury Marbury was the point at which the Supreme Court adopted a monitoring role over government actions.Laura Langer, Judicial Review in State Supreme Courts: A Comparative Study (Albany: State University of New York Press, 2002), p. 4 After the Court exercised its power of judicial review in Marbury, it avoided striking down a federal statute during the next fifty years. The court would not do so again until Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. (19 How.) 393 (1857).See Menez, Joseph et al., Summaries of Leading Cases on the Constitution, page 125 (2004). However, the Supreme Court did exercise judicial review in other contexts. In particular, the Court struck down a number of state statutes that were contrary to the Constitution. The first case in which the Supreme Court struck down a state statute as unconstitutional was Fletcher v. Peck, 10 U.S. (6 Cranch) 87 (1810).The Supreme Court subsequently decided that a number of other cases finding state statutes unconstitutional. See, for example, Sturges v. Crowninshield, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 122 (1819), McCulloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316 (1819), and Gibbons v. Ogden, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 1 (1824). In a few cases, state courts took the position that their judgments were final and were not subject to review by the Supreme Court. They argued that the Constitution did not give the Supreme Court the authority to review state court decisions. They asserted that the Judiciary Act of 1789, which provided that the Supreme Court could hear certain appeals from state courts, was unconstitutional. In effect, these state courts were asserting that the principle of judicial review did not extend to allow federal review of state court decisions. This would have left the states free to adopt their own interpretations of the Constitution. The Supreme Court rejected this argument. In Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 14 U.S. (1 Wheat.) 304 (1816), the Court held that under Article III, the federal courts have jurisdiction to hear all cases arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States, and that the Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction in all such cases, whether those cases are filed in state or federal courts. The Court issued another decision to the same effect in the context of a criminal case, Cohens v. Virginia, 19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 264 (1821). It is now well established that the Supreme Court may review decisions of state courts that involve federal law. The Supreme Court also has reviewed actions of the federal executive branch to determine whether those actions were authorized by acts of Congress or were beyond the authority granted by Congress.See Little v. Barreme, 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 170 (1804) (the \\"Flying Fish case\\"). Judicial review is now well established as a cornerstone of constitutional law. As of September 2017, the United States Supreme Court had held unconstitutional portions or the entirety of some 182 Acts of the U.S. Congress, the most recent in the Supreme Court's June 2017 Matal v. Tam decision striking down a portion of July 1946's Lanham Act. Criticism of judicial review Although judicial review has now become an established part of constitutional law in the United States, there are some who disagree with the doctrine. At the Constitutional Convention, neither proponents nor opponents of judicial review disputed that any government based on a written constitution requires some mechanism to prevent laws that violate that constitution from being made and enforced. Otherwise, the document would be meaningless, and the legislature, with the power to enact any laws whatsoever, would be the supreme arm of government (the British doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty). The delegates at the Convention differed with respect to the question of whether Congress or the judiciary should make determinations regarding constitutionality of statutes. Hamilton addressed this in Federalist No. 78, in which he explained the reasons that the federal judiciary has the role of reviewing the constitutionality of statutes: Since the adoption of the Constitution, some have argued that the power of judicial review gives the courts the ability to impose their own views of the law, without an adequate check from any other branch of government. Robert Yates, a delegate to the Constitutional Convention from New York, argued during the ratification process in the Anti- Federalist Papers that the courts would use the power of judicial review loosely to impose their views about the \\"spirit\\" of the Constitution: In 1820, Thomas Jefferson expressed his opposition to the doctrine of judicial review: In 1861, Abraham Lincoln touched upon the same subject, during his first inaugural address: Lincoln was alluding here to the case of Dred Scott v. Sandford, in which the Court had struck down a federal statute for the first time since Marbury v. Madison. It has been argued that the judiciary is not the only branch of government that may interpret the meaning of the Constitution. Article VI requires federal and state officeholders to be bound \\"by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution.\\" It has been argued that such officials may follow their own interpretations of the Constitution, at least until those interpretations have been tested in court. Some have argued that judicial review is unconstitutionalSee W.W. Crosskey, Politics and the Constitution in the History of the United States (Chicago: 1953), chs. 27–29, with which compare Hart, Book Review, 67 Harv. L. Rev. 1456 (1954). A brief review of the debate on the subject is Westin, \\"Introduction: Charles Beard and American Debate over Judicial Review, 1790–1961\\", in: C. Beard, The Supreme Court and the Constitution (Englewood Cliffs: 1962 reissue of 1938 ed.), 1–34, and bibliography at 133–149. See more at: http://constitution.findlaw.com/article3/annotation13.html#f576 based on two arguments. First, the power of judicial review is not expressly delegated to the courts in the Constitution. The Tenth Amendment reserves to the states (or to the people) those powers not delegated to the federal government. The second argument is that the states alone have the power to ratify changes to the \\"supreme law\\" (the U.S. Constitution), and that the states should play some role in interpreting its meaning. Under this theory, allowing only federal courts to definitively conduct judicial review of federal law allows the national government to interpret its own restrictions as it sees fit, with no meaningful input from the ratifying power. Standard of review In the United States, unconstitutionality is the only ground for a federal court to strike down a federal statute. Justice Washington, speaking for the Marshall Court, put it this way in an 1829 case: If a state statute conflicts with a valid federal statute, then courts may strike down the state statute as an unstatutable violation of the Supremacy Clause. But a federal court may not strike down a statute absent a violation of federal law or of the federal Constitution. Moreover, a suspicion or possibility of unconstitutionality is not enough for American courts to strike down a statute. Alexander Hamilton explained in Federalist 78 that the standard of review should be \\"irreconcilable variance\\" with the Constitution. Anti-federalists agreed that courts would be unable to strike down federal statutes absent a conflict with the Constitution. For example, Robert Yates, writing under the pseudonym \\"Brutus\\", asserted that \\"the courts of the general government [will] be under obligation to observe the laws made by the general legislature not repugnant to the constitution.\\" These principles—that federal statutes can only be struck down for unconstitutionality and that the unconstitutionality must be clear—were very common views at the time of the framing of the Constitution. For example, George Mason explained during the constitutional convention that judges \\"could declare an unconstitutional law void. But with regard to every law, however unjust, oppressive or pernicious, which did not come plainly under this description, they would be under the necessity as Judges to give it a free course.\\" For a number of years, the courts were relatively deferential to Congress. Justice Washington put it this way, in an 1827 case: \\"It is but a decent respect to the wisdom, integrity, and patriotism of the legislative body, by which any law is passed, to presume in favor of its validity, until its violation of the Constitution is proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\\"Ogden v. Saunders, 25 U.S. 213 (1827). Although judges usually adhered to this principle that a statute could only be deemed unconstitutional in case of a clear contradiction until the twentieth century, this presumption of constitutionality weakened somewhat during the twentieth century, as exemplified by the Supreme Court's famous footnote four in United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U.S. 144 (1938), which suggested that statutes may be subjected to closer scrutiny in certain types of cases. Nevertheless, the federal courts have not departed from the principle that courts may only strike down statutes for unconstitutionality. Of course, the practical implication of this principle is that a court cannot strike down a statute, even if it recognizes that the statute is obviously poorly drafted, irrational, or arises from legislators' corrupt motives, unless the flaw in the statute rises to the level of a clear constitutional violation. In 2008, Justice John Paul Stevens reaffirmed this point in a concurring opinion: \\"[A]s I recall my esteemed former colleague, Thurgood Marshall, remarking on numerous occasions: 'The Constitution does not prohibit legislatures from enacting stupid laws.'\\"New York State Bd. of Elections v. Lopez Torres, 552 U.S. ___, ___ (2008) (Stevens, J., concurring). In the federal system, courts may only decide actual cases or controversies; it is not possible to request the federal courts to review a law without at least one party having legal standing to engage in a lawsuit. This principle means that courts sometimes do not exercise their power of review, even when a law is seemingly unconstitutional, for want of jurisdiction. In some state courts, such as the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, legislation may be referred in certain circumstances by the legislature or by the executive for an advisory ruling on its constitutionality prior to its enactment (or enforcement). The U.S. Supreme Court seeks to avoid reviewing the Constitutionality of an act where the case before it could be decided on other grounds, an attitude and practice exemplifying judicial restraint. Justice Brandeis framed it thus (citations omitted):Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, 297 U.S. 288, 346–9 (1936) (Brandeis, concurring) (citing cases) Laws limiting judicial review Although the Supreme Court continues to review the constitutionality of statutes, Congress and the states retain some power to influence what cases come before the Court. For example, the Constitution at Article III, Section 2, gives Congress power to make exceptions to the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction. The Supreme Court has historically acknowledged that its appellate jurisdiction is defined by Congress, and thus Congress may have power to make some legislative or executive actions unreviewable. This is known as jurisdiction stripping. Another way for Congress to limit judicial review was tried in January 1868, when a bill was proposed requiring a two- thirds majority of the Court in order to deem any Act of Congress unconstitutional.Schwartz, Bernard. A History of the Supreme Court, page 141 (Oxford University Press US 1995). The bill was approved by the House, 116 to 39.McPherson, Edward. A political manual for 1868, pages 350–351 (Philp & Solomons 1868). That measure died in the Senate, partly because the bill was unclear about how the bill's own constitutionality would be decided.Goldstone, Lawrence. Inherently Unequal: The Betrayal of Equal Rights by the Supreme Court, 1865–1903, pages 55–56 (Bloomsbury Publishing USA 2011). Many other bills have been proposed in Congress that would require a supermajority in order for the justices to exercise judicial review.Caminker, Evan. \\"Thayerian Deference to Congress and Supreme Court Supermajority Rule: Lessons From the Past \\", 78 Indiana Law Journal 73 (2003). During the early years of the United States, a two-thirds majority was necessary for the Supreme Court to exercise judicial review; because the Court then consisted of six members, a simple majority and a two-thirds majority both required four votes.Nackenoff, Carol. \\"Constitutional Reforms to Enhance Democratic Participation and Deliberation: Not All Clearly Trigger the Article V Amendment Process \\", 67 Maryland Law Review 62, 65 (2007). Currently, the constitutions of two states require a supermajority of supreme court justices in order to exercise judicial review: Nebraska (five out of seven justices) and North Dakota (four out of five justices). Administrative review The procedure for judicial review of federal administrative regulation in the United States is set forth by the Administrative Procedure Act although the courts have ruled such as in Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents403 U.S. 388 (1971). that a person may bring a case on the grounds of an implied cause of action when no statutory procedure exists.

Spencer Browne. Commander of the 1st battalion of the Qld Mounted Infantry, 1901 Major General Reginald Spencer Browne, CB (13 July 1856 – 9 November 1943) was a journalist, newspaper editor, and an Australian Imperial Force general in the First World War. Early life and career Reginald Spencer Browne (a.k.a. Browne, R. Spencer; Browne, Spencer; Spencer-Browne, ReginaldBrowne, Reginald Spencer, austlit.edu.au) was born at Oaklands, Appin, New South Wales on 13 July 1856, the son of a pastoralist. His father, also born in Australia, was a superintending officer of yeomanry. Browne was educated at Appin, Corowa and in England. He became journalist, working for several newspapers including the Albury Banner and the Deniliquin Pastoral Times, before becoming sub editor of the Townsville Herald in 1877, editor of the Cooktown Herald in 1878 and editor of the Brisbane Observer in 1881. In 1882 Browne joined the Brisbane Courier, and stayed there nearly all of his working life, until 1936. Browne joined the Queensland Mounted Infantry in 1887 and was commissioned a lieutenant. During the shearers strike of 1891, Browne took commanded a flying column which put down the strike; he took part in these actions even though he was sympathetic to the unions cause. Browne was promoted to captain in 1891 and then to major in 1896. Browne volunteered for service in South Africa during the Second Boer War, and sailed in November 1899 with the 1st Queensland Contingent. For his services, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath, awarded the Queen's South Africa Medal with five clasps, and was mentioned in despatches. Browne returned to Australia in November 1900. In 1903 Browne became commanding officer of the 13th Light Horse Regiment with the rank of lieutenant colonel. Then in 1906 he became the commander of the 5th Light Horse Brigade and was promoted to full colonel. He then transferred onto the list of Reserve of Officers in 1911. First World War Browne joined the Australian Imperial Force on 16 March 1915 as commander of the 4th Light Horse Brigade. This brigade was sent to Egypt, but was dismounted and broke up on 26 August 1915. Browne's new unit, the 13th Light Horse Regiment, was assigned to the newly formed 2nd Division, with which it served at Anzac Cove. On 28 August 1915, Browne was appointed officer commanding Australian Details Egypt, responsible for training reinforcements. In September Major General Legge sent for him to replace the commander of the 6th Infantry Brigade who had drowned following the torpedoing of the troop transport Southland. Browne took over the brigade on 8 September 1915 and served at Lone Pine and Quinn's Post, but at the age of 59 the rigours of the campaign combined with his age began to take its toll. Nonetheless he stayed until he was evacuated on 10 December 1915. On his return to Egypt, Browne was transferred to the Training and General Base Depot at Tel el Kebir. He was promoted to temporary brigadier general on 16 March 1916 and appointed to command the Depot on 20 March 1916. During 1915 he had published The Heroic Serbians, for which he was awarded the Serbian Red Cross. When the Base moved to England, Browne went with it, taking command of the Training Depots in England on 14 June 1916. On 25 July 1916, his command was abolished and merged into AIF depots in the United Kingdom under Major General Newton James Moore. Browne took charge of the 2nd Command Depot at Weymouth, England; this unit was responsible for taking in men \\"unfit for service within six months\\" and therefore to be returned home. On 12 October 1917, Browne was declared medically unfit and listed for return to Australia. He took a visit to France, and then left for Australia on 24 November 1917. On 10 February 1918, Browne was appointed to command the new Molonglo Concentration Camp near Canberra, where German internees were held.Alan Foskett (2009) The Molonglo internment Camp, Browne was demobilized on 17 December 1918, and was formally retired on 20 October 1921 as an honorary major general. Post-war For two years (1921–1922) Browne was State president of the Queensland branch of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia.Missing Photos , Queensland RSL News, Summer 2006, pg.14, column 1. – Referred to as \\"R. Spencer Browne\\". From 1925 to 1927, he contributed weekly articles to the Courier on his memories of people and events in 19th century Queensland. These were collected and published as A Journalist's Memories in 1927. The book is considered a reliable source of much information on the history and legends of Queensland. Personal In 1881 Browne moved to Brisbane and married Violet Edith Fanny Sutton of Maryborough on 13 October. She died soon afterwards. On 7 August 1889 he had married Catherine Fraser Munro (d.1942), a noted musician and amateur actress. He had been interested primarily in pastimes like polo, shooting and fishing, but henceforth shared wide cultural interests with his wife. He died, childless, in Brisbane on 9 November 1943, and was cremated. Publications *Romances of goldfield and bush by R.

Born in England, his family moved to New Zealand in the 1890s. He became a professional soldier in the New Zealand Military Forces in 1911. In Australia on an exchange with the Australian Army when the First World War broke out, he was attached to the Australian Imperial Force. He served in the Gallipoli Campaign and on the Western Front in a series of artillery commands. During the war, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order, mentioned in despatches six times and was one of only 14 personnel of the New Zealand Military Forces to receive the French Legion of Honour. Returning to New Zealand after the war, he later served as Commandant of the New Zealand Military Forces from 1931 until his retirement in 1937. He died in 1964 at the age of 84. Early life William Livingston Hatchwell Sinclair was born on 18 February 1880 in Longsight, Manchester, England, to a shipping merchant, Archibald Sinclair, and his wife, Eliza Maria Sandford. His parents divorced when he was a child, and when his mother remarried, he took on his stepfather's surname, Burgess. His stepfather, George Burgess, was a minister of a Congregational church and immigrated to New Zealand with his family in the 1890s. Military career Burgess joined the New Zealand Volunteer Forces in 1898. He initially served with the South Canterbury Mounted Rifles in Timaru and then in 1902 was transferred the New Zealand Regiment of Field Artillery Volunteers, based in Auckland. He was commissioned in 1906, and was promoted to captain three years later. In 1911, he joined the New Zealand Permanent Forces, the precursor to the New Zealand Military Forces. As one of the first officers in the newly formed New Zealand Staff Corps, he served as adjutant of the 16th (Waikato) Regiment. He also commanded No. 4 Area Group in Hamilton. =First World War= In late 1913 Burgess was sent to Tasmania on exchange with the Australian Military Forces. When the First World War broke out in August 1914, he joined the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) rather than returning to New Zealand to volunteer for the New Zealand Expeditionary Force. He embarked for the Middle East with the 3rd Australian Field Artillery Brigade on 20 October 1914 aboard the P&O; liner Geelong. Group portrait of officers of the 9th Battery, 3rd Field Artillery Brigade, including Major Burgess, seated in centre. Middle East, March 1915 During the Gallipoli Campaign, Burgess, now a major, commanded the 9th (Tasmanian) Battery. However, the guns of his battery were not landed until early May 1915. He and his men took over the guns of 7th Battery, allowing its personnel some rest. On 5 May, while reporting the location of Turkish artillery positions to his commander, Colonel Charles Rosenthal, he was wounded by shelling. His injuries required hospital treatment but he returned to the front on 17 May. Eventually poor health led to his evacuation from Gallipoli in October 1915. For his services during the campaign, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. Promoted to lieutenant colonel in March 1916 and given command of the 3rd Australian Field Artillery Brigade, he served on the Western Front. Burgess particularly distinguished himself in action from July to September 1916 during the Battle of the Somme and was awarded the Croix de Officier of France's highest order, the Légion d’honneur (Legion of Honour) in May 1917. Burgess was one of only 14 members of the New Zealand Military Forces to be decorated with the Legion of Honour during the war. In 1917, Burgess was promoted to temporary brigadier general and appointed Commander, Royal Artillery of the 4th Australian Division. He served in this capacity for the remainder of the war, by the end of which he had been mentioned in despatches six times. He received a number of honours, including being made a Companion of the Order of the Bath and a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George. He also received the Distinguished Service Medal from the government of the United States, having been attached to the 27th Division for a time. He was discharged from the AIF on 18 July 1919. =Post-war career= Burgess returned to New Zealand, and resumed his career with the New Zealand military with the rank of lieutenant colonel. He was an artillery officer at the Wellington Military District headquarters, in Palmerston North. He married in 1921, which was when he first adopted the additional surname Sinclair, his biological father's name. However, he did not begin formally using his new surname until 1926. In 1922, Burgess was posted to New Zealand Military Forces headquarters in Wellington as a staff officer. Two years later, he became director of 'Military intelligence and training' for three months before being promoted to colonel and appointed Chief of the General Staff. Sinclair-Burgess (3rd from left back row) at the opening of the Memorial Hall, Wellington College 1928 Promoted to brigadier in 1928, Burgess became Commandant of the New Zealand Military Forces, a position now known as the Chief of Army, in 1931 for a four-year term. The country's economic difficulties made his appointment a difficult one. The depression had resulted in New Zealand's compulsory military training scheme being abolished and the Territorial Force needed to be reorganised accordingly. Burgess, now a major general, also implemented a rearmament program in response to increased aggression by the Japanese Empire in China and made a number of recommendations to the New Zealand government. Some recommendations, such as the purchase of aircraft (which led to the establishment of the Royal New Zealand Air Force) and artillery for harbour defences, were enacted. Others, such as the proposal for an infantry battalion and artillery battery be formed for service in British India, were not. He was also an advocate for the mechanisation of the New Zealand Military Forces. He was made a Knight Bachelor in 1934, and a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1935, the same year his term as Commandant of the New Zealand Military Forces was extended for two years. In 1935, he was also awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal. Later life Sinclair-Burgess retired from the military in 1937, having served six years as Commandant of the New Zealand Military Forces. On his retirement, the position was abolished. Following the outbreak of the Second World War he offered his services to the New Zealand government but this was turned down despite the enthusiasm of Edward Puttick, the Chief of Staff at the time. A carpenter in his youth, he built a house for himself at Mahina Bay, near Wellington. It was destroyed in a fire in 1959, along with all his belongings. Army officers raised the money to replace his medals and insignia. He died at Eastborne, Wellington, on 3 April 1964. His marriage had ended in divorce several years earlier, and he had no children. He is buried in the servicemen's section of Wellington's Karori Cemetery.

(September 22, 1815 - January 27, 1890) was a Russian statesman and writer.  Life  Valuev was born in the Tsaritsyno District of Moscow on September 22, 1815. Valuev served as Emperor Alexander II's Minister of Interior between April 23, 1861 to March 9, 1868, and as Minister of State Assets from February 17, 1872 to 1877. In 1877, he was made Chairman of the Committee of Ministers. In 1880, his influence began to decline when he was eclipsed by his opponent, Count Loris-Melikov. Valuev was sent into retirement in October 1881 by the son of the recently assassinated Alexander II, Alexander III. Valuev was always close to the literary world. In 1834 he was transferred from Moscow to St. Petersburg and became acquainted with prominent Russian poets Aleksandr Pushkin and Pyotr Vyazemsky. Valuev may have served as one of the prototypes for the protagonist of Pushkin's novel The Captain's Daughter (1836), and the same year he married Vyazemsky's daughter. Valuev began writing fiction in the 1870s while still serving in the government. His first novel, Lorin (1878) was circulated in manuscript, although it remained unpublished until 1882. Once he was retired, he concentrated on writing and published four novels, essays on history of Christianity and a devotional calendar with his poetry prior to his death in 1890 in St. Petersburg. Throughout most of his adult life, Valuev kept a diary, which was published after his death and has proved to be an important source of information on the inner circle of the Russian Empire in the 19th century.

Shoppers has fresh produce, Swift Angus beef, Smithfield natural pork, all-natural chicken, Dietz & Watson delis, fresh seafood, steamed shrimp, as well as hot foods, and full-service pharmacies. Shoppers is thought to have innovated several now-common supermarket features, such as warehouse shelving (no longer utilized in new stores), open-bin bulk foods (also no longer found in the chain), large salad bars with hot prepared foods and specialized fans to keep produce fresh, and \\"warehouse-sized\\" packaged products. Shoppers also was one of the first chains to sell all of its produce by the pound, rather than by the item, which is now common. This prevented the \\"picked-over\\" selection of produce commonly found in conventional supermarkets several days after a produce delivery. History A Germantown, Maryland, Shoppers Food & Pharmacy in September 2013. Shoppers Food & Pharmacy had its roots in a store opened in 1929 by founders Irving Herman and his younger brother, Kenneth Herman, at Vermont and V St., NW, Washington, D.C. The earliest Jumbo Food Store was in operation as early as May 1952 at 3439 Benning Rd., N.E., Washington, D.C., and was the former River Terrace Super Market. The Herman brothers were joined by their brother-in-law, Sam Levin, and a location in Seat Pleasant, Maryland, at 401 Eastern Ave opened shortly after. On October 1, 1958, the store at 2400 University Blvd., E., in the Adelphi Shopping Center opened in Adelphi, Maryland, and, even after being gutted by a fire in 1994, remained a Shoppers Food Warehouse until its closure in spring 2011. By January 1960, there were four Jumbo Food Store locations: 1551 Alabama Ave, S.E. at Stanton Rd (Shopping Center); 3439 Benning Rd N.E. (River Terrace); 401 Eastern Ave., Seat Pleasant, Md.; and 2400 University Blvd. E. (Adelphi Shopping Center). By March 1967, five additional locations were in operation: 1919 Michigan Ave, (at Eastern); 6016 Old Silver Hill Rd. at Marlboro Pike, District Heights, Maryland; 3041 Naylor Rd., S.E. near Sears and Suitland Pkwy.; 12145 Rockville Pike (Pike Shipping Center), Rockville, Maryland; and 6300 New Hampshire Ave., Takoma Park, Maryland. By 1969, the Alabama Ave store closed and eight stores remained. By 1978, the River Terrace, Michigan Ave., District Heights, and Naylor Rd., S.E., stores were closed. On August 23, 1978, the last new Jumbo Food Store opened at Little River Turnpike and John Marr Drive (4223 John Marr Dr), Annandale, Virginia. In 1978, Jumbo also opened the first Shoppers Food Warehouse (SFW). The SFW at 3255 Little River Turnpike in the Brighton Mall, Alexandria, Virginia, opened in 1980. By 1983, there were three additional SFWs at 9195 Central Ave. (Hampton Mall), Capitol Heights, Maryland; Rt 108 & Georgia Ave (Village Mart Shopping Center), Olney, Maryland; and Little River Turnpike and Pickett Rd., Fairfax, Va. In 1985, when Jumbo / Shoppers became the third largest chain in the DC area, eight SFWs were in operation and four Jumbos (Rockville, Takoma Park, Adelphi, Md., and Annandale, Va). In 1986, there were 13 Jumbos / Shoppers locations with the Chantilly, Virginia and Clinton, Maryland SFW locations opening that August. Levin died before Shoppers was conceptualized. By 1989, when the infamous Herbert Haft acquired half interest in the Jumbo Food Stores chain, 18 Shoppers Food Warehouse locations were in operation and the Jumbo Food Store name was gone. The two remaining Herman brothers opened the first Shoppers Food Warehouse in 1978 as a foray into the warehouse supermarket business. The original concept brought the Washington area its first non- membership chain in the area to offer an expanded selection of large-packaged (or \\"warehouse-sized\\") products at a lower, bulk price. Shoppers eliminated all but two to three sizes of each product to allow a greater selection of different brands on a typical shelf and to further lower prices. Using warehouse shelving and leaving packaged goods in their boxes on the shelves enabled a reduction of retail labor that also allowed a much lower price to be passed to the consumer. Since changing hands from the company founders, it has developed into a more conventional supermarket model with more conventional pricing. With the success of the Shoppers format, all Jumbo stores were eventually converted to Shoppers.Shoppers Food Warehouse Corporation - Company Profile, Information, Business Description, History, Background Information on Shoppers Food Warehouse Corporation In 1988, Irving and his son and vice president, Mike Herman, made the decision to retire, leaving Kenneth and his children in control of the corporation. In 1989, Irving sold 49 of his 50 percent of the company, leaving Kenneth with a majority 51 percent controlling stake in the company. Herbert Haft's Dart Group, whose holdings included Dart Drug, Crown Books, Trak Auto stores and Combined Properties Realty, purchased the minority share from Irving. Haft and the Herman brothers were long time acquaintances, having grown up and been schooled together in the same poor Jewish neighborhood of Washington, D.C. Kenneth remained at the company as President and CEO, his son Robert, then Executive Vice President, took over as Chief Operating Officer, son Mitchel retained his post as Senior Vice President for Corporate Affairs, and Kenneth's daughter and company spokesperson Sandra Perkins retained her position as Director of Marketing and Advertising. Another son, Laurence, did not work in the family business. Under the control of Kenneth, Shoppers grew to almost twice its size in the following ten years. Dart acquired the remainder of the company in 1997 after exercising a complicated buy-sell agreement with the Herman family. Dart's intention was to force the Herman family into purchasing the shares of the company back after Dart experienced infighting amongst their board members and financial trouble with their retail chains. The final effect was the opposite; Dart was ultimately forced to purchase from the Hermans at an inflated price, starting a severe financial downward spiral and the ultimate sale and breakup of the Dart Corporation. In April 1998, Richfood Holdings Inc., a regional wholesale distributor, purchased Dart Group in order to acquire Shoppers, later selling or spinning off Dart's other operations. SuperValu acquired Richfood Holdings in 1999, also large in part to acquire the Shoppers brand, which was by then the third largest supermarket chain in the Washington, D.C., region in sales and volume. In 2018, United Natural Foods acquired SuperValu (including) Shoppers in order to obtain the wholesale operations of the company. They had little inclination to continue to operate the retail business and sold off the many of the retail assets. All Shoppers stores are expected to close by early 2020. In the community Through the Shoppers Foundation, Shoppers supports organizations like The Ed Block Courage Award Foundation and now The American Red Cross of the National Capital Area. Shoppers donates to over 2500 schools, churches and not-for-profit organizations throughout their trade area. In 2000, the Shoppers Classic Charity Golf Tournament was established to raise funds along with its vendor partners for local causes, including the Maryland Food Bank and Capitol Area Food Bank, new community playgrounds, and the Ed Block Courage Award Foundation for underprivileged children. Controversy On May 29, 2008, it was reported that the FBI had searched Maryland State Senator Ulysses Currie's District Heights home and taken documents related to his work as a consultant to Shoppers Food & Pharmacy. On September 1, 2010, federal grand jury indicted Currie and Shoppers Food Warehouse Corporation executives William J. White and R. Kevin Small in connection with a scheme from 2002 to 2008 in which the supermarket chain allegedly paid Senator Currie in exchange for using his official position and influence in matters benefiting White, Small, and the supermarket chain.

The Sopranos' neighbor Jean Cusamano has a sister, Joan O'Connell, who is a prestigious alumna of Georgetown University. Carmela cajoles Jean into asking Joan to write a letter of recommendation for Meadow. Joan declines, but Carmela visits her, presents her with a ricotta pie and, smiling, insists, \\"I want you to write that letter.\\" Jean reports to Carmela that the letter has been written, and Carmela asks for a copy. Silvio and Paulie pressure Richie to build Beansie a wheelchair ramp for his house, as partial reparation for crippling him. Richie scornfully refuses, but when he learns that these instructions came from Tony, he sends his nephew Vito Spatafore and his construction workers to fully adapt Beansie's home. Richie has a leather jacket which he obtained years ago from the feared mobster Rocco DiMeo. He gives it to Tony, who accepts it reluctantly but politely. Richie attaches great importance to the jacket, and to the act of giving it to Tony. He later sees it being worn by the husband of the Sopranos' maid and is deeply offended. Adriana, embarrassed in a restaurant by Christopher, has left him and gone back to her mother's. He goes to her, proposes marriage, and presents her with a ring. She says she loves him, and the ring. In bed, he tells her, \\"I'm back on track, rededicating myself\\"—to her and to Tony. Matt and Sean continue to work with Christopher, breaking into safes. They are introduced to Richie and laugh ingratiatingly at his abusive jokes about Chris. They try and fail to make casual contact with Tony at the Bada Bing. They are humiliated when Furio collects Tony's cut from the safe-cracking operations and takes an additional $1,000 for himself. Waiting for a meeting with Chris, who does not show up, they feel they are getting nowhere and must do something drastic. They ambush Chris as he is leaving a diner, imagining that this will gain them favor with Richie. Chris is shot three times and left unconscious. Sean is killed. Matt, unhurt, escapes and asks for Richie's protection; Richie, furious, chases him away. Chris lies in hospital in a coma. Tony, in a broken voice, says, \\"How could this happen?\\" First appearances * Liz La Cerva: The mother of Adriana La Cerva. * Bryan Spatafore: The brother of Vito Spatafore. * Donald \\"Donny K\\" Kafranza: A soldier in Richie Aprile's crew.

Title reference The episode's title is a play on the 1987 film Full Metal Jacket, whose title refers to full metal jacket bullets. Here, it alludes to the leather jacket that Richie gave to Tony. Also, after Christopher is shot, the camera pans the sidewalk showing the metal cartridge casings that have been expelled from the weapons. Production * Saundra Santiago plays a dual role , in this episode, portraying twin sisters Jean Cusamano and Joannie O'Connell. * Although the episode was the eighth of the second season, it was the seventh to be produced. * Unlike most other episodes, there is no song played over the end credits.

It was introduced as the replacement for the Quadra 610, and was the least-expensive computer in the Macintosh lineup with prices starting at $1,199 USD. While Apple's transition to PowerPC CPUs had already begun with the introduction of the Power Macintosh a few months prior, the 630 was built around the older Motorola 68040 and 68LC040 chips. Two reasons were cited for this: One, the older chips were less expensive; and two, PowerPC-native education software was almost non-existent at the time. Also, existing PowerPC software had yet to be translated to non- English languages. The 630 was the last new Macintosh Quadra introduced, though the earlier Quadra 950 remained available longer. It was discontinued with no direct replacement; while the 630's form factor was retained with the Power Macintosh 6200 introduced a few months earlier, but with an entry price of $2,300 it cost nearly twice as much. The Power Macintosh 4400 was Apple's most inexpensive Power Macintosh, but at $1,725 still cost several hundred dollars more than the 630.  Hardware  Rear view of a Macintosh LC 630 Form factor: The Quadra 630 introduced a new case design to the Macintosh family. On the front, a headphone jack and volume up/down buttons are included, a first for the Macintosh. There is an infrared receiver, intended for use with the remote included with the TV tuner card included with the Performa 637CD and 638CD models. The case's motherboard is accessible by opening a cover at the bottom rear of the case and sliding out a drawer that the motherboard was mounted on; this similar to the LC 575. Memory: All 630 models have 4 MB of memory soldered on the logic board. Depending on which logic board is in the system, there is either one or two SIMM slots. In all cases, the first SIMM slot requires 80ns non-parity chips, with a refresh rate of 2k or better, and 4, 8, 16 or 32 MB SIMMs will work. The second slot supports single-sided SIMM cards only, up to 16 MB in size. Maximum memory is therefore 52 MB for two- slot systems, and 36 MB for one-slot systems. Hard drive controller: One of the big differences, when compared to some of the previous Macintosh models was the choice of the internal hard drive interface; conforming to the standards of the IBM PC compatible platform, cheaper but slower IDE drives were used instead of SCSI for the first time. An external SCSI port was still available, and the CD-ROM used SCSI internally, but the 630 used an older controller that was much slower than the ones used in higher-end Macs of the time. Video: One external monitor is supported through a DB-15 connector. A non-upgradeable 1 MB of DRAM is soldered to the motherboard; this provides resolution of up to 640x480 with 16-bit color, and 832x624 with 8-bit color. A separate video card is required for 24-bit color or higher resolutions. The choice to use DRAM instead of VRAM saves money due to its commonality, but results in lower performance and increased chance of flickering. In their testing, MacWorld described the video performance of the Quadra 630 as \\"mediocre\\". CD-ROM: Models equipped with a CD-ROM use the Apple CD 300i plus, a 2x-speed SCSI drive capable of reading 656MB and 748MB data CDs as well as audio CDs. The caddy tray from the Quadra 610 is replaced with a tray-based loading mechanism. Remote control: Models equipped with the TV/video system included a Sony RMC-A1 remote control; consequently, the remote would control both the Macintosh and any compatible Sony television at the same time. Performance: MacWorld Magazine ran benchmarks at the time of the Quadra's release and reported that performance is similar to a Quadra 950 but slightly slower than the 800.  Models  The Quadra 630 has different names depending on its target market: Macintosh Quadra 630 for professional and business use, Macintosh LC 630 for the K-12 educational market, and Macintosh Performa 630 for the consumer and higher-education markets. The Performa 630 was sold with several slightly different model numbers, depending on included hardware and software features. Some models included a 14\\" Shadow mask CRT called the Apple Performa Plus Display. Introduced July 1, 1994: * Macintosh Performa 630: Same as the LC 630, without the CD-ROM drive.

It was projected that over 700 new students would come to the district as a result of new housing developments being built around town. On top of that, the grade level structure would be reconfigured so that students in the district would only have to move between schools twice instead of three times (in other words attending three schools instead of four), hence the name \\"One Less Move\\". All of Franklin's elementary schools had previously housed students in grades PreK-4, but since the reconfiguration they each now have 5th grade. To fix the overcrowding issues at the district's six elementary schools, Claremont Elementary School, a seventh elementary school, was built and opened in time for the 2018-19 school year, and Elizabeth Ave, and Hillcrest Elementary Schools were expanded with new classroom wings. Also in terms of facility additions, an additional gym and a new main office were built at Franklin Middle School at Sampson G. Smith as part of the referendum. In those schools and all the others (excluding the High School), upgrades were made to replace aging and old bathrooms, windows, doors, parking lot repavement, new playgrounds and outside playing fields, exterior lighting, and electrical systems, just to name a few.

Plot Two 13-year-old blind girls Marie and Inga are close friends in a boarding school for the blind, and share a love for music. The girls are fairly sheltered in their school, and have a motto, \\"Trau bloß keinem Gucki!\\" (\\"Don't trust a \\"lookie\\"\\" [sighted person]). They try out for a school band, but despite their musical skills they are turned away for their blindness. Then Marie meets a young émigré from Kazakhstan, \\"Herbert\\" (Oleg Rabcuk), and hides him from the police in the school, with the help of the sighted caretaker Mr. Karl (Dominique Horwitz). Herbert needs money to return to his homeland, against his father's wishes. Inga proposes that the three form a band of clowns (which is what the German name of the film implies) to play music in the street, \\"The Blind Flyers\\", with Herbert pretending to be blind as well. The band is successful—for a time. According to the director, the film was not supposed to be about blindness per se, and aimed to portray blind people as normal. And although the characters Marie and Inga are totally blind, they are played by partially sighted actresses Ricarda Ramünke (who won \\"Best Young Actress\\" award) and Maria Rother, who in real life attend boarding schools for the visually impaired.

She is the author of the 2008 book Finding Angela Shelton: The True Story of One Woman's Triumph over Sexual Abuse. Early career Shelton was a co-screenwriter (with then-husband Gavin O'Connor) and executive producer for the 1999 film Tumbleweeds, based on her experiences with her serial-marrying mother, to whom she was returned after being in foster care. She has acted in the films Comfortably Numb (1995), The Shrink Is In (2001), The Big Time (2002 television movie), The Safe Side, a 2004 instructional video, and Beautiful Dreamer (aka Daysleeper) (2009). On television, Shelton has appeared in Pacific Blue, Chicago Hope, and Becker. Searching for Angela Shelton After her parents divorced, Shelton lived with her father, stepmother, stepbrother, and stepsister in North Carolina. She and her siblings were sexually molested by her father and stepmother, and were eventually removed from their care and placed in foster care. The events in her childhood inspired her to make a documentary. In 2001, Shelton undertook the production of a documentary in which she travelled the United States in an effort to interview 40 of the 76 women who shared her name, whom she found while searching the Internet. Shelton found that many of the women whom she interviewed had either been raped, beaten, or molested. Inspired to document her quest to find the women and to catalogue their traumas, she rented a motor home and spent 57 days traversing the United States, spending nearly $300,000, some of which was donated by personal friends and family and professional contacts. Shelton also confronted her father, her own abuser, during the production of the film, meeting with him on Father's Day 2001 to discuss her molestation. It took three years and three different editors to complete the film. In the end Shelton edited the film herself. Shelton chose to promote and distribute the film independently, and appeared in 2004 on the American television programs 48 Hours and The Oprah Winfrey Show. Since then, in an effort to bring attention to domestic violence, especially when perpetrated against women and children, Shelton has travelled the United States speaking at colleges and universities and film festivals. In April 2006, an edited version of the film aired on the cable television channel Lifetime, as part of their campaign to end violence against women. Shelton now presents the film and gives speeches at colleges and universities across the country in an effort to end violence against women. =Awards= Angela Shelton won a regional Emmy for her appearance as Safe Side Superchick in The Safe Side Series, created by Baby Einsteins Julie Clark and America's Most Wanteds John Walsh.

Shelton created the Survivor Manual as a way to help abuse survivors and their loved ones find healing. The site houses Shelton's articles, videos, and new submissions by others who share Angela's vision of a better world. The Angela Shelton Foundation has since been dissolved and is no longer active. Shelton donated the foundation's assets to the 501C3 Darkness to Light in an effort to have her work in the trauma and recovery movement continue to reach more people as she went back to her writing and filmmaking career. The Survivor Manual is still running, and donors are directed to Darkness to Light. Finding Angela Shelton In April 2007, she released her book, Finding Angela Shelton: The True Story of One Woman's Triumph over Sexual Abuse. The book is not based on her movie, although it does run parallel to it. In it, Shelton shares how making the film forced her to face her past. She wrote the book to call for a healing revolution after seeing so many people in pain. The movie breaks the silence and the book breaks the cycle. In 2009, Shelton released a revised second edition on Amazon called Finding Angela Shelton Recovered with an additional chapter explaining all that happened since she made her film and why she went back to writing more fun things.

It is a generalization of a Cunningham number.  Definition  A Binomial number is an integer obtained by evaluating a homogeneous polynomial containing two terms, also called a binomial. The form of this binomial is \\\\scriptstyle x^n \\\\,\\\\pm\\\\, y^n, with \\\\scriptstyle x \\\\, > \\\\, y and \\\\scriptstyle n \\\\, > \\\\, 1 . However, since \\\\scriptstyle x^n \\\\,-\\\\, y^n is always divisible by \\\\scriptstyle x \\\\,-\\\\, y, when studying the numbers generated from the version with the negative sign, they are usually divided by \\\\scriptstyle x \\\\,-\\\\, y first. Binomial numbers formed this way form Lucas sequences. Specifically: :U_n(a+b,ab)=\\\\frac{a^n-b^n}{a-b}, and V_n(a+b,ab)=a^n+b^n Binomial numbers are a generalization of a Cunningham numbers, and it will be seen that the Cunningham numbers are Binomial numbers where \\\\scriptstyle y \\\\,=\\\\, 1 . Other subsets of the Binomial numbers are the Mersenne numbers and the Repunits. Factorization  The main reason for studying these numbers is to obtain their factorizations. Aside from algebraic factors, which are obtained by factoring the underlying polynomial (binomial) that was used to define the number, there are other prime factors (called primitive prime factors, because for a given \\\\scriptstyle x^n \\\\,\\\\pm\\\\, y^n they do not factorize \\\\scriptstyle x^m \\\\,\\\\pm\\\\, y^m with \\\\scriptstyle m \\\\, < \\\\, n) which occur seemingly at random, and it is these which the number theorist is looking for. Some Binomial numbers' underlying binomials have Aurifeuillian factorizations, which can assist in finding prime factors. Cyclotomic polynomials are also helpful in finding factorizations. The amount of work required in searching for a factor is considerably reduced by applying Legendre's theorem.

Cannan assumed command of the 15th Battalion in 1914 and landed with it at Anzac Cove on the evening of Anzac Day, 25 April 1915. The 15th Infantry Battalion garrisoned Quinn's Post, one of the most exposed parts of the Anzac perimeter, with Cannan as post commander. Later, Cannan led his battalion into action again on the Western Front at the Battle of Pozières and Battle of Mouquet Farm. He commanded the 11th Infantry Brigade at the Battle of Messines, the Battle of Broodseinde, and during the Hundred Days Offensive. Between the wars Cannan worked at Insurance Office of Australia, becoming the manager of its Sydney office in 1932. He remained active in the Militia until he was placed on the unattached list in 1925. During the Second World War, Cannan was recalled to duty in 1940, first as Inspector General of Administration, and then as Quartermaster General. During the course of the war he visited operational areas to prepare and plan the logistical support of operations. Despite his immense responsibility and achievements, he received little recognition. He retired in 1946 as a major general, and was the last surviving Australian general of the First World War before his death in 1976. Education and early life James Harold Cannan was born in Townsville, Queensland on 29 August 1882, the sixth child of John Kearsey Cannan, a Brisbane bank manager and his wife Elizabeth Christian née Hodgson. He was educated at Brisbane Central Boys' State School and Brisbane Grammar School. James was employed by a firm of hardware merchants, and later worked for seven years for New Zealand Insurance. He was chief agent at the Queensland branch of the Patriotic Assurance Company and then from 1910 was the state manager of the Insurance Office of Australia. Cannan married Eileen Clair Ranken on 12 December 1911. Their marriage produced no children. Cannan was commissioned as a lieutenant in the 1st Queensland (Moreton) Regiment on 27 March 1903. He transferred to the 9th Infantry Regiment on 1 July 1903. He was promoted to captain on 24 September 1907 and major on 14 August 1911. On 1 July 1912, he transferred to the 8th Infantry (Oxley Battalion). He took command of the battalion and was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 9 May 1914. First World War =Gallipoli= When the First World War broke out, Cannan was appointed to command the Lytton Fixed Defences, holding this post from 5 to 31 August 1914. He joined the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) on 23 September 1914 with the rank of lieutenant colonel, and assumed command of the 15th Battalion. His older brother, Captain D. H. Cannan, was also one of the original officers of this battalion, the Queensland and Tasmanian battalion in Colonel John Monash's 4th Infantry Brigade. They embarked for the Middle East from Melbourne on the transport HMAT Ceramic on 22 December 1914. The ship passed through the Suez Canal safely, arriving at Alexandria on 31 January 1915, although a Turkish force was operating in the nearby desert. The 4th Infantry Brigade encamped at Heliopolis, where it resumed its training. The 15th Infantry Battalion arrived at Anzac Cove on the evening of Anzac Day, 25 April 1915. Cannan was sent with half of his battalion to fill the gap between the 2nd and 3rd Infantry Brigades. Moving in the dark through the thick scrub of the Razorback, the 15th found in the scrub the empty positions that it was sent to fill. The 15th Infantry Battalion was soon switched to Quinn's Post, one of the most exposed parts of the Anzac perimeter, with Cannan becoming post commander. In the Battle of Sari Bair on 8 August 1915, the 15th Infantry Battalion suffered heavily, having seven officers killed—including Cannan's older brother, Major D. H. Cannan—and most of the rest wounded. Major Douglas Cannan's body was never identified. His name is inscribed on the Lone Pine Memorial. Cannan became ill and was evacuated from Anzac on 4 October 1915, and transferred to hospitals on Lemnos and Malta, before being sent to the 3rd London General Hospital in England. For \\"distinguished service in the field during operations in the Dardanelles\\", Cannan was mentioned in despatches and made a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 5 November 1915. =Western Front= Major General alt=Six men in uniform with peaked caps satand and sit in a circle talking to each other.

It departed Alexandria for Marseilles on 1 June 1916, to join the British Expeditionary Force on the Western Front. Cannan led his battalion into action again at the Battle of Pozières and Battle of Mouquet Farm. On the night of 8 August 1916, the 15th Infantry Battalion launched an attack on the German trench in front of Mouquet Farm known as Park Lane. Cannan's men captured their objectives, and indeed went beyond them in some places. However, the Suffolk Regiment on his flank was mown down by German machine gun fire and Cannan was compelled to withdraw part of his force to a more defensible position. On 30 August 1916, Cannan was appointed to command the 11th Infantry Brigade by Major General John Monash, now commander of the 3rd Division. At this time the 3rd Division—of which the 11th Infantry Brigade was part—was training on the Salisbury Plain in England. Cannan returned to France with the 11th Infantry Brigade in November 1916, and led it in the Battle of Messines in June 1917 and the Battle of Broodseinde in October 1917. For these battles, Cannan was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George. His citation read: In the fighting in 1918, the 11th Infantry Brigade was the first to check the German advance towards Amiens, repelling a German attack at Morlancourt in late March. In July, it was selected from the brigades of the 3rd Division to participate in the Battle of Hamel. The 11th Brigade went on to participate in the Battle of Amiens and the Hundred Days Offensive. For the battles of August and September, Cannan was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. His citation read: For his services on the Western Front, Cannan was also awarded the Belgian Croix de Guerre, his citation noting his \\"tenacity, thoroughness and efficient organisation\\", \\"his splendid qualities of leadership\\", and his \\"personal gallantry.\\" He was mentioned in despatches another five times. Between the wars Cannan studied insurance practice in London under the Army Education Scheme for two months before embarking for Australia on HMAT Ancises on 22 August 1919. He arrived back in Australia on 17 October 1919 and his appointment to the AIF was terminated on 13 December 1919. Cannan had been made a brevet colonel in the Militia on 24 September 1917 but he was entitled to keep his AIF rank of brigadier general as an honorary rank. Cannan returned to his old job at Insurance Office of Australia. He became manager of the Sydney office in 1932 and presided over the Insurance Institute of New South Wales from 1936 to 1937. He was also president of the Queensland branch of the Returned Soldiers' and Sailors' Imperial League of Australia from 1920 to 1921, and became the first president of the Brisbane branch of Legacy Australia in 1928. Cannan commanded the 2/15th Infantry from 1 October 1918 to 30 June 1920, although he did not actually take up command until 14 December 1919. On 1 July 1920, he became a substantive colonel and honorary brigadier general on assuming command of the 2nd Infantry Brigade. He then commanded the 11th Mixed Brigade from 1 May 1921 to 30 April 1925, when he was transferred to the unattached list. Cannan was also aide de camp to the Governor General from 1 April 1920 to 21 March 1923 and honorary colonel of the 47th Infantry Battalion from 19 June 1930. Second World War On 27 May 1940, after over fifteen years on the unattached list, Cannan was appointed Inspector General of Administration at the Department of Defence Coordination. Although his tenure was brief, Cannan gained valuable experience working with the bureaucracy. On 7 July 1940, Cannan was promoted to temporary major general and took over command of the 2nd Division in succession to Major General Iven Mackay, who had been appointed to command the 6th Division. Major General J. E. S. Stevens of the 6th Division (right) greets Lieutenant General alt=Four men in uniform with peaked caps talking to each other. Because most Australian soldiers were Militia, the government decided in 1940 that there should be \\"direct Militia representation on the Military Board at Army Headquarters.\\" The appointment of a Militia officer to the board was opposed by the Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General Vernon Sturdee, but when he was overruled by the Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, Sturdee offered the post to Cannan. On 24 October 1940, Cannan became Quartermaster General and a member of the Military Board. His experience as a businessman gave him managerial skills that were to prove particularly useful. Cannan offered to resign in 1942 so that his post could be given to a regular officer, but General Sir Thomas Blamey refused to countenance it, and Cannan remained Quartermaster General until 31 December 1945. However, in the 1942 reorganisation, the Military Board was abolished and Cannan now reported to the Lieutenant General Administration, Lieutenant General Henry Wynter, instead. Cannan volunteered for the Second Australian Imperial Force and was allotted the serial number VX89075 on 2 September 1942. As Quartermaster General, Cannan was responsible for the Australian Army's supply, transport and engineering services throughout Australia and the South West Pacific Area. It was the most important logistical command in Australian history. In carrying it out, he clashed repeatedly with the Department of Defence Coordination in its attempt to maintain peacetime financial controls. Cannan had to work long hours and use all of his skills both as a soldier and a businessman. He had to attempt to keep ahead of the plans at General Headquarters in order to ensure that the required logistical support would be there on time. Colonel G. Drake-Brockman considered Cannan \\"a man of great personality and charm with tremendous drive\\" whose administration was \\"outstanding\\". As well as supporting the Australian Army, Cannan was also responsible for providing a broad range of goods and services to the Americans. In no other theatre of war was local procurement of supplies by US forces as extensive or important as in the South West Pacific. Australian Reverse Lend Lease came to USD $1.1 billion, representing 13% of all reciprocal aid to the United States. Such figures understate the value of Australian aid, for every ton of supplies procured in Australia meant a ton that did not have to be shipped across the Pacific Ocean. This required the same shipping space as two tons of supplies shipped across in the Atlantic Ocean, the distance there being half as great. Cannan was responsible for rationing the American forces in Australia until the American Quartermaster Corps felt capable of taking over the function in 1943. When requirements to support the British Pacific Fleet were piled on top of American demands and an increasing tight Army manpower situation, Cannan protested the \\"lavishness and extravagance which characterised US demands whilst the Australian services' demands were being subjected to rigid scrutiny and economies\\", citing examples, and urged that economies be made on goods and services supplied to Allied countries. However the government was reluctant to take any action that might not be welcomed by American military and political leaders. Nonetheless, Prime Minister John Curtin did successfully persuade General Douglas MacArthur to rationalise his use of Australian resources in order to provide accommodation for the British Pacific Fleet. Cannan travelled widely in the combat areas to see conditions at first hand. He visited New Guinea between 19 October and 21 December 1943 and in February and March 1944. In October 1944, Cannan travelled with General Blamey to visit General Douglas MacArthur in Hollandia in order to prepare for Philippines campaign. In the event, plans to employ Australian troops in the Philippines fell through and they were employed in the Borneo Campaign instead. Cannan visited New Britain, Lae, Hollandia, Bougainville and Aitape in February 1945 to help plan the final campaigns and Hollandia, Morotai, Labuan and Darwin in August 1945. Later life Cannan received no honours for the Second World War. Blamey nominated him for a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in September 1943, but it was refused, it not being the Labor government's policy to award knighthoods at this time. In November 1945, Blamey was abruptly dismissed by the government. Asked if he wanted any honours for himself, Blamey declined, instead requesting knighthoods for his generals, including Cannan. His request was refused. In December 1949, the government changed and Blamey wrote to the new Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, once again recommending knighthoods for a number of his generals, including Cannan. All were accepted \\"except, for some inexplicable reason, for Cannan\\". Of Cannan, it was said that his \\"contribution to the defence of Australia was immense; his responsibility for supply, transport and works, a giant-sized burden; his acknowledgement—nil\\". Cannan relinquished his appointment as Quartermaster General on 31 December 1945 and retired as a major general the next day. He remained an honorary colonel until 8 June 1953. His abilities as an administrator were still in demand. He was Director of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in the South West Pacific from 1946 to 1947, of the Queensland division of the Australian Red Cross from 1950 to 1951, and of the Services Canteens Trust from 1948 to 1957. He was also a director of several companies. Survived by his wife Eileen, Cannan died on 23 May 1976. He became the last of Australia's Great War generals to pass away, and was cremated with full military honours.

The eastern two- thirds of the park are closed due to an underdeveloped trail system and safety concerns over the numerous wind turbines that are located in the Gonzaga Wind Farm that occupies the area. In 2018, it was announced that the 1980s-era turbines would be replaced with more efficient models, which would increase power production capacity from the original 16.5 megawatts (MW) to as much as 80 MW. History The park was created as the last piece of the Rancho San Luis Gonzaga in 1997, five years after it was bequeathed to the state by Paula M. Fatjo. Fatjo was the great-great granddaughter of Mexican ranchero Francisco Pacheco, for whom both the park and the nearby Pacheco Pass are named. The rancho had been in the Pacheco family since 1843, serving as a horse and cattle ranch... Recreation The park now has about of trails for hiking, horseback riding and mountain biking. Dogs are not allowed on the trails. There are no camping facilities inside the park, nor are there any sources of potable water for human consumption. The park is known for its vistas of the Central Valley to the East and the Santa Clara Valley to the West. In Spring, there are impressive displays of colorful wildflowers. Historic features in the park include an old line shack used by a cattle company in the 1800s, part of the old Butterfield Stage route and the ruins of the original Pacheco adobe. Wildlife in the park include tule elk, deer, bobcat, coyote, fox, several varieties of hawks, golden eagles and many smaller animals. Park land is still used for cattle grazing during the winter and spring. Power production A large part of the park that is closed to the public is devoted to wind turbines that were installed in the 1980s and designed to produce 16.5 megawatts (MW) of electric power. Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners announced that its Quinbrook Low Carbon Power Fund had won a long-term lease to upgrade the Gonzaga Wind Farm in Pacheco State Park.

Biography Nether Swell Manor Reptile House entrance, London Zoo Edward Guy Dawber was born in Britain in 1861, at King's Lynn, Norfolk, the son of John Stockdale Dawber (d. 1898) and his wife Lois Ellen (née Edwards). He trained in the practice of Sir Ernest George and Harold Peto, supervising their work on Batsford Park (1887–93), near Moreton-in-Marsh, in the Cotswolds. In 1896 he married Mary Eccles in Lancashire. In 1897 Dawber designed St John the Baptist's Chapel, Matlock Bath in Matlock Dale, Derbyshire, when he lived locally. It was the only church designed by him. Dawber designed the Old Post Office at 25 High Street, Broadway, Worcestershire, which was built in Cotswold stone by Espley & Co of Evesham in 1899 and opened on Friday 1 December 1899.Evesham Standard & West Midland Observer, Saturday 9 December 1899. He also designed Bibsworth House, Broadway. Working in the Cotswold vernacular tradition, Dawber became a respected and scholarly architect, designing and converting houses such as Nether Swell Manor (1903 and 1909) and Eyford Park (1911–12), both near Stow- on-the-Wold. In 1905 Batsford published Dawber's Old Cottages, Farm-houses and other Stone Buildings in the Cotswold District. He also specialised in laying out and designing gardens. From 1925 to 1927 Dawber was President of the Royal Institute of British Architects. In 1928 he was awarded the RIBA Royal Gold Medal. In 1926 he played a prominent part in establishing the Council for the Preservation of Rural England, and became its first President. In that year he worked on the design of the Reptile House at London Zoo, Regent's Park, opened in 1927. About 1928 he designed many buildings of Lord Wandsworth College, Hampshire. He was knighted in 1936. He died in London on 24 April 1938; he is buried at St Giles's church with his parents and brother. Dawber also painted in watercolour.

Early years Alexander Guchkov was born in Moscow. Unlike most of the conservative politicians of that time, Guchkov did not belong to the Russian nobility. His father, the grandson of a peasant, was a factory owner of some means, whose family came from a stock of Old Believers who had acknowledged the authority of the Russian Orthodox Church while keeping their ancient ritual. His mother was French. Guchkov studied history and humanities at the Moscow State University, and, after having gone through his military training in a grenadier regiment, left for Germany where he read political economy in Berlin under Schmoller. Academic studies were, however, not suited to his active and adventurous character. He gave them up and started traveling. He rode alone on horseback through Mongolia to western Siberia, and narrowly escaped being slaughtered by a mob. He eventually became a rich capitalist, head of a huge insurance company. A.I. Guchkov He became known for his hazardous acts, which also included volunteering for the Boer army in the Second Boer War under General Smuts, where he was wounded and taken prisoner. He also fought numerous duels. He was elected by the Moscow municipal Duma to be a member of the executive (Uprava), and took active part in the self-government of the city. During the Russo-Japanese War, he served in the Red Cross and in the Municipal Union for the organization of hospitals, and he was left to take care of the Russian wounded after the Battle of Mukden. When the Russian Revolution of 1905 developed, he took part in the meetings of Zemstvo representatives, but did not join the Cadets, whom he considered to be too doctrinaire and cosmopolitan. Guchkov wanted military reforms, including the transfer of certain controls from the court to the Duma and the government.Orland Figes (1996), \\"A People's Tragedy\\", p. 61. Under Sergei Witte he was appointed as Minister of Trade and Industry. In October 1906, Guchkov became the head of the conservative liberal Union of 17 October. He had the hope that the Tsar's government would recognize the necessity of great reforms and work with the moderate liberals of the Zemstvos, while safeguarding the monarchical principle. The Tsar signed the October Manifesto. Pyotr Stolypin was for some time in sympathy with that agenda, and even contemplated the formation of a ministry strengthened by leaders of public opinion, of whom Guchkov, Count Heyden and N. Lvov would have been prominent members. When this project came to grief, Guchkov continued to support Stolypin. Guchkov was Chairman of the Duma's Committee of Imperial Defence, which had a veto over the military budget. In 1908 he condemned the diplomats' decision not to go in war in 1908, when Austria annexed Bosnia and Hercegovina.O. Figes (1996), p. 247. In the third Duma, elected on a restricted franchise, the Octobrists assumed the leading role. After Khomiakov's resignation in 1910, Guchkov was elected speaker. He attacked the \\"irresponsible influences\\" at the Russian court and the shortcomings of the Ministry of War in preparing for the inevitable conflict with Germany. As Stolypin became more and more violent and reactionary, the Octobrists lost their standing ground, and Guchkov eventually resigned the presidency of the Duma. He \\"lost faith in the possibility of peaceful evolution.\\"Куликов С.В. Центральный военно-промышленный комитет накануне и в ходе Февральской революции 1917 года // Российская история. – 2012. – № 1. – С. 69-90. Party crisis and World War I In 1912 the Octobrists were defeated in elections to the fourth Duma, losing over 30 seats. Guchkov in particular was defeated in his constituency in Moscow. The remaining Octobrists in Duma split into two fractions and went into opposition. By 1915 many local party branches and the main party newspaper \\"Voice of Moscow\\" ceased to exist. Guchkov is connected with spreading letters between Tsarina Alexandra and Rasputin. Grigori Rasputin's behavior was discussed in the Fourth Duma,Iliodor, The Mad Monk, p. 193 and in March 1913 the Octobrists, led by Guchkov and President of the Duma, commissioned an investigation.B. Moynahan (1997) Rasputin. The saint who sinned, p. 169-170.J.T. Fuhrmann (2013) The Untold Story, p. 91. Worried with the threat of a scandal, the Tsar asked Rasputin to leave for Siberia. Since Rasputin was attacked in the Duma, the Tsarina Alexandra hated him and suggested to hang Guchkov.O. Figes (1996), p. 279. With the outbreak of World War I, Guchkov was put in charge of the Red Cross organization on the German front, and it fell to him to search for the corpse of the unfortunate General of the Second Army, Alexander Samsonov. (Which was eventually repatriated to his wife by the Germans). Guchkov became the head of Military-Industrial Committee, an organization created by industrial magnates in order to supply the army. He became friends with Alexei Polivanov. In June 1915 Vladimir Sukhomlinov left on charges of abuse of power and treason by Guchkov and Grand Duke Nicholas. In July 1915 Guchkov was elected chair of the Central War Industry Committee. In August 1915 Guchkov was among the founders of Progressive Bloc, which demanded for establishing ministerial responsibility before the Duma. Nicholas II constantly refused to satisfy this demand. In October 1915 Guchkov became more revolutionary and involved in the preparations of a coup. The abdication of Nicholas II.

In August 1916 the word revolution was on everybody's lips.O. Figes (1996), p. 283. On 13 October Guchkov travelled to Kislovodsk because of his health. In December 1916 Guchkov came to the painful conclusion the situation could only improve when the Tsar was replaced.Raymond Pearson (1964) The Russian moderates and the crisis of Tsarism 1914–1917, p. 128. Guchkov reported that members of the Progressive Bloc would consider a coup d'etat to force the government to deal with the Duma. When the February Revolution of 1917 broke out, Guchkov was prepared in to take charge of the Ministry of War and Navy. Shortly after the Petrograd riots in February 1917, Guchkov, along with Vasily Shulgin, came to the army headquarters near Pskov to persuade the Tsar to abdicate. On 2 March 1917 (Old Style) Nicholas II abdicated. In the evening Guchkov was at once arrested and threatened with execution by the workers.O. Figes (1996), p. 344. After revolution Alexander Guchkov, 1918. After the February Revolution the Union of 17 October legally ceased to exist. Guchkov held the office of War Minister in the Russian Provisional Government until 29 April. He was forced to resign after public unrest, caused by Milyukov's Note. Along with his fellow Octobrist Mikhail Rodzianko he continued to struggle for establishing of \\"strong government\\". He supported Lavr Kornilov and was arrested after the Kornilov Affair, but released the next day. After the October Revolution Guchkov provided financial support for the White Guard. When the eventual defeat of the White Guard became inevitable, he emigrated, first going to Germany. He died in 1936 in Paris.

Modern perception Guchkov has become something of a cult figure in recent years: his reputation in Russia has grown after a documentary on the main state channel, which included an interview with then-President Vladimir Putin. In the documentary, Putin revealed that Guchkov had been one of his childhood heroes for the way in which he tried to bring democracy to the country.

It is tradable by institutional and private investors and has characteristics similar to contracts for difference and covered warrants. Characteristics The most important characteristic of a rolling turbo is the strict connection of its value to market prices either at the stock exchange or in the off-board trade of the primary security. The value of the underlying stock is multiplied by the leverage value to give the value of the rolling turbo. Unlike other financial derivatives, the leverage of a rolling turbo is kept constant on a daily basis. However the issuer can change the leverage by a predetermined fixed procedure. The rationale of a rolling turbo arises from a combination of a predictable course process of the base value stock and the promise of a proportionally higher profit than would be possible with the purchase of the base stock. Rolling turbos also offer the possibility of speculating on falling quotations. On the DAX rolling turbos with leverages between 5 and 35 are offered.

It is a large and well established part of New Zealand music, and includes some of the country's most successful and highly acclaimed bands. History Reggae bands in New Zealand the 1970s and 1980s included Herbs, Dread, Beat and Blood, Unity Pacific and the Twelve Tribes of Israel. The 1979 Bob Marley concert at Western Springs Stadium is credited with having a huge influence of the growth of reggae in the country and inspiring many prominent reggae artists. The growth of the Rastafarian religion, particularly among Māori, was also a factor in the growth of the genre, and the high rates of use of marijuana among New Zealanders is likely to have had an influence. Reggae topped the charts in New Zealand in the early 1980s when Toots and the Maytals, the first artist to use the term \\"reggae\\" in song, went platinum with their song \\"Beautiful Woman\\".Radio Swiss Jazz.

The reggae scene is centred around the Waikato, Whanganui and the capital Wellington, with capital music having a more dub and jazz influenced sound.

They have won numerous awards and sold over 90,000 copies of their debut album. One of the most important groups of the last decade was Trinity Roots (1998–2005), who also melded sparse jazz melodies with their reggae to great effect. The Black Seeds are another group who have significant commercial success in recent times. Their albums On The Sun and Into the Dojo both sold double platinum and the group has toured extensively throughout Europe. Their latest album, Solid Ground, reached #15 on the US Reggae Charts. Other major groups include Katchafire, Cornerstone Roots, 1814, Kora, House of Shem and Tahuna Breaks. Major dub/electronic groups and solo artists include Pitch Black, Deep Fried Dub, Shapeshifter, International Observer and Salmonella Dub. Festivals The scene is live- performance based, and large reggae festivals occur annually. The most important are the Soundsplash Eco Reggae Festival in Raglan, the Kaikoura Roots Festival, and East Coast Vibes, a roots reggae festival held in January at the soundshell on Gisborne's Midway Beach.

Dramatism recommends the use of a metalinguistic approach to stories about human action that investigates the roles and uses of five rhetorical elements common to all narratives, each of which is related to a question. These five rhetorical elements form the \\"dramatistic pentad\\". Burke argues that an evaluation of the relative emphasis that is given to each of the five elements by a human drama enables a determination of the motive for the behaviour of its characters. A character's stress on one element over the others suggests their world view. Burke introduced the pentad in his 1945 book A Grammar of Motives. Burke based his pentad on the scholastic hexameter which defines \\"questions to be answered in the treatment of a topic: Who, what, where, by what means, why, how, when\\". Burke created the pentad by combining several of the categories in the scholastic hexameter. The result was a pentad that has the five categories of: act, scene, agent, agency, and purpose. Burke states, \\"The 'who' is obviously covered by agent. Scene covers the 'where' and the 'when'. The 'why' is purpose. 'How' and 'by what means' fall under agency. All that is left to take care of is act in our terms and 'what' in the scholastic formula\\". The pentad also closely follows the journalistic 'Five Ws': who, what, when, where, why. 'Who' maps to agent. 'What' maps to action. 'When' and 'Where' map to scene. 'Why' maps to purpose. There is no direct mapping from the Five Ws to the pentads category of agency but Geoff Hart states \\"Some authorities add a sixth question, \\"how\\", to this list, but \\"how to\\" information generally fits under what, where, or when, depending on the nature of the information.\\" Rhetorical elements The dramatistic pentad comprises the five rhetorical elements: act, scene, agent, agency, and purpose. The \\"world views\\" listed below reflect the prominent schools of thought during Burke's time, \\"without dismissing any of them,\\" to read them \\"at once sympathetically and critically in relation to each other,\\" and \\"in a wider context than any of them recognizes.\\" =Act= Act, which is associated with dramatic action verbs and answers the question \\"what?\\", is related to the world view of realism; What happened? What is the action? What is going on? What action; what thoughts? Burke defines the act as that which \\"names what took place, in thought or deed.\\" Since an act is likely composed of many separate actions, Burke states that \\"any verb, no matter how specific or general, that has connotations of consciousness or purpose falls under this category.\\" =Scene= Scene, which is associated with the setting of an act and answers the questions \\"when?\\" and \\"where?\\", is related to the world view of materialism and minimal or non-existent free will. Burke defines the scene as \\"the background of an act, the situation in which it occurred.\\" =Agent= Agent, which answers the question \\"by whom?\\", reflects the world view of philosophical idealism. Burke defines the agent as \\"what person or kind of person performed the act.\\" =Agency= Agency (means), which is associated with the person or the organization that committed the deed and answers the question \\"how?\\", implies a pragmatic point of view. Burke defines agency as \\"what instrument or instruments he used.\\" =Purpose= Purpose, which is associated with meaning and answers the question \\"why?\\", indicates that the agent seeks unity through identification with an ultimate meaning of life. It reflects the world view of mysticism. Purpose is inextricably linked to the analysis of \\"motive\\" which, derived from the title of A Grammar of Motives, is the main subject of its analysis. Since purpose is both the subject of analysis and an element of the dramatistic pentad, it is not a common element to be included in a ratio. Ratios In A Grammar of Motives, Burke provides a system of analysis for the scene-act ratio and the scene-agent ratio, though his analysis of ratios in the analysis of rhetoric is not limited to these. He states that, \\"The principles of dramatic consistency would lead one to expect such cases of overlap among the terms; but while being aware of them we should firmly fix in our minds such cases as afford a clear differentiation. Our terms leaning themselves towards merger and division, we are here trying to divide two of them while recognizing their possibilities of merger.\\" Thus any two dramatistic elements can be analyzed in relation to each other, creating a ratio, and can produce individual, yet separate meanings which are equally valid. However, the rhetor's selection of elements to compose a ratio should be scrutinized, as it can deflect attention away from or direct attention towards aspects of the rhetor's desire. This is what Burke calls the \\"Ubiquity of the Ratios\\", claiming that the composition of ratios \\"are at the very centre of motivational assumptions.\\" For example, \\"The maxim 'terrain determines tactics' is a strict localization of the scene-act ratio, with 'terrain' as the casuistic equivalent for 'scene' in a military calculus of motives, and 'tactics' as the corresponding 'act.'\\" The analysis of a situation as a multi-faceted occurrence is central to Burke's concept of ratios. Likewise, the substitution of a dramatistic element with another can change an interpretation of the motive, allowing the analyst to modify the ratio in order to highlight the importance of a specific factor. For example, \\"the resistance of the Russian armies to the Nazi invasion could be explained 'scenically' in terms of the Soviet political and economic structure; or one could use the act-agent ratio, attributing the power and tenacity to 'Russian' traits of character. However, in deriving the act from the scene, one would have to credit socialism as a major scenic factor, whereas a derivation of the act from agents would allow for a much more felicitous explanation from the standpoint of capitalist apologists.\\" The rhetor-agent also has a significant amount of power in crafting the perception of these ratios to their effect, \\"If an agent acts in keeping with his nature as an agent (act-agent ratio), he may change the nature of the scene accordingly (scene-act ratio) and thereby establish a state of unity between himself and his world (scene-agent ratio).\\" =Scene-act ratio= The scene, or the setting, will contain the act, or the what/actions. The way in which the agent interacts with the scene draws out specific analyses usually related to the atmosphere of the setting. While Burke states that, \\"It is a principle of drama that the nature of acts and agents should be consistent with the nature of the scene,\\" some \\"comic and grotesque works may deliberately set these elements at odds with one another, audiences make allowances for such liberty, which reaffirms the same principle of consistency in its very violation.\\" This reflects the division of most plays into very literal \\"acts\\", as the agents who construct the scene are very literally \\"acters\\" whose work is played against the backdrop of the scene.The actions that a person performs are interpreted through the setting or happenings. =Scene-agent ratio= A relationship between the agent (person) and the scene (place or setting). A scene can pose restrictions on the agent; in a narrative, the person and place should have some connection. =Act-agent ratio= While requiring the scene to contain them, the agent does not contain the act. Burke states that, \\"the agent is an author of his acts,\\" which can \\"make him or remake him in accordance with their nature.\\" This is one of the main principles that separates act and agent, producing a linked cycle which constructs the presentation of the agent's identity. A sixth element In A Grammar of Motives, Burke mentions that attitude is \\"a state of mind\\", remaining exterior from the pentad, as it is often \\"a preparation for an act, which would make it kind of symbolic act, or incipient act. But in its character as a state of mind that may or may not lead to an act, it is clearly classified under the head of agent.\\" Burke also refers to attitude as a variation of agency. Prior to 1969 the term attitude is placed under agency, act or agent and is not considered a sixth element. In 1969, Burke places attitude as a new sixth element, yet he does not refer to the pentad as a hexad. Attitude is defined as \\"the preparation for an act, which would make it a kind of symbolic act, or incipient act.\\" The attitude, like the agency, would answer the \\"how?\\". There is still some uncertainty over whether attitude is an additional element, and thus makes the dramatistic pentad a hexad, or if it is still a sub-element of the original pentad. While Burke has never directly stated that the pentad is a hexad, he has admitted that the addition of attitude to the pentad is similar to gaining \\"another soul\\" or an \\"extra existence\\". Scholars have read this as Burke's desire not to \\"dispose of\\" ambiguity, but rather to \\"study and clarify the resources of ambiguity.\\" As a result, many diagrams of the pentad depict attitude as a derivative of agent.

He was once said by historians to be one of the earliest (if not the earliest) pornographic film directors and pornographic film actors,Waugh, Thomas. Hard To Imagine. New York: Columbia University Press, 1996. Slade, Joseph. \\"Bernard Natan: France's Legendary Pornographer.\\" Journal of Film and Video. 45:2–3 (Summer-Fall 1993). although there is now considerable doubt about this. Natan certainly worked in mainstream cinema from his youngest days, working his way up from projectionist and chemist to cinematographer and producer. He eventually acquired the giant French motion picture studio Pathé in 1929. Pathé collapsed in 1935, and Natan was convicted of fraud. However, he laid the foundation for the modern film industry in France and helped revolutionize film technology around the world. Natan died after being transported to Auschwitz concentration camp. Personal life Natan was born Natan Tannenzaft (possibly Tanenzapf) to Jewish parents in Iaşi, Romania in 1886. He moved to France in the early 1900s and, despite being a Romanian, volunteered to fight for France in World War I. In 1909 he married and subsequently had 2 children.Cairns, David & Duane, Paul. Natan. Screenworks, 2013 In 1921 he became a French citizen, and at some point changed his name to \\"Bernard Natan.\\" His younger brother Emile Natan also moved to France and became a film producer.Rossel-Kirschen and Willems Mainstream film career Natan worked as a projectionist, film lab chemist, titles designer, cinematographer and producer during his early years in Paris. He was a publicity stringer for Paramount Pictures during the early 1920s. But by 1929, Natan's Rapid Film had become a major film producer and distributor. His reputation was such that in 1924 Natan became a member of the executive committee of the Cinematographic Employers' Federation. By 1926, his film laboratory was highly regarded, he had established a marketing firm, and he built two sound stages. Natan was also a film producer, helping finance and produce motion pictures at other studios.Willems, Gilles. \\"Rapid-Film et ses Branches Production.\\" Pathé, Premier Empire du Cinéma.

Willems, Gilles. \\"Les Origines du Groupe Pathé-Natan et le Modele Americain.\\" Vingtième Siècle. 46 (April–June 1995). =Takeover of Pathé= In late February 1929, Bernard Natan acquired the production and exhibition businesses of Pathé, then the largest French motion picture company. He agreed to merge his own studio, Rapid Film (then worth 25 million francs), with Pathé in exchange for 50 million francs in shares. The remaining shares were purchased with funding from a consortium of banks, bonds (to be paid with income from Pathé), and a 10 percent ownership in Pathé by the banks. After the merger, Natan renamed the company Pathé-Natan (sometimes also credited as Pathé-Cinéma).Abel, Richard. The Red Rooster Scare: Making Cinema American, 1900–1910. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1999. Abel, Richard. French Cinema: The First Wave 1915–1929. Paperback ed. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1987. Pathé was already in substantial financial trouble when Natan took control. Studio founder Charles Pathé had been selling assets for several years to boost investor value and keep the studio's cash flow healthy. The company's founder had even sold Pathé's name and \\"rooster\\" trademark to other companies in return for a mere 2 percent of revenues generated by them. Natan had the bad luck to take charge of the studio just as the Great Depression convulsed the French economy.Willems, Gilles. \\"Les origines de Pathé-Natan.\\" In Une Histoire Économique du Cinéma Français (1895–1995), Regards Croisés Franco-Américains. Pierre-Jean Benghozi and Christian Delage, eds. Paris: Harmattan, Collection Champs Visuels, 1997. English translation available at http://www.latrobe.edu.au/screeningthepast/classics/rr1199/gwrr8b.htm . Natan attempted to steady Pathé's finances and implement modern film industry practices at the studio. Natan acquired another film studio, Société des Cinéromans, from Arthur Bernède and Gaston Leroux, which enabled Pathé to expand into projector and electronics manufacturing. He also bought the Fornier chain of motion picture theaters and rapidly expanded the chain's nationwide presence. The French press, however, attacked Natan mercilessly for his stewardship of Pathé. Many of these attacks were antisemitic and contained veiled homophobic allusions to Natan's supposed sexuality. Pathé-Natan did well under Natan's guidance. Between 1930 and 1935, despite the world economic crisis, the company made 100 million francs in profits and produced and released more than 60 feature films (just as many films as major American studios produced at the time). He resumed production of the newsreel Pathé News, which had not been produced since 1927. Natan also invested heavily in research and development to expand Pathé's film business. In 1929, he pushed Pathé into sound film. In September, the studio produced its first sound feature film and its first sound newsreel a month later. Natan also launched two new cinema-related magazines, Pathé-Revue and Actualités Féminines, to help market Pathé's films and build consumer demand for cinema. Under Natan, Pathé also funded the research of Henri Chrétien, who developed the anamorphic lens (a technology which later led to the creation of CinemaScope and other widescreen film formats common today). Natan expanded Pathé's business interests into communications industries other than film. In November 1929, Natan established France's first television company, Télévision-Baird-Natan. A year later, he purchased a radio station in Paris and formed a holding company (Radio-Natan-Vitus) to run what would become a burgeoning radio empire. =Collapse of Pathé and imprisonment= In 1935, Pathé went bankrupt. In order to finance the company's continued expansion, Pathé's board of directors (which still included Charles Pathé) voted in 1930 to issue shares worth 105 million francs. But with the depression deepening, only 50 percent of the shares were purchased. One of the investor banks collapsed due to financial difficulties unrelated to Pathé's problems, and Pathé was forced to follow through with the purchase of several movie theater chains it no longer could afford to buy. Although the company continued to make a profit (as noted above) for a time, it soon began to lose more money than it could bring in. The collapse of Pathé led French authorities to indict Bernard Natan on charges of fraud. Natan was accused of financing the purchase of the company without any collateral, of bilking investors by establishing fictitious shell corporations, and negligent financial mismanagement. Natan was even accused of hiding his Romanian and Jewish heritage by changing his name. Natan was indicted and imprisoned in 1939. This meant he was in prison when France fell to the Nazis, while most other major Jewish filmmakers were able to flee the country or go into hiding. A second indictment was brought in 1941, and he was convicted shortly thereafter. His French citizenship was taken away, which required special legal manoeuvres by the state, since he had been naturalized as a result of his WWI military service and there were no existing legal means to render him stateless. He was transferred from prison in September 1942 to the camp at Drancy, and shortly afterwards deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Adult film controversy In 1911, Natan and colleagues were convicted of making erotic films, he was jailed for a short time and fined 1,000 francs but due to his exceptional record fighting in World War I this was later removed from his record.Rossel-Kirschen and Willems, p. 168-169. Some sources have claimed that Natan's career in pornography did not end there. Joseph Slade suggests that Natan may have directed at least one hardcore pornographic film in Romania and produced and acted in at least 20 hardcore heterosexual and bisexual films between 1920 and 1927.Trumpbour, p. 232. Slade wrote that nearly all French pornographic films from this period which include bisexual and homosexual content were produced by Natan. The same source states that Natan himself was bisexual, and engaged in intercourse in Le Menage Moderne de Madame Butterfly (1920) and La Maîtresse du Capitaine de Meydeux (1924). Furthermore, Slade claimed that he introduced masochism into French pornographic film. Slade's claims are disputed by the historians of the French organization \\"Les Indépendants du Premier Siècle\\", who argue that the various actors in question are not Natan and that accusations at Natan's trial and in Paris-Match connecting him to the adult film industry were false.Rossel- Kirschen, André and Willems, Gilles. \\"Bernard Natan à la direction de Pathé- Cinéma.\\" 1895. 21 (December 1996). Paris: AFRHC (association française pour l'Histoire du cinéma).Droit de réponse Mise au point Sur le grand producteur Bernard Natan, LIPS.org, Natan, a 2013 documentary film, compares stills from the adult films attributed to Natan with official headshots and shows that several pornographic actors have been mistaken for Natan but are not him. Joseph Slade now admits there is room for doubt over whether Natan worked in pornography at any time after 1910. Death World War II broke out while Natan was in prison awaiting trial, and Nazi Germany conquered France. After Natan's release from prison, the French government handed him over to the occupying German authorities. Natan was sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp on September 25, 1942, where it is believed he died in 1943. Importance to the film industry Bernard Natan's importance to the French film industry should not be underestimated. He pioneered the vertical integration of the French film industry, and adopted the \\"American model\\" of film-making and distribution. This model provides the underpinning of the French film industry even in the 21st century. Indeed, Pathé survived into the 1980s almost solely on revenues generated by the companies purchased and integration instituted by Bernard Natan. Natan also brought television to France, and established the first French radio holding and television companies. Under Natan's leadership, the anamorphic film camera lens was developed. The anamorphic lens was not only a major advance in film technology, but helped Hollywood survive during the early years of television.Bordwell, David and Thompson, Kristin. Film Art. 4th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1993. Monaco, James. How to Read a Film: The Art, Technology, Language, History and Theory of Film and Media. Rev. ed. New York: Oxford University Press, 1981.

The use of the symbol is described by the Universal Copyright Convention.Universal Copyright Convention, Article III, §1. (Paris text, July 24, 1971.) The symbol is widely recognized but, under the Berne Convention, is no longer required in most nations to assert a new copyright . US law In the United States, the Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988, effective March 1, 1989, removed the requirement for the copyright symbol from U.S. copyright law, but its presence or absence is legally significant on works published before that date, and it continues to affect remedies available to a copyright holder whose work is infringed. =History= Prior symbols indicating a work's copyright status are seen in Scottish almanacs of the 1670s; books included a printed copy of the local coat-of-arms to indicate their authenticity. A copyright notice was first required in the U.S. by the Copyright Act of 1802. It was lengthy: \\"Entered according to act of Congress, in the year __, by A. B., in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington.\\" In general, this notice had to appear on the copyrighted work itself, but in the case of a \\"work of the fine arts\\", such as a painting, it could instead be inscribed \\"on the face of the substance on which [the work of art] shall be mounted\\".Copyright Act of 1870, §97. The Copyright Act was amended in 1874 to allow a much shortened notice: \\"Copyright, 18 __, by A. B.\\"1874 Amendment to the Copyright Act of 1870, §1. The copyright symbol was introduced in the United States in section 18 of the Copyright Act of 1909,Copyright Act of 1909, §18 and initially applied only to pictorial, graphic and sculptural works. The Copyright Act of 1909 was meant to be a complete rewrite and overhaul of existing copyright law. As originally proposed in the draft of the bill, copyright protection required putting the word \\"copyright\\" or a sanctioned abbreviation on the work of art itself. This included paintings, the argument being that the frame was detachable. In conference sessions among copyright stakeholders on the proposed bill, conducted in 1905 and 1906, representatives of artist organizations objected to this requirement, wishing to put no more on the work itself than the artist's name. As a compromise, the possibility was created to add a relatively unintrusive mark, the capital letter C within a circle, to appear on the work itself next to the artist's name, indicating the existence of a more elaborate copyright notice elsewhere that was still to be allowed to be placed on the mounting. Indeed, the version of the bill that was submitted to Congress in 1906, compiled by the Copyright Commission under the direction of the Librarian of Congress, Herbert Putnam, contained a provision that a special copyright symbol, the letter C inclosed within a circle, could be used instead of the word \\"copyright\\" or the abbreviation \\"copr.\\", but only for a limited category of copyrightable works, including works of art but not ordinary books or periodicals. The formulation of the 1909 Act was left unchanged when it was incorporated in 1946 as title 17 of the United States Code. A 1954 amendment to the law extended the use of the symbol to any published copyrighted work, the symbol was allowed as an alternative to \\"Copyright\\" or \\"Copr.\\" in all copyright notices.An Act to amend title 17, United States Code, entitled \\"Copyrights\\", . = US copyright notice = In the United States, the copyright notice consists of: * \\"©\\" or the word \\"Copyright\\" or abbreviation \\"Copr.\\"; * the year of first publication of the copyrighted work; and * identification of the owner of the copyright, either by name, abbreviation, or other designation by which they are generally known. For example, for a work first published in 2011: The notice was once required in order to receive copyright protection in the United States, but in countries respecting the Berne convention this is no longer the case. The United States joined the Berne Convention effective March 1, 1989. Berne Convention In countries party to the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, including the modern-day U.S., a copyright notice is not required to be displayed in order for copyright to be established; rather, the creation of the work automatically establishes copyright. The United States was one of the later accedents to Berne, implementing its adherence to the treaty with the Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988, which became effective March 1, 1989, making the notice optional. However, the copyright notice remains material in one instance: a copyright infringer cannot claim innocent infringement as a partial defense to mitigate its damages where the infringer had access to a copy of the work that bore a copyright notice. (Evidentiary weight of notice) The majority of nations now belong to Berne, and thus do not require copyright notices to obtain copyright.

Running six issues before its cancellation and cover-dated December 2005 to May 2006, the series featured a fictional team set in the Marvel Universe, consisting of supernatural characters employed as a unit of the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D.. The title is a play on that of Marvel's World War II-based series Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos. Although Marvel superspy hero Nick Fury is the title character, he only appeared in a cameo in the first issue. The group's official name was never established in the series' six issues, but was called the S.H.I.E.L.D. Paranormal Containment Unit in its single other appearance, in Blade vol. 3, #1 (Nov. 2006). The same issue established its nickname as the Howling Commandos. Marvel returned to the concept in 2015 with Howling Commandos of S.H.I.E.L.D., a series canceled after six issues where that version featured a spiritual successor to the team that is established by S.H.I.E.L.D. subsidiary S.T.A.K.E. Publication history Written by Keith Giffen for its entire run, the series was launched with penciller Eduardo Francisco for its first two issues, followed by Dan Norton for issues #3, Derec Aucoin for #4-5 and Mike Norton for #6. Plot synopsis A powerful magician claiming to be the one true Merlin (one of many characters in the Marvel Universe to make this claim) escapes from a S.H.I.E.L.D. containment facility dubbed the Warehouse. He journeys to the United Kingdom where he transforms the entire country into a fantasy realm. The Howling Commandos are charged with stopping him. The team is headquartered in Area 13, a classified base run by S.H.I.E.L.D. for its supernatural black op program. It also serves as a research and development facility, specializing in the supernatural. Characters Some of the characters, including Brother Voodoo and Gorilla-Man, were pre-existing human characters from Marvel's superhero and supernatural comics. Others, such as Goom, Grogg and Groot, were monsters from pre-superhero Marvel science fiction/fantasy anthology comics of the late 1950s and early 1960s. Others were newly-created or new versions of existing characters. The seven primary characters are: * Frank - Frank is an intelligent clone of the original Frankenstein's Monster. He has super strength and durability, as well as a healing factor. * Gorilla- Man (Kenneth Hale) - Hale is a man trapped in a gorilla's body, granting him superhuman strength, stamina and dexterity as well as immortality. He is a member of the Agents of Atlas. * The Living Mummy (N'Kantu) - N'Kantu is a human who is injected with a fluid causing him to be immortal, although he resembles a rotting corpse. He has super strength and durability. * Clay Quartermain - Quartermain is the commanding officer of Area 13. He takes over in the first issue from Dum Dum Dugan. He is later killed by Doc Samson when he discovers Red Hulk's identity.Hulk vol. 2 #4 (August 2008) * Vampire by Night (Nina Price) - Price is a hybrid of a vampire and a werewolf. * Warwolf (Vince Marcus) - Marcus is the field leader. He is a werewolf who can shapeshift voluntarily whenever Mars is in the night sky. * Zombie (John Doe) - Doe is depicted as having normal human-level intelligence, in contrast to other zombie characters in the Marvel universe. The main antagonists are: * Merlin - Merlin is one of many magicians in the Marvel universe claiming to be the true Merlin. * Tilesti of the Folk is a Faerie and Merlin's second-in- command. Supporting characters include: * Bradley Beemer - Beemer is Area 13's Tech Chief and in charge of research and development. * Brother Voodoo (Jericho Drumm) - Drumm is a master of voodoo magic. He is later killed when the Eye of Agamotto is destroyed.New Avengers vol. 2 #6 (January 2011) * Glob (Joseph \\"Joe\\" Timms) - Timms is a swamp monster that has superhuman strength, stamina and durability. * Grogg - Grogg is a winged dragon that can shoot flames from his nostrils. He is used as the team's transportation. * Groot - Groot is a sentient tree. He has super strength and durability and he is able to animate and control plant life. He later became a member of the Guardians of the Galaxy. * Hellstorm (Daimon Hellstrom) - Hellstorm has mystical powers due to being a human-demon hybrid. He is currently a member of HYDRA's Department of Occult Armaments and is one of the Hell-Lords. * Lilith - Lilith is the daughter of Dracula and possesses vampire powers. However, she is immune to sunlight and can not be permanently killed while her father is alive. * Buzz McMahon - McMahon is a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent that pilots Grogg. * Werewolf by Night (Jacob Russoff/Jack Russell) - Russell's lycanthropy gives him superhuman speed, strength and agility as well as sharpened senses and a healing factor. He only appears in issue #1, the Director's Cut. Other characters include: * Abominable Snowman - This Abominable Snowman is described as the actual folkloric Abominable Snowman and not specifically connected to the other versions of the Abominable Snowman that were seen in Marvel Comics. * Dragoom - Dragoom is an alien who has a plasma form and the ability to control fire. He joins the team in issue #6. * Goom - Goom is an alien from Planet X first appearing in \\"pre-superhero Marvel\\". He is seen briefly at the beginning of issue #3. * Gorgolla - Gorgolla's body is made of living granite, giving him super strength and near-invulnerability. He also has wings that allow him to fly. * It the Living Colossus - It is a living statue, capable of flight and is nearly invulnerable. * Manphibian - Manphibian is a member of an amphibious race, with superhuman strength and razor-sharp claws. * Joshua Pryce - Pryce has magical abilities. He joins the team in issue #6. * Sasquatch - This Sasquatch is described in issue #2 as the actual folkloric Sasquatch and not specifically connected to the superhero Sasquatch of Alpha Flight vol. 1 or to the race of Sasquatches revealed in the series Alpha Flight vol. 2. In other media * Nick Fury's Howling Commandos appear in the Ultimate Spider-Man animated series episodes \\"Blade\\" and \\"The Howling Commandos\\". The team consists of Frankenstein's Monster, Werewolf by Night, N'Kantu, the Living Mummy, the Man-Thing, and a minor original character called Max the Invisible Man. Blade was originally a member of the team before he left for unknown reasons. Blade and the Howling Commandos are assigned to work with Spider-Man to recover Tekamentep's Ankh from Dracula. While they succeed, N'Kantu goes rogue and uses the Ankh to restore his life and power so he can take revenge on Fury. However, he is defeated and changed back to his original form by his teammates and Spider-Man. * Nick Fury's Howling Commandos appear in the Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. animated series, consisting of Blade, Frankenstein's Monster, Werewolf by Night, N'Kantu the Living Mummy, and the Man-Thing. In the episode \\"Hulking Commandos\\", Fury enlists the Howling Commandos to hunt down the agents of S.M.A.S.H., only for the two teams to join forces to defeat Dormammu and his Mindless Ones after they target a magical hourglass. In the episode \\"Days of Future Smash: Dracula\\", the Hulk pursues the Leader to 1890 and joins forces with N'Kantu, Frankenstein's Monster, and Werewolf by Night's grandfather to thwart Dracula and the Leader's plans to blanket the Earth in darkness with their Gamma Furnace. In the episode \\"Planet Monster Part 2\\", the Howling Commandos join forces with the agents of S.M.A.S.H. and the Avengers to fight the Supreme Intelligence's forces.

Description Two Red-backed Toadlets, normal red colouration on left, rare grey-red morph on right This species of frog reaches about 35mm in length. It is normally red, from red- orange or red-brown on the dorsal surface, however on occasion grey-red colour morphs can occur (see image). There is a dark (normally black) \\"dividing\\" line present right down the entire side of the frog, starting from the nostril. This line separates the red dorsal surface from the strongly marbled black and white ventral surface. There is a white spot in the armpits. Ecology and behaviour This species is normally associated with rainforest and wet sclerphyll forest, however it is also found in dry sclerophyll forest, woodland and at times cleared areas. It is normally found in areas that are frequently flooded such as roadside ditches, creeks and temporary pools. Males make an \\"ark\\" call, similar to most Pseudophryne species, but it is slightly more of an elongated note compared to P. australis and P. bibronii. Males call from under moist leaf litter and rotting logs, during spring, summer and autumn, they breed after rain. As with other Pseudophryne species the male stays with the eggs in the nest site and may mate with more than one female. Eggs are laid in the nest site and tadpoles hatch after heavy rain floods the nest site and the develop in the temporary pools. Tadpole development is relatively short, due to the ephemeral nature of the pools in which they dwell. Sources *Anstis, M. 2002. Tadpoles of South-eastern Australia.

Some firearms are designed to slamfire, but the term also describes a malfunction of self-loading firearms. Shooters accustomed to firearms requiring trigger activation for discharge may be unprepared for a slamfire discharge. Slamfire occurs if the cartridge discharges as soon as it reaches the chamber, rather than waiting in the chamber to receive a firing pin impact when the trigger is pulled. Some military firearms are designed to fire from an open bolt condition to avoid unintended discharge of a chambered cartridge cooking off in a gun barrel heated by firing previous cartridges. Activating the trigger of such firearms releases the spring-loaded bolt to move forward stripping a cartridge from the magazine into the chamber. The firing pin impacts the primer as the cartridge is chambered, and the energy released by the discharging cartridge returns the bolt into an open position while ejecting the empty case.  Unintentional slamfire  More conventional self-loading firearms begin this cycle with a cartridge already in the chamber and await activation of the trigger to allow the firing pin to impact the primer, causing discharge and loading another cartridge into the chamber. The first cartridge must be loaded from the magazine by manually pulling back and then releasing the spring-loaded bolt to chamber the cartridge; and unintentional slamfires may occur if the firing pin activates the primer as the first cartridge is being chambered. Unintentional slamfires may also occur during the normal self-loading process following an intended discharge. Control of firing pin movement is the essential difference between cartridge discharge as the bolt closes, or discharge when the trigger is pulled. Firearms designed to discharge as the bolt closes may have a fixed firing pin or a firing pin which moves forward by inertia as forward motion of the bolt ceases when the cartridge is fully chambered, while more conventional firearms are designed to prevent the firing pin from impacting the primer until the trigger is pulled. Some unintentional slamfires are caused by firing pin malfunction, while others may be attributed to defective cartridges with improperly positioned or unexpectedly sensitive primers. = Possible causes = The free-floating firing pin of AR-15 style rifles typically causes an indentation as the firing pin lightly strikes the primer when the bolt closes as it chambers a loaded cartridge. Although a single light indentation may not detonate the primer, the indentation may make the primer more sensitive to subsequent impact. Some shooters avoid using cartridges with primer indentations from being previously loaded but not fired. Firing pins intended to be activated by a trigger are either spring-loaded or free-floating. Both may move forward during the loading process when the face of the bolt hits the head of the chamber. Although the amount of forward movement is not intended to detonate the primer, slamfires occur when conditions do not match design assumptions. Cartridges which may be entirely satisfactory in manually loaded firearms may be considered defective if they do not meet the design specifications of self-loading firearms. Primer depth is very important in centerfire ammunition. Most cartridges are assembled with the exposed surface of the primer a specified distance deeper than the base of the cartridge in contact with the bolt face. Primers with insufficient depth may be detonated by the normal amount of firing pin movement as the cartridge is chambered by forward bolt movement. Primer response to impact is a function of the thickness and hardness of the metal cup containing the detonating explosive. Primers intended to respond to the comparatively light firing pin impact of older or smaller manually-loaded firearms may be initiated by the relatively energetic self-loading process necessary to reliably chamber cartridges. Most military ammunition makes use of hard primers unlikely to be detonated by a comparatively light inertial strike. Spring-loaded firing pins may move further forward than expected during the loading process if the restraining spring is broken or weakened by age. As rust, dirt, fouling, or inappropriately viscous lubricants accumulate in the firing pin channel, both free-floating and spring-loaded firing pins may be held in a forward position protruding from the bolt face. While rust prevention is important, wet lubricants can trap carbon and other pollutants from burning propellant, so avoidance of excess lubrication reduces the risk of slam fires from firing pins becoming stuck forward. Anything adhering to the tip of a firing pin or the portion of the bolt face behind the primer may cause unexpectedly heavy primer contact during the self-loading process. The larger priming compound distribution area of rimfire ammunition increases the number of locations where dirt or fouling on the bolt face or in the rim portion of the firearm chamber may deform the cartridge rim enough to function as a firing pin during the self-loading process. = Risks = Unintended slamfires are dangerous, and recoil may cause shooters to lose control of light firearms with conditions causing sequential slamfires if a normally semi-automatic firearm \\"goes full-auto\\" unexpectedly. A single defective cartridge may cause a single slamfire, but a firing pin stuck in a forward position or a magazine loaded with defective ammunition may cause a round to fire every time the bolt closes until the magazine is empty. Shooters must keep the firearm pointed in a safe direction (\\"downrange\\") while closing the bolt and chambering a cartridge. If a slamfire does occur, the shooter must do his or her best to hold the firearm securely pointed in a safe direction until it ceases firing. This requires discipline, because untrained shooters may become surprised and instinctively drop the firearm as soon as it begins firing. Aside from the dangers of any accidental discharge, an out-of-battery ignition may occur if a round slamfires before it is completely secured in the chamber. The firearm may be damaged or destroyed by a breech explosion potentially injuring the shooter and bystanders. Intentional slamfire designs Pipe guns use a free floating gun barrel with a rimmed cartridge (often a shotgun shell) inserted in the breech, sliding within a pipe functioning as a tubular receiver with a fixed firing pin in the back. No trigger or lockwork is required, because the loaded barrel is simply inserted into the pipe and slammed backward to fire.

The Kinetic Family Drawing, developed in 1970 by Burns and Kaufman, requires the test- taker to draw a picture of his or her entire family. Children are asked to draw a picture of their family, including themselves, \\"doing something.\\" This picture is meant to elicit the child's attitudes toward his or her family and the overall family dynamics. The KFD is sometimes interpreted as part of an evaluation of child abuse. Interpretations of all projective tests should be made with caution, and the limitations of projective tests should be considered. It is generally a good idea to use projective tests as part of an overall test battery. There is little professional support for the use of figure drawing, so the examples that follow should be interpreted with caution. In particular, in forensic situations, the use of the KFD and other projective tests may be unethical or illegal depending on the jurisdiction. Method Despite the flexibility in administration and interpretation of figure drawings, these tests require skilled and trained administrators familiar with both the theory behind the tests and the structure of the tests themselves. The KFD involves the examiner instructing the child to draw a picture of themselves, and everyone in his or her family, doing something. The examiner may then ask the child questions about the drawing, such as what is happening and who is in the picture. Certain characteristics of the drawing are noted upon analysis, such as the placement of family members; the absence of any members; whether the figures are relatively consistent with reality or altered by the child; the absence of particular body parts; erasures; elevated figures; and so on. The KFD was created as an extension of the Family Drawing Test (Burns & Kaufman, 1972). The kinetic aspect refers to the instructions given to the child to draw his or her family members doing something. The KFD is similar to other psychometric projective techniques such as the Draw-A- Person Test developed by Machover and the House-Tree-Person (HTP) technique developed by Buck.

More multimedia collective than traditional band Lucid Nation projects include zines, documentary films, and art. Lucid Nation is on their own independent record label Brain Floss Records. Biography \\"In 1994, Tamra Spivey started the Riot Grrrl Message Board on a fledgling one million subscriber America Online. Participants in the board and a related email list included Slim Moon of Kill Rock Stars, Courtney Love of Hole and Danny Goldberg, then president of Warner Bros. Records, college radio workers, several zinewriters, musicians, and high school girls, graduate students, Carla DiSantis, editor of 'Rockrgrl' magazine, and Donna Dresch of the band Team Dresch.\\" An email debate about the treatment of women at indie labels vs. major labels proposed by Spivey involving members of the AOL Riot Grrrl Message Board and others became the very popular zine TVi described by New York Magazine in a feature on Danny Goldberg as \\"an haute-grunge cyber salon of e-mail aficionados that include Courtney Love and Kill Rock Stars label chief Slim Moon.\\" Lucid Nation was formed in Los Angeles in 1994, when founding drummer, Debbie Haliday, joined Spivey and Ronnie Pontiac to form a riot grrrl band. Spivey and Pontiac were already playing in a band called Cat Cult who never released recordings or played live despite recording demos with Ralph Schuckett for Columbia Records. The three soon formed Lucid Nation and had their first live gig, a fundraiser for a riot grrrl art and zine collective known as Revolution Rising. The show was at a club called Cell 63, where they opened for two local riot grrrl bands: TummyAche and Crown for Athena. Haliday, Spivey, and Pontiac became members of the Los Angeles-based feminist art and zine collective Revolution Rising. Their next show was in a downtown LA art gallery opening for Team Dresch, followed by a show opening for Bikini Kill in Montebello. Lucid Nation toured the West Coast next, playing seven riot grrrl conventions in one summer. They also backed Warhol superstar Holly Woodlawn at several live shows. After her apartment was ransacked and a gang member was shot dead in the doorway to her apartment building, Haliday moved back to Florida for college. Spivey compiled the band's work thus far and put out an album entitled The Stillness of Over (1997). The album reached #11 most added on the CMJ charts. Spivey on The Stillness of Over: \\"'The Stillness of Over' has a triple meaning. Obviously it refers to the exit of Debbie, and also to the end of the golden age of riot grrrl, but 'The Stillness of Over' is also the instant when a hurdle is cleared.\\" The last track of the CD featured a guest drummer, Nick Romero (of The Limeys), who joined the band after Haliday left. The track was recorded live at a protest show headlined by iconic activist and poet John Sinclair during the Republican National Convention in San Diego. In 1997 Spivey's zine writing was included in A Girl's Guide to Taking Over the World: Writings from the Girl Zine Revolution (St. Martin's Press, 1997). Erin McCarley took over on drums. Spivey had met McCarley in an online riot grrrl newsgroup. McCarley was also founder of the first riot grrrl chapter in Orange County, CA. At this point, McCarley introduced the band to the Anarcho-punk scene. In 1998, Lucid Nation released their second album, American Stonehenge. At Koo's Anarchist Cafe in Santa Ana, California the band played matinees promoted by Peace Punk and McCarley, including Food Not Bombs fundraisers. At these shows they became acquainted with the local Black Panther Party, which had renamed itself New African Vanguard. New African Vanguard helped distribute Lucid Nation zines including Eracism to prisons all over the western United States. Lucid Nation's \\"The Stillness of Over\\" was positively reviewed in the Vanguard newspaper. While on their national tour, McCarley chose to leave the band. Lucid Nation turned to Tia Sprocket, formerly of Sexpod, who was on a break from touring with Luscious Jackson. After the tour, the band (Spivey and Pontiac) invited Sprocket to write and record with them back in L.A. Spivey's former bass teacher, Margaret \\"Grit\\" Maldonado (bassist of Girl Jesus), began playing with them. Guitarist Danette Lee (formerly of Butt Trumpet) was also added when Sprocket arrived Christmas 1998. They began to record at Big Scary Tree in the Los Angeles Art District. Danny Goldberg's Artemis Records paid for mixes of several songs by Neil Perry. Faced with a decision between mixes made by Perry (who had worked with Nine Inch Nails and Smashing Pumpkins) or Nitebob (who worked with Iggy and the Stooges and New York Dolls) and Mike Barile (who worked with Candiria), they decided to go with the latter two and began mixing at Unique Studios on Times Square, where Tupac was shot. Before this group of musicians could perform their first gig together in Olympia, Washington (headlining a fundraiser for The Transfused at the Capitol Theater (Olympia)), the band imploded. However, the band put out a CD in 1999 of those recordings titled DNA. Holly Woodlawn provided spoken word for the song \\"L.A. River,\\" a song Rolling Stone's guitarist Keith Richards called \\"marvelous\\". The band name after that was often displayed with a capitalized DNA in the middle: luciDNAtion. Two songs from DNA \\"Las Vegas the Instrumental\\" and \\"Fun\\" were later chosen by Sasha Grey for two scenes in avant garde porn filmmaker Jack the Zipper's \\"Naked and Famous\\". In 1999 Spivey's zine writing was included in Hillary Carlip's book Zine Scene (Girl Press, 1999) 2000s In 2000 Lucid Nation put out another collection of recordings from the DNA sessions called Suburban Legends, a totally improvisational album. The album got the attention of Randy Roark (assistant to Allen Ginsberg for sixteen years) who was interested in Spivey's writing. In 2002 Laccoon Press released \\"Dialogue of a Hundred Preoccupations\\" by Roark and Spivey. In February 2001 the band recorded a live show at the college radio station KXLU, in L.A. during one of the worst storms Southern California had ever seen. The gig would become their fourth album. The only members of Lucid Nation left from the previous group of musicians were Spivey and Pontiac (two of the three original members). The album was named Nonpoetic Rain: Live on KXLU and distributed in a limited edition of just one hundred home made signed CDs. In 2002 the band came out with a double CD of improvised songs named Tacoma Ballet. Patty Schemel (of Hole) volunteered to play drums and Greta Brinkman (of Moby's backing band) was on bass. Larry Schemel of Death Valley Girls and Midnight Movies played guitar. Diane Naegel was recruited on keyboards and Lucid Nation recorded the whole album in Tacoma, Washington at Uptone Studio. There were no rehearsals, and Naegel had never played with a band before. The band recorded fifty-two tracks, thirty-two of which ended up on the album. Recording ended on September 10, 2001 and several of the songs foreshadowed 9/11 including the phrase \\"homeland security\\" and the chorus \\"everything's falling down\\" from the song \\"Fall.\\" After some rearrangement, the songs were revealed to depict a story about a girl who realized the hypocrisy of her town, her family, and herself. Tacoma Ballet was broken into two discs of sixteen songs each. The first was labeled What is the Answer? and the second one was named What is the Question? (inspired by the final words of Gertrude Stein). The album gained critical praise from Rolling Stone and Magnet. Tacoma Ballet hit #8 most added on the College Music Journal charts in July 2002. In January 2002 the band recorded Tribeca Shockwave with New York residents Lafrae Sci on drums and Jezebel Kipp on bass, keyboards and production. The recordings include many references to 9/11. They were never released. Alternative Press singled out the song \\"Las Vegas the Instrumental\\" from the DNA record when Lucid Nation was included in their \\"100 Bands You Need to Know: 2002\\". After 9/11 Tamra refused to tour, telling her fans that it would by hypocritical to sing songs protesting oil wars while burning fossil fuels during long drives. Lucid Nation has expressed a desire to stay out of the mainstream. Tacoma Ballet reached #1 on college and commercial stations with playlists chosen by d.j.s, known as the secondary market in the music business. There was a chart to measure those stations, called the New Music Weekly Combined College Radio and Secondary Chart (aka 'NMW Chart'). By November, without tour support or radio promotion, Lucid Nation had broken through to the top five on the 'NMW Chart' and reached #1 in December 2002, after a six-month climb, with more spins than the Breeders, Beck, or the Pixies, becoming the only freestyle rock record to hit #1. From July 2002 to October 2005 Spivey was an Art Editor and then Senior Editor for Newtopia Magazine, an award-winning website of progressive politics and under reported news. Pontiac was Art Editor, a member of the New Poetry Collective and then Poet in Residence for Newtopia Magazine. Individually and in collaboration they produced articles on underground multimedia icon Jean Smith, peak oil author Michael Ruppert, music executive Danny Goldberg, election consultant Larry Tramutola, the late activist Rachel Corrie, and others. 2004 saw the recording of mung jung bushi with Jean Smith on guitar and David Lester of Mecca Normal on guitar. Also on MJB was LaFrae Olivia Sci on drums and keyboard. There were no vocals on this album. The album name 'mung jung bushi' was thought up by Smith, and is a rough combination of Chinese and Japanese possibly meaning \\"grumpy dance\\". In 2005 Lucid Nation released a 'best of' album named Public Domain: The Best of Lucid Nation. This compilation featured songs spanning the entire career of Lucid Nation. Also on the CD was a song titled FUBAR, which Lucid Nation collaborated on with Jody Bleyle of Team Dresch and Hazel. This song was originally created for the P.E.T.A. compilation by Fat Wreck, but rejected because it was \\"too raw\\". Denise Saffren of Wench played drums. In January 2006, Spivey also began a process she named 'The Hundred Song March'. With the help of Jon Krop for programming, Spivey began to post one song and a story (some true, some fabricated) about it every day for one hundred and fifty days, starting in January. The songs were posted chronologically, from least recent to most recent. They were all available for free download by MP3, RSS, and podcast. In Summer of 2006, Lucid Nation recorded improvisational sessions with Ken Schalk of Candiria on drums and others. The band released several rough mixes from the sessions as YouTube videos including \\"Stray\\" \\"Token Voter\\" and \\"Pretzels for Algernon.\\" In Summer of 2007, Lucid Nation recorded songs with drummer Rob Cournoyer and others. Rough mixes were shared as YouTube videos \\"Last Day of Pretend\\", \\"Pressure Cooker\\" and \\"World's Guiltiest Pleasure.\\" In November 2007 Spivey was included in the book Riot Grrrl: Revolution Girl Style Now! edited by Nadine Monem. In 2008 Lucid Nation headlined RockNRead at the VirginMega on Hollywood Boulevard where they covered a protest song written by Alex Maranjian called \\"Bring My Brothers Home\\". In Summer of 2008 Spivey and Pontiac associate produced The Gits documentary with Executive Producer Danny Goldberg and Liberation Entertainment. In Fall of 2008 Spivey collaborated with Danny Goldberg to connect music artists and management with the Obama campaign to help bring rally concerts to key counties. 2010s Tamra Spivey at rehearsal in 2016 In 2010 Lucid Nation released a cover of \\"Second Skin\\" by The Gits with guest drummer Steve Moriarity, who played with the original Gits, mixed by John X. In 2011 Rookie included Lucid Nation in \\"Girl Germs\\", its list of favorite riot grrrl songs. Lucid Nation provided the music for deaf Muslim punk playwright and filmmaker Sabina England's experimental performance and video Vazzxo Alien Dance. Mixing and new recordings continued with the advice of veteran producers Rob Fraboni and George Daly (music executive). Both Spivey and Pontiac became bloggers for the relaunch of Newtopia Magazine. Spivey's first blog for the relaunch was an interview with Kelly Heresy a day one occupier at OccupyWallStreet, the first protester pepper sprayed. The interview received attention from Bookforum. Spivey's other interviews included presidential candidate and former governor Buddy Roemer, Food, Inc. documentary director Rob Kenner, writer and political candidate Marianne Williamson, poet and AIM activist John Trudell, Feral House publisher Adam Parfrey, legendary music producer Rob Fraboni, and Beehive Design Collective. Pontiac's second essay for Newtopia \\"Is America Evolving a New Religion\\" was featured on Bookforum's Omnivore. In 2012 Spivey became a digital outreach assistant for 99%: The Occupy Wall Street Collaborative Film. She connected the directors with the Brooklyn Film Coop and organized the initial submissions to the film's YouTube channel. In 2013 the film premiered at Sundance Film Festival. Also in 2012 Spivey and Pontiac were among the executive producers and writers of Cohen on the Bridge, a documentary short about the Entebbe rescue that won the St. Louis International Film Festival's Festival Prize. In June 2012 Lucid Nation's Mommie Dearest the Musical, a rock parody created with Frank Yablans, was released on YouTube. In 2013 Spivey and Pontiac produced \\"An Excerpt of the Forthcoming Documentary, GRRRL\\"(2013) directed by Angie Young and Vega Darling, a documentary short about the riot grrrl movement. The short which featured songs by Lucid Nation, Bikini Kill, Pagan Holiday and others, was an installation at Alien She, the first comprehensive museum exhibit about riot grrrl, hosted by Carnegie Mellon University, which toured other museums for three years. Lucid Nation's song \\"Landmark\\" is included in the exhibit's California section. In 2013 Viva Cuba Libre: Rap is War a documentary by Jesse Acevedo about the Cuban hip hop legends Los Aldeanos premiered at Miami International Film Festival where it was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize. The documentary played the Sound + Vision Film Festival at Lincoln Center on opening night. Spivey and Pontiac are among the several executive producers of the film. In 2013 Viva Cuba Libre: Rap is War screened at IDFA2014, Movies That Matter at the Hague, was chosen for the Embassies Program, and won the Student Jury Award at One World 2014 in Prague and the Student Jury Award at the Kraków Film Festival. In 2013 Spivey and Pontiac as producers also began production on Exile Nation: The Plastic People a documentary about Zona Norte, Tijuana directed by Charles Shaw. In 2014 Edward James Olmos became executive producer and narrator of Exile Nation: The Plastic People, which became available on Netflix in February 2015. In May 2014 Lucid Nation was filmed in rehearsal and interviewed for a riot grrrl documentary by Sonia Gonzalez for Arte the French/German arts channel, but were not selected to be in the documentary. In Jan. 2015 Rookie included Lucid Nation in its list \\"Staying Power: Music that endures.\\" In March 2015 an excerpt from Pontiac's first novel The School of Outlaws was featured in Exterminating Angel Press: The Magazine. In fall Spivey released her zine The Good The True The Beautiful for Printed Matter, a fundraiser for Atlanta Zine Fest. Contributors included Jackie Joice, Legs McNeil, Daniel Pinchbeck, and Adam Parfrey. In October 2015 Lucid Nation was picked by Momentoy for a technical test of their simplified multimedia music widget for Facebook. Lucid Nation recorded three songs and created a GoPro video for the project that was released in March 2016. In early 2016 Pontiac used GoogleDrive and Facebook to release his Yi Jing inspired novel The School of Outlaws. and a non-fiction work he co-authored Dialogue with a Spirit. That summer Spivey began a series of interviews with Standing Rock Water Protectors and filmmakers including Linda Black Elk, Emerald Village co-founder Bianca Heyming, award-winning documentary director Shannon Kring, and Virtual Reality pioneer Jeris JC Miller. In November 2016 Sounding Out blog published Spivey's article \\"Riot Grrrl, Punk and the Tyranny of Technique.\\" January 1, 2017 in reaction to the election of President Trump the band posted the punk song 2BU on Facebook, the first in a series of videos satirizing Trump. Inspired by the strong response among rock fans in Mexico the band commenced a series of Facebook video posts, some critical of Trump, others targeted at current events, e.g. the song Token Voter was posted, with a video featuring famous tokers, to commemorate Mexico's legalization of medical marijuana. The band began posting bilingually at this time. By December 2018 these videos had been viewed 1.3 million times. In February 2017 the band released a live video of the cover song \\"You Can't Put Your Arms Around A Memory\\" by Johnny Thunders, in honor of Tia Sprocket, drummer on the band's DNA and Suburban Legends records, who had recently died. Also in memory of Tia Sprocket, Pontiac began posting weekly \\"cool rock bands found on Facebook\\" on his own profile and in a group he started called Saturday Rock Band. In May 2017 Lucid Nation's recording \\"Effaced\\" became the opening track on Silent Records compilation album Transcendigitalism - a compilation of esoteric drones followed in September by the inclusion of the Lucid Nation track \\"Mars Opposition Pluto\\" on the Silent Records compilation Tulpamancers. Spivey continued her series of Standing Rock related interviews for Reality Sandwich including activist and producer Pearl Means. Spivey interviewed music business legend Danny Goldberg about his book The Lesson of 1967, and Grammy Award winner Mamone about the Queer Appalachia project. Spivey also commenced a series of interviews about creatives using social media to reach their audiences including multimedia artist Jean Smith and writer Jennifer Robin. Both Spivey and Pontiac continued writing for Exterminating Angel Press: the Magazine In September 2017 Pontiac's views on the underground music business were quoted in the academic publication Resisting Muse: Popular Music and Social Protest. In early 2018 Lucid Nation released Ecosteria, an 18-song record, on Bandcamp, Tidal, Amazon, Apple Music, Spotify, Rhapsody, Pandora, and Slacker Radio. Reviews Rolling Stone wrote \\"If Spivey sounds spacey, she's not. Her songs range from aggressive, screaming punk to beautifully melodic rhythm and blues, the very definition of garage rock. Like Sleater-Kinney and Bikini Kill -- Lucid Nation has opened for both -- her band's music is raw, poetic, sloppy and infectious...simply bare-bones, kick-ass rock and roll.\\" Magnet wrote \\"a punk rock Exile on Main Street with shades of The Stooges, riot grrrl, Pere Ubu, and even The Doors.\\" Mario Mesquita Borges of Allmusic wrote \\"Lucid Nation's creations expose fierce streams of experimentalism within the rock genre by captioning a singular set of conceptual alternative pop/rock style, somehow following a similar trail as the one unclosed by Sonic Youth... \\" Band members *Tamra Spivey, vocals, guitar *Ronnie Pontiac, guitar, vocals *Grit Maldonado, bass *Phoenix LaFollete, bass, keys, engineer *Dave Greene, drums, percussion =Past members= *Debbie Haliday, drums, guitar, vocals *Nitebob, guitar *Darren Carter, sound engineer, guitar, bass, video *Mardhavi Sakuntala, bass, drums, percussion *Diane Naegal, keyboard *Jody Bleyle, bass *Greta Brinkman, bass *Danette Lee, guitar *Justin Citron, guitar *Ken Schalk, drums *LaFrae Sci, drums *Lita Penaherrera, keyboard, vocals *Erin McCarley, drums, guitar, bass, vocals *Liam Philpot, saxophone *Nick Romero, drums *Denise Saffren, drums, percussion *Larry Schemel, guitar *Patty Schemel, drums *John Sellers, bass *Tia Sprocket, drums, vocals *Kristian Storli, guitar *Troy Taroy, guitar *Craig Waters, drums *Rob Cournoyer, drums *Jimmy Shines, harp *Art Johnson, fiddle *Holly Woodlawn, spoken word *Imran Asif, drums *Jason Kirk, bass *Jezebel Kipp, bass Discography =Albums= *The Stillness of Over, 1997. *American Stonehenge, 1998. *DNA, 1999. *Suburban Legends, 2000. *Tribeca Shockwave, 2001, unreleased. *Nonpoetic Rain: Live on KXLU, 2001. *Tacoma Ballet, 2002. *Public Domain, 2006. *Ecosteria, 2018. *Last of the Teens, 2019. *Ghosts of Laurel Canyon, 2020. =Compilations= *Public Domain: The Best of Lucid Nation, 2006. **FUBAR, single, 2005, included in this compilation.

He is listed and praised in shloka 22 of the Vedic Ekatmata Stotra hymn among Hindu sages, warriors and conquerors alongside Agastya, Narasimhavarman I, Rajendra Chola I, Ashoka, Pushyamitra Shunga and others. History Vedic period of India with the Kambojas tribal lands in the north- west Scholar George Coedes refers to a 10th century inscription of a Cambodian dynastic legend in which the hermit Kambu Swayambhuva and the celestial nymph Mera unite and establish the Cambodian Solar royal dynasty (Kambu-Mera), that begins with the Chenla ruler Srutavarman and his son Sreshthavarman. However, this tale differs from the Kaundinya-Nagi Somā legend, another popular Khmer creation myth. Coedes suggests that the Kambu Swayambhuva legend has its origins in southern India, as a version of the Kanchi Pallava dynasty creation myth. Claimed to be the eponym of the Kambojas, Kambu Swayambhuva is characterized as a Brahminised Kshatriya chieftain, married to Mera, who was given to him by Shiva.Indianised States of Southeast Asia, 1968, p 66, 47, George Coedes The name Kambu is stated to be a corruption of the standard Sanskrit Kamboja.Ancient Kamboja, People and the Country, 1981, pp 359-60, Dr J. L. Kamboj. Scholars such as C. Lassen, S. Levi, Michael Witzel, J. Charpentier, A. Hoffman, A. B. Keith, A. A. Macdonell, H. W. Bailey and many others have traced the ethnic name Kamboja in the royal name Kambujiya in the Old Persian Inscriptions (Cambyses/Kambuses of the Greeks.Early East Iran and Atharvaveda, Persica, 1980, pp 114-15, ffn 81, Dr Michael Witzel). Parskar Gryhamsutram spells the usual Kamboja as Kambuja.Parskar Gryhamsutram 2.1.23 The Markandeya Purana (8.1-6) as well as in Srimad Devi Bhagawatam (5.28.1-12) etc. refers to the Kambojas as Kambu clan. King Ashoka's Rock Edicts V & XIII located at Peshawar write Kamboj as Kamboy or Kambo. According to J. W. McCrindle, Kamboja (=Afghanistan) is Kaofu (Kambu) of Xuanzang.Alexander's Invasion, p 38; See also Some Kshatriya Tribes of Ancient India, p 235, Dr B. C. Law The Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra of Buddhism uses the word Kieufieu (i.e. Kaofu of Xuanzang) for the Kamboja. The reference Kieufieu of the Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra stands translated variously as Kampoce, Kampochih and Kampotse etc. in the Tibetan religious texts. Numerous Muslim writings of medieval era spell the Kamboj clan name as Kambu as well as Kambo. Obviously, these Kambu/Kambo terms are the corrupted forms of Kambuj/Kamboj and relate to the Kamboja of ancient Sanskrit and Pali texts and Inscriptions. This Sanskrit Kamboja appears as K.b.u.ji.i.y, Kabujiya or perhaps Kabaujiya/Kaboujiya and Kambujiya or perhaps Kambaujiya ( OR with -n- in place of -m- as Kanbujiya or Kanbaujiya) of Old Persian inscriptions, and Cambyses of Greek writings. The same name appears as C-n-b-n-z-y in Aramaic, Kambuzia in Assyrian, Kambythet in Egyptian, Kam-bu-zi-ya or Ka-am-bu-zi-ya in Akkadian, Kan-bu-zi-ia or Kan- bu-si-ya in Elamite, and Kanpuziya in the Susan language (cf: Ancient Kamboja in Iran and Islam, p 69, Dr H.

In a 2007 Sports Illustrated article ranking the NBA's personnel bosses from 1 to 30, Nelson was ranked No. 2.Ranking the league's personnel bosses from 1-30, published June 26, 2007 In a 2009 Yahoo Sports article, Nelson was ranked the third-best general manager of the decade after producing nine 50-plus-win seasons in a row and the first finals appearance in franchise history in 2006.Yahoo Sports NBA Nelson assembled the Mavericks team that would later win the 2011 NBA championship. Nelson is one of the co-owners of the Texas Legends, the NBA G League affiliate of the Mavericks, located in the Dallas–Fort Worth suburb of Frisco. Early life Donnie Nelson is the second of four children born to Don and Sharon Nelson, and the only son. He was born in Iowa City during his father's final year at the University of Iowa, and was raised in Natick, Massachusetts as Don played for the Boston Celtics. Growing up to proportions similar to his father, Nelson also took up basketball, playing in high school for Worcester Academy.The Nelsons: Love and basketball However, a broken ankle reduced his playing efficacy. Don's job coaching the Milwaukee Bucks had made the family move to Brookfield, Wisconsin, and the same day Donnie graduated and was driven back home by Sharon in 1982, Don decided to leave his wife. Wishing to remain closer to his mother, Donnie gave up on playing in Iowa or Indiana, and instead went to the Division III Wheaton College in Illinois, where his older sister Julie studied. Despite being an All-America player with Wheaton, he asked his father not to make any calls for a professional tryout. The summer after his freshman year, he joined the Athletes in Action team, traveling first to South America and then to Europe. The experience made Nelson interested in bringing international players to the NBA, a trademark of his subsequent career.Operation Yao Ming: The Chinese Sports Empire, American Big Business, and the Making of an NBA Super star He graduated in 1986. NBA beginnings Nelson's first works with the NBA were in his father's teams, first as a regional scout of the Milwaukee Bucks between 1984 and 1986, and then as the top assistant to Don in the Golden State Warriors from 1986 to 1994. During this time, Nelson also worked as a part-time scout starting in 1987. While playing in Lithuania SSR capital Vilnius, Nelson met Šarūnas Marčiulionis, with whom he struck a friendship despite the language barrier. Once Donnie told his father about Marčiulionis and his skills, the Warriors would draft him in the 6th round of the 1987 NBA draft.A Soviet Hoopster In the Promised Land After the 1988 Summer Olympics, Marciulionis invited Nelson to Lithuania, where for three months he lived in the player's apartment in Vilnius, staging a series of basketball clinics around the increasingly restive republic. Eventually Nelson would fly to Moscow to sign Marčiulionis in 1989, leading him to become the first Soviet Union player in the NBA.'I Have To Open People's Eyes'New World Order As Don Nelson resigned from Golden State in 1995, Donnie also left the organization.Report: Warriors' Nelson To Resign Today . From 1995 to 1998, Nelson was an assistant coach with the Phoenix Suns. He was a major influence in getting the team to pick Steve Nash, who he met while Nash played in high school, and would later befriend as Nash became the star of Santa Clara University. Dallas Mavericks In 1998, Nelson rejoined his father, who was coach and general manager of the Dallas Mavericks, as assistant general manager. In the 1998 NBA draft, Nelson arranged for the Mavericks to draft little-known German Dirk Nowitzki and bring in Nash, who saw limited minutes in Phoenix, through a three-team trade. Both players would win the Most Valuable Player Award. The Draft Day trades for Nowitzki and Nash is the first time in NBA history two future MVP's were acquired in the same transaction. NBA Sunday Insider: Where the international look began Like with Marciulionis and Eastern Europe in the late 1980s, Nelson opened the league to a traditionally closed market when he made the Mavericks draft the first Chinese player to ever play in the NBA, Wang Zhizhi, in 1999. Donnie Nelson's efforts to rebuild the Mavericks occurred following the team's decade-long playoff drought. During his tenure, the Mavericks have won 66% of their games, including five 50-win seasons, two 60-wins seasons, and a franchise record 67-wins season in 2007. The 2007 season was tied for the sixth-best regular season in NBA history. The Mavericks are also one of just six franchises to win 60 games or more three times in a five-year span. Stemming from the efforts made during Nelson's tenure, the Mavericks reached the playoffs for ten consecutive seasons, reached the Western Conference Finals three times, and advanced to the NBA Finals twice, winning their first NBA Championship in 2011. Nelson acquired the core group of players on the 2011 championship Mavs roster through key trades and success in the NBA Draft. All-Star Tyson Chandler, 2008–2009 6th Man of the Year Jason Terry, Hall of Fame point guard Jason Kidd, four-time All-Star Shawn Marion, two-time All- Star Caron Butler, and Brendan Haywood were acquired through trades. Nelson was also responsible for adding 2007 MVP, 2011 NBA Finals MVP, and 14-time All-Star Dirk Nowitzki via a trade on NBA Draft night. On previous teams Nelson played a role in trading for players such as two-time Most Valuable Player Steve Nash and All-Star/6th Man of the Year Antawn Jamison, as well as acquiring future All-Stars Devin Harris and Josh Howard via the draft. The key pieces of the current Mavericks roster were once again assembled through impressive trades and Draft night success orchestrated by Nelson. The promising young core of the team features 2018 All-Star Kristaps Porzingis, acquired in a 2019 Trade Deadline deal with the New York Knicks. As well as sophomore sensation Luka Doncic, the nearly unanimous 2019 Rookie of the Year, acquired through a Draft night trade with the Atlanta Hawks. Nelson has the Mavericks well positioned for success and a rapid rebuild with two young cornerstones following the retirement of Mavericks legend Dirk Nowitzki. Nelson has earned a reputation in basketball as arguably the greatest international scout of all time considering his groundbreaking involvement in Eastern Europe (Marciulionis) and China (ZhiZhi) combined with his role in acquiring future MVP's Steve Nash (Canada) and Dirk Nowitzki (Germany), All- Star Kristaps Porzingis (Latvia), and Rookie of the Year Luka Doncic (Slovenia). He also famously advocated for the Mavericks to draft future MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo (Greece) in 2013, only to be rebuffed by owner Mark Cuban Nelson also served as assistant coach in 2000, when Mark Cuban purchased the team, and was an interim coach filling in for his father on multiple occasions between 2000 and 2002. As the Mavericks established an NBA G League (D-League) team in Frisco, Texas, a suburb north of Dallas, Nelson was named co-owner. The Texas Legends began play in the 2010–11 season, and became the first male professional team coached by a woman, Nancy Lieberman. Olympics Since 1990, Nelson has served as an assistant coach for the Lithuania national basketball team. In 1991, as Lithuania had just been re- established as an independent state, the Lithuanian Basketball Federation could not rely on public funding. Knowing of Marčiulionis' struggles, Nelson helped get sponsors for the Lithuanian team's 1992 Summer Olympics campaign, which included rock band Grateful Dead.Jenkins: Marciulionis’ Impact Goes Beyond Basketball In that period, the Lithuanians won three bronze medals in four Olympics, a silver medal in the 1995 EuroBasket and a gold medal in Eurobasket 2003. In appreciation for his contributions, Nelson was awarded the Medal of the Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas in 1995 and the Commander's Grand Crosses of the Order for Merits to Lithuania by the President of Lithuania in 2004. He also serves as Honorary Ambassador for the League of Industries.Donnie Nelson honored in Lithuania. In 1994, Nelson served as a scout for USA Basketball at the World Championships in Toronto. Dream Team II went undefeated on their way to capturing a gold medal that year. Nelson also serves as the Chief Advisor for the China national basketball team. During his two years of service, they equaled their all-time best Olympic finish (8th) in Athens and won the Gold Medal at the 2005 Asian Championships. Personal life and activism Nelson is married to Lotta and has two children. Nelson has been involved with several charitable efforts. He worked with the NBA's African Top 100 campaign, an outreach program providing educational opportunities to challenged African athletes. He is the founder of the \\"Global Games\\" in Dallas, which gives area high school kids a chance to test themselves against the top Junior National teams in the world. He also helped create the Assist Youth Foundation, who offers opportunities for underprivileged kids in the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex and across the globe.

The bus station disaster The crash occurred on 28 August 2000 at the central bus station in the city. A gravel truck transporting building supplies to a construction site suffered total brake failure on a hill above the bus station. The truck then free-wheeled in reverse down the hill, entering the bus station at a very high speed, crushing three old buses under its considerable weight. The crash caused gallons of petrol to spill from the damaged buses which were in the process of being refuelled, flooding the wreckage and parts of the crowded bus station. A flame, from an unknown source, caught the spilt fuel, and the bus station was almost instantly consumed by an immense fireball, which killed or seriously injured hundreds of people in the station or in the crushed buses, one of which was still underneath the truck. The bus station was in the Nyanya district of the city, which is a very poor and dangerous suburb, and thus it was sometime before emergency fire-fighter services arrived and combatted the blaze, which was mostly being fought by local people as best they could. The police did not show up until much later. At least 70 were killed in the blast and well over 100 badly injured. The full death toll cannot be known, as there is little available census information for the area, some bodies were destroyed outright in the blaze, and others may have been removed by relatives before the recovery operation began. Others died later in hospital from their terrible injuries. The crash was determined by police to be the result of the truck's faulty brakes, but local people expressed anger at that conclusion, claiming that the brakes were just one of a number of factors which led to the disaster. They claimed that the road approaching the bus stop was too narrow and totally unmaintained, resulting in damage to vehicles and allowing the truck to roll straight into the bus station, which had no protection against this type of incident in place such as concrete or metal defences to fend off speeding vehicles. The riots The crash had also come after a series of high-casualty accidents, including two in the last few months that killed over 20 people and another which killed over 50. On the following day, furious at the poorly maintained roads, incompetent or corrupt officials and total lack of road security or law-enforcement by police, people in Nyanya took to the streets in protest. This protest was supposedly arranged to convince the federal government to step in and widen the dangerous road. Events of the day are confusing, some claiming that the protests were peaceful and that what occurred was a police riot, others suggesting that there was an all out riot in progress which the police had to put down. The police report that a policeman was killed by a gunshot as they approached the protesters, whilst protesters claim the death of the policeman occurred after the riot broke out. The eventual result was that the police opened fire on the crowd, killing three and then pursuing, beating several more people. Riots continued in Nyanya and other areas of the city, both related to the bus disaster and in protest at police brutality and government corruption, as well as opportunistic. Parts of the city were damaged, with several cars and buildings set on fire by the mobs. Another major vehicle crash, the Ibadan tanker truck explosion three months later, also provoked riots, aimed specifically at the police. Nigeria was at this time experiencing a period of massive social upheaval and unrest. The country was extremely poverty stricken, with huge shanty towns filled with rebellious groups, free to express some of their resentment at the government following the fall of the thirty-year military dictatorship in 1999. On top of this, the country was, and still is, heavily divided along religious lines, with the North being predominantly Muslim whilst the South is strongly Christian. Strong friction between the communities was the catalyst for dozens of intercommunity riots at this period, and it is possible the protest following the bus station disaster were linked to the wider violent protest movement in Nigeria at that time.

Near the end of the hostage crisis, six were killed: three hostages and three of the four hostage-takers. The fourth hostage-taker was captured by authorities, and an additional 14 hostages were injured during the crisis. To this day, the hostage crisis remains the largest hostage rescue operation in U.S. history, with over 40 hostages having been held at gunpoint. Event =Background= The four gunmen were all Vietnamese immigrants. brothers Loi Khac Nguyen, 21; Pham Khac Nguyen, 19; and Long Khac Nguyen, 17; and their friend, Cuong Tran, 17. The Nguyens had fled Vietnam as a family of eight in 1979 at the peak of the first wave of Vietnamese refugees, first sailing to Malaysia and remaining anchored there for the first seven months, then waiting for four more months in an Indonesian refugee camp before they arrived in California in 1980. The entire family lived in a two-bedroom apartment from The Good Guys! store. Cuong Tran had moved with his parents into a new home in Elk Grove 15 months before the hostage crisis. Tran and Long Nguyen were friends and classmates at Florin High School; both had been expelled in March 1991 after stealing athletic equipment and attempting to set fire to the building. Loi Nguyen had attended Valley High School, but dropped out during his senior year. Pham Nguyen was attending William Daylor High School (a continuation school) after having transferred from Valley following attendance issues. The day of the hostage crisis, Pham Nguyen briefly came to school and asked to be excused with a toothache. The Nguyen brothers told their parents they were going fishing at the Sacramento River. =Start of the siege= At approximately 1:00 p.m., on April 4, 1991, the four young gunmen drove into the parking lot of The Good Guys! Electronics store, in the South Area of Sacramento County. The group left their vehicle, a 1982 Toyota Corolla, and entered the store armed with three pistols and a shotgun. They had purchased the guns legally at a local sporting goods store the prior week, following a background check and waiting period. Although reported, the gunmen were not members of the Oriental Boys gang, the hostage taking and subsequent crisis was not considered to be gang-related. They herded customers and staff into a group, including a shoplifter attempting to leave the store, and began shooting at the ceiling of the store. One employee escaped after being ordered to lock the doors. Although initial reports indicated they had taken the hostages after a failed robbery attempt, subsequent statements to hostages and negotiators instead proved \\"they were attempting to gain notoriety,\\" according to Sacramento County Sheriff Glen Craig. They were frustrated with their lives in the United States as it was difficult to find good jobs, and expressed a desire to travel to Thailand and fight the Viet Cong, according to two of the hostages. =Law enforcement and media response= When the 9-1-1 call came in at 1:33 p.m., the Sacramento County Sheriff's Department Special Enforcement Detail (SED) was already in the process of gearing up in anticipation of executing a previously planned drug raid. They immediately paged off-duty team members, and began preparations to rush to the scene along with the Department's Critical Incident Negotiations Team (CINT) and other local and state law enforcement agencies. As the situation developed, the local media descended on the area in force, broadcasting the unfolding incident. They were able to get footage of the event because of the store's huge glass front doors, which allowed video crews to see into the store where the hostage takers lined up some of the hostages in front of the entrance as human shields. =Surveillance and negotiation= In accordance with standard operating procedure, the team obtained a floor plan of the building, which was copied and distributed to team members. The SED team was told that there was only one entrance to the store which was not alarmed: a freight entrance located at the rear of the store. Their only option would be to enter the store's showroom, where the hostages were being held, through a fabrics store on the north side of the building. The entry team gained entrance to the fabric store, and slowly moved into position. The criminals apparently heard movement by the police amid shouts of \\"stay away from the door\\" coming from inside the store itself. One of the entry team members removed a ceiling panel in the hallway between the two buildings and inserted a pole-mounted mirror. He was able to observe the subjects directing hostages to place large boxes against the back door to block entry. Once the door was barricaded, the area was abandoned. A fisheye camera was installed by the team but was of limited use because of the design of the store, showing only a portion of the showroom near the door. By this time, the hostages had been tied up with speaker wire and had been arranged inside the store's glass front entrance doors in standing and kneeling positions. For more than two hours, the department's CINT tried to end the incident peacefully by negotiating with the hostage takers. Negotiations were initially conducted from police headquarters, and a special negotiation team took over on-site after a few hours from a bank that had been evacuated. The hostage takers demanded $4 million, forty 1,000-year- old ginseng roots, four bulletproof vests, a 50-troop military helicopter, and transportation for everyone to Thailand after a refueling stop in Alaska. Throughout the incident, the hostage takers did not present a consistent set of demands to the negotiators. One demand that remained constant was for bulletproof vests. During early negotiations, one of the requested vests was exchanged for what was to be the release of nine hostages, although only three were released initially; the police officer who took the first vest to them stripped to his underwear to prove he was unarmed. Loi Nguyen sent a woman to retrieve the vest and threatened to shoot her children if she did not return; after she retrieved the vest, they were the first three hostages to be released. In addition to the hostage exchange, another benefit was that it allowed police to gain information on the current situation in the store. One of the released hostages revealed that the shots heard earlier had been the hostage takers shooting at the store's security cameras, and that none of the hostages had been harmed up to this point. Soon thereafter, more shots were heard, but this was the hostage takers testing the vest. Approximately an hour later, another woman and her three children were released; an eighth hostage was released at 8:20 p.m., bearing a message that they would start to shoot the other hostages shortly. At one point during the negotiations, the leader of the hostage takers, who called himself \\"Thai\\" (later shown to be Loi Nguyen), agreed to surrender to the police, but only if they were allowed to retain their bulletproof vests and weapons while in prison. The police negotiator informed Loi Nguyen that he would have a short sentence and his vest and guns would be returned upon his release. He set down the phone and began to discuss the situation with his partners. At that point, many of the officers involved felt the exchanges might lead to a negotiated settlement; when he returned to the phone, Loi Nguyen stated that while he accepted those terms, his partners did not. Suddenly, the phone went dead, and the CINT immediately tried to re-establish contact with the store. On the first attempt, the phone was busy, and on the second attempt a suspect calling himself \\"Number One\\" (later shown to be Long Nguyen) answered the phone, informing everyone that he was now in control. From that point on, the situation began to rapidly deteriorate. Shots were once again fired at the store's security cameras. =Entry= Audio of the SCSD's SED entering the store and engaging in a shootout with the gunmen. At approximately 9 p.m., Long Nguyen shot a twenty-year-old male hostage named Sean McIntyre in the leg, then released McIntyre as the ninth and final hostage to be released with the instruction to deliver their message and plight to the local media. They claimed they were trying to draw attention to the troubles of their home country and that they were on a suicide mission. At that point, the police attempted to distract the gunmen by putting the hostage on the news, which would also move them to the television area of the store, but unfortunately this tactic did not work. The police team was finally given the \\"green light\\" to enter the store. Sniper Jeffrey Boyes would issue the signal to execute the assault. Boyes had received permission to fire on any subject on whom he could obtain a clear line of sight. After McIntyre was shot and released, another hostage was shot just before 10 p.m.; the gunmen had told the hostages to select the next victim from among themselves, causing an elderly hostage, Harold Brooks, to faint. According to Sheriff Craig, the gunmen joked \\"he just decided he was going to be our next person shot.\\" Long Nguyen attempted to shoot Brooks, but his gun misfired and Loi Nguyen shot Brooks in the leg. The surviving hostages stated the gunmen divided them into two groups and had begun flipping a coin to decide their fates. Guns were placed to the hostages' heads. Several hostages were placed on the phone, and they informed the police the gunmen were going to begin executing hostages. A second bulletproof vest was delivered to the front door shortly after Brooks was shot, which was to be exchanged for nine more hostages, but no one was released. A female hostage was sent out to recover the second vest with her wrists tied behind her and harnessed with more speaker cord. As the door was opened and the woman was halfway down the path to retrieve the vest, Boyes took a shot at one of the gunmen, but the sniper's bullet was deflected by the glass door as it swung shut and it failed to hit the target. Immediately, the hostage takers ran back and forth, and one started to shoot the seated hostages who were tied down in a row behind the glass door, in full view of the news cameras broadcasting the event live. At the same time, Boyes radioed \\"Go\\", and the SED entry team immediately hit the door at 9:51 p.m. A stun grenade was tossed into the store from outside, and Curt Warburton, one of the Good Guys employees, managed to scramble to safety through the now shattered glass door. \\"Number One\\" (Long Nguyen), now stunned and disoriented, managed to stagger out of Boyes's sights and take cover behind a large pillar. He then immediately began firing his weapon at more bound hostages. It took the seven-person entry team two to three seconds to get through the back doors from where they had been hiding (a storage space in the rear of the store) because of the \\"barricades\\" erected earlier. They then had to contend with the distance to the front of the store. The team was armed with a variety of weapons for the entry. Sergeants Don Devlin, Charles Price, and Gordon Smith were armed with SiGARMS Sig P220 pistols, Bill Kelly carried a laser-sighted HK MP5, and investigators Mike Hammel and Greg Peterson carried H&K; MP5SD3 submachine guns. Roger Stanfill was still armed with his AR-15. Hammel and Price cleared the west side of the store, Peterson and Kelly the east side, and Devlin and Smith went straight up the middle. Stanfill took up a rear guard position. As the team began its movement toward the front of the store, the remaining hostage takers immediately began to fire on the entry team and hostages. Peterson stepped on the wire that had been used to tether the female hostage sent out to recover the second vest. At that moment, she was snatched to safety by officers outside the store, causing Peterson's feet to fly out from under him, forcing him to fall backwards, just as a shotgun blast immediately blew through the area where he was standing. His fellow team members mistakenly believed he had been struck in the face by the blast. As Peterson began to rise to his feet, Devlin and Kelly tried to flank the shotgun wielding suspect who fired on them once again, before being taken under fire by the team. =Suspects shot= Simultaneously, on the west side of the store, the team shot one of the suspects (Cuong Tran) before he could react. Then they spotted a second armed suspect (Pham Nguyen) and fired on him, but he disappeared into the chaos of the screaming and panicking crowd of hostages. Then, \\"Number One\\" (Long Nguyen) was shot. At this point, the team could only account for three of the suspects, and immediately began a systematic search for the fourth. Price and Hammel discovered an unarmed Asian male (Loi Nguyen) lying on the floor, wearing the sole bulletproof vest that had been provided earlier. Once he was rolled over, they discovered he had a .223 caliber entrance wound, accounting for all four suspects. It took only 30 seconds from the initial police entry until the gunfire ceased, bringing an end to the hostage crisis. Aftermath =Casualties= During the assault, the suspects wounded eleven hostages and killed three. Of the eleven wounded, ten were shot and one suffered a miscarriage. Others shot at were Bret Soren, Chris Lauretzen, Curt Warburton and many others who suffered both physical and extreme emotional consequences including brutal bodily injuries, trauma and severe ongoing symptoms of post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Of the four suspects, three were killed by the entry team and one, \\"Thai\\" (Loi), was wounded. None of the SED entry team was wounded. The hostages killed were store employees Kris Edward Sohne and John Lee Fritz, and customer Fernando Gutierrez. Gutierrez's two nieces were also hostages. One of the nieces, Lisa Joseph, later wrote the book Heads or Tails: A True Hostage Story of Terror, Torture and Ultimate Survival about her ordeal. Two employees hid in a computer closet during the hostage crisis. The Good Guys! announced they would set up trust funds for the two slain employees, and would pay for the funerals of all three murder victims. =Trial and prosecution= Loi Nguyen was arraigned from his hospital bed shortly after the crisis ended and charged with 54 felonies, including murder. Nguyen's attorney, Sacramento public defender Linda Parisi, argued that Loi Nguyen was trying to make peace, based on witness testimony and recorded audio, and did not deserve the death penalty; she pointed to Long Nguyen as the leader. However, Rebecca Moore, a sheriff's detective, pointed out that Loi Nguyen had purchased the guns, driven the group to the store, and had handled most of the negotiations: \\"In my opinion he is the most responsible party for this thing going down.\\" Because of pre-trial publicity, the trial was moved to San Francisco. He was convicted on February 8, 1995, on 51 felony counts: three for murder, eight for attempted murder, two for assault with a firearm, and 38 for kidnapping, after two days of jury deliberation. On March 28, the jury recommended a life sentence in prison rather than the death penalty, after four more hours of deliberation. At the sentencing hearing in Sacramento, Judge W.J. Harpham said, \\"It's hard to find the adjectives for the terror the defendant put these hostages through.\\" He sentenced Loi Khac Nguyen to 49 life terms in prison, 41 to be served consecutively without the chance of parole. Information that surfaced at Nguyen's trial revealed the men's motivation for committing the crime was that they were frustrated by their inability to learn English and find jobs. Nguyen initially served his sentence at the California State Prison, Lancaster. At some point he was transferred to California State Prison, Centinela, where he is currently serving his term. His CDCR number is J69791. The former Good Guys! building later became a Dollar Tree store, which was modified to move the main entry doors from the front (south facade) to the side of the building (east facade). This Dollar Tree still stands and remains in business.

Each year, approximately 15,000 Year 6 students across the state of New South Wales optionally undertake the Selective High Schools Test to seek one of the 3,600 places offered for first-year entry into selective high schools. For Year 8 to Year 12 entry into selective schools, students do not take an external test, however they can apply directly to a school for entry. The application package is standard to all government selective schools, with internal selection committees considering applications each year in August–September. History The first government selective high schools in NSW were established in the late 19th and early 20th century. The selective school system at the turn of the 20th century included both schools newly established as selective schools, and older schools with selective entry that were brought into the system. The oldest selective schools included Bathurst High School, Fort Street High School, Goulburn High School, St. George Girls High School, Sydney Technical High School, Penrith High School and Sydney High School (now Sydney Boys High School and Sydney Girls High School).Proctor, H, Sriprakash, A., \\"Selective schools' long and tangled history with race and class\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 29 March 2017 Many of the oldest selective schools in NSW have always been selective since establishment, including Fort Street (1849), Sydney Boys and Sydney Girls (1883), North Sydney Girls High School (1914), North Sydney Boys High School (1915), Hurlstone Agricultural High School (1959) and James Ruse Agricultural High School (1959).Campbell, C., \\"The reason NSW has more selective schools than other states combined\\", ABC, 22 July 2019 Before World War II, most of the state's government high schools were selective. In 1957, a government report recommended the conversion of selective schools to comprehensive schools, reflecting changes in education philosophy. As a result, from the early 1960s, most selective schools were converted to comprehensive schools. The conversion was resisted by parents and influential alumni of especially inner-city selective schools such as Fort Street. As a result, a small number of selective schools survived the reforms: Fort Street, Sydney Boys, Sydney Girls, North Sydney Boys, North Sydney Girls, James Ruse and Hurlstone.Baker, J., \\"'I can see why people are worried': Have we hit peak selective?\\". Sydney Morning Herald, 20 July 2018 However, in 1988, the NSW government began increasing the number of selective schools and also made an important reform, abolishing catchment restrictions for selective schools so that any student in NSW could apply to attend any selective school. In 1995, the NSW government under Bob Carr created some partially selective schools (i.e. schools with both comprehensive and selective streams). In 2010, 14 more comprehensive high schools became partially selective, with one or more classes of selective students, and a \\"virtual school\\" bringing together a single class of students from regional NSW. there are 47 fully or partially selective government high schools, including 17 fully selective high schools (some of which are co- educational and other provide a single-sex educational environment; 25 partially selective high schools (high schools with both selective and comprehensive classes); four selective agricultural high schools; and one virtual selective high school. Of the 47 school, 34 are located in greater metropolitan Sydney. The Aurora College is a virtual selective high school that caters for students enrolled in government high schools in rural or remote areas in New South Wales. Virtual classes commenced in January 2015 with over 160 students. The school is managed from administrative offices based in . Aurora allows students in rural and remote areas to remain in their local school and community while studying specialist subjects which their home school cannot currently offer. The College uses a range of technologies to access more fast-paced lessons delivered by video and interact with each other, and attend a residential program held twice per year. =Partially selective schools= A number of schools have been designated as \\"partially selective\\", in that they have self-contained classes to provide for gifted and talented students in the junior years of high school. Often, schools combine selective and comprehensive streams as students enter the senior years, however, in practice, selective students tend to \\"self-select\\" into more advanced classes, such as extension units in Mathematics and English.  Admission and criteria  =Profile score= In general, entry into a government selective school is determined by a profile score, which is derived by combining school marks in English and mathematics with the marks received in the Selective High Schools Test in reading, writing, mathematics and general ability. The profile score is computed by adding together component scores for English, mathematics and general ability, each of which are marks out of 100, to form the profile score out of 300. the component scores are computed as follows: * In general ability the test marks are scaled on a statewide basis to a mean of 60 and a standard deviation of 12 to form the component general ability score out of 100. * In mathematics, the component score is the scaled average of the scaled test mark and the moderated school mark. The raw test marks are scaled on a statewide basis to a mean of 60 and a standard deviation of 12 to form the scaled mathematics test marks out of 100. School marks are scaled on a school-by-school basis. The distribution of mathematics school marks for each school is scaled to the same mean and standard deviation, as the mean and standard deviation of the scaled test marks for students at that school. This accounts for different marking standards in different schools. A student's raw school mark, scaled according to this adjusted distribution, is the moderated school mark. The scaled test mark and the moderated school mark for each student is averaged, and the average is then re-scaled on a statewide basis to the mean of 60 and standard deviation of 12 to form the final component score out of 100. * In English, the component score is the scaled weighted average of scaled reading and writing scores. The process follows the process used for mathematics, except that the school mark is used twice - once moderated according to reading test marks for the school and averaged with the scaled reading test score, and a second time scaled according to writing test marks for the school and averaged with the scaled writing test score. The average reading score is given a weighting of two thirds and the resultant scores for writing are given a weighting of one third. These two scores are then added and re-scaled on a statewide basis to a mean of 60 and a standard deviation of 12 to form the final component score in English out of 100. Scaling and moderating school and tests marks ensure that: * school and test marks have the same value; * school marks from each school are placed on the same scale as the test marks achieved by students from those same schools thereby making it possible to fairly compare school marks from one school with school marks from each other school; and * each component (English, mathematics and general ability) has the same value. The process also includes 'wild-score' processing which identifies students who, based on their school performance, may have done much worse than expected in the test. Where such students have been identified the moderating process takes this into account and adjusts scores accordingly. This ensures that students will not be disadvantaged by other students who attend the same school and may have done much worse than expected because of serious illness, misadventure or other cause. =Offers= By early July students receive letters informing them of one of three outcomes concerning their application to each school: * offerthe student can apply immediately for enrolment in the certain school; * reserve listthe student is placed on a waiting list, with the possibility of entry if their place on the list is reached; or * unsuccessfulthe student will not be considered for a place. In some cases, an application can be placed on 'hold', meaning it is awaiting the result of further enquiries by the Department of Education. =Other criteria= Other criteria include age and grade, and current residency status in Australia. This usually requires students to be between 11 years and 5 months and 13 years at the start of the year they wish to commence Year 7, be in Year 6 the year before they wish to enter, and be either a citizen or permanent resident of Australia or a citizen of New Zealand. However, exemptions to some of these requirements may be given in special circumstances or through consultation with the Department of Education.  Debate  The existence of government selective schools in NSW, which also exist in Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia, has not been without controversy, with much of it centred on the discrepancies between selective high schools and comprehensive high schools. A significant dismantling of the selective schools system was proposed by an inquiry in 2002 that was funded by the NSW Parents and Citizens Association and the NSW Teachers Federation. At that time, the report called for the changing of 12 of the state's 19 selective high schools to partially selective high schools, retaining only the seven most established schools: Fort Street, North Sydney Boys', North Sydney Girls', Sydney Boys', Sydney Girls', Sydney Technical, and St George Girls'. The recommendation were justified, from the viewpoint of the inquiry's chair UNSW Professor Tony Vinson, by the fact that 'wherever possible, talented students should be able to remain within mainstream schools to maximise social cohesion and \\"an inclusive school community\\"'. However, although the report had the backing of the then NSW Education Minister John Watkins, most of the Vinson enquiry's recommendations, including most of the recommendations concerning the status of selective schools, were not implemented by the NSW Government. Another report commissioned by the Department of Education, in 2005, drew on consultation with the public across the entire state school system and found that opinions are still polarised on whether they should continue to exist.Secondary School Years. NSW Department of Education and Training. June 2005. Retrieved 2 August 2006. (pdf 125kb) The debate has been reignited recently due to a string of articles from The Sydney Morning Herald criticising selective schools, with the main argument purporting that they are the cause of much socio-economic divide within Sydney. In December 2018, the then NSW Minister for Education, Rob Stokes, announced the findings of the Review of Selective Education Access that outlined changes that aim to increase the number of girls, poor and disabled students, and students stronger in English than other subjects, in selective schools. The review found that: * The existing selection process is no longer fit for purpose and needs updating for the coming decades; * Students from disadvantaged groups face unintended barriers to entry in the selective education system; * Shortcomings in the assessment process mean it is not capturing all students’ true ability and so may not identify all the students it is intended to; and * A number of gaps in the selection system constrain its effectiveness.

It is endemic to the highlands of Costa Rica and western Panama. This vireo occurs from 2000 m to the timberline in the canopy of mountain forest, sometimes feeding in undergrowth or tall second growth. The small cup nest is built in the fork of a small branch 3–20 m high in a tree or scrub and the clutch is two dark-spotted white eggs. Both sexes construct the nest, incubate the eggs and feed the young. The adult yellow-winged vireo is 11.5 cm in length and weighs 13 g. It has olive-green upperparts and blackish wings with two yellow wing bars. There is a yellowish supercilium which joins the interrupted white eye ring. The throat is white, and the underparts are otherwise pale yellow with some olive on the flanks. Young birds are browner above and have very pale yellow underparts. Yellow-winged vireos feed on spiders and insects gleaned from tree foliage, and also eat small fruits. They will join mixed- species feeding flocks, or accompany flame-throated warblers. The yellow- winged vireo has a nasal nit call and the song is a high slurred viree chichu chuyee; viree viree cheeyu; viree witchum vireee.

This designation was changed to Model 1905 in 1917, and then to M1905 in 1925, when the army adopted the M designation nomenclature. The M1905 bayonet has a 16-inch (40.6 cm) steel blade and a 4-inch (10.16 cm) handle with wooden or plastic grips. The bayonet also fits the U.S. M1 Garand rifle. From 1943 to 1945, a shorter, 10-inch (25.4 cm), bladed version was produced with black or dark red molded plastic grips, and designated the M1 bayonet. A number of M1905 bayonets were recalled from service, their blades cut down, and reissued as M1 bayonets. M1905 bayonet The M1905 bayonet was produced from 1906 to 1922 by Springfield Armory and Rock Island Arsenal. The blade and handle frame were forged as a single piece with a wide, square-shaped fuller, and the crossguard was pinned to this assembly through two holes with cone- shaped steel pins. The ribbed hand grips were made of walnut wood and attached to the handle with a screw. The screw also held the catch mechanism, manipulated with a button under the crossguard, that was used to fix the bayonet to the rifle's bayonet lug. In mid-1941, it was decided to restart production of the M1905 bayonet. To simplify production, these later bayonets had handles with black or dark red ribbed grips, made of phenol formaldehyde resin, the earliest type of synthetic plastic. Production was scheduled to begin in January 1942, but the first bayonets were not delivered until April, with quantity deliveries not beginning until the summer of 1942. Despite initial setbacks, the M1905 bayonet was manufactured in sufficient numbers to keep up with the widespread introduction of the new M1 Garand rifle in 1942. By the end of 1942, all six manufacturers had changed the shape of their fullers to a narrower, round-bottomed shape. The later version of the M1905 bayonet with plastic grips is sometimes referred to as the \\"M1942\\" by collectors and historians, but this designation was never used by the Army. {class=wikitable !Approximate M1905 production (1906–22) by manufacturer USMilitaryKnives.com Number - !

Production of this new bayonet, designated the M1, began at the five remaining manufacturers by April 1943. Because of quality control issues and problems meeting delivery expectations, Wilde Drop Forge and Tool was dropped from the bayonet production program after finishing their run of M1905 bayonets. As many of the M1905 bayonets already in service as possible were recalled, their blades were cut down, and they were reissued; roughly 1 million bayonets underwent this process. The first shortened bayonets were delivered in September 1943, and deliveries continued at a rate of 40-50,000 per month until August 1945. The points were either shortened to a \\"spear\\" or \\"beak\\" point, the latter being used most often on the early M1905 bayonets with a square fuller to give extra strength to the tip of the blade. Oneida was dropped from the bayonet program altogether in November 1943 after it asked the War Department to be released, as it could not keep its workers steadily employed because of the erratic nature of recalling bayonets for shortening. Utica and Pal Blade and Tool were released from shortening in 1944. American Fork and Hoe and Union Fork and Hoe then took over the duty of shortening M1905 bayonets. These shortened bayonets were re-designated as M1; all ten-inch bladed bayonets, whether new production M1 or cut-down M1905, were officially referred to as M1 bayonets, and the Army made no distinction between the two when issuing them. {class=wikitable !Approximate M1 production (1943–1945) by manufacturer USMilitaryKnives.com Number - !

Oneida, Ltd.  75,000 } These shortened bayonets functioned well in the European theater, where in the rare bayonet actions of the time they were matched up against the 9-inch long blade of the German S84/98 III bayonet fitted on the Karabiner 98k rifle. However, in the Pacific theater, the Japanese used the much longer, 15.75 inch (40.0 cm)-bladed Type 30 sword bayonet on the already very long Arisaka rifle, which caused many American troops to retain the longer, unmodified M1905 bayonet. Scabbards U.S Marine sheaths an M-1 bayonet The original M1905 scabbard had a wooden body with a rawhide cover and employed a wire belt- hanger which went over and around the belt. The M1910 scabbard was covered in canvas with a leather tip to prevent the blade tip from tearing the material. A wire hook that engaged grommets on the cartridge belt replaced the belt- hanger. The M1910 scabbard was the primary scabbard used during the First World War. Earlier M1905 scabbards were modified by replacing the belt-hanger with a belt hook. A green leather-bodied M1917 scabbard (designed for the M1917 bayonet) was approved as a substitute for the M1905 bayonet scabbard. A new scabbard, the M3, was developed early in the Second World War to replace these earlier scabbards. The M3 scabbard had a body made of resin-impregnated cotton duck canvas with a metal throat, and was equipped with a wire hook hanger.Canfield, Bruce N.; Bayonet Scabbards for U.S. M1903 Springfields; \\"American Rifleman;\\" September 2009; p.48 The M1905 bayonet had a tendency to rattle inside the scabbard, and so ribs were molded into the scabbard tip to hold the blade. When production of the M1 bayonet began in 1943, a new scabbard, the M7 (otherwise identical in construction to the M3) was developed that used spring steel plates in the scabbard throat to hold the blade instead of the molded ribs. As a part of the bayonet-shortening program, M3 scabbards were also recalled for modification. The tabs which held the body to the throat were bent outward, the body was removed and shortened, and then reinserted into the throat and the tabs bent back. Since the tabs had a tendency to break off when being bent during the shortening process, later shortened scabbards had the tabs removed, short V-shaped cuts were made in the sides of the throat, and it was crimped onto the shortened body using a special tool.

He retired in 1923 as an honorary major general. Early life Charles Frederick Cox was born on 2 May 1863 at Pennant Hills, New South Wales. He was a grandson of William Cox. He was educated in Parramatta and became a clerk with the New South Wales Railways traffic audit branch in 1881. Cox enlisted in the New South Wales Lancers in 1891 and was commissioned as a lieutenant in 1894. In 1897 he was chosen to head a detachment of the regiment in the ceremonies for Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. He married Minnie Elizabeth Gibbons on 7 March 1894. Promoted to captain in 1897, he travelled to England again in 1899 in command of a squadron of the lancers for training with the British cavalry. Boer War The squadron was training alongside the 6th Dragoon Guards (Carabiniers) at Aldershot, England, when the Boer War broke out. Cox volunteered himself and his squadron for service in South Africa. Some 70 of his men went to South Africa; another 31, for various reasons, did not, and returned to Australia. Cox and his volunteers arrived in Cape Town in December 1899 and were the first colonial volunteers to arrive in Cape Town. The squadron saw only limited action throughout their first tour, but did take part in the last major battle of the war, the Battle of Paardeberg, on 18 February 1900. In May 1900, Cox was attached to the Inniskilling Dragoons, under the command of Major Edmund Allenby. The lancers returned to Australia in December 1900. Cox was promoted to major and given command of the newly formed 3rd New South Wales Mounted Rifles, with which he returned to South Africa in April 1901. In June he was made an honorary lieutenant colonel. In the latter half of 1901, Cox's regiment joined part of a force led by Colonel Michael Rimington. They covered 1,814 miles in 153 days. There was little action apart from the occasional skirmish, but these cost the regiment 5 killed and 19 wounded. While the British regulars had doubts about Cox's competence in 1899, by the end of the war in 1902 Cox had earned considerable accolades from Colonel Rimington. From his men he had earned the nickname \\"Fighting Charlie\\". For his service during the war, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the South Africa honours list published on 26 June 1902,(mistakenly gazetted as C. W. Cox) and received the decoration from the Prince of Wales during a large coronation parade of colonial troops in London on 1 July 1902. Cox remained with the lancers, which became the 1st Light Horse in 1903. He became the commander in 1906 and was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 2 April 1908. In 1911 Cox was transferred to the unattached officer list. First World War In September 1914, Cox was appointed to command the AIF's 6th Light Horse Regiment. The regiment trained in Sydney and Egypt before arriving at Gallipoli for dismounted service on 19 May 1915. Two days later, Cox was wounded by shrapnel while in his dugout. He was evacuated and did not rejoin his regiment until 1 July. When Brigadier General Chauvel took over the New Zealand and Australian Division on 19 September, Cox became acting commander of the 1st Light Horse Brigade. On 6 December 1915 the appointment became permanent and Cox was promoted to colonel and temporary brigadier general. He held this post for the duration of the war. The 1st Light Horse Brigade arrived back in Egypt on 28 December 1915. The brigade was sent to Wadi Natrun, south west of Cairo, to protect the Kataba Canal against the Senussi. On 11 February 1916, the brigade, less the 3rd Light Horse Regiment, entrained for Minia. They remained there until May, patrolling the area for signs of the Senussi. In May Cox went to England on sick leave. He rejoined his brigade on 26 August 1916 on the Suez Canal front, where they now formed part of Chauvel's ANZAC Mounted Division. Cox and his brigade took part in multiple actions during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign, including the Battle of Magdhaba, Battle of Beersheba and captured the town of Jericho. Post-war Cox returned to Australia on 13 March 1919. In 1920 he was elected to the Senate as a Nationalist representing New South Wales, a seat he held until 1938. He travelled widely through New South Wales and became well known and popular. As a senator, he took an interest in defence policy, the development of the railway system, and the construction of the new national capital in Canberra. Cox was appointed to command the 4th Light Horse Brigade in 1920, and then the 1st Cavalry Division in 1921. In 1923 he was transferred to the retired list with the rank of honorary major general. He died at Croydon on 20 November 1944 and was buried in the Carlingford Cemetery with full military honours.

Non-DGA productions might call it the production manager or production supervisor. They work closely with the line producer. Sometimes the line producer is the UPM. A senior producer may assign a UPM more than one production at a time. Responsibility to a senior producer A UPM is usually hired by a film producer or television producer, and is responsible for managing the production and regulating the costs of delivering the expected film or television show on budget at the end of principal photography. Typically, a producer will oversee all the cost-related decisions, including above-the-line expenditures (especially during pre-production). However, the UPM is responsible for the more detailed planning and execution of the below- the-line costs (primarily for physical production). The film's director will select important department heads (keys) or support personnel related to his work, including the casting director, cinematographer, costume designer, production designer, and film editor. For below-the-line matters, the UPM often negotiates deals (for location, equipment, etc.) and hires the remaining crew, typically on the recommendation of the keys and/or based on prior experience with trusted individuals. The UPM frequently does not have any direct responsibilities with the creative direction of the film's narrative, although in some cases they will and can be consulted. Many budget decisions affect the creative direction of the project. They are to support the director's artistic vision on a daily physical production level. Before principal photography begins both the producer and UPM work to secure as many of the production elements as possible, including a workable schedule and budget. Usually from a production office during pre-production, they may later divide their time between the office and the set while the film is being shot. An on-set trailer may also be used as a makeshift production office. Like nearly all members of a film crew, UPMs will typically remain on the shoot until the end of principal photography and can return if there are any reshoots. It is not atypical for a UPM to work 80-100 (or more) hours per week while a film is in production. In the US, a union UPM is represented by The Directors Guild of America. Certain conditions must be adhered to on a union shoot in order to remain in good standing with the DGA. These include expected salary rates, working hours, overtime penalties, required meals and other related criteria. Highly experienced UPMs bring great value to a project for their strategic and creative problem-solving skills.

He was at the centre of one of the country's most enduring judicial controversies, after being found guilty in June 1993 in the High Court of New Zealand on 16 counts of sexual offences involving children in his care at the Christchurch Civic Creche and sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment. He maintained his innocence until his death 26 years later and was supported by many New Zealanders in his attempts to overturn his convictions. Concerns about the reliability of the convictions centred on lurid stories told by many of the children and the interview techniques used to obtain their testimony. In 1994, Ellis took his case to the Court of Appeal of New Zealand which quashed convictions on three of the charges but upheld the sentence. His conviction and sentence were upheld in his second appearance before the Court of Appeal in October 1999. In March 2000, former Chief Justice Sir Thomas Eichelbaum was appointed to conduct a ministerial inquiry reviewing the children's evidence. His report upheld the guilty verdicts. The same month Governor-General Sir Michael Hardie Boys rejected Ellis' third bid for pardon on the advice of Justice Minister Phil Goff, who was satisfied with Eichelbaum's finding that Ellis had failed to prove his convictions were unsafe. Ellis refused to attend parole board hearings while in prison because he would have to confess to the crimes in order to argue for early release.Gilbert, Jarrod (8 February 2018). Jarrod Gilbert: \\"Peter Ellis martyr to deranged prejudice\\", New Zealand Herald. He was released in February 2000 after serving seven years in prison. Two books and numerous articlesSee http://www.peterellis.org.nz for reproductions of articles. have been written about the case. After his release, Ellis continued campaigning to clear his name. In 2019, nineteen years after he was released, he appealed to the Supreme Court to have his conviction overturned, but died of cancer before the appeal could be heard. The Ellis case was one of several similar high profile child abuse cases around the world in the 1980s and early 1990s. It has been mentioned as a cause in the decline in the number of male teachers in New Zealand schools. Personal life Ellis was the eldest of four children. His parents were teachers who separated when he was nine. He left school in 1975 to take up tobacco picking in Motueka. After two years overseas, he returned to New Zealand. He then had a part-time job in a bakery in the 1980s which eventually became full-time. When he left this job and applied for unemployment benefits, authorities discovered he had received dole payments to which he was not entitled. He was prosecuted and convicted in 1986 of \\"misleading a social welfare officer\\" and sentenced to 80 hours community service. Ellis carried out his community service at the Christchurch Civic Creche. His supervisor, Dora Reinfeld, later reported that \\"Peter ... provided some hilarious puppetry shows – one of which we had to abandon as staff and children 'got out of hand'\\". Ellis became a relieving worker, and Reinfeld's next monthly report said: \\"Peter Ellis has fitted in extremely well and puts lots of energy into programme planning. Fantastic team spirit.\\" Ellis's pre- sentencing report said, \\"The overall picture gained of Peter Ellis is that of an outgoing, uninhibited, unconventional person given to putting plenty of enthusiasm and energy into his work and social activities, sometimes to the point of being risqué and outrageous.\\"R v Ellis [2000] 1 NZLR 513 Before his imprisonment, Ellis had sexual relationships lasting for periods of two to five years with both men and women. He told Lynley Hood, \\"In a relationship with a woman I was, for want of a better word, bisexual, and with a man I was monogamous.\\" When working for the Civic Creche, Ellis was described by Hood as \\"blatantly homosexual\\". In July 2019, Ellis was diagnosed with terminal cancer. He died on 4 September 2019 while appealing his conviction at the age of 61. Investigations The creche building in January 2006. The door to the toilet lobby, clearly visible, has not been changed since 1991. It features a large glass window and was kept open during the daily operation of the creche. The premises continued to operate as a day care centre until February 2011. = Background = Ellis loved animals and kept rabbits, cats and dogs as pets.Why the Peter Ellis Civic Creche case won't go away. Noted His difficulties began when a mother, who was a social worker and a self-claimed victim of sexual abuse, bought a black puppy from him. Ellis showed her four year old son who attended the Creche how to distinguish the puppy's gender. A few months later, in November 1991, the mother alleged that her son said he \\"didn't like Peter's black penis\\". His mother, who had written a handbook on sexual abuse, Peter Ellis and the Christchurch creche case, RNZ, 2 August 2018 concluded her son had been sexually interfered with. She made a complaint to the creche in November 1991. After a brief investigation, the police decided there was no case to answer,Felicity Goodyear-Smith, Civic Creche Case, Christchurch, from First Do No Harm: The Sexual Abuse Industry, 1993, Auckland, New Zealand: Benton-Guy Publishers. but Ellis was suspended from work. The mother then withdrew her son from the creche and enrolled him into a different Christchurch day care centre. Shortly thereafter, she alleged a male worker at this second creche had also abused her son. The police investigated and again found no evidence to support the allegation. = ERO report = Ellis was extremely popular with children and parents at the creche. In the week following his suspension, inspectors from the New Zealand Education Review Office spent a full week at the Civic Creche observing its daily operation. The office subsequently issued a highly favourable report, stating that \\"The staff ensure personal needs are met with warmth, care and consideration. The children appear happy, inquisitive and sociable\\" and that \\"they [the children] have high self-esteem\\". = Second police investigation = Even though police concluded no abuse had occurred, some parents started asking their children about what went on at the creche and then shared these stories with other parents. The Department of Social Welfare was called in to conduct formal interviews with many of these children. A social welfare psychologist, Sue Sidey, initially revealed that there were six children for whom she felt there were grounds for concern, although the children made no disclosures of any indecent touching by a creche staff member. More parents became concerned that something must have happened. As the social welfare interviews continued, claims about bizarre sexual abuse incidents began to surface. A meeting was held at the creche attended by staff members, a group of concerned parents and representatives from the Social Welfare Department. In response, the police reopened their investigation. Altogether, at least 127 children were interviewed. Some detectives believed that up to 80 had been abused.  Smart report  In addition to interviews conducted by Sue Sidey, the Christchurch City Council, which owned the creche, requested that psychologist and sex therapist Rosemary Smart review the management practices at the creche. Even though Smart's report was completed nearly 12 months before Ellis' trial, she seems to have assumed he was guilty; although the word \\"alleged\\" crops up occasionally in her report, severely incriminating circumstantial evidence is presented as factual.Beyond the Civic creche case, Cate Brett, North & South September 1993, pp. 54-70. Smart suggested that female staff may have been involved with abuse at the Civic Creche and her report helped convince investigating officers of the women's guilt. She quoted research by the New Hampshire sociologist David Finkelhor, whose 1987 book, Nursery Crimes, became the source for American believers in ritual abuse occurring in creches. Finkelhor's work has since been discredited.  Arrest of four female staff  Smart's report was completed in July 1992 and a copy was given to police. Detectives said her report was central to their decision to investigate four of Ellis's female colleagues at the creche. Their houses were searched for everything from pornography to babies bodies. Nothing was found. Ellis' mother was suspected of being involved and accused of administering drugs to the children. The four female staff members were arrested on 1 October 1992 amid considerable televised publicity. At depositions they faced 15 charges that included sexual violation, indecent assault and one charge of performing an indecent act (having sex with Ellis) in a public place. The charges were subsequently dropped when Judge Williamson concluded the publicity meant their chances of a fair trial would be prejudiced by their association with Ellis. Although the charges were dropped, their careers were ruined.  Accusations  Ellis was accused, among other things, of \\"sodomising children, forcing them to eat his faeces, urinating on them, suspending them in cages, taking them on terrifying trips of abuse through tunnels, ceilings and trapdoors\\". Other allegations included children being forced into a steaming hot oven or buried in coffins; one boy claimed he had his belly-button removed with pliers. New evidence in the Peter Ellis case, Ross Francis, New Zealand Law Journal, November 2007 Allegations which emerged later as the interviews progressed included \\"Asian men dressed as cowboys, Masonic lodges, cemeteries, the Park Royal Hotel and private houses far from the creche ... (and) the notorious 'circle incident' where Ellis and his co-workers supposedly took a group of children to 404 Hereford St on the other side of town and made them stand naked and kick each other while the adults danced around them ... Alleged by one parent, was the sacrifice of a boy called Andrew.\\" No child was actually reported missing by anyone involved.  Arrest  The police arrested Ellis on 30 March 1992, charging him with the first of what would eventually be 45 counts of sexually abusing 20 different children at the creche. By the time the case went to trial, the Crown had reduced the number of charges to 28, involving 13 complainants. Some charges were dropped because the crown prosecutor, Brent Stanaway, did not want to put the more bizarre claims made by some of the children before a conservative Christchurch jury. Trial Barristers Rob Harrison and Siobhan McNulty represented Ellis; Brent Stanaway and Chris Lange appeared for the Crown. The offences were alleged to have taken place at unspecified times and dates between 1 May 1986 (four months before Ellis started work at the creche) and 1 October 1992 (11 months after he left the creche, and a month after the creche was closed).\\" (Hood, 2001) Defence counsel, Rob Harrison, wanted the jury to see the children's videotaped testimony containing the bizarre allegations as \\"he believed they would cast reasonable doubt on the more credible testimony.\\" However, Justice Williamson ruled that these tapes were not relevant. In A City Possessed, Lynley Hood observed: \\"[Judge] Williamson's rulings before and during the trial meant Ellis' lawyer Rob Harrison was effectively hamstrung - the jury did not get to hear the most bizarre of the children's allegations, but did learn of the highly prejudicial but irrelevant conversations Ellis had about unusual sexual practices between consenting adults.\\" Lynley Hood, \\"A City Possessed,\\" Longacre Press, (2001), 672 Pages, cited in Christchurch New Zealand Ritual Abuse Cases Psychiatrist Karen Zelas was the prosecution's expert witness. She also supervised the social workers conducting the children's interviews and advised the police about how they should conduct their investigation.Peter Ellis the case for a Commission of inquiry, Ross Francis, September 2009 p.12. She testified that the complainants were credible and their behaviour was consistent with sexual abuse.Peter Ellis the case for a Commission of inquiry, Ross Francis, September 2009 p.6. However, in August 1992, she wrote to the police saying that two of the complainants had undergone \\"highly leading questioning\\" from their parents.Peter Ellis the case for a Commission of inquiry, Ross Francis, September 2009 p.4. Her letter was not disclosed to Ellis's defence, and Zelas did not mention any concerns about the two children's credibility at trial. Psychiatrist and defence expert Keith Le Page said that none of the behaviours described by Zelas were specific to sexual abuse.Peter Ellis the case for a Commission of inquiry, Ross Francis, September 2009 p.5. Le Page said that in his experience, children and adults who had been abused usually expressed distress when recounting their experiences of abuse. The complainants showed little or no distress when describing acts of abuse during their interviews and when later testifying in court. Le Page also testified that children couldn't remember events experienced at a very young age when there was a long delay between the event and the attempt to recall it. Children couldn't remember events, even traumatic events, that had occurred at two or three years of age when there was a long delay, he claimed. The alleged abuse at the creche had occurred when children were at these ages. = Conviction = In June 1993, Ellis was convicted of 16 counts of sexual offences involving seven children. The charges on which he was found guilty were that he had urinated on two children, made one masturbate him, put his penis in the mouths of three of them, engaged in indecent touching of three, and put his penis or an unknown associate's penis against the vagina or anus of three. The following year he was acquitted of three charges involving the oldest complainant, who retracted her allegations and admitted her original statement was what her mother told her to say.Peter Ellis - his court appeal dies with him, Newsroom 2 August 2019 = Treatment in prison = Corrections officers who sat through the trial with Ellis did not think he was guilty and let that be known at Paparua prison. As a result, Ellis was not subject to the kind of beatings that perpetrators of childhood sexual abuse often suffer when sent to prison.Christchurch new Zealand ritual abuse cases  Creche closure  On 3 September 1992, following discussions between the City Council, the Ministry of Education and police, the Civic Creche was closed. In March 1995, the four female employees and six other former staff who had also lost their jobs were awarded $1 million by the Employment Court. This was later reduced to $170,000 by the Court of Appeal in September 1996.  Reliability concerns  = Moral panic = In the years preceding the first allegation of abuse against Ellis, there had been a number of high profile child abuse cases in Christchurch involving \\"highly suspect interviews of children\\", \\"mistaken mass diagnosis of children\\" and other \\"highly questionable claims\\". The case has also been linked with the day-care sex-abuse hysteria, a moral panic that originated out of California in 1982 and that existed throughout the 1980s. It has also been cited as a major cause in the decline in the number of male teachers in New Zealand schools. From September 1991 (two months before the first allegation against Ellis), there was \\"continuous publicity of sexual abuse and ritual abuse of children in the local press or in national media.\\" On 4 September 1991, a Wellington sex abuse counsellor, Anne-Marie Stapp, told the Christchurch daily, The Press, that \\"New Zealand was fast approaching the level of ritual abuse awareness found in the United States.\\" North and South Magazine reported that it was common knowledge around town that \\"various Christchurch police officers were hunting for a near mythical pornography- paedophile ring alleged to involve judges, Freemasons and prominent businessmen, though it was never found.\\" On 3 November 1991 the Sunday News quoted the police as saying that \\"Satanism was rampant in New Zealand and linked to child pornography.\\" Seventeen days later, a Christchurch mother rang Gaye Davidson, the supervisor at the Civic Creche to make the first complaint about Peter Ellis. When making his appeal to the Supreme Court announced in July 2019, Ellis' former lawyer, Nigel Hampton QC, said he wants the Supreme Court to take the moral panic of the '90s into account in its decision-making. As dying Peter Ellis appeals child sex rituals convictions again, court should consider 'moral panic' of the '90s, ex-lawyer says, OneNewsNow, 31 July 2019 = Interview process = At least 118 children were interviewed as part of the second investigation into allegations of sexual abuse. Social Welfare psychologist, Sue Sidey, conducted most of the evidential child interviews used at the trial, although she had no formal qualifications in child psychologyCritique of the Eichelbaum report and matters arising from the Ellis convictions, Jonathon Harper, January 2006 In December 1991, Sidey conducted a number of interviews with children which failed to turn up any statements consistent with abuse.Comments on the investigation and interviewing of children in the Ellis case, para 60 Nevertheless, that month, she made a statement that “Peter Ellis is not a suitable person for a child centre” - before any formal allegations of abuse came to light.Critique of the Eichelbaum report and matters arising from the Ellis convictions, Jonathon Harper, January 2006. p 31. However, as more parents became concerned, some children were subsequently interviewed up to six times and began making bizarre allegations. The children's stories \\"were hardly ever challenged, no matter how fanciful their answers. If the answers were inconsistent or incoherent, then they would be asked again in more elaborate form until an acceptable answer was elicited.\\"Time to revisit the lessons of the Civic Creche case, Stuff 27 July 2019 Specific questions were employed to elicit allegations that children had apparently made to their parents, contrary to best practice guidelines. The interviewers generally did not check with the children to find out whether their parents had said things to them about Peter Ellis or about the creche to eliminate the possibility of parental contamination. One mother even admitted in court that she encouraged her son to come up with new information by cuddling him, praising him and \\"telling him how brave he was after he revealed more and more details of his abuse\\".Civic Creche Case, Christchurch, IPT Journal Vol 5 1993 Michael Lamb, a leading authority on the interviewing of child abuse victims, was asked to review the interviewing process the children endured. In addition to the problems caused by multiple interviews, he noted that there were substantial delays between the alleged events and the formal interviews which were conducted up to 18 months later. Lamb wrote that during this time, the children were exposed to conversations with their parents, social workers and other children and \\"were likely to have adopted recently acquired information about the events in question.\\"New evidence in the Peter Ellis case Stephen J. Ceci, a psychologist at of Cornell University and an expert in children's suggestibility and children's courtroom testimony, also studied transcripts of many of the children's evidential interviews. In July 1995 he said the interviews \\"were not conducted in accordance with currently understood interviewing principles.\\" According to Ceci, it is impossible to distinguish between accurate and inaccurate allegations when children are suggestively and repeatedly interviewed over a long period. = Ellis' sexuality = A number of people who were involved in the case believed Ellis was convicted because he was homosexual and was the only male worker at the creche.Jarrod Gilbert: Peter Ellis martyr to deranged prejudice, NZ Herald 8 February 2018 At the trial, he was portrayed as sexually deviant and perverted, which was somehow consistent with the makeup of a child molester.The Christchurch Civic Creche case Steven Sliepen, August 26, 2003 = ACC involvement = One parent, Malcolm Cox, who had three children at the creche suggested that some parents may have been motivated to make claims that their child had been sexually abused because ACC automatically awarded $10,000 to anyone claiming to have been abused. He said that he and his wife were visited by a council social worker with ACC claim forms and told \\"we had to get in quick to claim the money because lump sums were being abolished\\". In the end, the Accident Compensation Corporation, ACC, paid more than $500,000 to about 40 parents of Civic Creche children. Generally parents received a standard $10,000, \\"but in cases where Ellis faced multiple charges relating to a single child, some parents claimed for each alleged incident of abuse\\" (McLoughlin, 1996). One child's parents allegedly claimed five payments, while another claimed four. According to North and South Magazine, \\"ACC didn't require a conviction before paying out. It paid up without so much as charges being laid in respect of some allegations. The police even wrote letters to ACC supporting compensation claims.\\" = Jury = A number of irregularities in the trial were publicised in a TV3 20/20 television programme which aired on 16 November 1997. The programme alleged that the jury foreman had been the celebrant at the wedding of the Crown Prosecutor Brent Stanaway 15 years earlier. It was also alleged that a female juror had had a sexual relationship with a co-worker of the mother of one of the children involved. The programme also put forward statements that most of the children who made allegations of sexual abuse withdrew their accusations at various times during proceedings but that social workers conducting the interviews treated this as a symptom of ‘denial’.Peter Ellis and the Christchurch Creche Case, COSA Newsletter, Volume 4 No 10. = Detective Colin Eade = The 20/20 programme also claimed the main investigating detective, Colin Eade, had a history of mental health problems. Eade told interviewer Melanie Reid he was \\"burnt out\\" before the case started and ‘beyond repair’ by the time it was over. He left the police force in 1994 suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder. In an interview with Sean Plunkett on Radio New Zealand’s Morning Report on 20 November, 1997, Eade admitted that after the trial he had sexual relationships with two of the mothers involved in the case and that he had propositioned another mother during the course of the investigation when he was drunk.Peter Ellis, Crime.co.nz New Zealand First MP Rana Waitai, who was a former police commander with 31 years’ experience, said \\"If half of what was on the (20/20) programme is true, Peter Ellis must immediately be released and hugely compensated for the devastation that has been done to his life.\\"Peter Ellis and the Christchurch Creche Case, COSA Newsletter, Volume 4 No 10. Appeals = First court of appeal 1994 = The case entered the Court of Appeal in July 1994 led by Graham Panckhurst QC. A key aspect of the appeal was that the seven children, whose evidence the jury accepted, had named 21 other victims – either as observers or participants. None of those 21 children confirmed any of the allegations.Civic Creche: Sexual abuse or abuse of justice? Stuff 2 August 2019 On the fourth day of the hearing (28 July), the oldest child on whose testimony Ellis was convicted, and probably the most credible of the child witnesses, told her parents that her story was not true, that she had said only what she thought her parents and the interviewer wanted to hear. The Court of Appeal considered that it was not uncommon for child complainants to withdraw their allegations. The appellate judges believed the retraction may have been a case of denial on the part of the child and was grounds to overturn only those convictions relating to that child. The child has continued to maintain that she fabricated her allegations. = Second court of appeal 1999 = In November 1998, Ellis presented a second petition to the Governor General seeking a Royal Commission on Inquiry into his case, and either a free pardon or for the whole case to be referred back to the Court of Appeal. The Secretary for Justice sought advice from Sir Thomas Thorp on the second petition. His advice concluded that the terms of reference should be expanded. In 1999 the Ellis case was referred to the Court of Appeal for a second time. Judith Ablett-Kerr, QC, appeared as counsel for Ellis, and Simon France for the Crown. Ablett-Kerr argued emphatically that the children's evidence had been contaminated by parental questioning and presented updated opinions on the dangers of multiple interviews, using anatomically correct dolls and suggestive questioning. Barry Parsonson, former head of the New Zealand Psychologists Board, was asked to write a report into the process used to interview the children prior to Ellis's second Court of Appeal hearings. Parsonson concluded that \\"given the conditions prevailing (at the time), the level of parental contamination, and the extremely suggestive interviewing procedures, the probability of the proportion of fact outweighing the proportion of fiction must be very, very small indeed.\\"Reference to the Court of Appeal page 1415 The Crown presented the expert opinion of Constance Dalenberg. The court concluded that they were not persuaded that a miscarriage of justice had occurred but suggested a Royal Commission of Inquiry could better examine some of the issues raised. Ellis immediately presented a third petition to the Governor General. = Petition for mercy = In 1999, a retired High Court judge, Sir Thomas Thorp, was commissioned by the Ministry of Justice to examine a petition for the royal prerogative of mercy lodged by Ellis's counsel, Judith Ablett-Kerr QC. She commissioned and supplied reports by experts that were based on selective information, for Thorp to consider. Despite the limitations of the reports, Thorp considered they raised serious concerns that should be investigated further. He wrote that the interview transcripts revealed that on more than one occasion, one child claimed to have seen serious abuse committed against another child, but the second child denied anything happened. Thorp said there was no evidence that the interviewers or the police or did any cross checking before presenting abuse allegations to the jury.The Thorp report, Para 4.2 He was also concerned that the more bizarre allegations made by children were not put before the jury, arguing that \\"the jury had to see that the children were capable of outrageous and fanciful allegation\\".The Thorp report, Para 4.4 Thorp stated that the central concerns were \\"the claims of defective interviewing techniques ... the risk of contamination of the childrens' evidence... (and) the exclusion of evidence necessary to a proper assessment of the childrens' reliability\\". He added that if the opinions of Barry Parsonson, Stephen Ceci and Justice Wood were found to have substantial support, it would \\"be difficult to argue against the existence of a serious doubt about the safety of the Petitioner's convictions.\\"The Thorp Report, Summary, Conclusions and recommendations, para 2 = Eichelbaum inquiry 2000 = In March 2000, then Minister of Justice Phil Goff established a ministerial inquiry into the conduct of the interviews, headed by Sir Thomas Eichelbaum. This was undertaken in response to Justice Thorp's report and ongoing concerns over the reliability of the children's evidence. In a later submission, Ministry officials stated that the Ministerial Inquiry was \\"intended to address specific areas of concern that might not have been seen to have been fully resolved by the Court of Appeal.\\" The terms of reference required Eichelbaum to examine the relevant documents and seek written submissions from those who were involved in the case but not to interview anyone.Eichelbaum's report, para 3.1 He was also required to appoint two international experts to provide written reviews of the interviewing techniques that had been used to seek information from the children. He appointed Professor Graham Davies of the University of Leicester and Dr Louise Sas, from London, Ontario, Canada.Eichelbaum report, p.25 In his evaluation, Graham Davies wrote he would not \\"pronounce on the reliability of individual children's accounts.\\"Eichelbaum report Appendix Professor of psychology at Auckland University, Michael Corballis, subsequently questioned the credentials of both these experts asking of Dr Sas, \\"Can she really be considered an expert?\\" Released in March 2001, Eichelbaum's inquiry concluded that the interviews were of good quality overall, and that though excessive questioning by some parents could have led to some contamination, this would not have been sufficient to affect the convictions. Eichelbaum did not say how he determined the children's evidence to be reliable. In December 2007 University of Otago psychologist Harlene Hayne conducted research which compared the standard of interviews conducted in the Ellis case with those of the Kelly Michaels case in the United States. Empirical analysis allowed Hayne to conclude that there was a \\"strong risk that the evidence of children who told of sexual abuse by Ellis was contaminated by the way the interviews were carried out,\\" and that, contrary to Eichelbaum's conclusions, \\"the standard of the questions in Ellis was not substantially better than those in Michaels.\\" Francis's articles and Hayne's research were cited in January 2008 by Ellis's counsel when making a renewed request that the Ministry of Justice establish a Royal Commission of Inquiry into the case, but Associate Justice Minister Rick Barker rejected this approach in March 2008. A further call for a Commission of Inquiry was made by former National MPs Katherine Rich and Don Brash and author Lynley Hood in November 2008, and the new Minister of Justice Simon Power said that the government would reconsider the issue. He later declined their request for an inquiry, on the grounds that Ellis still held the right of appeal to the Privy Council and an inquiry therefore could not achieve finality. = Petitions for a royal commission = In June 2003, two petitions called for a royal commission of inquiry into the case. The first, organised by then National Party leader Don Brash and MP Katherine Rich, had 140 highly prominent signatories. They included two former prime ministers (David Lange and Mike Moore), four former Cabinet ministers, 26 MPs, a retired High Court Judge (Laurence Greig), a retired District Court Judge, 12 law professors, 12 Queen's Counsel, former Auckland police chief Bryan Rowe, historian Michael King, psychology professors, professors from other disciplines, lawyers, child protection workers, psychologists, social workers, therapists and counsellors.New evidence in the Ellis case – II , Ross Francis, New Zealand Law Journal December 2007 In August 2005, Parliament's justice and electoral select committee reported on two petitions relating to the Ellis case. The committee had several concerns with the way the case was prosecuted. It recommended several changes, although it acknowledged that changes had already been made to the way that children were now interviewed. It also suggested that the testimony of expert prosecution witness Karen Zelas would not be permitted if it were proffered now. The committee noted that \\"The operation of the legal system in respect of this case did not inspire adequate public confidence in the operation of the legal system. A justice system should lead to certainty. In this case it seemed to increase the sense of uncertainty.\\" However, the committee rejected the petitioners' call for a commission of inquiry, concluding that it was not practical to hold such an inquiry. In 2011, Ellis announced his intention to lodge a fourth petition to the Governor General. = Supreme court 2019 = On 25 July 2019, Ellis, aged 61, lodged an appeal to the Supreme Court. However, by this time he had been diagnosed with terminal bladder cancer and was not expected to live. In August, the Supreme Court said it would consider hearing Ellis' appeal even if he died before the hearing date, 11 November.Possibility Peter Ellis' appeal could go ahead even if he dies, Stuff 12 August 2019 He died on 4 September, 2019 before the hearing began.Christchurch Civic Creche accused Peter Ellis dies while appealing conviction, Stuff 4 Sept 2019  Tikanga issues  Prior to this hearing which began on 14 November 2019, courts in Commonwealth countries, including New Zealand, have traditionally ruled that an individual's interest in any judicial hearing ends if they die. On Ellis' behalf, lawyer Robert Harrison said the appeal should proceed because it was an issue of public importance and addressed a systemic issue in the justice system. Peter Ellis Supreme Court hearing into Christchurch creche case begins today, NZ Herald 14 November 2019 Justice Joe Williams noted \\"this a very western idea that on demise you have nothing to protect\\" pointing out that tikanga Māori held that \\"an ancestor has even more reputation to protect\\". He adjourned the hearing for five weeks so that both sides could make new submissions addressing tikanga issues in the new year. Peter Ellis appeal derailed by legal curveball on possible tikanga Māori approach Stuff 15 November 2019 Prominent support = Lynley Hood's A City Possessed = In 2001 Lynley Hood published a 616 page book about the case and the moral panic of sexual abuse within New Zealand at that time. In 2002 A City Possessed won the top prize for non- fiction and for readers' choice in the New Zealand Book Awards. As Hood tells it, fear and anxiety about ritual abuse began in childcare facilities overseas in the early 1980s. Given the number of sex abuse scenarios in Christchurch in the 1980s such as \\"the Glenelg Health Camp, Ward 24, and the Great Child Pornography fiascos – it was probable that some sort of panic would break out in Christchurch.\\"The Christchurch Crucible, Greg Newbold, New Zealand review of A City Possessed, 1 December 2000. Hood argued that the professional careers of experts benefited from the case while more than 100 children were subjected to unpleasant, repetitive and psychologically dangerous procedures for no good reason. A former National Party leader, Don Brash, was drawn to the controversy after reading Hood’s book. He commented: “I was stunned at how compelling a case it made. The Peter Ellis case is a serious miscarriage of justice and I am utterly astonished [his conviction] hasn’t been overturned. It is implausible to believe four women and one man could do this in a busy creche.”Why the Peter Ellis Civic Creche case won't go away, Noted, 29 July 2019 In 2006, Brash cited the case when supporting calls for an independent body investigating miscarriages of justice in New Zealand.Brash said, \\"It is cases like the Peter Ellis case that highlight the need for an independent body with the resources and authority to investigate possible miscarriages of justice.\\" On 17 December 2014, Brash and author Lynley Hood again called for a review of the case by way of an independent inquiry led by an authority from outside New Zealand. The appeal was made to Amy Adams, the newly appointed Minister of Justice for the National Party-led government returned in the 2014 General Election. = Journalists = According to Greg Newbold, senior lecturer in sociology at the University of Canterbury, even cynical journalists like Frank Haden, David McLoughlin, Melanie Reid, George Balani, and Martin van Beynen – the only journalist to have sat right through the trial – agree that Ellis is not guilty. Newbold notes that \\"it was a politician who saved Arthur Allan Thomas, but the Ellis case is different from Thomas’s, because Ellis lacks government support.\\" In 2000 (after Ellis' failed appeals) he wrote: \\"at the moment the judiciary is turning away from the plight of a man impugned by some of the most absurd testimony ever heard in a New Zealand court.\\" = New Zealand Law Journal = In late 2007 and January 2008, three articles on the Ellis case were published in The New Zealand Law Journal. These included \\"New Evidence in the Peter Ellis Case\\" by researcher Ross Francis. Francis concluded that despite two appeal hearings, three applications for a pardon, a ministerial inquiry, and a parliamentary inquiry, questions about the reliability of Ellis' convictions remain. He wrote: \\"Whilst it may appear that the case has been examined thoroughly, the facts show otherwise. The Court of Appeal did not review all the available evidence and, at the second hearing, failed to give any weight to the expert opinions.\\"New evidence in the Peter Ellis case, New Zealand Law Journal, November 2007. The journal review prompted Sir Thomas Thorp to comment that the articles \\"must add to concerns expressed previously that that case may have gone awry\\".

In medieval times the area had a profitable wool trade.A brief history of the parish The villages =Chalvington= The village of Chalvington (Charnton in the traditional Sussex dialect) is named Calvintone or Caveltone in the Domesday Book. It is located in the area between the A27 and the A22 roads, some 15 miles (24 km) north-west of Eastbourne. The name Chalvington, comes from the Saxon Caelfa's farm, and many local names derive from their occupation of the area. There is one public house in the village, the Yew Tree Inn. The parish church is dedicated to St Bartholomew.St Bartholomew's church =Ripe= Ripe is a village within the Wealden District of East Sussex, England. It is located eight miles (13 km) east of Lewes in the valley north of the South Downs. The two villages are adjacent to one another, Ripe ecclesiastical parish being the larger of the two in area. There is limited public transport to the village. The village, in a mainly rural area, is mentioned in the Domesday Book and has had a number of names, including Alchitone, Achiltone, Achintone, Echentone and Eckington. The 13th-century parish church is dedicated to St John the Baptist.Photographs of Ripe church There is limited public transport to the village. At the end of the Anglo-Saxon period it was owned by Earl Harold Godwinson, who become King Harold II and was killed at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. The Domesday Book mentions 'Rype' and 'Echentone' which were owned by Richer de Aquila (L'Aigle), and the church is also mentioned in the 1291 Pope Nicholas IV Taxatio ecclesiastical tax assessment survey. The novelist Malcolm Lowry, best known for Under the Volcano, died at age 47 in a boarding house in Ripe on 27 June 1957. Lowry is buried in the village churchyard.

Individuals with agrammatism present with speech that is characterized by containing mainly content words, with a lack of function words. For example, when asked to describe a picture of children playing in the park, the affected individual responds with, \\"trees..children..run.\\"Treatment Resource Manual for Speech- Language Pathology 5th Edition People with agrammatism may have telegraphic speech, a unique speech pattern with simplified formation of sentences (in which many or all function words are omitted), akin to that found in telegraph messages. Deficits in agrammaticism are often language-specific, however--in other words, \\"agrammaticism\\" in speakers of one language may present differently from in speakers of another. Errors made in agrammatism depend on the severity of aphasia. In severe forms language production is severely telegraphic and in more mild to moderate cases necessary elements for sentence construction are missing. Common errors include errors in tense, number, and gender. Patients also find it very hard to produce sentences involving \\"movement\\" of elements, such as passive sentences, wh-questions or complex sentences. Agrammatism is seen in many brain disease syndromes, including expressive aphasia and traumatic brain injury.  History  Agrammatism was first coined by Adolf Kussmaul in 1887 to explain the inability to form words grammatically and to syntactically order them into a sentence. Later on, Harold Goodglass defined the term as the omission of connective words, auxiliaries and inflectional morphemes, all of these generating a speech production with extremely rudimentary grammar. Agrammatism, today seen as a symptom of the Broca's syndrome (Tesak & Code, 2008), has been also referred as 'motor aphasia' (Goldstein, 1948), 'syntactic aphasia' (Wepman & Jones, 1964), 'efferent motor aphasia' (Luria, 1970), and 'non-fluent aphasia' (Goodglass et al., 1964). The early accounts of agrammatism involved cases of German and French participants. The greater sophistication of the German school of aphasiology at the turn of the 20th century and also the fact that both German and French are highly inflected languages, might have been triggers for that situation (Code, 1991). Nowadays, the image has slightly changed: grammatical impairment has been found to be selective rather than complete, and a cross-linguistic perspective under the framework of Universal Grammar (UG) together with a shift from morphosyntax to morphosemantics is à la page. Now the focus of study in agrammatism embraces all natural languages and the idiosyncrasies scholars think a specific language has are put in relation to other languages so as to better understand agrammatism, help its treatment, and review and advance in the field of theoretical linguistics. There is little written about agrammatism in Catalan. The beginnings of the field should be encountered in the work of Peña-Casanova & Bagunyà-Durich (1998), and Junque et al. (1989). These papers do not describe case reports, they are rather dealing with more general topics such as lesion localization or rehabilitation of agrammatic patients. The most updated studies could be found in the work of Martínez-Ferreiro (2009). The work of Martínez-Ferreiro is under the so-called Tree Pruning Hypothesis (TPH) of Friedmann & Grodzinsky (2007). Such a hypothesis is somewhat lagging behind after the findings in Bastiaanse (2008) have been proved by means of a re-analysis of data from Nanousi et al. (2006) and Lee et al. (2008), and the work of Yarbay Duman & Bastiaanse (2009). Other rather updated work for agrammatism in Catalan should be found in Martínez-Ferreiro et Gavarró (2007), in Gavarró (2008, 2003a, 2003b, 2002), Balaguer et al. (2004), in Peña-Casanova et al. (2001), and in Sánchez-Casas (2001). From a cross-linguistic perspective under the framework of Universal Grammar (UG), grammatical impairment in agrammatism has been found to be selective rather than complete. Under this line of thought, the impairment in tense production for agrammatic speakers is currently being approached in different natural languages by means of the study of verb inflection for tense in contrast to agreement (a morphosyntactic approach) and also, more recently, by means of the study of time reference (which, in a sense, should be seen closer to morphosemantics). The type of studies this paper should be related with are those dealing with tense impairment under the framework of time reference. Prior to explaining that, to help understand the goals of such research, it is good to give a taste of the shift from morphosyntax to morphosemantics the study of agrammatism is undergoing. = Verb Inflection = Verb inflection for tense has been found to be problematic in several languages. Different scholars have come up with different theories to explain it: Friedman & Grodzinsky (1997) introduced the so-called Tree Pruning Hypothesis (TPH) from the study of Hebrew, Arabic, and English; the same hypothesis has been proved by Gavarró & Martínez-Ferreiro (2007) for what they called Ibero-Romance (that is, Catalan, Galician, and Castilian); Wenzlaff & Clahsen (2004; 2005) introduced the Tense Underespecification Hypothesis (TUH) for German, and by the same time Bruchert et al. (2005) introduced the Tense and Agreement Underespecification Hypothesis (TAUH) for the same language; and Lee et al. (2008), and Faroqi-Shah & Dickey (2009) introduced a morphosemantic hypothesis, arguing that the diacritic tense features are affected in English agrammatism. Bastiaanse (2008) did not find such dissociation for Dutch but rather that reference to the past is more impaired regardless of verb inflection or agreement. Her research found that finite verbs are more difficult than non-finite verbs, but both within the finite verbs and within the nonfinite verbs, the forms referring to the past (third person singular past tense and participle respectively) are more difficult than their counterparts referring to the present (third person singular present tense and infinitives). None of the hypotheses on verb forms aforementioned (TPH, TUH, and TAUH) can account for these results, ever since participles in Dutch are not inflected for tense and agreement nor do they check their features in the left periphery. Similar findings have been also reported for Greek and for English respectively in a re-analysis of Nanousi et al.'s (2006) and Lee et al.'s (2008) data, and also for Turkish in Yarbay, Duman & Bastiaanse (2009). In any case, the conclusion of Bastiaanse (2008) was that an additional hypothesis expressing that agrammatic speakers have difficulty making reference to the past was needed. In that same paper she unveiled two possible answers: (a) it could be that representations of events in the past are semantically more complex, possibly because there are two time periods of relevance. (b) It might also be the case that it is not so much reference to the past as such that is difficult for agrammatic speakers, but to express this reference by verb inflection. Probably Bastiaanse et al. (subm.) hold the key. In their study, one reads that both tense and aspect are impaired and, most importantly, that reference to the past is selectively impaired both through simple verb forms (such as simple present in English) and through periphrastic verb forms (such as the present perfect in English). Bastiaanse et al. (subm.) argued that reference to the past is discourse linked and reference to the present and future is not. This is in line with Avrutin (2000) who suggests discourse linking is impaired in Broca’s aphasia. The notion of discourse linking is originally due to Pesetsky (1987) and should be seen in regard to discourse presupposition which is a basic notion in linguistics and, more concretely, in semantics and pragmatics (for further information: Stalnaker, 1973). To the extent it involves language, discourse linking should be seen in contrast to a local (i.e., internal) binding relation. A clear example of a local binding relation can be found in a sentence like 'The boy is washing himself', in which the pronoun 'himself' refers to 'the boy' within the same sentence. An example of discourse linking is found in a sentence like 'The boy is washing him', in which the pronoun 'him' refers to someone not mentioned in the sentence (in technical terms, the identity of its antecedent is \\"extra-sentential information\\") and, therefore, access to previously provided information is a prerequisite for understanding of the pronoun's meaning. Similar examples of such relations can be found in which-questions and, with relevance to this study, in tense and agreement. Avrutin (2000) argued that agreement is a purely morphosyntactic system, with no discourse operations involved and, therefore, it establishes a binding relation whereas tense requires access to the discourse representation and, therefore, it establishes a discourse linking relation. Zagona (2003) reasoned that present tense indicates simultaneity between evaluation time and event time (binding relation). Past tense, on the other hand, lacks this simultaneity and indicates a need for establishing a relation between speech time and an earlier event (discourse linking). Although Bastiaanse's et al. (subm.) conclusions are not as broad as Avruitin's (2000) and do not strictly look at tense but at time reference, they are supported by several findings: Bastiaanse et al., (2009) and Faroqi-Shah & Dickey (2009) found more problems with verb forms and aspectual adverbs referring to the past in agrammatic aphasic individuals; Jonkers et al., (2007) and Faroqi-Shah & Dickey (2009) reflected longer RTs in non-brain-damaged individuals; and Dragoy et al. (in preparation) are about to present an ERP and an RT experiment of tense violations in Dutch where they have found higher error rates and longer reaction times for the violations by a past tense verb in contrast with present tense. Bastiaanse et al. (subm.), formulated the PAst DIscourse LInking Hypothesis (PADILIH) with the aim of testing three predictions: (1) selective impairment of grammatical morphology is used for reference to the past, while reference to the present and future are relatively spared (2) this impairment is language–independent; (3) this impairment will occur in both production and comprehension. In order to do so, their research puts into practice the Test for Assessing Reference of Time (TART; Bastiaanse et al., unpublished) in Chinese, English and Turkish agrammatic speakers. The results demonstrate that both English and Turkish agrammatic speakers show the hypothesized selective deficit for reference to the past, despite the great typological difference between the languages. The Chinese agrammatic speakers are poor in producing reference to the past as well by producing grammatical morphology, but reference to the present and future are also severely affected. The results on the subtest for comprehension are strikingly similar for the three languages: reference to the past is impaired. These results confirm the PADILIH: reference to the past is discourse linked and, therefore, grammatical morphology used for reference to the past is impaired in agrammatic aphasia, whether this is done through tense and / or aspect markers.

In April 1930 Coxen was promoted to the position of Chief of the General Staff. He retired in 1931. Early life and career Walter Adams Coxen was born at Egham, England, on 22 June 1870. Coxen and his family moved to Australia in 1880. Walter was educated at Brisbane Grammar School and Toowoomba Grammar School. He took a job with the Queensland Department of Railways as a clerk and draftsman on 18 August 1887, but was retrenched in 1892 due to the depression of the 1890s. In 1893 Coxen was commissioned into the Queensland Militia Garrison Artillery as a second lieutenant. In June 1895 he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in the Permanent Military Forces, in the Queensland Artillery. In 1897 he was sent to England to study at the Royal School of Gunnery at Shoeburyness, concentrating on coast defence and siege artillery, and then went to Aldershot for training with the Royal Artillery in 1898. On returning to Australia in 1899 he was appointed commander of the garrison on Thursday Island, with the rank of captain. In July 1902 he succeeded Major William Bridges as Chief Instructor at the School of Gunnery at Middle Head. In November 1907, Coxen again went to England for ordnance training at the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich. He was promoted to major in 1908, and returned to Australia in February 1910. Coxen served briefly with the coast artillery at Fort Queenscliff before becoming Inspector of Ordnance and Ammunition at Army Headquarters in Melbourne. In January 1911 he became Director of Artillery. On 14 August 1914, Coxen also became Inspector of Coast Defences with the rank of lieutenant colonel. First World War Group portrait of Siege Artillery Brigade officers (SAB), 1914, Melbourne. Commanding Officer LtCol Coxen seated front row centre. On 21 May 1915 Coxen was ordered to raise the brigade of siege artillery (SAB) for service in Europe. The brigade was to consist of two batteries, with eight siege guns to be supplied by Britain and 415 officers and other ranks, about half of whom would be permanent force artillery gunners. The brigade, which became known as the 36th Heavy Artillery Group (36 HAG), departed Melbourne on 17 July 1915 and landed in England on 25 August 1915. After a delay due to a short supply of heavy artillery pieces, the 54th Siege Battery was equipped with 8 inch howitzers and the 55th Siege Battery with 9.2 inch howitzers. The batteries moved to France on 26 February and 2 March 1916 respectively. The 36th Heavy Artillery Group began operations in support of the British XVII Corps in the Arras sector before moving south to join the British Fourth Army for the Battle of the Somme. The Group then joined I Anzac Corps Artillery at Pozières and took part in the Battle of Pozières in support of the Australian infantry. For his services, Coxen was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in the 1917 New Year Honours. On 18 January 1917, Coxen replaced Brigadier General Talbot Hobbs as commander of the 1st Division Artillery. On his appointment to the 1st Division, Coxen was promoted to brigadier general. He served in that capacity through the German withdrawal to the Hindenburg Line, the Battle of Bullecourt and the Third Battle of Ypres. On 18 October 1917, Coxen took over as commander of the Australian Corps Artillery and was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 1918 New Year's Honours. On 16 November 1918, Coxen became Director of Ordnance in the AIF's Department of Repatriation in London. He returned to Australia in August 1919 and became Chief of Ordnance, and a member of the Military Board. In the 1919 New Year's Honours, Coxen was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB). Post war In January 1920 he was promoted to full colonel. He became Deputy Quartermaster General in April 1920, Chief of Artillery in May 1921 and Quartermaster General in 1925. In March 1927 he was promoted to major general and finally became Chief of the General Staff in April 1930. Due to a new government policy on retirements, he was retired on 1 October 1931. In retirement he was director of the council for Victoria's centenary celebrations in 1934. Coxen died at the Repatriation General Hospital, Heidelberg on 15 December 1949 and was cremated with full military honours.

Her husband was Emperor Wen (Liu Yilong). Yuan Qigui was the daughter of the official Yuan Dan (袁湛) and his concubine, Concubine Wang, but her mother was of such low status that Yuan Dan did not let others know of Yuan Qigui's existence until she was four or five. She married Liu Yilong when he was still the Prince of Yidu, and she bore him his oldest son Liu Shao and a daughter, Liu Ying'e (劉英娥), later the Princess Dongyang. After key imperial officials concluded that his brother Emperor Shao was unfit to be emperor, they deposed and killed Emperor Shao in 424 and offered the throne to Liu Yilong. Liu Yilong accepted, and took the throne as Emperor Wen. Later that year, he created her empress. It was around this time, either right before or right after Emperor Wen became emperor, that Empress Yuan bore him Liu Shao. According to traditional histories, when she observed her son's face, she remarked that this child would bring disaster on the house, and was ready to kill her child. Emperor Wen, hearing this, rushed to her bedchambers and forced her to spare the child. (Some later historians, including Bo Yang, doubted this account.) However, because he was still within the three-year mourning period for his father Emperor Wu and supposed to abstain from sexual relations, he hid Liu Shao's birth from the public and only announced it in 426. Emperor Wen initially favored Empress Yuan greatly. Because the Yuan clan was a poor one, she often requested him to give her money so that she could give them to her clan. Emperor Wen, known as a thrifty man, refused to give her much. Later on, he began to favor Consort Pan greater than her, and she, in order to test Emperor Wen's affection for her, asked Consort Pan to request an amount of money six to 10 times greater than what Emperor Wen had been giving her. Emperor Wen approved Consort Pan's request, and from this point on Empress Yuan was filled with anger. Whenever Emperor Wen wished to see her, she would try to hide from him, and she also refused to see her stepchildren. She grew ill in her anger, and in 440 she grew very ill. Emperor Wen went in to see her and, crying, held her hands to ask what request she had. She looked at him for a long time and then, without saying anything, covered her face with a blanket and refused to look at him again. She soon died. Emperor Wen mourned her greatly, and had the talented writer Yan Yanzhi (顏延之) write a beautiful ode dedicated to her.

Hilder (23 July 1881 – 10 April 1916), also known as Jesse Jewhurst Hilder, was an Australian watercolourist. Early life Hilder was born in Toowoomba, Queensland, Australia, the fourth son and eighth child of Henry Hilder, an engineer originally from Sussex. Hilder attended Toowoomba North State School until 1890 when his family moved to Brisbane where he continued his education at Fortitude Valley State School. Winning a scholarship when 13 years of age, Hilder spent three years at the Brisbane Grammar School and passed the junior public examination in 1897. In 1898 Hilder joined the Brisbane branch of the Bank of New South Wales. In 1901 he was transferred to Goulburn, and the following year to Bega, on the south coast of New South Wales, where he joined some friends in weekend sketching. Later on he was to receive £1 for one of these sketches, his first sale. Suffering increasing ill-health he moved on a number of occasions. Hilder was transferred to a Sydney suburb, but the sea air did not suit him; he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. During the next five years he had to obtain leave of absence from the bank several times. Career In 1906 Hilder asked Julian Ashton for advice about his art work and received encouragement he undertook classes at the Ashton's art school and had practice in drawing which he realized was his weak point. Towards the end of 1906 Hilder went to a sanatorium in Queensland for four months, but came back little improved in health. At his own request he was transferred to a branch west of the mountains in April 1907. In August 1907 he sent 21 watercolours to an exhibition of the Society of Artists, Sydney. They were priced very low, from three to five guineas, and 19 were sold. These works created a sensation among the artists and critics. Hilder's health continued to be very bad and he kept moving about seeking vainly for improvement. He was able to do some painting, and at the spring exhibition of the Society of Artists his 14 watercolours were all sold. Early in 1909 Hilder was married to Phyllis Meadmore, a probationer nurse. He had told her frankly about the state of his health but it was decided to take the risk. Later that same year Hilder the Bank of New South Wales accepted his resignation, and paid him nine months' leaving salary. He was grateful to his employers for the consideration he had received during his many years of ill-health. A cottage was taken at Epping in the hills a few miles from Sydney, and during the next two years Hilder and his wife went through many anxieties. His sales were uncertain and his prices were low. Increasingly focused on his artwork, Hilder began to find more patronage and sales, and exhibited in Melbourne in 1914. Despite continued ill-health he painted throughout the remaining two years of his life, dying on 10 April 1916, at Hornsby, New South Wales, Australia. His elder son was sculptor Bim Hilder. His younger son was artist and author Brett Hilder, although Brett is better known as a Master Mariner. Legacy Hilder was modest, shy and affected by illness; this sometimes led to estrangement from his best friends. He was fortunate in his wife, in the admiration of his fellow artists, and in finding early buyers of his paintings. He was very critical of his own work and tore up much of it; sometimes the final result was the third or fourth effort to capture the subject. He was not afraid of empty spaces and everything in the drawing was beautifully placed. His colour was always excellent, though some of his later work is painted almost in monochrome washed in on very rough paper. The treatment generally is broad, yet full of refinement and poetical feeling. The best collection of his work will be found at the national gallery at Sydney. He is also represented at the Melbourne, Adelaide and other galleries. The Ewing collection at the University of Melbourne has a good example, \\"The Island Trader\\". Ure Smith published a tribute, J. J. Hilder: Watercolourist (1916), with proceeds going to Hilder's widow. Publications *J. J. (Jesse Jewhurst) Hilder, J.J.

Schor, 478 U.S. 833 (1986), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held an administrative agency may, in some cases, exert jurisdiction over state-law counterclaims.Commodity Futures Trading Comm'n v. Schor, . Background The Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), et seq., prohibits fraudulent conduct in the trading of futures contracts. In 1974, Congress amended the Act to create a more comprehensive regulatory framework for the trading of future contracts. To that end, Congress created an administrative agency called the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). One of the duties assigned to the CFTC was the administration of a quasi-judicial reparations procedure by which customers of commodities brokers could seek legal redress for brokers’ alleged violations of the Act or other CFTC regulations. One of the CFTC's regulations also provided the agency to adjudicate counterclaims “arising out of the same transaction or occurrence or series of transactions or occurrences set forth in the complaint”. The section of the statute and the CFTC regulation at issue in this case, both of which were intended to provide an inexpensive and expeditious method for the settlement of futures contract-related claims, were challenged by the customers of a broker as being violative of Article III of the United States Constitution. Facts & procedural history In February 1980, respondents Schor and Mortgage Services of America, Inc. filed complaints with the CFTC against brokerage firm ContiCommodity Services, Inc. (Conti) and Richard L. Sandor, one of the firm's employees, alleging violations of the CEA. Meanwhile, Conti filed an action under diversity jurisdiction in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois to recover the debit balance in Schor's account. Schor filed a counterclaim in the federal suit, asserting the same charges against Conti it had made in its complaint to the CFTC. Schor moved to dismiss the district court action, but the judge declined. Conti then voluntarily dismissed the suit, in order to present its counterclaim against Schor for the debit balance as a defense in the CFTC action. The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) in the CFTC reparations proceeding ruled in Conti's favor on both claims, and it was at that point Schor challenged the CFTC's jurisdiction to hear Conti's counterclaim against him. The ALJ rejected this contention, and the CFTC declined to review the decision. Schor then petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for review. The Court of Appeals held that the CFTC had jurisdiction over Schor's claim against Conti, but not over Conti's state-law based counterclaim against Schor for the debit balance, seeking to avoid the constitutional problems faced in Northern Pipeline Construction Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co.. The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case back to the Court of Appeals for further consideration under Thomas v. Union Carbide Agricultural Products Co.. The Court of Appeals reinstated its previous judgment, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari again. Majority opinion Justice O’Connor, joined by Chief Justice Burger and Justices White, Blackmun, Powell, Rehnquist and Stevens, authored the opinion of the Court, addressing the statutory interpretation issue first. She held that the D.C. Circuit created a false distinction between the CFTC's jurisdiction over state law counterclaims and counterclaims arising under the CEA, simply to avoid a constitutional problem, and ignored the legislative intent of Congress in doing so. The situation faced by the litigants here was common: a claim and counterclaim arising out of the same transaction and occurrence, and it was well within the statutory jurisdiction of the CFTC to adjudicate such both actions. This is in keeping with Congress’ intent to create a more efficient means of adjudicating such disputes, as well as the administration's interpretation of the statute. She then turned to the Article III issue. Justice O’Connor chose to interpret Article III liberally, examining the underlying purposes of adjudication of cases by an independent judiciary. The right to be heard by an Article III tribunal is not absolute, and is subject to waiver by the parties. In this case, Schor waived his right to a trial with respect to Conti's counterclaim, and elected to have the entire dispute resolved before the CFTC. It was only after the CFTC ruled against him that he challenged the agency's jurisdiction. To Justice O’Connor, Schor's actions constituted an express waiver of his right to a civil trial. Additionally, Justice O’Connor held that Congress’ grant of judicial power to the CFTC for the adjudication of state-law counterclaims did not intrude on the powers of the judiciary. She concluded that while Congress could not vest administrative agencies with ancillary or pendent jurisdiction of all claims, it was not outright forbidden for Congress to vest an agency with such jurisdiction over some claims. Unlike the situation in Northern Pipeline, not only were the CFTC's orders reviewable in the U.S. district courts, the CFTC was not granted the full powers of an Article III court, and the parties were given the option of invoking the agency's jurisdiction, rather than being compelled to use it. Furthermore, any issue of intrusion upon the powers of state courts was irrelevant, Justice O’Connor reasoned, because federal courts may exercise ancillary jurisdiction over state law claims anyway. Dissent Justice Brennan, joined by Justice Marshall, dissented on the grounds that allowing Congress to grant such jurisdictional powers to administrative agencies eroded the powers of Article III courts, and deprived litigants of the impartial decision-making authority of an independent judiciary. He accused the majority of putting concerns of convenience and judicial economy ahead of separation of powers. Also, because the individual and structural/separation of powers issues served by Article III were “coextensive”, Brennan reasoned that the consent of the litigants to appear before a non-Article III tribunal should have no bearing on the legal analysis in this case.Schor, 478 U.S. at 867 (Brennan, J., dissenting).

The work consisted of an existing woodshed and earth added by the artist in order to illustrate the concept of entropy. By 2018, only a large mound of dirt and the structure's concrete foundation remain. The remaining elements, along with an informational plaque, are located in a small wooded area immediately behind the Liquid Crystal Institute building on the Kent State University main campus, in the southeastern area of Kent.  History  Plaque marking the site of the Partially Buried Woodshed In January 1970 Robert Smithson visited Kent State University as part of the School of Art Creative Arts Festival. Initially, he had planned to do a mudflow sculpture, but cold temperatures prevented him from being able to dig the dirt needed for the project. Instead, he created Partially Buried Woodshed using an old woodshed from a former farm on the eastern edge of campus that had recently been acquired by the school. Smithson rented a backhoe and transported 20 truck loads of dirt onto the right side of the woodshed until the center beam cracked, marking the beginning of the structure’s decline. He valued the work at $10,000 and donated it to the university, asking that no changes be made and that the structure be allowed to deteriorate naturally. Shortly after the May 4, 1970, Kent State shootings, an anonymous person added the inscription 'MAY 4 KENT 70' with white paint to one of the structure's horizontal beams. The addition of the message about May 4, 1970 helped make the Partially Buried Woodshed one of the many memorial sites on campus. The work was set on fire by an unknown arsonist on March 28, 1975, burning much of the left side and causing the structure's major collapse. The University Arts Commission recommended in April that the roof and burned portion be removed—mostly citing safety concerns—with the remaining walls, earthen mound, and rafters allowed to continue the natural aging process. By late April, the university had much of the damaged section removed and planned to landscape the area around the sculpture as a park. Smithson's widow, Nancy Holt, visited the work on May 3, 1975, and called for its preservation. A committee recommended in June 1975 that the entire sculpture be removed, citing liability concerns, though university president Glenn Olds ultimately decided to keep the remains of the sculpture in 1976. Sometime in mid-1981, the center beam fully broke, and in January 1984, the remaining wooden elements of the structure were quietly removed by the university. While the School of Art hosted exhibits in 1990 for the 20th anniversary of the work's creation, and again in 2005 for the 35th anniversary, the location of the artwork was largely ignored until Kent State University added an informational plaque to a sidewalk near the site in 2016.

From 1992 to 1999 the aquarium hosted a family of dolphins enclosed in a sea pen, which later died due to poisoning. Stingray in the main tank Exhibits The aquarium specializes in marine animals that inhabit the long coastline of Western Australia. In total AQWA holds over of water and is home to approximately 400 species of marine life, including more than 4,000 fish. AQWA is themed as an underwater journey along W.A.'s coastline and is broken up into 5 distinct areas. Each area represents the unique marine life and environments of different regions along W.A.'s coast. These include: The Great Southern, the Shipwreck Coast, the Perth Coast, the Far North and Marmion Marine Park. The main Shipwreck Coast aquarium is long and wide and holds of seawater. It incorporates a underwater acrylic tunnel, the largest in Australia. This exhibit contains grey nurse shark, smooth stingrays, large loggerhead turtles and over 70 other species of rays, octopuses, sharks and fish.

ALCOR (ALGOL Converter, acronym) is an early computer language definition created by the ALCOR Group, a consortium of universities, research institutions and manufacturers in Europe and the United States which was founded in 1959 and which had 60 members in 1966. The group had the aim of a common compiler specification for a subset of ALGOL 60 after the ALGOL meeting in Copenhagen in 1958. In addition to its programming application, as the name Algol is also an astronomical reference, to the star Algol, so too, Alcor is a reference to the star Alcor. This star is the fainter companion of the 2nd magnitude star Zeta Ursae Majoris. This was sometimes ironized as being a bad omen for the future of the language. In Europe, a high level machine architecture for ALGOL 60 was devised which was emulated on various real computers, among them the Siemens 2002 and the IBM 7090. An ALGOL manual was published which provided a detailed introduction of all features of the language with many program snippets, and four appendixes: # Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language ALGOL 60 # Report on Subset ALGOL 60 (IFIP) # Report on Input-Output Procedures for ALGOL 60 # An early \\"standard\\" character set for representing ALGOL 60 code on paper and paper tape.

Menon and Prema Menon.https://english.manoramaonline.com/entertainment/entertainment- news/2020/05/09/actress-shobha-filmy-life-story-still-remain-endearing.html Her mother was an actress in the Malayalam film industry during the 1950s. Career In 1966, Shoba made her screen debut in Tamil Thriller film Thattungal Thirakkappadum directed by actor J. P. Chandrababu. In the film she was credited as Baby Mahalakshmi where she played the role of Lakshmi opposite actress Savitri, K. R. Vijaya, R. S. Manohar and Chandrababu himself. The following year she made her debut in Malayalam cinema through Udhyogastha by P. Venu where she was named as Baby Shoba. Touted as the first \\"multi- starrer\\", with five top actors, in Malayalam cinema, the film had Sathyan, Prem Nazir, K. P. Ummer, Padmini, Sharada, Sheela and Rajasree in the lead along with Shobha. The film was a big hit and gained Shoba recognition as a child actor in South Indian cinema. In 1978 she was cast as a heroine in Uthrada Rathri, a film directed by Balachandra Menon. She received the Kerala government's Best Actress award for the 1978 films Bandhanam and Ente Neelakaasham. The same year she earned the Best Actress award by Filmfare for the Kannada-language film Aparichita. In 1979 she was recipient of the National Award for Best Actress for the Tamil film Pasi, which was produced by Lalitha, the eldest of the Travancore sisters. She also received the Filmfare Best Actress award for Pasi and received the Second Best Actress award from the Kerala government in 1977 for the film Ormakal Marikkumo. Death Shobha committed suicide at the age of 17. She was married to Balu Mahendra. In an interview to Anu Haasan in Koffee with Anu, Balu Mahendra has said that the tragedy of how Shoba was suddenly snatched away from his life by destiny, as quickly as she came, formed the plot for his next movie Moondram Pirai. The 1983 Malayalam film Lekhayude Maranam Oru Flashback directed by K. G. George is loosely based on her life and death.http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/kannada/movies/news/Balu- Mahendra-passes-away/articleshow/30334092.cms Filmography =Malayalam films= * Jeevithayaathra (1965) * Karuna (1966) * Penmakkal (1966) * Ollathu Mathi (1967) * Pareeksha (1967) * Kadal (1968) * Adyapika (1968) * Aparadhini (1968) * Kuruthikkalam (1969) * Vettamrigam (1969) * Udhyogastha (1967) – child artist * Aval Alpam Vaikipoyi (1971) * Yogammullaval (1971) * Sindooracheppu (1971) – Ammalu * Makane Ninakku Vendi (1971) – Young Sophia * Taxi Car (1972) * Gandharavakshetram (1972) – Young Lakshmi * Aradimanninte Janmi (1972) – Minikutty * Udayam (1973) – Young Geetha * Badradeepam (1973) – Lekha * Ayalathe Sundari (1974) – Shobha * Night Duty (1974) – Ammini * Ayodhya (1975) – Shanthi * Chottanikkara Amma (1976) * Amruthavahini (1976) – Rani * Dweep (1977) * Ormakal Marikkumo (1977) – Ammini/Parvathi * Nurayum Pathayum (1977) * Rajaparambara (1977) * Pad–aram (1978) – Shoba * Randu Penkuttikal (1978) * Wayanadan Thampan (1978) * Utradaraatri (1978) * Ulkkadal (1978) * Ekakini (1978) * Bandhanam (1978) * Lillyppookkal (1979) * Ishta Praneshwari (1979) * Ente Neelakasham (1979) * Shalini Ente Koottukaari (1980) * Daliapookkal (1980) * Aniyatha Valakal (1980) * Soorya Daham (1980) * Yovvanam Daham (1980) * Manju Moodal Manju (1980) =Tamil films= * Naanal (1965) – child artist * Thattungal Thirakkappadum (1966) – child artist * Iru Kodugal (1969) – child artist * Punnagai (1971) * Vairam (1974) * Achchani (1978) * Nizhal Nijamagiradhu (1978) * Oru Veedu Oru Ulagam (1978) * Mullum Malarum (1978) * Veetuku Veedu Vasappadi (1979) * Oru Vidukadhai Oru Thodarkadhai (1979) * Enippadigal (1979) * Chakkalathi (1979) * Agal Vilakku (1979) * Azhiyatha Kolangal (1979) * Pasi (1979) * Veli Thandiya Velladu (1980) * Moodu Pani (1980) * Ponnagaram (1980) * Saamanthippoo (1980) * Mayil (1981) – Released posthumously * Vaadagai Veedu (1981) – Released posthumously * Anbulla Athan (1981) – Released posthumously =Telugu films= * Tharam Marindi (1977) * Manavoori Pandavulu (1978) =Kannada films= * Kokila (1977) * Aparichita (1978) * Amara Madhura Prema (1982 – Released posthumously) * Mududida Tavare Aralithu (1983 – Released posthumously) Awards ;National Film Awards * 1979 – National Film Award for Best Actress for Pasi ;Filmfare Awards South * 1978 – Filmfare Best Kannada Actress Award for Aparichita * 1979 – Filmfare Best Tamil Actress Award for Pasi ;Kerala State Film Award * 1971 – Best Female Child Artist for Yogammullaval and Aval Alpam Vaikippoyi * 1977 – Second Best Actress for Ormakal Marikkumo * 1978 – Best Actress for Ente Neelakasham References * Sindooracheppu (1971) * Naturalism was his signature * Kokila was Balu’s first as director * Balu Mahendra (1939–2014) * Shobha * Sobha * It's a heavy price to pay External links * * Urvashi Sobha Category:1962 births Category:1980 deaths Category:Kerala State Film Award winners Category:Indian actresses who committed suicide Category:Best Actress National Film Award winners Category:Actresses from Kerala Category:Actresses in Malayalam cinema Category:Indian film actresses Category:Actresses in Tamil cinema Category:Filmfare Awards South winners Category:20th-century Indian actresses Category:Actresses in Telugu cinema Category:Indian child actresses Category:Actresses in Kannada cinema Category:Suicides by hanging in India Category:Suicide in 1980 ","title":"Shoba"},{"id":"4862628","text":"Bernardino Molinari (11 April 1880 - 25 December 1952) was an Italian conductor.

Conductor: Bernardino Molinari Molinari studied under Renzi and Falchi at the Accademia (then \\"Liceo Musicale\\") of Santa Cecilia in his home town of Rome. In 1912, he was appointed artistic director of the Augusteo Orchestra, Rome, later renamed l'Orchestra dell'Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia, a position he held until the end of the Second World War. Since this was then, like now, the leading symphony orchestra position in Italy, it aroused the envy of several rivals. After the liberation of Rome on 4 June 1944, Molinari was contested by the public, in particular during two concerts held on 9 and 12 July, for his involvement with the Fascist regime. He had to suspend the performance and, since then, he was able to conduct in Rome the Orchestra of the Theatre of Opera only.MOLINARI, Bernardino Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani, Treccani, Volume 75 (2011). In 1945, he arrived in Palestine and conducted the Israeli Philharmonic Orchestra, then became its musical advisor. The performance of the Korngold violin concerto with David Grunschlag as soloist was critically acclaimed According to some, his arrangement of the Israeli national anthem Hatikvah was praised by Leonard Bernstein. His version serves most Israeli performances of the piece. Molinari guest-conducted at all the important musical centres in Europe and the Americas.

Personal professorships are conferred on individuals and exist only so long as that individual continues to hold the post. While the first established chair at the university was created in 1637, personal professorships were first created by the university in 1964 to facilitate more flexibility in appointment.

It is also known as LBP, LB, BP, La Belle Pro, Belle Pro, La Belle or Labelle, as nicknames. Each location is independently franchised; some are open 24 hours a day. History Founder Peter Kivetos, a native of Greece, opened the first La Belle Province on Sherbrooke Street East in 1970. He took the name with permission from a restaurant on Saint Catherine Street where he had worked, which had burned down in the 1960s. It became a franchise when the second location was opened in Saint-Hubert in 1976. Kivetos' ownership group had 45 locations in 1997. By 1999 there were 125 locations under the name La Belle Province. It is not strictly a franchise operation, in 1999 there were six different ownership groups, mostly relatives of Kivetos.

Reason for the various names A Quebec judge ruled that the La Belle Province franchise owners could not prevent others from giving a similar name to their restaurants, because \\"la belle province\\" is an official nickname for the province of Quebec. This resulted in several knock-off franchises that had menus and prices similar to the original franchise in order to capitalize on its existing image and marketing. Notable knock-offs include Belle Province II, La Plus Belle Province, La Belle Québécoise and La Très Belle Province.

He was promoted major general in 1930 and retired in 1934. Early life and career Thomas Henry Dodds was born on 11 November 1873 at Gateshead, England. Dodds and his family migrated to Australia in 1883. Dodds was educated at Fortitude Valley State School and Brisbane Normal School and became a teacher with the Queensland Department of Public Instruction in 1888. Dodds enlisted in the militia in 1892 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Queensland Volunteers on 2 August 1899. He was promoted to lieutenant on 1 December 1899. In 1901 Dodds joined the 5th (Queensland Imperial Bushmen) Contingent as adjutant and went to South Africa. There he saw service in the Transvaal, the Orange River Colony and the Cape Colony. When the bushmen and other units were attacked by a superior Boer force at Onverwacht, Dodds rallied the survivors and held on to a ridge until help arrived. For this and other actions he was mentioned in despatches and awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). He returned to Australia in May 1902 with the rank of honorary captain. Dodds was promoted to captain on 27 July 1904 but on 1 July 1906, he joined the regulars as lieutenant, serving on the staff of the 1st Military District (Queensland). On 1 January 1911 he moved to Melbourne to serve at Army Headquarters. Dodd was secretary of the Railway Council from 14 February 1911 to 31 December 1912, Director of Personnel from 1 July 1911 and Assistant Adjutant General from 16 March 1913. He was also secretary of the establishments committee from 1 April 1913 to 31 May 1914. Along the way he was promoted to captain in 1911 and major in 1913. From 15 August 1914 to 15 September 1916, Dodds was Adjutant General and a member of the Military Board, replacing Lieutenant Colonel V. Sellheim who was appointed to the Australian Imperial Force. Dodds was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 1 December 1915 but his ability kept him in Australia, where he was responsible for the training, recruitment and organisation of new units of the AIF. A request from Major General Legge in May 1915 for Dodds to be sent as Assistant Adjutant and Quartermaster General of the 2nd Division was turned down. First World War On 3 April 1917, Dodds was appointed to the AIF as a full colonel. He arrived in England on 17 May 1917, to become Deputy Adjutant General of the AIF. By this time there was over 120,000 Australian soldiers in France and the job was a formidable one. On 1 October 1918, Dodds became Commandant of the AIF Administrative Headquarters in London. For his services he was twice mentioned in despatches and appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 1918 King's Birthday Honours. Later career Dodds returned to Australia in May 1919 and resumed his duties at Army Headquarters as a colonel. He was deputy director of the royal visit of the Prince of Wales in 1920, for which he was appointed a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO). He was military secretary at Army Headquarters from 1920 to 1922 and Adjutant General from 1922 to 1924. In January 1925, the Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General Sir Harry Chauvel sent him to London as Australian Representative at the War Office. On his return in 1927, he became Commandant of the 2nd Military District (New South Wales) and commander of the 1st Division. In 1929 Dodds once again became Adjutant General, with the task of dismantling the Universal Service Scheme that he had once built and creating a new volunteer militia. Dodds was promoted to major general in 1930 and retired in 1934, by which time the volunteer army was a reality. Dodds held the post of honorary Federal Treasurer of the Returned and Services League from 1931 to 1941. He was elected to the Hawthorn City Council in 1935. On 15 October 1943, Dodds died of a sudden heart attack. He was accorded full military honours at his funeral.

It is named after its principal sponsor, Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont). To implement this law, U.S. embassies, the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, and the appropriate regional bureau of the U.S. Department of State vet potential recipients of security assistance. If a unit is found to have been credibly implicated in a serious abuse of human rights, assistance is denied until the host nation government takes effective steps to bring the responsible persons within the unit to justice. While the U.S. Government does not publicly report on foreign armed forces units it has cut off from receiving assistance, press reports have indicated that security force and national defense force units in Bangladesh, Bolivia, Colombia, Guatemala, Mexico, Nigeria, Turkey, Indonesia, Lebanon, and Saint Lucia have been denied assistance due to the Leahy Law. Origins and background Senator Leahy first introduced this law in 1997 as part of the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act. It initially referred only to counter-narcotics assistance for one year. The next year, with his leadership, Congress expanded it to cover all State Department funded assistance. This provision was included in all annual Foreign Operations budget laws until 2008. At that time Congress made the law permanent by amending it into the Foreign Assistance Act.Section 620M of the Foreign Assistance Act. In 2011, Congress revised the law substantially, seeking to enhance its implementation. The United States government has long been a major, if not the largest, provider of assistance—funding, training, non-lethal equipment, and/or weaponry---to foreign military and other security forces. In 2012 it spent $25 billion on training and equipping foreign militaries and law enforcement agencies of more than 100 countries around the world.International Security Advisory Board, Report on Security Capacity Building, January 7, 2013, p. 15 Security assistance is driven by overriding U.S. national security objectives, including a desire to challenge/overturn communist regimes during the Cold War, counter drug trafficking in the 1990s, or counter anti-Western terrorism in the 2000s. Throughout the United States' long history of providing assistance to foreign armed forces, some portion of this assistance has been provided to forces that repress and abuse their own populations. Before 1997, the primary U.S. legislation constraining aid to countries with poor human rights records was Section 502B of the Foreign Assistance Act, which prohibited security assistance to \\"any country the government of which engages in a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights.\\" This law was seen as too vague to be effective in cases where the U.S. government had an overriding interest. According to Senator Leahy, his law \\"makes it clear that when credible evidence of human rights violations exists, U.S.aid must stop. But, it provides the necessary flexibility to allow the U.S. to advance its foreign policy objectives in these countries.\\" Text of the laws U.S. assistance to foreign armed forces comes from two different budgets; therefore, two separate versions of the Leahy amendment have been enacted into law. One covers assistance to foreign forces funded through the State Department foreign assistance budget, and another covers assistance funded out of the Department of Defense budget. The law covering State Department funded aid is found in Section 620M of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (as amended most recently in January 2014).22 USC § 2378d It states: The Department of Defense Appropriations version of the Leahy Law (10 U.S. Code § 2249e) reads:10 USC 2249e There are several key differences between the two versions of the law. First, the Department of Defense version includes a waiver that allows the Secretary of Defense - after consulting with the Secretary of State - to waive the requirements of the provision if \\"extraordinary circumstances\\" warrant it.US Government Accountability Office, \\"Human Rights: Additional Guidance, Monitoring, and Training Could Improve Implementation of the Leahy Laws,\\" September 2013, GAO-13-866, p. 7 Another difference concerns what steps a government must take to resume assistance once a security force unit has been flagged for gross human rights violations. The Foreign Assistance Act version requires that the government of the country in question \\"is taking effective steps to bring the responsible members of the security forces unit to justice\\" while the Defense Department version prohibits assistance \\"unless all necessary corrective steps have been taken.\\" Leahy Law provisions are sometimes confused with human rights conditionality that applies to overall Foreign Operations aid packages to a specific country, such as Colombia, Mexico, or Guatemala. Leahy Law applies only to assistance to specific units, and does not necessarily affect the level of assistance to a country, even when implemented. Human rights conditionality, on the other hand, typically requires a percentage of assistance to a country to be withheld until the Department of State certifies progress on certain human rights conditions. Vetting process The U.S. government (via the State Department) implements the law through a process known as \\"Leahy vetting.\\" A prospective aid recipient's unit is searched for evidence of past commission of gross human rights violations. The State Department has interpreted \\"gross human rights violations\\" to mean a small number of the most heinous acts: murder of non-combatants, torture, \\"disappearing\\" people, and rape as a tactic. The government utilizes the International Vetting and Security Tracking (INVEST) system, which tracks all units and individuals who are potential recipients of assistance, including any information that suggests they are ineligible for assistance and any past determinations regarding their eligibility. Vetting is done at several points in the approval process and by several elements of the State Department, starting at the U.S. embassy in the particular country and occurring at the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor (DRL) and the appropriate regional bureau. When a vetter finds credible derogatory information, the information is entered into INVEST, triggering a review with all relevant bureaus. All assistance remains on hold until a final decision is reached. If credible information is found implicating a unit in a gross violation of human rights, the unit will be prohibited from receiving assistance until remediation steps are taken. The law requires the U.S. government to offer assistance to the country's government in bringing those responsible to justice and remediate the sanctioned unit. The process is, in general, not transparent; in June 2016, State Department Spokesperson John Kirby said department officials do not \\"speak to specific cases on Leahy vetting. We don't do that.\\" While there is no exact definition of what constitutes \\"credible\\" information, the State Department's standard is that it need not reach the same standard as would be required to admit evidence in a U.S. court of law. Vetters rely on a wide array of sources including the annual Depart of State Country Reports on Human Rights, US government agency records, NGO human rights reports, and information garnered from the media. Certain countries known as \\"Fast Track\\" countries are only required to be vetted at the embassy level. The State Department's Leahy Working Group determines by consensus which countries are eligible for Fast Track vetting. A Fast Track country has a \\"favorable human rights record, including no serious or systemic problems in the country's security forces and no widespread problems with impunity.\\" The State Department's \\"Country Reports on Human Rights Practices\\" is the primary source for Fast Track determination. The Fast Track list is updated annually via State Department diplomatic cable.

Withholding of assistance  The U.S. government rarely publicizes decisions to deny cease assistance under the Leahy Law. The vast majority of requests for assistance are cleared immediately; in 2011, only 1,766 units and individuals out of approximately 200,000 were barred from receiving aid because of gross violations of human rights. In 1998, financing from the Export-Import Bank was denied for thirty-nine of 140 armored police vehicles being bought by Turkey because those vehicles were destined for 11 provinces where police had been implicated in abuses of human rights. The manufacturer, General Dynamics, ultimately provided the financing for the thirty-nine vehicles.Dana Priest, New Human Rights Law Triggers Policy Debate, Washington Post, December 31, 1998. Indonesia's elite Komando Pasukan Khusus (Kopassus) was subject to a 12-year ban on U.S. security assistance after it was implicated in a series of kidnappings and murders of activists in the late 1990s.John Pomfret, U.S. may train Indonesian unit; AN EFFORT TO IMPROVE TIES Aid to Kopassus has been banned since '97, Washington Post, March 3, 2010 In 2010 outrage over extrajudicial killings committed by the armed forces of Pakistan led to the suspension of aid to \\"about a half-dozen\\" units of the Pakistani army. A 2013 report by Freedom House described the Leahy Law as \\"an invaluable tool in preventing U.S. assistance to military or police units that commit human rights abuses\\" and added that \\"it is invoked sparingly and only in egregious cases of specific violence.\\"Sarah Trister, \\"Investing In Freedom: Democracy Support in the U.S. Budget,\\" Freedom House Policy Brief, July 22, 2013. In 2014, Major General Paul Eaton(retired) spoke in support of the law, saying, \\"the value of the Leahy Law is that it serves as a moral guide to the application of U.S. military engagement. Some in the U.S. armed forces have argued that the law frustrates U.S. partnership at precisely the moment we need most to influence better behaviors. This dilemma has a solution embedded in the amendment itself, which provides that if human rights remediation has begun, U.S. assistance can be brought to bear.\\"http://nsnetwork.org/critical- issues-in-the-senate-defense-appropriations-bill/ \\"This is a law that works, if it is enforced,\\" Senator Leahy was quoted as stating in the New York Times. \\"We can help reform foreign security forces, but they need to show they are serious about accountability. If not, we are wasting American taxpayers' money and risk prolonging the abusive conduct that we seek to prevent.\\" Criticisms of the law and its implementation In 2013, several U.S. military commanders cited the law as interfering with their ability to train foreign forces. They claimed that the law was being applied too broadly. Most criticism, however, has been that the law is too weak and is not enforced robustly enough. For instance, in 2011 Human Rights Watch reported that the U.S. \\"continued to aid and train Cambodia's armed forces including units with records of serious human rights violations such as Brigade 31, battalion 70 and Airborne Brigade 911- in violation of the Leahy Law.\\" A number of observers have complained that the Leahy Act has not been enacted in response to what they've claimed are human rights abuses by the Israeli military. In 2011, Haartez reported that veteran U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT), a long-time human rights defender, after being approached by constituents in Vermont, was pushing clauses that would bar aid to three elite Israeli military units that have been accused of human rights violations in the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. A spokesman for Senator Leahy denied this. Sen. Leahy's Senate page repeats his views that while \\"he has supported Israel's right to self- defense\\", \\"he disagrees with restrictions on imports of goods into Gaza as it amounts to collective punishment, with Israel's use of excessive force in Gaza which has caused the deaths of hundreds of civilians, and with home demolitions and settlement construction in the West Bank.\\" In February 2016, 11 members of Congress, including Senator Leahy, sent a letter to the State Department demanding a review of the Leahy Act be conducted after reports of extrajudicial killings by Israeli and Egyptian military forces.

Federal Aviation Administration. Updated 15 October 2008. History =World War II= Bisbee Douglas International Airport was originally constructed during World War II as a U.S. Army Air Forces installation known as Douglas Army Airfield. Douglas AAF conducted advanced training in the AT-9 Jeep, AT-17 BobcT, and C-45 Expeditor training aircraft and the B-25 Mitchell bomber.https://web.archive.org/web/20120607234703/http://www.chrismcdoniel.com/P-38/Dougas_Field.html In addition to Douglas Army Airfield, five auxiliary airfields were constructed in the area for emergency and overflow use: * McNeal Field (Aux #1) * Forrest Field (Aux #2) * Webb Coutland (Elfrida) Field (Aux #3) * Auxiliary Field 4 is unknown * Hereford Army Airfield (Aux #5) Post-war With the end of World War II, Douglas AAF was considered surplus to military needs and was transferred to local government authorities of the City of Douglas for conversion to a civilian airport. American Airlines served the airport before being replaced by Apache Airlines, a commuter air carrier, in 1965. Bisbee/Douglas was part of a transcontinental multi-stop route operated by American in 1959 with Douglas DC-6 propliners with daily flights in each direction between the east coast and the west coast. The westbound routing was New York Newark (EWR) - Philadelphia (PHL) - Washington D.C. (DCA) - Memphis (MEM) - Fort Worth (GSW) - El Paso (ELP) - Bisbee/Douglas (DUG) - Tucson (TUS) - Phoenix (PHX) - San Diego (SAN) - Los Angeles (LAX).http://www.timetableimages.com, Oct. 25, 1959 American Airlines system timetable By 1963, American was still serving the airport with two daily flights operated with the DC-6.

The film stars Brendan Fraser as the cartoon's titular Mountie with supporting roles from Sarah Jessica Parker, Alfred Molina, and Eric Idle. Plot The story begins with three children and a horse. These are young versions of Dudley Do-Right, Nell Fenwick, Snidely Whiplash, and Horse. The three talk of their aspirations; Dudley believes he is destined to be a Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer (Mountie) while Nell wishes to see the world. Snidely, however, wishes to be the \\"bad guy\\" and travel around the world. Several years later, all three have fulfilled their supposed destinies. Dudley is now a Mountie (but always sticks to the rules and is frequently oblivious to even the most obvious of things), and Snidely has become an infamous bank robber. After Snidely and his gang rob a bank of its money and gold, Snidely tricks his entire gang into believing he has fled with all the gold to the Sudan and going on a wild goose chase after him. Snidely subsequently salts the stolen gold and spreads it in the lakes. Dudley catches him the act, but Snidely fools him into thinking he is vampire hunting, and uses a similar tactic to scare Horse off. Not long after, Nell returns from her world tour and reunites with Dudley. The two attend a festival at the nearby Kumquat tribe. Meanwhile, Prospector Kim J. Darling (Eric Idle), the poorest man in Semi-Happy Valley, stumbles across the gold in the river and is made into a media sensation by Snidely. The subsequent gold rush boosts Snidely's popularity and, after foreclosing many local mortgages, he quickly takes control of the town, renaming it \\"Whiplash City\\". Eventually, Snidely's men return from the Sudan to kill him for his deceit, but Snidely convinces them otherwise by offering them lives of luxury in his new town. Dudley becomes convinced that Snidely is up to something and confronts him, but Snidely laughs him off and snatches Nell from him. Snidely sends his second in command, Homer (Jack Kehler), to assassinate Dudley with a bomb, but Dudley is absent when the bomb goes off. Nell's father Inspector Fenwick (Robert Prosky), who is in good favor with Snidely, discovers Dudley's feud with Snidely and discharges Dudley from the Mounties. Dudley falls into a depression and wanders across the town until he runs into a drunken Darling, who offers him shelter at his cave in the woods. Darling tells Dudley of Snidely's plans and newfound popularity and takes him to see a Gala Ball in Snidely's honor. Despite Darling's warning not to challenge Snidely due to his loss of favor, Dudley comically attempts to take Nell back from Snidely, but loses pathetically. Feeling sympathy for Dudley, Darling decides to put him through a very harsh training regimen to make him a more formidable opponent and take back Semi-Valley from Snidely. Dudley's first act is to intimidate one of Snidely's men into telling him the next gold shipment. Dudley sabotages the shipment and leaves his mark on Snidely's workshop as well as his favorite golf course. Snidely, unaware that Dudley lost his job, is offended by this and more so with his men's incompetence to stop him, believing Dudley is enjoying the perks of being the villain. Eventually, Darling leaves to find his family and parts ways with Dudley thanking him for his friendship. Dudley then uses his new training to win Nell back from Snidely, who swears revenge. At a nighttime town meeting, Snidely attempts to rally the people against Dudley, but it falls on deaf ears. The populace have grown weary of Snidely and shows more respect for Dudley in his efforts to retake their town. Snidely ultimately discovers that Dudley and Nell are at another festival with the Kumquat tribe and leads a full-scale attack on them. The Kumquats flee for their lives until Horse reappears and helps Dudley sabotage Snidely's tanks by making Snidely and Homer accidentally shoot each other. A cavalry of Mounties appears and arrests Snidely and his men. Darling also arrives with his wife, the Prime Minister of Canada (Jessica Schreier) and is reunited with Dudley, revealing that they called out the cavalry. Inspector Fenwick reinstates Dudley in the Mounties. The final scene shows Dudley and Nell living together in Dudley's rebuilt house. They share a kiss as the film closes.

Dudley Do-Right was Fraser's second film based on a Jay Ward cartoon, 1997's George of the Jungle being the first. Despite the different studios producing each film (George of the Jungle was adapted by Disney), advertising for the Dudley Do-Right film made open reference to this coincidence: \\"From the creator of George of the Jungle…and the star of George of the Jungle…and the acclaimed director who saw George of the Jungle…\\" Reception The film received generally negative reviews from critics, including Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times, who said that it \\"disappoints in every way possible, forcing its failed tongue-in-cheek humor and proving one more time that not all successful cartoons cry out for live- action treatment.\\" It currently has a 'Rotten' rating of 16% on Rotten Tomatoes, with the site's consensus stating: \\"Gags aren't that funny.\\" The film did get a positive review from The New York Times' Janet Maslin said that the film \\"attempts to be both zany entertainment for children and nostalgic fun for those who grew up on this and other deft, snarky Ward creations. (Rocky, Bullwinkle and George of the Jungle are other well-loved Ward characters.) And it works pretty well, too. Beyond the sure-fire goofy presence of Brendan Fraser and the comic possibilities of a Canadian mountie who rides his horse backward, this jokey romp written and directed by Hugh Wilson has an appealing try-anything spirit. It's a movie that can start with Mr. Fraser buttoned into his stiff red uniform and have him dancing shirtless in a Las Vegas-style Indian act before its story is over.\\" Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert gave the film a two and a half stars rating, writing: \\"Dudley Do-Right is a genial live-action version of the old cartoon, with a lot of broad slapstick humor that kids like and adults wince at. I did a little wincing the ninth or 10th time Dudley stepped on a loose plank and it slammed him in the head, but I enjoyed the film more than I expected to. It's harmless, simple-minded, and has a couple of sequences better than Dudley really deserves.\\" =Box office= The film was a box office bomb. In its opening weekend, it grossed $3,018,345 - ranking eleventh for the weekend - and went on to gross just $9,974,410 domestically against a budget of $70 million. Home media Dudley Do-Right was released on VHS and DVD on December 28, 1999, and on Blu-ray on October 8, 2019.

The discovery resulted from Florián’s own request for transference, alleging that he was being treated in violation of penitentiary rules, including his being held in a maximum security cell, being kept from attending Sunday Mass and denied visitors.Dominican Today, December 15, 2005 In the April 2006 extradition request for the money changer Euleterio Guante, the U.S. Government included Juan Danilo Florián Féliz, brother of Rolando Florián Féliz. The U.S. also requested Francisco Féliz and another man known only as Edwin (El Flaco), charged with utilizing Dominican territory to introduce drugs to Puerto Rico by ship. According to a case prepared by the National District Prosecutor, on April, 2003 Guante participated in transporting 1,451 kilos of cocaine to Puerto Rico, along with Pedro Alberto Ubiera Jiménez, Angel Cuevas Guillén, Quirino Paulino, Francisco Fortune Maconi Diaz, one known only as Kiko and others declared fugitives. Accommodations in prison and death On 16 May 2009 Rolando Florián Féliz was killed by a prison official during an altercation taking place on the outer premises of the Najayo prison. A preliminary enquiry was carried out by officials for the Procuradoría General (State Attorney), National Police and Prisons Authority.Hoy newspaper (in Spanish), link to official report .pdf download In addition to the events leading to Florián's death the report candidly describes the inmate's luxurious lifestyle as well as a complicit (at times reluctant) permissiveness and deference granted towards him by the prison staff. As photographic evidence in the report shows Florián lived in considerable opulence in a cell or set of cells that apparently had been joined into a single apartment. He enjoyed the use of electric appliances, including air conditioning and a refrigerator. He had fully furnished rooms, including a personal collection of books, paintings, portraits, flat television screen and many other belongings. Around 1:00 pm of the day in question, Florián received an unscheduled visit by two young women. One of the women was 17 years of age and not identified in the report, as she is a minor by Dominican laws. Despite the irregular time of the visit the two young women were allowed to enter the prison by Lieutenant Colonel José Antonio Pulinario Rodríguez. According to the report Florián was already hosting a gathering with several other prison inmates which included food and alcoholic drinks. Florián left his fellow inmates in general areas of his cell while he retired to his bedroom with the women to engage in sexual activities. These irregular acts caused uneasiness among the very officials who approved of the events in the first place, and a series of communications up and down the chain of command occurred. Various prison officials visited Florián's cell and requested for the two women to leave. Florián Féliz refused on several occasions to allow the women to comply with the request. These refusals were relayed to superiors. Police Lieutenant Colonel José A. Pulinario Rodríguez visited the cell on two occasions and left on both times having no success in persuading Florián. The second visit by José A. Pulinario took place between 8:00 pm and 9:00 pm. Shortly after Pulinario's departure Florián Féliz instructed the women to stay and instead exited his cell armed with a knife in search of Pulinario. According to the report Florián Féliz found a group of officers near the front outdoor areas of the correctional facility. He attempted to injure Lieutenant Colonel Pulinario Rodríguez, who avoided injury and fled the scene. Florián Féliz then turned his attention to two other officers. He injured Captain Lino De Oca Jiménez, cutting his mouth and one of his fingers. Although Captain Jiménez is reported as initially not being equipped with a firearm per the prison's regulations, during the ensuing struggle the Captain produced a 9 mm Browning (registered to Pulinario Rodríguez) and fired several times at Florián. The post-mortem report revealed Florián had been shot eight times, one of them a fatal wound. Despite his extensive injuries Florián managed to return to his cell, telephone his wife and move to a fellow inmate's cell to receive aid. He was later transported to a hospital and died approximately 13–15 hours after the shooting. The toxicology report revealed Florián Féliz had ingested alcohol in the hours prior to the shooting. There was no evidence of consumption of illegal drugs. Legacy after death At the time of his death Florián Félix was concluding a 51-chapter biography LA VIDA DE ROLANDO FLORIAN FELIZ]http://foro.univision.com/univision/board/message?board.id=republicadominicana&message.id;=133755 detailing his life story, his rise and fall.

Many of these degrees were earned during his tenure in prison and can be seen adorning the walls of his Najayo prison cell, in photos. While imprisoned Florián held audience with several prominent professors and scholars, who tutored him to assist him in earning these degrees.

S. Reid, to build and operate the Silverton Tramway, a -long -gauge railway running from Cockburn on the New South Wales-South Australia state border to Broken Hill; after the Government of New South Wales enacted into legislation the Silverton Tramway Act of 1886 that granted the Silverton Tramway Company the rights to build and operate a railway. It was headquartered in Melbourne, listing on the London Stock Exchange in 1897, later transferring to the Australian Securities Exchange. The line the line opened on 12 January 1888. Initially using hired South Australian Railways Y class locomotives, until it received its own locomotives. By the end of 1888, it had concluded a deal for the South Australian Railways to operate the main line services with Silverton servicing the various mines and sidings in Broken Hill. On 1 July 1893, Silverton resumed operating mainline services. In August 1899, the New South Wales Government Railways (NSWGR) purchased the Tarrawingee Tramway. As it was isolated and to a different gauge from the rest of its operations, the NSWGR contracted Silverton to operate services until the line closed in 1931. Following a new line being opened in February 1970 by the Federal Government, the line was made redundant and the company concentrated on operating shunting and track maintenance services to the mines industry in and around Broken Hill with its remaining two diesel locomotives.Progress in Rail Reform: Submission to the Productivity Commission Silverton Tramway Company\\"Silverton\\" Railway Digest July 1985 page 189 Under the 1886 Act, the Government of New South Wales had an option to buy out the company for 21 times the annual divisible profits of the preceding seven years.

It is the world's first gravitational wave observatory in Asia, the first built underground, and the first whose detector uses cryogenic mirrors. The design calls for an operational sensitivity equal to, or greater, than LIGO. Overview The ICRR was established in 1976 for cosmic ray studies. The LCGT project was approved on 22 June 2010. In January 2012, it was given its new name, KAGRA, deriving the \\"KA\\" from its location at the Kamioka mine and \\"GRA\\" from gravity and gravitational radiation. The project is led by Nobelist Takaaki Kajita who had a major role in getting the project funded and constructed. Two prototype detectors have been constructed to develop technologies needed for KAGRA. The first, TAMA 300, was located in Mitaka, Tokyo and operated 1998-2008, demonstrating the feasibility of KAGRA. The second, CLIO, is operating since 2006 underground near the KAGRA site, and is being used to develop cryogenic technologies for KAGRA. KAGRA has two arms, long, which form a laser interferometric gravitational wave detector. It is built in the Kamioka Observatory near the neutrino physics experiments. The excavation phase of tunnels was started in May 2012 and was completed on 31 March 2014. KAGRA will detect gravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers at up to 240 Mpc away with a signal to noise ratio of 10. The expected number of detectable events in a year is two or three. To achieve the required sensitivity, the existing state of the art techniques as used by LIGO and VIRGO (low-frequency vibration-isolation system, high-power laser system, Fabry-Pérot cavities, resonant side band extraction method, and so on) will be extended with an underground location, cryogenic mirrors, and a suspension point interferometer. KAGRA has suffered numerous delays. Early planning had hoped to begin construction in 2005 and observation in 2009 but is now likely to enter operation in April 2020. Excess water in the tunnels caused significant delays in 2014 and 2015. Initial operation (\\"iKAGRA\\") with room- temperature test masses was hoped to begin in December 2015. The first operation of the interferometer happened in March 2016. As of early 2019, the project hoped to complete the KAGRA detector by the end of 2019 to join a gravitational wave observation campaign of LIGO and Virgo. The construction of KAGRA was completed 4 October 2019, with the construction taking nine years. However, further technical adjustments were needed before it could start observations. The \\"baseline\\" planned cryogenic operation (\\"bKAGRA\\") is planned to follow in 2020.KAGRA International Workshop. (PDF). Masaki Ando. 21 May 2017.

Description D. innominatus males grow up to 93 cm in pelvic length (PL).Finucci, B. & Kyne, P.M. 2018. Dipturus innominatus. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species 2018: e.T41799A116736852. https://dx.doi.org/10.2305/IUCN.UK.2018-2.RLTS.T41799A116736852.en. Downloaded on 27 December 2018. PL is a measure from the tip of the animals’ snout to the outer margin of the pelvic fins. Contrasting the males, the female smooth skates grow to a larger size around 112 cm PL. The largest recorded female smooth skate measured 158 cm PL. Smooth skates are the largest known skates in the world and can weigh up to 70 kg at maturity. Their length has been reported up to 2.4 m. The smooth skate has a dark grey upper side with darker grey to black spots and an underside that is lighter grey to white in color. Some adults have small prickles or whiskers on their snouts or noses. Smooth skates are commonly mistaken for rough skates, but are larger in size and lighter in color.  Range and habitat  D. innominatus is endemic to New Zealand. They are found in the coastal waters of New Zealand's North, South and Stewart Islands, and are also found in the Snares Islands shelf and Chatham Rise. D. innominatus is found at shorelines to depths of roughly 1200 m below sea level, although it is rare to find them exceeding depths of 800 m. This species inhabits soft seafloor areas on the continental shelf and its upper slope: they are most numerous on the mid-outer continental shelf.  Diet and foraging  D innominatus lives in the dermal zone near the sea bed. The feeding habits of smooth skates have been researched specifically and results have shown the effects of the commercial fishing industry on this species' feeding habits. Smooth skates are bottom-feeding predators (benthic) and scavenge for food eating dead fish and scraps from larger predators No difference exists between the diet of the individuals regarding the depth of the water or the sex of the individual. Though no change in the diet is seen between sex and depth, a change in diet occurs with maturity of the fish. When the fish are young, most of their diet is made up of small crustaceans, and as the individuals mature, they start to consume larger crustaceans and small fish. When reaching maturity, they consume larger fish and the leftover fish from predators and commercial fishing. Mature skates no longer eat crustaceans that once were the majority their diet when they were younger. This change of diet is also seen in the skate species Sympterygia acuta, which follows a very similar diet pattern to New Zealand smooth skate. The diet of mature D. innominatus is largely made up of shrimp, prawns, and fish coming from 17 different families. The most common of these species were found to be hoki, a deepwater cod species, and many different species of discarded fish from the commercial fishing industry.  Predation  Little information is known on the predation, parasites, and diseases affecting D. innominatus. Marine mammals, especially seals, are known to feed on other species of skate, so the assumption that New Zealand marine mammals would do the same is not unrealistic. Skates are part of seals' diets, though this may be underestimated in the data, as skates do not have bony parts that are easily identified when seal stomachs are surveyed. Predation on skate egg cases by gastropods has been recorded to affect some skate species. Fishing has an impact on New Zealand smooth skate populations, so humans act as predators. New Zealand smooth skate is often caught as bycatch in the commercial fishing industry targeting hoki.  Conservation status  In June 2018 the New Zealand Department of Conservation classified the New Zealand smooth skate as \\"Not Threatened\\" with the qualifier \\"Conservation Dependent\\" under the New Zealand Threat Classification System.

It is located from Bristol, Bath and Wells. The nearest town is Midsomer Norton, which is away. The parish has a population of 1,292 and includes the village of Temple Cloud.  History  It lies on Cam Brook. According to Robinson it was listed as Camelie in the 1086 Domesday Book and the name means 'The curved river meadow' from the Celtic cam and Old English leah. About 1150 the manor was given to Bath Abbey by the Alnes (or d'Alneto) family. In the 13th century it was held by the Marisco family, better known for their connection with Lundy, and then passed into the control of the Knights Templar, which was confirmed in a grant of 1201. During the 13th and early 14th century the manor was again under the control of the de Marisco family. The parish was part of the hundred of Chewton.  Governance  The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council’s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, playing fields and playgrounds, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council. Cameley is part of the Mendip Ward which is represented by one councillor on the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset which was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1992. It provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. It is also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the Great Western Ambulance Service. Bath and North East Somerset's area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non- metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters is in Bath. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the Wansdyke district and the City of Bath of the county of Avon. Before 1974 the parish was part of the Clutton Rural District. The parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of North East Somerset. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. It was also part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament prior to Britain leaving the European Union in January 2020, which elected seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation.  Demographics  According to the 2001 Census the Mendip Ward (which includes West Harptree and Hinton Blewett), had 1,465 residents, living in 548 households, with an average age of 39.0 years. Of these 79% of residents describing their health as 'good', 22% of 16- to 74-year-olds had no qualifications; and the area had an unemployment rate of 1.5% of all economically active people aged 16–74. In the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2004, it was ranked at 25,387 out of 32,482 wards in England, where 1 was the most deprived LSOA and 32,482 the least deprived.  Church  Church of St James The parish church is dedicated to St. James and dates from the late 12th century. The tower, probably from the 15th century with 19th-century restoration, is built of red Mendip stone which contrasts with the local blue lias limestone of the rest of the church. The tower contains a bell dating from 1779 and made by William Bilbie of the Bilbie family. There are fragments of wall paintings on the nave north and south walls. Fragments from the 12th to the 17th century have been identified, the most impressive being the fine early-17th-century Ten Commandments over the chancel arch, framed in twining leaves with cherubs' faces peering out. These remained hidden behind whitewash until the 1960s leading John Betjeman to describe it as \\"Rip Van Winkle's Church\\". The west gallery is dated 1711 but with Jacobean style balusters and attached Charles I coat of arms. The south gallery is dated 1819. There are two early-19th-century monuments on the north wall of the nave to the Rees- Mogg family of Cholwell House within the parish, and a brass plaque commemorating the nine people from the village who died in World War I. The church is surrounded by trees. It is a Grade I listed building Several of the monuments in the churchyard are Grade II listed.  Cameley Lodge  Cameley Lodge is now a hotel, wedding, conference and events venue.  Cameley Lakes  Cameley Lakes comprise a group of small fishing lakes immediately to the west of the village.

He is especially known for his reproductive engravings of paintings. Life \\"Garden of Holland\\", allegorical engraving by Galle of a woman dressed in the manner of Kenau Simonsdochter Hasselaer Galle was born in Haarlem in the Netherlands, where he was a pupil of the humanist and engraver Dirck Volkertsz. Coornhert. According to the RKD, he married Catharina van Rollant on 9 June 1569. They had five children who later became active as artists: Theodoor, Cornelis, Philips II, Justa (who married the engraver Adriaen Collaert) and Catharina (who married the engraver Karel de Mallery).Philips Galle in the RKD In Haarlem he engraved several works of the Haarlem painter Maarten van Heemskerck. Even while he worked from 1557 for the Antwerp publisher Hieronymus Cock, he established himself as an independent printer in Haarlem in 1563, where he made prints after Johannes Stradanus and Maerten de Vos. In 1569 the series of Counts of Holland and Zeeland was published, a series of six engravings which he made in Haarlem with Willem Thibaut, just before moving to Antwerp somewhere near the end of 1569 or the start of 1570, probably to avoid the Siege of Haarlem. His first house in Antwerp was most probably a house called Het Gulden Hert (The Golden Deer), opposite the house of the mapmaker Ortels (also known as Ortelius). He managed Cock's press and succeeded Cock in 1570 and was received as a citizen of Antwerp the following year. The work contains an approbatio, or permission from the ecclesiastical (Roman Catholic) authorities to publish. Galle had a difficult relationship with religion and political power during his entire life. He was a friend of the Antwerp printer Christopher Plantin and perhaps part of the secretive humanist circle of the Familia Caritatis (Family of Love), which makes it difficult to place him as Catholic or Protestant during the Dutch Revolt. Some of his numerous prints made in Antwerp were after Anthonie van Blocklandt, Hans Bol, Marcus Gheeraerts, Gerard Groening, and Hans Vredeman de Vries. Galle had many pupils who became popular engravers. The map engraver Cornelis de Hooghe (or Hogius),Cornelis de Hooghe in the RKD who later died a gruesome death when he was beheaded and quartered in the Hague because of a conspiracy against the state, received his education when Galle still lived in Haarlem, while De Hooghe already worked for himself at the moment Galle moved to Antwerp. Galle's son Cornelis followed him as an engraver. Early works by Cornelis shows a striking similarity to the work of his father. Philip Galle's press and publishing house was a success. His pupils included his children, de Hooghe, Hendrick Goltzius, Jan Baptist Barbé, Pieter Nagel, the sons of his colleague Hans Collaert Adriaen and Jan, and Karel van Mallery. His sons and sons-in-law carried on the business at Antwerp through the seventeenth century. Writings As a resident of Antwerp, Galle witnessed numerous events of the Eighty Years War, notably the siege and looting of the town in 1576 by the Spaniards, called \\"The Spanish Fury\\". Galle wrote a Cort Verhael, a short chronicle of these events, which was published around the end of 1578. This booklet, which included several maps, was dedicated to archduke Matthias of Austria, a relative of the legal king Philip II of Spain, but not recognised by him as a landvoogd or supervisor of the country. A later print was dedicated to Jean de Bourgogne, lord of Froidmont or Fromont. This rather personal book, which was translated in several languages soon after its first publication, shows Galle as a peace-loving person who intended to stay far away from the political and military turmoil of his era. Death He died in Antwerp in March 1612.

The resulting fragrant smoke is offered to the objects of refuge and shared with all sentient beings. Tiny, high-pitched cymbals called tingshas may be struck while the offering is burned; these call sentient beings, especially hungry ghosts (pretas), to share it and satisfy their hunger. Partaking of this blessing purifies their karma and allows them to pass on to a blessed rebirth. The practice may be long or short, as time and circumstances allow, and generally does not require initiation from a lama. The merit of the practice is dedicated to the benefit of deceased persons or animals, especially during the 49 days after death, during which they are believed to be in the bardo state.

After the war he served as a Senator for Victoria in the Australian parliament. Elliott entered the University of Melbourne in 1898 to study law, but left in 1900 to serve in the Imperial Bushmen in the South African War. He was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal, and given a British Army commission, but chose to remain with the Victorian Imperial Bushmen as an attached subaltern. He returned to Australia in 1901, but went back to South Africa to serve with the Border Scouts, who patrolled remote and inhospitable areas. In December 1901, he distinguished himself in repelling a numerically superior Boer force, and received a congratulatory telegram from General Lord Kitchener. After he returned to Australia, he completed his law degree and became a solicitor. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Militia in 1904, and he was promoted to lieutenant in 1905, captain in 1909, major in 1911, and lieutenant colonel in 1913, commanding the 58th Battalion (Essendon Rifles). After the outbreak of the First World War, Elliott joined the Australian Imperial Force (AIF), and formed and commanded the 7th Infantry Battalion, which he led in the landing at Anzac on 25 April 1915, and the Battle of Lone Pine in August. In March 1916, he became the commander of the newly formed 15th Infantry Brigade, which he led in the disastrous Battle of Fromelles in July 1916. In March 1917, the German retreat to the Hindenburg Line gave Elliott a rare chance to display his tactical acumen in an independent command as the 15th Brigade operated as an advance guard of the British Fifth Army. It fought in the Second Battle of Bullecourt in May 1917, and the Battle of Polygon Wood at the end of September 1917, when Elliott's leadership transformed a near-defeat into a victory. In the Second Battle of Villers-Bretonneux in April 1918, he won another famous victory. Elliott won the 1919 federal election as a Nationalist Party of Australia candidate for the Senate, and was re-elected in the 1925 election. His involvement with returned servicemen's issues led to his redrafting of the constitution of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia, and he played an important part in the Victoria Police strike, making a call alongside Lieutenant General Sir John Monash for members of the AIF to come to Melbourne Town Hall and sign up as special constables. In 1926, he was appointed to command the 15th Brigade again, and the following year was finally promoted to the rank of major general, and became the commander of the 3rd Division. Suffering from mental illness, he committed suicide in March 1931. Early life Harold Edward Elliott was born 19 June 1878 in West Charlton, Victoria, the third son and fifth child of eight children of a farmer and prospector, Thomas Elliott, and his wife Helen, née Janvrin. To his family, he was nicknamed \\"Harkey\\". He grew up on the family farms, and attended the local school, known as the Rock Tank. In 1894, his father was one of six men who made a sensational find on the goldfields at Coolgardie, Western Australia. They sold their claim to the Earl of Fingall for £180,000 and a sixth interest. Fingall then floated it in London as a company valued at £700,000. This changed the family's circumstances. Debts were paid, and the farms acquired outright. The family moved to a new house named \\"Elsinore\\" near Lake Wendouree in Ballarat, Victoria. In January 1895, Elliott commenced at Ballarat College, a private Presbyterian boys' school, where one of the school houses, \\"Elliott\\", is now named after him. Despite concerns about the adequacy of his Rock Tank education, Elliott topped his class in Latin, bookkeeping, and Bible studies in his first year. He topped the class in seven of his eight subjects in 1896, and went on to become dux of the school in 1897. Elliott entered Ormond College, the Presbyterian hall of residence at the University of Melbourne in 1898 to study law. Between 1883 and 1896, law students had been required to first obtain a bachelor of arts degree before going on to study law. This had been changed, but Elliott, who was under no financial pressure to complete his degree quickly, elected to follow the old route and complete an arts degree first. He also represented Ormond College in football and athletics, and joined the University Officers' Training Corps. In March 1900, the Imperial authorities asked the Australian colonial governments to raise a force of 2,500 Imperial Bushmen for service in the South African War. Elliott decided to interrupt his studies to serve, and was one of 4,000 applicants for the 626 positions allotted to Victoria. He was accepted for the Victorian Imperial Bushmen, and trained at Langwarrin, Victoria, before embarking for South Africa on 1 May 1900. In another aspect of his life, Elliott would join the United Grand Lodge of Victoria as a Freemason in the old and established Naval & Military Lodge No 49. Boer War service The Victorian Imperial Bushmen were initially based at Marandellas in case the Boers invaded Southern Rhodesia. In January 1901 they moved to the Cape Colony, where they were attached to a Coldstream Guards force under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Henniker. This sometimes formed part of a larger force under the command of Colonel Herbert Plumer. On 28 February 1901, a 16-man detachment of Victorian Imperial Bushmen under the command of Captain Joseph Dallimore tracked a party of Boers. During the night, Elliott, now a corporal, stole the Boers' 54 horses without waking them. At dawn the bushmen surrounded and attacked the Boer party's encampment, and compelled all 33 of them to surrender. For his part, Elliott was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal, the British Empire's second-highest award for gallantry by other ranks after the Victoria Cross, and mentioned in despatches. He was given a British Army commission as a lieutenant in the 2nd Battalion, Royal Berkshire Regiment on 20 November 1900, but he remained with the Victorian Imperial Bushmen as an attached subaltern. He embarked for Australia on 22 June 1901, reaching Melbourne on 12 July. His British Army commission was cancelled at his own request. On 24 August 1901, he sailed for South Africa again on the SS Britannic. There, he obtained a commission as a lieutenant in the Cape Colony Cyclist Corps on 18 October 1901. He then joined the Border Scouts, who patrolled remote and inhospitable areas. In December 1901, he distinguished himself in repelling a numerically superior Boer force under Commandant Edwin Alfred Conroy. For this he received a congratulatory telegram from General Lord Kitchener that read: \\"Please tell Lieut. Elliott that I am very pleased with his conduct and that of his men in driving off Conroy and saving horses.\\" The war ended in May 1902, but Elliott remained with the Border Scouts until they were disbanded in September. In addition to his Distinguished Conduct Medal, Elliott was awarded the Queen's South Africa Medal with four clasps (Rhodesia, Orange Free State, Transvaal, and Cape Colony), and the King's South Africa Medal with two clasps (South Africa 1901 and South Africa 1902). Early law career In 1903, Elliott returned to his studies, completing his arts degree. Instead of staying at Ormond College, he lived at \\"Endersleigh\\", a residence in Drummond Street, Carlton, owned by Alexander and Mary Campbell. The following year he commenced law, winning a residential scholarship to Ormond College. He was also commissioned in the Militia as a second lieutenant in the 5th Infantry Regiment. He returned to Ormond in 1905, where he was joined by his brother George, who had also been dux of Ballarat College, and went on to play football for Fitzroy and University in the Victorian Football League. Elliott graduated in 1906 with his Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws with second class honours, sharing the Supreme Court Prize for the top law student. A law degree was not sufficient to allow one to practise law; aspiring lawyers still had to also complete their articles. Elliott joined the firm of Moule, Hamilton and Kiddle on Market Street. While working on his articles, he lived at Endersleigh, where he dated Belle and Kate, the daughters of the owners. He completed his articles in August 1907, and was dismissed by Moule, Hamilton and Kiddle, since the firm would now have to pay him a living wage. Elliott practised as a solicitor in Stawell, Victoria, for a while, before returning to Melbourne, where he formed a partnership with a fellow solicitor, Glen Roberts, with offices in Collins Street. He bought a house called \\"Dalriada\\" in Northcote, with a loan from his father, and married Kate Campbell there on 27 December 1909. They had two children, a daughter, Violet, born in March 1911, and a son, Neil, in June 1912. His militia career also flourished, and he was promoted to lieutenant in 1905, captain in 1909, major in 1911, and lieutenant colonel in 1913, commanding the 58th Battalion (Essendon Rifles). First World War =Gallipoli Campaign= The 7th Battalion disembarking in Egypt On 14 August 1914, soon after the First World War began, Elliott was given the same rank in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF), and command of the 7th Infantry Battalion, one of four Victorian battalions in Colonel James Whiteside McCay's 2nd Infantry Brigade. Elliott's first action was to ask Major Walter McNicoll to be his second in command, a position McNicoll readily accepted. He then supervised the raising of his battalion. Three of his eight companies were drawn from the northern suburbs of Melbourne, but the other five came mainly from central Victoria. He took particular care over the selection of officers. The newly formed battalion marched from Victoria Barracks to the training camp at Broadmeadows, Victoria, on 19 August. Elliott believed that Australians would take readily to military discipline if the reasons for it were properly explained. McCay was disturbed at the numbers of men without prior militia training that were being enlisted, but some of the battalion's recruiting area had no militia units. Instead, Elliott relied on the quality of the militia's officers and non-commissioned officers to produce well-trained soldiers. On 18 October, the 7th Battalion entrained for Port Melbourne, where it boarded the SS Hororata for England. While it was en route, the destination was changed to Egypt. In Egypt, the battalion was re-organised, changing over to the new establishment of four companies instead of eight, and McNicoll left to take over command of the 6th Infantry Battalion. Elliott established a mystique as a larger than life personality, and his idiosyncrasies drew intense devotion and loyalty from his men. He acquired the nickname \\"Pompey\\" after the famous football player Fred \\"Pompey\\" Elliott, who played 209 games for Carlton and Melbourne. Throughout the war, he was accompanied by a black charger, called \\"Darkie\\", who (with subtle encouragement) would spot the smallest irregularities in the men. Years later, his men were still convinced that it was the horse who had noticed the errors their commander had berated them for. Elliott (second from left) and McNicoll (third from left) taking a rest during training in the desert. For the landing at Anzac on 25 April 1915, the 6th and 7th Battalions travelled from Lemnos in the . The plan called for the troops to be landed by tows—wooden rowboats towed by a powered craft; but when the ship came under fire with no sign of the tows that were to take the troops ashore, the ship's master decided that the 7th Battalion must proceed ashore in the ship's rowboats. Elliott was strongly opposed to this, as the men would have to row a long way, and the battalion would become disorganised from the start, but had to give way. Elliott went in the fifth boat. When his boat and the one following were about from shore, they were met by a steam pinnace, which towed them to Anzac Cove, where Elliott stepped ashore at about 05:30. The plan called for the 2nd Brigade to advance on the left towards Hill 971, but Colonel Ewen Sinclair-Maclagan told him that the plan needed to be changed, and that the 2nd Brigade was required on the right, around the 400 Plateau. Climbing up to the 400 Plateau to view the situation for himself, Elliott was wounded in the ankle. He was helped down to the beach, where he remained for several hours, insisting that others were more severely wounded than himself. Eventually, he was taken to the hospital ship HMHS Gascon, and thence back to Alexandria. Elliott was admitted to the 1st Australian General Hospital in Heliopolis on 7 May 1915, was discharged on 26 May, and rejoined the 7th Battalion at Anzac on 5 June. On 8 July he was in his headquarters behind Steele's Post when he received word that the Turks were in an Australian tunnel near the German Officers' Trench. Characteristically, he went forward in person to ascertain the situation, entering the tunnel with two men. Some from the end there was a flash in his face, and the man behind him was shot. Elliott drew his pistol and barricaded the tunnel with sand bags, refusing help for fear that anyone else coming forward might also be hit. The tunnel was blocked off, and sealed with an explosion. On 8 August 1915, the 7th Battalion moved into positions captured the previous day in the Battle of Lone Pine, and he took over responsibility for the defence of the entire position. He led his men from the front trenches, steadying them in an uncertain situation. They fought off a series of Turkish counterattacks, winning four Victoria Crosses in the process. In the fighting, a man next to him was shot dead, splashing him from head to foot with blood and brains, but he was not decorated for the battle despite inspirational leadership. Apparently his name, originally at the top of the recommendations for decorations, had been struck off the list. On 28 August, Elliott was evacuated to England towards the end of August with pleurisy, and did not rejoin the 7th Battalion until 7 November. On 18 December, one day before the evacuation of Anzac, he sprained his ankle and was evacuated ahead of his troops. He was mentioned in despatches on 28 January 1916. =Suez Canal= After the evacuation, the 7th Battalion was returned to Egypt, where Elliott rejoined it on 15 January. On 15 February, he was appointed to command, with the rank of brigadier general, the 1st Infantry Brigade, vice Brigadier General Nevill Smyth, who was being promoted. Two weeks later the news came that Smyth would not be promoted after all, so Elliott asked to be returned to the 7th Battalion. When the commander of the AIF, Lieutenant General Sir William Birdwood, offered Elliott the newly formed 14th Infantry Brigade in McCay's new 5th Division instead, Elliott said that he would prefer the 15th Infantry Brigade, as it was the Victorian brigade of the 5th Division, whereas the 14th was from New South Wales. Birdwood granted this request. Elliott soon made himself unpopular with Birdwood when he wanted to replaced three of the four battalion commanders allotted to him. He was told that their reputations were sacred, but Elliott replied that the lives of his men were more so. Birdwood forced him to accept them for the time being; but Elliott eventually had his way. He also reorganised the brigade to match that of the Militia brigade of the same number at home. Elliott's horse Darkie. The men of the 15th Brigade credited this charger with the ability to notice and point out to Elliott any man who had not shaved or was not dressed properly. The charger was a well trained stock horse and the slightest pressure on his shoulder would cause him to stop. In March 1916, the 5th Division was sent across the desert to defend the Suez Canal. The crossing was first attempted by the 14th Brigade, who suffered badly. Elliott personally inspected the route, talked with officers familiar with it, and drew up a new timetable for the march, managing to get his men across with only a handful of casualties. On the march, one man forgot the ban on smoking. Elliott characteristically started to scream at the man, even threatening to shoot him. Out from the ranks came a shout: \\"If you shoot him, I'll shoot you.\\" When the soldier who called out was brought forward and explained that no one talked to his brother like that, Elliott sent the man to his school for non-commissioned officers, with the rationale that anyone who could stand up to himself in full flight clearly had leadership potential. On arriving at Suez, the water that the Battalion had been promised was nowhere to be found. They were assured that the water was coming, but hours later it still had not appeared. Elliott then made one of the \\"vigorous protests\\" that he was becoming famous for. He even threatened to march them back across the Suez Canal to get them a drink. \\"It was outrageous to deprive men of water in the desert\\" Elliott thundered. He was assured that the water would be available at 05:30 the next morning. Elliott was up at 05:00, and found many of his men had been unable to sleep due to their thirst, and were licking at the taps around camp. He found the camp's Chief Engineer who informed him that the Egyptian civil authorities had not provided enough water for the troops in camp, and that he had strict orders not to start the pumps before 08:00, as it would wake the II Anzac Corps Commander, Lieutenant General Sir Alexander Godley. Elliott remounted his horse and went to II Anzac Corps Headquarters, where he informed a yawning staff officer in silk pyjamas that unless the water was turned on in the next five minutes, the brigade would be assembling and telling the Corps Commander exactly what they thought of him. The staff officer made a phone call, and Elliott was warned that he shouldn't make such a fuss again. He simply replied that he would do whatever was needed to help his men whenever he had to. =Western Front= The 15th Brigade embarked for the Western Front on 17 June 1916. Its first battle was the disastrous Battle of Fromelles. Despite his inexperience in trench warfare, he pointed out to Major H. C. L. Howard of Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig's British Expeditionary Force staff that the width of no-man's land was too great for the assault to succeed. Major Howard agreed and, on returning to Haig's Chateau, attempted to persuade him that the attack was doomed to fail. But the commander-in-chief decided that the operation must go on, so Elliott did all that was possible to make it a success by himself going to the front line to personally inspect the lie of the land and encourage his men. He soon realised that the attack had been a complete failure, reported to that effect, and established that he was now organising the defence of the original trenches. In the end, 1,804 of the 5,533 Australian casualties were from the 15th Brigade. For his part, Elliott was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, mentioned in despatches, and awarded the Russian Order of St Anna (3rd class, with swords). Major General Sir Talbot Hobbs, General Officer Commanding the 5th Division, inspecting the 59th and 60th Battalion Bands with Elliott (left) These losses precluded the 5th Division's further involvement in the fighting in the Battle of the Somme. It was not sent south to join the other division of I Anzac Corps until October. Ordered to make an attack north of Flers that he didn't believe would succeed, he refused. In March 1917, the Germans retreated to the Hindenburg Line, giving Elliott a rare chance to display his tactical acumen in an independent command as his brigade operated as an advance guard of the British Fifth Army. He was mentioned in despatches, and made a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order. His citation read: The 15th Brigade fought in the Second Battle of Bullecourt in May 1917, and the Battle of Polygon Wood at the end of September. According to Charles Bean, this victory was For Elliott, the victory was marred by the death of his brother George, a captain in the Medical Corps attached to the 14th Brigade. He submitted a detailed report of the battle that was highly critical of the British 33rd Division on his right flank, and which Birdwood ordered suppressed. Elliott was mentioned in despatches. In March 1918, a British Army captain was apprehended in Corbie looting champagne. The culprit was handed over the military police, and Elliott posted a proclamation that the next officer found looting would be publicly hanged in the village market square, in emulation of the actions of Major General Robert Craufurd. He reasoned that the enlisted men could not be expected to refrain from looting if officers set a bad example. The Second Battle of Villers-Bretonneux in April 1918, was another famous victory, praised by Marshal Ferdinand Foch for its \\"altogether astonishing valiance\\". Elliott was again mentioned in despatches, and made a Companion of the Order of the Bath. Bean wrote that Elliott standing at the door of a captured German divisional headquarters near Harbonnieres captured in the Battle of Amiens Elliott was deeply disappointed at being passed over for command of a division in favour of John Gellibrand and William Glasgow, who were of equal seniority. He continued to lead the 15th Brigade, which fought in the Battle of Hamel on 4 July 1918, the Battle of Amiens on 8 August, and the Battle of St. Quentin Canal in August and September. At Peronne on 1 September, after leading his troops across a damaged bridge over the Somme River, he slipped and fell in the river. The division radio network became clogged with stations repeating the message that \\"Pompey's fallen in the Somme\\". During the mutinies over disbanding battalions in September 1918, Elliott was the only brigade commander with sufficient sway over his men for a battalion, the 60th, to obey his order to disband. As the members of the brigade began to return to Australia after the war, he became increasingly depressed. Eventually, he called a parade to hand out some last medals, and gave them a farewell speech to thank them for upholding his demanding standards. They were then dismissed and he returned to his paperwork. Later that afternoon, the brigade returned to his chateau preceded by bands and colours. Each company circled the chateau and cheered for their commander. Lastly, the senior colonel called for three cheers and told Elliott that the men wanted to show their appreciation for him and that, despite it being a voluntary march, everyone was there. He was mentioned in despatches twice more, and awarded the French Croix de guerre. Political service Portrait of Elliott by William Beckwith McInnes, 1921 Elliott embarked for Australia on the RMS Orontes on 15 May 1919, sharing a cabin with an old friend, Brigadier General Gordon Bennett. They arrived back in Melbourne on 28 June, and his AIF appointment was terminated the following day. He contested the federal election as a candidate for the Nationalist Party of Australia on 13 December 1919. He achieved the greatest popular vote of any Victorian candidate for the Senate. Moreover, he repeated this success at the 1925 election. Although not naturally suited to life in the federal parliament, he made significant contributions, and was outspoken in his efforts to assist returned servicemen, particularly those with whom he had served. This outspokenness often took the form of arguing in the Senate in relation to the new legislation being brought before it, when such legislation involved the defence forces. At other times, he would personally champion the cause of those men who had been in his battalion. In 1919, Elliott became Melbourne's city solicitor. His involvement with returned servicemen's issues led to his redrafting of the constitution of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia. He played an important part in the Victoria Police strike, making a call alongside Lieutenant General Sir John Monash for members of the AIF to come to Melbourne Town Hall and sign up as special constables. Many men came specifically for Elliott, ready to stand behind him again, although he was forced to leave only a few days into the Strike to attend meetings in Queensland of the Royal Commission on the Navigation Act. He received special thanks from the Premier of Victoria, Harry Lawson. He built a new house in Camberwell at 56 Prospect Hill Road, where he lived with his wife, children, sister-in-law Belle, and mother-in-law, Mary Campbell, until she died in 1923. He would often attend functions escorted by Belle. Violet attended at Fintona Girls' School while Neil went to Camberwell Grammar School. With considerable justice, Elliott felt that he had been sidelined by the new leadership of the Australian Army. This was most probably due to his tactlessness, particularly in relation to post-war changes of policy, and regarding the wartime records of some of those now being selected for the prime military appointments, particularly Lieutenant General Sir Brudenell White, who was now the Chief of the General Staff. In 1921, the Army established a division structure, and the two divisions in Victoria, the 3rd and 4th were given to Gellibrand and Charles Brand respectively. Elliott used the Senate as a forum to protest this, and he was supported by fellow senators and generals, Charlie Cox and Edmund Drake- Brockman. White was succeeded as Chief of the General Staff by Lieutenant General Sir Harry Chauvel in 1926, and he moved to rehabilitate Elliott, who was appointed to command the 15th Brigade again. In 1927, he was finally promoted to the rank of major general, and became the commander of the 3rd Division. Death Statue of Elliott in Ballarat Increasingly, Elliott suffered from diabetes, hypertension, and what would now be referred to as post traumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorder, but was then diagnosed by Dr J.F. Williams as a \\"definite form of nervous disorder\\". He was admitted to the Alfred Hospital on 16 February 1931 after making an attempt to gas himself in the oven at his house. His older sister Nell had committed suicide, as had a niece. Early on the morning of 23 March 1931, Elliott committed suicide by cutting himself with his shaving razor while an inpatient in a private hospital in Malvern. Elliott's funeral took place on 25 March. Following a short service at his home, his casket was drawn, with full military honours, including bands and an escort party, on a gun carriage pulled by horses resplendent with black plumes, to the Burwood Cemetery, a march of some four miles. Stanley Bruce, whose Prime Ministership had come to an end in late 1929, marched as a common returned soldier. Reports in the newspapers of the time state that several thousand people followed the cortège and lined the parade route. The parade was led by Rear Admiral William Munro Kerr, with Brigadier Generals Charles Brand, Thomas Blamey and J. C. Stewart. His papers are in the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. In popular culture Pompey Elliott was one of the six Australians whose war experiences were presented in The War That Changed Us, a four-part television documentary series about Australia's involvement in World War I. A street in Ascot Vale, Victoria, was created in the Whiskey Hill subdivision around 6 km north of Melbourne in around 1930 and named after Elliott. The street is called Elliott street and is a time capsule of early 1930s architecture.

GBR-12909 binds to the target site on the dopamine transporter (DAT) ~ 50 times more strongly than cocaine, but simultaneously inhibits the release of dopamine. This combined effect only slightly elevates dopamine levels, giving vanoxerine only mild stimulant effects. Vanoxerine has also been observed to be a potent blocker of the IKr (hERG) channel. GBR-12909 also binds with nanomolar affinity to the serotonin transporter.  Vanoxerine as a treatment for cocaine dependence  Vanoxerine has been researched for use in treating cocaine dependence both as a substitute for cocaine and to block the rewarding effects. This strategy of using a competing agonist with a longer half-life has been successfully used to treat addiction to opiates such as heroin by substituting with methadone. It was hoped that vanoxerine would be of similar use in treating cocaine addiction. Research also indicates that vanoxerine may have additional mechanisms of action including antagonist action at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, and it has also been shown to reduce the consumption of alcohol in animal models of alcohol abuse. Vanoxerine has been through human trials up to Phase II, but development was stopped due to observed QTc effects in the context of cocaine use. This article refers to vanoxerine as GBR 12909. However, GBR 12909 analogs continue to be studied as treatments for cocaine addiction. As an example, GBR compounds are piperazine based and contain a proximal and a distal nitrogen. It was found that piperidine analogs are still fully active DRIs, although they do not have any affinity for the \\"piperazine binding site\\" unlike the GBR compounds. Further SAR revealed that while there are 4 atoms connecting the two fluorophenyl rings to the piperazine, the ether in the chain could be omitted in exchange for a tertiary nitrogen. Vanoxerine, a blocker of the dopamine carrier devoid of action on the noradrenaline carrier, while fully increasing dopamine in the nucleus accumbens, is ineffective in raising extracellular dopamine in the prefrontal cortex.  Vanoxerine as an antiarrhythmic  Vanoxerine is a drug that was in the midst of recruiting participants for a phase III human clinical trial for its use as a cardiac antiarrhythmic when safety concerns arose. It had passed phase IIb human trials without any concerns but the company, Laguna Pharmaceuticals, found safety issues which prompted them to shut down their company and the $30 million effort to produce a new heart medication. It was previously indicated as a treatment for Parkinson’s disease and depression; however, it had no significant benefit with these diseases. = Medical uses = Vanoxerine is a potentially effective treatment for abnormal heart rhythms. A significant cause of abnormal heart rhythms is reentry, an electrophysiologic event in which the proliferating signal refuses to terminate, and endures to preexcite the heart after the refractory period. It is likely that vanoxerine acts to prevent reentrant circuits. Vanoxerine terminates atrial flutters and atrial fibrillations (both cardiac abnormal heart rhythms) by blocking the recirculating electrical signal, and preventing the reformation of the reentrant circuit. Vanoxerine has also shown a tendency to reduce the recurrence of cardiac arrhythmias, as it was exceedingly difficult to reproduce an atrial flutter or fibrillation in a subject that had been taking vanoxerine. Experiments have successfully been performed on cell cultures, canine hosts, and testing has moved towards human trials. In clinical human trials with increasing dosages, vanoxerine has shown to have a highly favourable therapeutic index, showing no side effects at concentrations much higher than the therapeutic dose. In canines, the effective therapeutic dose was between 76 ng/ml and 99 ng/ml, however the drug reached plasma concentrations of 550 ng/ml without harmful side effects, presenting a desirable therapeutic index. One of the major benefits of vanoxerine is that it does not appear to cause the same harmful side effects as its most comparable contender, amiodarone. = Cellular mechanism = At a cellular level, vanoxerine acts to block cardiac ion channels. Vanoxerine is a multichannel blocker, acting on IKr (potassium), L-type calcium and sodium ion channels. By blocking these specific channels, there is a prolongation of the action potential of the cell, preventing reactivation by a reentrant circuit. The block is strongly frequency dependant: as the pacing of the heart increases so does the frequency of ion channel blocking by vanoxerine. = Molecular mechanism = At this time, little is known about the molecular mechanism of vanoxerine, and steps are being made towards understanding how vanoxerine operates on a molecular level.

He is best known as the founder and Director of the Libertarian Alliance, a free market and civil liberties think tank.Chris Tame, Marc Glendening, The Guardian, 5 April 2006 Early years Tame was born on 20 December 1949 in Enfield, Middlesex. His father, Ronald Ernest Tame, was a printer who had spent the war in the Eighth Army as an escort to Montgomery and had been mentioned in dispatches.Chris Tame , The Daily Telegraph, 7 April 2006 He later became a process engraver and shop steward, and he and Tame's mother Elsie Florence, a nurse, had met and married just after the end of the Second World War. Tame was an only child,An obituary of Dr Chris Tame Dr Sean Gabb, Libertarian Alliance, 22 March 2006 who grew up in post-war Britain. He was brought up in Godalming in Surrey, where his family had moved. He attended a local Church of England primary school, and then grammar school. In 1971, he graduated from Hull University with a degree in American Studies.Chris R. Tame, Founder of the Libertarian Alliance , Sean Gabb, The Independent, 23 March 2006 The Libertarian Alliance Tame joined the Conservative students' organisation at Hull, and became active in the organisation. Disillusioned by the interventionist and authoritarian mindset, he left and never went back. He had felt that the Conservative Party was dominated by a \\"corporate elite\\" wedded to a \\"corrupt state capitalism.\\" He announced his departure from the rostrum at an annual Federation of Conservative Students conference in the early 1970s. In 1967, Tame founded the Libertarian Alliance as an informal discussion group, drawing ideas from Ayn Rand, among others. The organisation was formalised in 1979, with a structure of Tame as its President, and the Alliance was based in the Alternative Bookshop which Tame had opened in Covent Garden in London a year earlier. The Bookshop was advertised in National Association for Freedom's journal, 'The Free Nation.' After university, Tame settled in London, where he worked mainly for the Institute of Economic Affairs and the National Association for Freedom. In 1978, Tame set up the Alternative Bookshop and was its manager. The shop became a \\"mecca\\" of classical liberals, anarchists, and free- marketers, and was once target of a Molotov cocktail and of Socialist workers. The bookshop closed its doors in 1985 due to an unaffordable rent increase. Political beliefs Tame did not believe in seeking political power nor propagandising the masses, but saw the importance of influencing the intellectual debate. Under the umbrella of the Libertarian Alliance, he published prolifically. One such work published in 1989 bore the title \\"Taxation is Theft\\". In addition to writing, he enjoyed engaging in debate with visitors to his shop. Tame was equally opposed to censorship. During the Thatcher years, he exposed the contradictions of Conservatives who claimed to support free market economics yet demanded that \\"obscene\\" publications be censored. At the Conservative Party conference in 1990, Tame disrupted a rally organised by Christian morality campaigner Mary Whitehouse by engineering an intervention by scantily clad models claiming to be \\"Conservatives against sex censorship.\\" The Conservative Party In the early 1980s, Tame was recruited by Sir Keith Joseph at the Department of Trade and Industry to prepare a reading list to wean civil servants off the interventionist mindset in favour of genuine free markets and privatisation. Being a monetarist, Tame was influential in convincing Margaret Thatcher, Geoffrey Howe and Joseph that inflation was due to problems of controlling the money supply, debunking the conventional Tory wisdom that it was due to greedy trade unions, speculators, oil sheikhs or other \\"phantoms.\\" Journalism In the mid-1980s, Tame was a producer on Channel 4's Diverse Reports, a series which looked at topical issues with libertarian and socialist perspectives. In 1983, while researching for an article on how easy it was to acquire guns, grenades and other military items with a credit card by mail order from the United States, Tame duly did so and carried his acquired collection of light armaments in his knapsack to work further in the library at the American Embassy in Grosvenor Square, London. He was arrested, charged and subsequently acquitted. FOREST and Smokers' Rights He was a non-smoker and keep-fit enthusiast, but he philosophically regarded that smokers' bodies were their own and that a person's liberty must extend to the freedom to make foolish decisions in this regard. He defended the rights of tobacco smokers as Director of pressure group FOREST from 1988 to 1995. During his time with FOREST he was an extensive user of Westminster libraries requesting many obscure books which were supplied by the British Library Document Supply Centre to the Great Smith Street branch. He saw off three Directors of ASH and forced ASH to refocus the debate away from the paternalistic desire to preserve the health of the smoker or would-be smoker to the harm of passive smoking to non-smokers. In 1992, he won libel damages after successfully suing LBC Radio, which accused him of \\"introducing young children to cigarettes and assisting in killing 110,000 people a year.\\" In 1995, FOREST removed Tame as director, as its tobacco industry sponsors believed Tame's approach had become too confrontational and abstract. Later years In the later part of his life, Tame moved to Ramsgate, where he had been working on a seven-volume Bibliography of Freedom. Tame was an avid collector of economic and philosophical books, and had amassed a collection of some 40,000 works, including a number of rare classical liberal documents, some of which were donated to the Foundation for Economic Education in New York. A large part of the rest of his collection was donated to Charles University, Prague (source: conversations later with Dr Sean Gabb). He also was an avid user of the public library system notably Westminster Library and the Great Smith Street library. Tame died on 20 March 2006 from an aggressive bone cancer, diagnosed a year before. He was twice divorced and childless. Legacy Since Tame's death, the Libertarian Alliance, under Sean Gabb and then President Tim Evans, awarded a number of 'Chris R. Tame Memorial Prizes.' In 2008, this was awarded to American left- anarchist Keith Preston for his essay 'Free Enterprise: The Antidote to Corporate Plutocracy.' In 2010, the 'Chris R. Tame Memorial Lecture' was delivered by Stephen Davies of the Institute of Economic Affairs.

Described as a \\"poème dansé\\" (literally a \\"danced poem\\"), it was written for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes with choreography by Vaslav Nijinsky. Debussy initially objected to the scenario but reconsidered the commission when Diaghilev doubled the fee. Debussy wrote the score quickly, from mid-August to mid- September 1912. Robert Orledge has analysed the chronology of Debussy's composition and preserved manuscripts of the score. Jeux premiered on 15 May 1913 at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, Paris, conducted by Pierre Monteux. The work was not well received and was soon eclipsed by Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, which was premiered two weeks later by Diaghilev's company. The first commercial recording was made by Victor de Sabata with the Orchestra Stabile Accademica di Santa Cecilia in 1947. A critical edition of the score, prepared by Pierre Boulez and Myriam Chimènes, was published in 1988. There are about sixty different tempo markings in the work, enough for Émile Vuillermoz to describe the score as changing \\"speed and nuance every two measures\\". The thematic motifs of Jeux are likewise very short, often two measures long or constructed from two single-measure building blocks. L.D. Berman has analysed Jeux in the context of Debussy's earlier Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune. Jann Pasler has analysed in detail Debussy's motivic construction. Scenario \\"Venetian holiday in the 16th century.\\" Set design by Alexandre Benois for an unrealized production of Jeux According to Nijinsky's Diaries, made during the weeks before his psychological breakdown, Diaghilev intended the music to describe a homosexual encounter between three young men, and Nijinsky wanted to include an airplane crash. The final version of the story involved a man, two girls, and a game of tennis. The scenario was described to the audience at the premiere as follows: > The scene is a garden at dusk; a tennis ball has been lost; a boy and two > girls are searching for it. The artificial light of the large electric lamps > shedding fantastic rays about them suggests the idea of childish games: they > play hide and seek, they try to catch one another, they quarrel, they sulk > without cause. The night is warm, the sky is bathed in pale light; they > embrace. But the spell is broken by another tennis ball thrown in > mischievously by an unknown hand. Surprised and alarmed, the boy and girls > disappear into the nocturnal depths of the garden.

Other cast members include Barbara Bel Geddes, Louis Armstrong, Harry Guardino, Bob Crosby, Bobby Troup, Susan Gordon, and Tuesday Weld. The film was directed by Melville Shavelson. The film received four Oscar nominations: Best Musical Scoring (Leith Stevens), Best Original Song (Sylvia Fine—Danny Kaye's wife), Best Cinematography (Daniel L. Fapp), and Best Costumes (Edith Head). The real Red Nichols recorded all of Kaye's cornet playing for the film soundtrack. The other musicians in Red's band were not asked to provide their musical contributions, and the sound of his band was supplied by session players. Plot Red Nichols (Kaye) is a small-town cornet player who moves to New York City in the 1920s and finds work in a band led by Wil Paradise (Crosby). He meets and marries singer Willia Stutsman, a.k.a. \\"Bobbie Meredith\\" (Bel Geddes). Red and his friends Jimmy Dorsey, Glenn Miller, Artie Schutt and Dave Tough form their own Dixieland band called \\"The Five Pennies\\" (a play on Nichols' name, since a nickel equals five pennies). As their popularity peaks, the Nichols' young daughter Dorothy (Susan Gordon) contracts polio, and the family leaves the music business, moving to the balmier climate of Los Angeles, where Nichols works in the shipyards and both parents help Dorothy work on her recovery. As a teenager, Dorothy (Tuesday Weld) learns of her father's music career and persuades him to make a comeback. His first attempts to play a horn (he threw his own treasured instrument into the San Francisco Bay in despair when Dorothy was ill) are a miserable failure. Eventually he listens to his wife and daughter, and practice restores his skill. His old friend Tony Valani (Guardino), now a huge success, gets him a gig to perform at a small club, with The New Five Pennies. Nichols, nervous and terrified of splitting his lip, is disappointed when he sees no other old friends in the audience. He opens the show, and after a few notes, “Won't you come home Bill Bailey?” echoes through the dark. The lights comes up, and it is Satchmo and his friends. Willa comes up on stage and tells him she has a surprise for him. Dorothy steps onto the dance floor without her cane and asks her father to dance. Willa sings “This little penny is to wish on...” while they do. Then Nichols takes his horn and plays “Glory Hallelujah!” His friends join in.

The show focuses on investigating and exposing the dubious work practices of tradespeople and businesses whom have received complaints against them from their customers, often through the use of hidden cameras and rigged situations, sometimes sending members of the show's research team undercover to secretly record any training methods taught to a business' employees that is suspicious or unethical. The programme ran for nine series between 2001 and 2009, before it was decided to incorporate Rogue Traders format as a multi-part segment for the long-running consumer series Watchdog; the segment retained the show's name after its merger in 2009. In 2012, Penteado was removed from the show, after he was jailed for benefit fraud. Format For each episode of Rogue Traders, Allwright seeks to expose individuals who have come to the attention of the research team, usually for one or several reasons, including being unethical with sales, aggressively pursuing a customer for money, creating unnecessary work, selling something that is not wanted, or committing a criminal offence/breaking the law during a job. Such individuals are usually found through customers writing to the programme outside of filming/broadcast, who were unsatisfied by the individual's work, behaviour or sales techniques, made complaints against them that they refused to deal with, or felt cheated by the amount they paid out, whereupon the programme's researchers will investigate the trader further. While the show usually has an improvised and humorous feel to each episode, per the script created by Allwright, the consumer investigative nature of the programme ensures that each trader's dubious nature is looked into seriously. In addition, the show often pursues a trader to acquire evidence that supports the complaints their customers make, to which the show uses an occasional catchphrase - \\"We never give up.\\" The general format of each episode is that Allwright will usually introduce viewers to the rogue trader(s) they are seeking to expose, revealing brief details about the issues they have caused, and highlighting the business that they run; for the latter, the show has generated a catchphrase, in which the host occasionally advises viewers that the business is \\"not to be confused with any other companies of the same name\\" or any other variation of it. He will then meet with the trader's customers who complained about them and wrote to the programme's research team with their experiences, through which Allwright will usually ask them what the trader was like, what they did, and how the customer felt about the whole experience. In some cases, the programme is sometimes contacted by a former associate of a business the programme is investigating, who can provide an inside look at how they perform and the associate's thoughts on such behaviour. After hearing enough about the trader, the next step focuses on filming the rogue trader in the act. How this is done varies, depending on the work that the rogue trader is involved in, but in all cases, hidden cameras are used to record everything, while either a trade or legal expert is brought in to view the recorded footage and provide their opinions, thoughts and criticism over what they see being done, including if they suspect a trader is lying to a customer about something that is untrue, questioning what a trader is doing on a job, revealing what something should really cost that a trader is overpricing, and if a trader is doing something illegal that they shouldn't be doing. The following lists how certain types of traders are filmed secretly to provide evidence of dubious work practices: * DIY Tradespeople - For traders who are involved in DIY work, such as gas fitters and roofers, a house is arranged by the production team, rigged with hidden cameras and occupied by a \\"customer\\", who is in reality an actor, that the trader will visit. In most cases of this format, before the trader is called over to the house, a DIY expert recruited to comment about the trader's work practices, will set up a simple, basic fault that can occur, which the customer will point out and request to have fixed. After the trader has completed the job and left, regardless of the length of time that is taken and whether they did it alone or with others that they employ, both the expert and Allwright will then inspect the trader's work to determine its quality and value for money, along with what work shouldn't have been done, and the expert's general opinion on the trader's performance. This format is sometimes repeated a second time, to determine how they perform when faced with a similar issue or a different fault. * Salespeople - For traders who operate a business that sends out salespeople, the production team use two arrangements of filming. The first operates on a similar principle as above, in which a house is rigged with hidden cameras and occupied by an elderly customer, portrayed by an actor. The customer will then call over a salesperson from the business to talk about a product, with the cameras recording what the salesperson does. A legal/commercial expert will usually comment on the techniques used by the salesperson, including \\"hard-selling\\", the price strategy used with the customer, and other behaviours that they should be adhering to or shouldn't be using. The second involves a member or members of the research team going undercover at the business being investigated on the pretense of seeking to work with them. These members are rigged with a hidden camera in their clothing to record the training they receive, and question the people working in the company on how they sell a product to customers. * Services and Goods - These situations can vary, depending on what the trader is involved in, though the production team will usually send out researchers and actors to pose as customers, and will usually procure a trader's services/goods multiple times: ** If the trader is a mechanic or runs a garage, the mechanical expert recruited by the production team will usually set up a fault on a car, arranged for the researchers, that the trader or their garage must fix. After the car has been serviced, the expert examines it, to determine the quality of the work performed, how safe the car is, and whether it was value for money. ** If the trader sells goods, these will be bought and then examined by an expert to determine their quality and true value. For example, if the trader is a second-hand car dealer, the vehicle is purchased and then checked to see if it is roadworthy, has valid documentation, and is safe for the driver and passengers. ** If the trader is involved in rubbish collection, the production team rig the location of the job with an actor portraying the customer and a set of hidden cameras, while marking the rubbish to be collected with an identifiable substance and concealing a tracker amongst it. Once the rubbish is collected, the team follow the tracker from a discrete distance, until it stops moving for a reasonable period of time, and then inspect the site that the rubbish has been dumped at, identifying it as their rubbish by the substance they marked it with. In all cases, once enough evidence of a trader's practices, ethics, and other misdemeanors are acquired via hidden cameras, Allwright will make arrangements to interview the trader and question them on what they do, and why they behave in a way that can leave customers cheated, unhappy, and shocked. In some cases, if the trader had appeared in an earlier episode for similar behaviour, the host will also question them on why they are still trading in the same manner as before. How the host arranges the interview, is done in one of two ways - for DIY traders, Allwright will usually set up a sting, in which the trader is called out to deal with a job, only to be ambushed by the host, who during the fourth and fifth series, wore a disguise and did not break character until after a suitable amount of time passed. For most others, Allwright will usually visit the place they work from and attempt to interview them there. In most cases, the trader(s) will avoid answering questions, sometimes swearing, locking themselves away in a place they cannot be reached by the host, or trying to give vague, unrelated answers while walking/driving away. In some cases, Allwright manages to interview them before they leave or he and his camera crew are asked to leave. In rare cases, traders may aggressively force the host and his camera team to leave, even intimidating them with the support of close friends. An episode then ends with Allwright warning customers about trading with the rogue trader, whereupon he narrates a response to viewers, made by the trader in relation to the show's investigations and the allegations of their practices, actions and attitude to customers. For some episodes, usually the last in the series, the show looks back at some of the traders they featured and reveals what happened to them after the episode they featured in had ended. In these episodes, footage from a trader's episode is used to remind viewers of how they performed and the opinions of their customers who complained about them and the experts who observed their work practices. New footage is then shown of what occurred afterwards with the trader, which include interviews with customers who had dealings with the trader and who decided to come forth on to the programme about their experience, and with investigators (mainly from Trading Standards) who investigated the trader, and found enough evidence to prosecute them for unethical, aggressive and illegal business conduct. For the latter, where the trader's trial took place, is mentioned by the host, who also states the sentence the trader received. Rogue Restaurants On 2 August 2008, a six- part spin-off show was launched called Rogue Restaurants, where Matt Allwright and Anita Rani investigate and secretly film restaurants across the UK in order to expose illegal and dangerous practices by restaurant managers and staff. They were accompanied by Dr Lisa Ackerley, a Food Safety Expert who was able to give an expert opinion to Matt and Anita. Merger with Watchdog On 10 May 2009, a plan was announced by the BBC to relaunch Watchdog;Anne Robinson returns to Watchdog Digital Spy, 10 May 2009 as part of the plans for the relaunch, it was decided that to extend the length of each episode to one hour, the format of Rogue Traders would be merged into the consumer programme, with both Allwright and Penteado retained to present it under the same name, with the former given the bonus of being a host alongside Anne Robinson and Anita Rani. As part of the arrangement, the segment was split into three parts with Allwright introducing each part from a section of Watchdogs new studio, and now featured a \\"rogues\\" gallery, to which he would put up pictures of the rogue traders he featured on the programme.  Arrest of Dan Penteado  On 13 June 2012, Dan Penteado was due in court to face charges of illegally claiming housing and council tax benefit after a council benefit officer had recognised Penteado on television and matched his name to their records. He failed to appear in court and a warrant for his arrest was issued. He later appeared in Bournemouth Magistrates' Court on 25 June, where his solicitor, Terrence Scanlan argued the fraud took place between 2008 and 2012 when he was working part-time for the BBC and had made the \\"very poor judgement not to interrupt the flow of housing benefit\\". He admitted eight offences of dishonestly or knowingly claiming housing and council tax benefits totalling more than £24,000, while he had been paid more than £56,000 for his work on Rogue Traders from 2008 to 2011 and was sentenced to 12 weeks in prison on 17 July 2012. The council bringing the case to court sought to recover the overpayments and was successful, with Penteado having subsequently repaid £210 of this by July.

It is native to light woodland, widespread across Europe, Asia and North Africa from Ireland and Morocco to China. This includes Iran, Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkey, Algeria, India, Pakistan, Germany, Italy, France, Spain, Portugal and many other countries.Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant FamiliesFlora of China, v 25 p 177, 头蕊兰 tou rui lan, Cephalanthera longifolia Altervista Flora Italiana, Cefalantera maggiore, Narrow Leaved Helleborine, Cephalanthera longifolia  Description  Cephalanthera longifolia reaches on average of height in typical conditions. This orchid has erect and glabrous multiple stems. The leaves are dark green, long and narrowly tapering (hence the common name of Sword-leaved Helleborine). The inflorescence is a lax, five to twenty-flowered spike with the bell-shaped flowers ascending in an oblique spiral. The flowers are white, about long, with a yellow-edged labellum and they usually open only during the warmest and brightest hours of the day. This plant can be found in bloom from April to June, depending on location and altitude. The fruit is a dry capsule and the dust-like seed is dispersed by the wind. One unusual characteristic of this species is that some individuals are achlorophyllous (lacking green pigment) and take all their nutrition from mycorrhizal fungi.Canadian Journal of Botany - Cephalanthera longifolia is mixotrophic  Ecology  The flowers are pollinated by solitary burrowing bees. The flowers produce little nectar and the yellowish dust on the labellum which the insects collect is of little nutritional value. The actual pollen is contained in two pollinia which adhere to the hairs on the bee's back. An investigation in Estonia determined that the mycorrhizal partners of this orchid species include Thelephoraceae and Helotiales. Another investigation indicated 9 mycorrhizal partners (still fewer than those recorded for Cephalanthera damasonium): Bjerkandera adusta, Phlebia acerina, Sebacinaceae, Tetracladium sp., and Tomentella sp.Journal of Systematics and Evolution Cephelanthera longifolia is vulnerable to grazing by deer.Woodland Wildlife Toolkit - Narrow-leaved helleborine  Distribution  Cephalanthera longifolia is common in some parts of its European range, such as southern France and Spain, but endangered particularly in northern areas such as Belgium. In Britain and Ireland it is a quite uncommon and declining species, and conservation work is being carried out at a number of sites to safeguard it (see also Galley Down Wood). In 2007 it was listed as a priority species under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan. The charity Plantlife International is leading this work in the United Kingdom.  Habitat  Sword-leaved Helleborine usually grows in damp woodland places (mainly oak and beech), forest edges and rocky slopes. These plants prefer calcareous soils and in well exposed places, at an altitude of above sea level. This species was once abundant, when forests were used for grazing livestock and trees were coppiced, but is now threatened by overgrowth of larger plants. As the flower spikes are eaten by deer, the sword-leaved helleborine is also threatened by the increase of deer populations following extirpation of large predators like wolf and brown bear in many parts of Europe.  Etymology  The genus name Cephalanthera comes from the Greek κεφαλή kephalē (head) and ἄνθηρα anthēra (anther): the anther is placed at the top (head) of the column. The Latin name longifolia means with long leaves . \\"Helleborine\\" may refer to deer using the orchid for food (many conservationists have noted that helleborine orchids are grazed by deer Plantlife - Epipactis youngianaWildflower Society Online ReportFinnish Orchids). Alternatively it may denote that the plants are similar to hellebores (a group of species in the family Ranunculaceae). \\"Hellebore\\" comes from the Greek \\"álkē\\" and \\"bora\\", translating as \\"fawn\\" and \\"food of beasts\\".Dictionary.com In German, Cephalanthera are referred to as Waldvöglein, meaning little birds of the wood, a reference to the winged appearance of the flowers.

For the 2010-11 season, they lost all 5 of their games with their first to Czech Republic by 25 – 13, which was followed by a 29 – 10 loss to Germany. They then lost to Poland, Belgium and Moldova 32 – 18, 30 – 18 and 22 – 15 respectively. The 2011-12 season started with another loss to Germany 23 – 7, followed by Czech Republic 22 – 10 and the worst of the lot, a 58 – 3 slaughtering at the hands of Belgium. They then had something to smile about even though it had no outcome to their final standing, as they beat Moldova 40 – 26, but finished off a very disappointing year with a 32 – 19 loss to Poland. The 2016-17 season is one of the best seasons to date for Rugby Nederland. The young and fairly less physical team in their pool of the FIRA European Nations Cup 1B managed to finish 2nd.

Retrieved on May 15, 2010. Picture : \\"Route 59 & Conde Street West Chicago, IL 60185\\" Established in 1926, its primary products are snack foods and beverages. History and products The Jel Sert Company was named for its original product, a gelatin dessert mix named by combining the words \\"jelly\\" and \\"dessert\\". In 1929, Jel Sert created a powdered drink mix called Flavor Aid. These remained Jel Sert's flagship products until the 1960s when the company acquired the Pop-Ice company and its line of frozen ice pop desserts. Later that decade, Jel Sert introduced Fla-Vor-Ice, another freezer pop, to complement its Flavor-Aid line. Fla-Vor-Ice quickly became the leading freezer pop brand in the United States. In 1991, the company launched the MONDO line of juice drinks and with it a promotional tactic involving the recycleability of their plastic container over conventional individual boxed juice containers. Otter Pops were acquired by the company in 1996. Similar to Jel Sert's other freezer pops, the Otter Pop brand is perhaps the strongest on the United States' West Coast and features flavor-based characters such as Lil' Orphan Orange, Sir Isaac Lime, and Strawberry Short Kook. In 1999, it signed a promotional deal with General Mills' Honey Nut Cheerios to promote its freezer bars. In 2000, Jel Sert acquired three other trademarks: Wyler's, a brand of powdered beverage mixes, and the Royal and My-T-Fine brands of puddings, pie fillings, and flan.
