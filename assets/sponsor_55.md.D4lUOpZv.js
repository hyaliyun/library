She is the author of plays and novels for both children and adults, and has been recognised as an exceptional artist by the Ministry of Culture. She has won a number of literary awards. Career Jana Kolariƒç was born on 17 September 1954 in Maribor, where she attended elementary and secondary school. In 1979 she completed her AGRF (Akademija za Gledali≈°ƒçe, Radio, Film) course in Ljubljana with a degree in film and TV directing. She worked in a variety of jobs after completing her studies, including as consultant for educational TV, lecturer in art education, mentor of a drama group, cultural animator, journalist and editor of school books for a publishing house. As of 2010 she was working as a translator of literature, particularly poetry and fairy tales, and by lecturing. She is married and the mother of four children. Literary activity Jana Kolariƒç has regularly published poems and plays. In 1976 she created a successful play for children, Salon Expon. While working for the Tuma publishing house she was responsible for Primadona, a collection of 12 plays with detailed staging instructions adapted to schools. She joined the Slovene Writers' Association (DSP: Dru≈°tvo slovenskih pisateljev) in January 2004. She received recognition as a leading artist from the Ministry of Culture in October 2004. In 2004 she published a drama for adults, Kdo le so oni?, and in 2005 a collection of puzzles, Ugibanke male, oblecene v ≈°ale. Kolariƒç drew the puzzles in this book, which was designed for children. Kolariƒç's debut science fiction novel Izpred kongresa, a satire of Slovene society featuring adults being cloned at a huge clinic, was first published in 2006 with the funding of the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Slovenia. It received special mention by the jury in a modern Slovene novel competition run by the Mladinska Knjiga publishing house. Kolariƒç translated two children's picture books for the Mi≈° publishing house: Moja sestra Zala and Ku≈°travi Slave z Mlekarske pristave. She published a collection of short dramatic scripts Dobro jutro, lutke (2007) for the Genija publishing house. In 2008 she published her second novel, co-authored with Tatjano Kokalj, Draga Alina, draga Brina. As of 2010 her second co-authored novel was ready for publication, Zima z ognjenim ≈°alom. In a 2009 interview Kolariƒç noted that the market for Slovene literature was small and it was hard to make money. Most writers had a full-time job, usually in education, and wrote when they had the time. She had to take whatever work was available, including teaching, translating, writing books, editing and sometimes helping stage plays. She felt that the media raised impossible expectations of a woman's role, describing a super-woman with a stylish way of life who is the perfect professional artist, who supports her children, husband and parents, and who is a breadwinner and markets their own books. She felt that women writers had to overcome prejudice against negative views of emotional aspects of their work, labeled as \\"sentimental\\", \\"melodramatic\\" or \\"weak\\". She had won competitions only when she consciously adopted a male style of writing. Selected awards Kolariƒç's radio play Upanje na bogastvo won third prize at the 60th anniversary competition of Trieste Radio Studios. Trieste Radio Studios staged the play in 2007. Her radio play Odiseja 3000 won first prize in the 2007 Radia Slovenija competition, and was staged by Radio Slovenija in 2008. The children's play is about life on different planets and what is new on earth. Her short story Barva marsovskih hlac was selected in the International Board on Books for Young People Slovene section as representative of Slovenia in the March 2009 world youth anthology in India. In 2011 her story Goli goli won third place in a competition organized by Ljubljana's Student Publishing Company. In 2013 Jana Kolaric won the first Literary Death Match competition in Ljubljana, where she read a short story with a tragic and unexpected end about a woman babysitting her niece.

It is a bright but loose cluster of intermediate age located approximately 2,300 light years away from Earth. It is located nearly 2 degrees east-southeast of Zeta Centauri.  Observation history  The location of NGC 5460 NGC 5460 was discovered by James Dunlop in 1826. He described it on May 7, 1826 as \\"a curiously curved line of small stars, of nearly equal magnitudes; two stars of 7th magnitude to the east\\" and added it to his catalog as number 431. John Herschel described as \\"a region of large bright stars of 8, 9... etc. magnitude; a very coarse cluster\\" and added it to General Catalogue as No. 3555. In the New General Catalogue it is described as \\"very large, very little concentrated, stars 8th magnitude and fainter\\".  Characteristics  NGC 5460 is a loose open cluster, of Trumper type II3m. There are 272 probable member stars within the angular radius of the cluster and 96 within the central part of the cluster. The tidal radius of the cluster is 4.1 - 8.2 parsecs (13 - 26 light years) and represents the average outer limit of NGC 5460, beyond which a star is unlikely to remain gravitationally bound to the cluster core. A photometric study by Barrado and Byrne in 1995 studied 353 stars near the core of the cluster and identified 25 members and 27 possible members. They estimated the age of the cluster to be 110 mys and its distance to be 740 pc and identified three stars, members and possible members, as variable. A spectrographic study of the cluster by Fossati et al. (2011) estimated the distance of the cluster to be 720 ¬± 50 pc, its age log t=8.2 ¬± 0.1 and the mean radial velocity ‚àí17.9 ¬± 5.2 km/s. The metallicity of the cluster is slightly higher than the solar one (Z = 0.013). The brightest of the members is HD 123226 (mag. 8.98, B8), which is also the hottest star of the cluster. One more star, HD 122983, (mag. 9.77, B9.5IV/V) has been found to be variable, with period 3.4 days. It is a He-weak star. Other chemically peculiar stars within the cluster are HD 123182 (He-weak star of an unclear type, mag. 9.88, spectral type B9), and UCAC 11105038 (mag. 11.59, A8). Also, the hotter component of the HD 123225 system may be an HgMn star.

It is her first release since 2008's Stronger, as well as her first album for Rounder Records. All twelve tracks on the album were written or co- written by a member of the Carter Family, with the majority being composed by Carlene's great-uncle A.P. Carter.  Reception  Carter Girl received positive critical acclaim, with Robin Denselow from UK publication The Guardian giving the album 4 out of 5 stars and saying \\"[Carter] has done her justice to her history\\", highlighting how the songs of the Carter Family have been revived with \\"intensity and emotion\\", specifically on the track \\"Long Black Train\\" which Carter has given \\"new maturity\\". Denselow also praises producer Don Was who has \\"captured the energy [Carter] showed in the late 1970s when she recorded in London\\". Similarly, Rolling Stone Country reported that \\"the two original tracks on the record alone are worth the price of admission\\", calling Me And The Wildwood Rose a \\"sweetly moving tribute to Carter's grandparents, Maybelle and Ezra, told through childhood memories\\". Metacritic also chose Me And The Wildwood Rose as the top track from the album, which was rated 81 based on 10 reviews, indicating universal acclaim. Mojo called Carter Girl \\"unashamedly traditional, committed, personal and really quite perfect\\". The Boston Globe suggesting that \\"this may be the best album the Carter Girl has ever made\\".

The statue was seriously damaged by protestors and removed from public view on August 14, 2017. Description The monument was a bronze sculpture (not solid) of a male armed and uniformed Confederate soldier atop a granite base. The plinth also held two lampposts and a pyramid of four cannonballs. The inscriptions on the base read In memory of \\"The boys who wore the gray\\" on the front, This memorial erected by the people of Durham County on the right, and Dedicated May 10th, 1924 on the left. History The monument was erected in 1924 in front of the Old Durham County Courthouse in Durham, North Carolina and dedicated on May 10, 1924. The United Daughters of the Confederacy advocated for the statue, but were unable to pay for it. It was paid for with public money‚Äîspecifically one-half of one percent of local county taxes‚Äîthrough a provision that had to go through the state legislature. The statue was pulled down and severely damaged by protestors on August 14, 2017, as part of nationwide demonstrations that followed the fatal attack on counterprotestors at Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. For the illegal removal of the statue, the Durham County sheriff's office arrested and charged 7 protestors with multiple felonies and misdemeanors, including felony inciting a riot and misdemeanor disorderly conduct by injury to a statue. (All charges against the protestors were dropped on February 20, 2018.) Additional protests were held on August 18, 2017, among rumors of a possible KKK rally in opposition to the statue's removal. As part of the August 18 protests, a piece of paper reading \\"shame\\" was taped onto the inscription, causing it to read In shame of \\"The boys who wore the gray\\". \\"Death to the Klan\\" was written below this altered inscription in marker. The damaged statue was placed into storage by the Durham police. Due to the state's Cultural History Artifact Management and Patriotism Act of 2015, changes to the statue or its base cannot occur without the permission of the North Carolina Historical Commission, and by the same law, the Commission can only approve moves to a location equally prominent on the same site. The Durham City-County Committee on Confederate Monuments and Memorials was created in response to the statue's removal and first convened in April 2018 to issue recommendations on what to do with the remaining base within the confines of this law, as well to catalog and issue recommendations on other Confederate memorials in the area. In early 2019, the Committee recommended that it be displayed inside the county administrative building in its crumpled state. \\"The committee said displaying the statue in its current damaged form would add important context. The proposal would leave the statue's pedestal in place and add outdoor markers honoring Union soldiers and enslaved people.\\" The proposal needs approval from the Durham County Commission. Durham County maintains that the Cultural History Artifact Management and Patriotism Act of 2015 does not apply, since the law does not address damaged monuments. Between midnight and 3:00am on Tuesday, August 11, 2020, the base of the monument was removed by officials and transported to an undisclosed location.

Her parents were Robert Smith Todd (1791 - 1849) and Elizabeth L Humphreys Todd (1800 - 1874) and she had 17 full or half siblings. Elodie Dawson was a staunch Confederate supporter who spearheaded the effort to erect the Confederate Soldier Monument. After his wife's death, Col. Dawson ordered the sculpture of his wife from Italy, but when it arrived he was dissatisfied with the hair which he judged to be less beautiful than his wife's hair, so he sent the statue back to Italy for a rework. In addition to the much photographed sculpture, Col. Dawson procured many of the magnolia and live oak trees in the cemetery from Mobile in 1879. After the war Dawson was appointed U.S. Commissioner of Education, the first from Alabama. Dawson also served as a member of the Alabama legislature which included serving as Speaker of the House. He was an organizer in the Democratic Party. Dawson was considered a leading citizen of Selma who raised money for Selma's Charity Hospital and Dallas Academy. He was a church leader at St. Paul's Episcopal Church, where his funeral was held. In 2015, the Elodie Todd Dawson sculpture was named one of Alabama's \\"most photographed cemetery monuments\\".

Between 2002 and 2004 she was the association president.. Retrieved on 16 August 2017. In 2004 she stood for election to the European parliament. Her 24,380 votes were not sufficient to win her a seat in the assembly, however. She stood for election to the national parliament in 2005. Venstre had been in power as the largest party in a coalition government since 2001, and although their support slipped in 2005 they remained the largest party. N√∏rby won 5,073 votes which was enough to secure her a seat in parliament. She became her party's spokesperson for culture and the arts. Support for Venstre slipped again in 2007, but they were still, by a small margin, the largest party. N√∏rby's own support increased to 12,804 votes in her South Jutland electoral district. In this parliamentary session her focus was on social issues and gender equality. Her vote level increased again in 2011, this time to 18,059 votes. This was the highest number of votes received by any of the Venstre candidates in 2011. Her 12,012 votes in the 2015 election were again comfortably more than were won by most (if, this time, not quite all) of her fellow Venstre candidates. Between 2006 and her first ministerial appointment, in 2015, Ellen Trane N√∏rby was her party's spokesperson on \\"new media\\" questions. On 28 June 2015 she was appointed Minister for Children, Education and Equality in the Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen minority government formed that year. On 28 November 2016, when that government was replaced by the Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen coalition government, she was transferred to the Ministry of Health. = Media profile = In Autumn 2012, as an opposition spokesperson, Ellen Trane N√∏rby submitted 696 parliamentary questions to Uffe Elb√¶k, the Minister for Culture and The Arts. This performance earned N√∏rby the soubriquet \\"Sp√∏rge-Ellen\\" (\\"Questions Ellen\\") from the mass-market tabloid newspaper BT. A more negative press encounter came about in January 2013 when the BT journalist Lars Fogt reported the allegation that student supporters working for N√∏rby had made more than thirty changes to her Danish Wikipedia entry since March 2011. She reacted promptly and fiercely, asserting that she was being subjected to a \\"journalistic campaign of personal hatred\\" from the tabloid BT, which was then being picked up and reported without critical evaluation by other press outlets.  Personal  Ellen Trane N√∏rby is married and has a daughter.  Publications  In 2004, jointly with Trine Pertou Mach, she published a cookery book with the title \\"Smag p√• Europe ‚Äì med honning og chili\\" (loosely: \\"Taste of Europe - with honey and chili\\").

It was active from 1971 until 2000. History The stable was founded in 1971 by the former yokozuna Kagamisato. He had become head coach of the Tokitsukaze stable in 1968 upon the death of the previous stablemaster, Futabayama, but was forced out because Futabayama's widow (who retained the rights of the stable and its premises) wanted the former ≈çzeki Yutakayama Katsuo in charge instead. Kagamisato took the elder name of Tatsutagawa (which had previously been used by several gy≈çji but had remained vacant since 1961) and set up the stable without taking any recruits with him from Tokitsukaze stable. He was joined by Tatsutayama Oyakata, the former ≈çzeki Ouchiyama, who worked as a coach at the new stable until his death in 1985. The stable was unable to attract many promising wrestlers and Kagamisato reached the Japan Sumo Association's mandatory retirement age of 65 in April 1988 without having produced any top division wrestlers, and just one sekitori, Takamichi, who reached a highest rank of j≈´ry≈ç 9. Following Kagamisato's retirement the stable was taken over by the former sekiwake Aonosato who moved from the parent Tokitsukaze stable. He produced the sekitori Fukunosato, Shikishima, J≈´monji and Ry≈´h≈ç.

The court held that seeking to assert title to the subsequently worked goods had the effect of creating an equitable charge, which was void for non- registration under the Companies Act. Facts The company, Peachdart Ltd, carried on the business of manufacturing leather handbags. The company had granted a debenture to Barclays Bank which contained a floating charge over all of the company's assets. That floating charge was duly registered under the Companies Act 1948. Freudenberg Leather Co Ltd supplied substantially all of the leather used by the company. The leather was sold under contracts of sale which included a retention of title clause. That clause provided not only did title to the leather remain vested in Freudenberg after delivery up until they time that they were paid, but that Freudenberg could trace their title into any goods into which the leather was worked. The company began to experience financial difficulties, and on 10 August 1981 Barclays Bank appointed receivers. A dispute then arose as to which creditor had better title to the leather - Barclays Bank under the floating charge, or Freudenberg under the retention of title clause. The receivers challenged the clause on the basis that the power to trace title into subsequent products meant that the arrangement was effectively an equitable charge, which was void for non- registration. Decision The case came before Vinelott J. The parties acknowledged that these issues had come before the courts several times, most notably in the leading cases of Aluminium Industrie Vaassen BV v Romalpa Aluminium Ltd [1976] 1 WLR 676, Re Bond Worth Ltd [1980] Ch 228 and Borden (UK) Ltd v Scottish Timber Products Ltd [1981] Ch 25. However counsel for Freudenberg sought to distinguish those cases, arguing that in the case of a leather handbag, the leather was still readily identifiable. It had simply been cut and restitched, but clearly not been destroyed by the process. Vinelott J rejected that argument. He held that at law the manufacturing process essentially created a new species of property, and that an attempt to trace title into that property took effect as an equitable charge, and accordingly, that provision in the contract of sale was void for non- registration under the mandatory statutory provisions applicable to company charges. Authority The case is still accepted as authoritative today.

Unveiled on 31 August 2017 as the successor to the LG V20, the V30 forgoes the V20's secondary display for a \\"floating bar\\" which has nearly the same functions as the second display. It still features quad DACs for improved audio.  History  The phone was teased on 3 August 2017 in a press release from LG showing the bottom half of the FullVision display. On 7 August press invitations were sent out featuring the words \\"Lights. Camera. Action.\\" Video teasers were later released, advertising the phone's display, audio and camera capabilities.  Specifications  = Hardware = The V30 has a Gorilla Glass 5 front and rear plate sandwiching an aluminum body and a 6.0-inch P-OLED FullVision Display, with a 2:1 aspect ratio (marketed as 18:9), manufactured by LG Display. Its processor is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC with an Adreno 540 GPU, coupled with 4 GB RAM. The V30 has 64 GB of internal storage, while the V30+ has 128 GB, which is expandable via microSD card. This is also the first LG smartphone to feature an OLED display. The LG V30 uses a dual-lens camera setup with a 16-megapixel main sensor with a 71¬∞ field of view, and a 13-megapixel wide angle sensor with a 120¬∞ field of view. However, the main camera also features a f/1.6 aperture, the lowest in a smartphone at the time of release, and a 10-bit HDR sensor. The 10-bit HDR image sensor is capable of capturing nearly 1,070,000,000 different colors, which is about 211% more colors than an 8-bit image sensor. The main sensor has optical image stabilization, which corrects motion blur in photos and videos, but there is no OIS on the wide angle lens. The V30 supports up to 1 Gbps download speed on 4G. The H932 model of the V30, for T-Mobile, is the first smartphone to support 4G's LTE Band 71, with a frequency of 600 MHz. = Software = The V30 ships with Android 7.1.2 \\"Nougat\\" (upgradeable to 9.0 but without Treble supportOreo beta begins rolling out to LG V30 and V30+ in South Korea, doesn't include Treble support) with LG's custom skin, LG UX 6.0+. It comes with Android's Always on Display feature.  Reception  The V30 has received praise for having one of the most mature dual-camera systems available and for its audio quality, retaining the headphone jack as other premium smartphones stopped providing it, and including multiple audio sensors for input and a 32-bit Quad-DAC (Digital Analog Converter) for output. The phone has been criticized for excessive bloatware on carrier-branded devices and its screen quality has been criticized for its relative lack of color saturation and flaws, as with the Google Pixel 2 XL ‚Äî which features a display also made by LG.

The compilation includes remasters of two entries in the series: Wipeout HD, along with its Wipeout HD Fury expansion, and Wipeout 2048. It was the first release without the involvement of original developers Studio Liverpool following the studio's closure in 2012. The game was released on 6 June 2017.  Overview  Wipeout Omega Collection is a remaster of the previous two titles in the Wipeout series: Wipeout HD (with its Wipeout HD Fury expansion) and Wipeout 2048. Wipeout HD itself contained content from Wipeout Pure and Wipeout Pulse. Players control anti-gravity ships which are owned by racing corporations (effectively referred to as 'teams' in-game). Every ship has different characteristics; for example, each ship's statistics vary in handling, thrust, top speed and shield strength (and in 2048, firepower). Each craft is equipped with an energy shield which absorbs damage sustained during a race; energy is lost whenever the player's ship collides with the trackside barrier, other ships, or is hit by weapon fire. If the shield runs out, the player's ship will explode and is consequently eliminated from the race. However, the player may replenish energy by absorbing weapon pick-ups. Nine games modes appear in Omega Collection: Zone, Tournament, Speed Lap, Time Trial and Single Race from HD; Zone Battle, Eliminator and Detonator from Fury; and the Career Mode from 2048. The games contain 26 unique tracks and 46 unique ship models, and include local split-screen and online multiplayer. Also, Racebox (which enables custom races across all game modes) is included for all tracks. The campaigns are split into 3 groups, in a similar manner to how the HD and Fury campaigns were separated in Wipeout HD Fury. Omega Collection was designed to be run at 1080p on the PlayStation 4 and 4K on the PlayStation 4 Pro, both at 60 frames per second. Van-√úber and Tigron officially make reappearances as playable teams, both gaining new designs, with the former as a digital pre- order bonus, though they are later bought as a redeemable code to obtain Van- Uber for free, with Tigron being unlocked early in the game.  Development and release  Studio Liverpool, the original developers of the Wipeout series, announced its closure by Sony Worldwide Studios. However, Sony stressed that the only part of the Liverpool campus that is being closed is Studio Liverpool. The campus still houses Sony's External Development Studio Europe (XDev) among other departments. In 2015, Sony Worldwide Studios President Shuhei Yoshida stated on a possible Wipeout for the PS4: \\"Never say never. From my standpoint I try to balance the number of games in a franchise. In the future there might be a chance to come back to a game like Wipeout.\\" In 2016, Nick Burcombe, co-creator of the original Wipeout, commented \\"If (my latest project) Table Top Racing is successful, I know I can put a team together for it as I get asked every week if we're making a new Wipeout. If there's demand there, we'd love to meet it. But as it stands right now, without the Wipeout brand on it ‚Äì which I doubt Sony is about to relinquish anytime soon ‚Äì it's kind of out of the question without Sony's blessing.\\" The game was announced by Sony Interactive Entertainment on 4 December 2016, during the annual PlayStation Experience expo for a Summer 2017 release. On 30 March 2017, Sony announced that the game would be available on 6 June for North America and 7 June for Europe. In December 2017, it was announced that a virtual reality (VR) game would be released. At the end of March 2018, a free patch was released, which added the VR mode to the game. Those who pre-ordered the game digitally were gifted a dynamic theme for their PS4 as well as access to the Van-√úber ship. Those who pre-ordered the disc version were given an exclusive steelbook as well as static themes for the PS4. The steelbook is not available in North America. Wipeout Omega Collection features 28 licensed soundtracks. If the PlayStation Music app is installed, players can use the \\"Best of WipEout\\" Spotify playlist to use tracks from older Wipeout games. Reception Wipeout Omega Collection received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Jordan Devore's score of 8.5/10 on Destructoid indicated that there was \\"Impressive effort with a few noticeable problems holding it back. Won't astound everyone, but is worth your time and cash.\\" Miguel Conception from GameSpot gave the game a score of 9/10 saying that \\"By focusing on this specific era of the series, Wipeout Omega Collection maintains a level of cohesion you wouldn't get if this compilation included, say, Wipeout Pure or Fusion. While each of the three games exude style and stimulation in their own distinct ways, they collectively showcase the best elements of franchise's engrossing racing and silky smooth visuals. And even though it doesn't completely scratch the itch that only a completely new PS4 sequel can offer, this collection is easily the next best thing.\\" David Miekleham of GamesRadar+ awarded it 4.5 out of 5 stars stating that \\"With breakneck racing thrills and impeccable presentation, this ranks up there with The Last Of Us Remastered as the best redux on PS4.\\" On 10 June 2017, Wipeout Omega Collection became the first game in the series to gain the UK All Formats physical No. 1. It entered the download charts at No. 15. The game was nominated for \\"Racing Game\\" at The Independent Game Developers' Association Awards 2017, and for \\"Music Design\\" at the 2018 Develop Awards.

From 1971 to 1991, they were exclusively produced for the Freiburger Verkehrs by the D√ºsseldorfer Waggonfabrik in three series, which is why they are defined as Typ Freiburg. They have been designed to be used uni-directionally.  Construction  The structural requirements of Freiburg made it necessary for their own tram type to be created. This was because trams with Jacobs bogies were not suitable for the partially narrow curved radii. Freiburg's trams were based on the type used in Mannheim, also produced by Duewag and built from 1969. This was based on the classic Duewag articulate tram from 1956. In contrast to conventional articulated trams, however, the centre of gravity of Freiburg's trams were not the Jacobs bogies, but underneath the middle section, into which two tram end parts were attached. In addition to the all-axle drive, which was easier to implement, a better structure gauge was also used, totalling 34 metres of length. After the twelve-axle tram were manufactured by the Rhein-Haardtbahn company, Freiburg's trams were regarded as the second longest tram car in the world.  Series  = First Series (1971/72) = Tram 203 with its original paintwork around 1979 Between the years of 1971 and 1972, the Freiburger Verkehrs AG initially obtained four vehicles using so-called Geamatic controls. They were given operating numbers 201-204. Carriage 202 (externally distinguishable bu its central double head light) was the first to receive an automatic set point adjuster. From the outset, they were designed for travel without conductors and replacing some of the obsolete and personal-intensive vehicle-type sidecars from the early 1950s, which were still based on the War Tram Cars. They were originally equipped with a head light and cream lacquer. During the middle part of the 1980s, they were adjusted to normal trams and had two headlights installed, which were fitted to the central part next to each other. At the same time, they were repainted red and white in 1981. Tram 206 in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ In 2001, they were decommissioned for use in Freiburg. They were later used across ≈Å√≥d≈∫'s tram network, where they were served by Miƒôdzygminna Komunikacja Tramwajowa on line 46 to Ozork√≥w. Tram 2-4 was later scrapped during this period. = Second Series (1981/82) = GT8K 210 at Hornusstra√üe, 2013 After good experiences with the first four trams and the decision to expand the network, ten more trams were ordered towards the end of 1970s. These were commissioned in 1981 and 1982 and were given the numbers 205-214, also referred to as GT8K. They were lacquered in red and white and had two central front head lights. On journeys, there was no need for a conductor and the last type of trams with sidecars were discarded. At a length of 2.32 metres, they are twelve centimetres wider than the trams from the first series, which in some curves of the network, required new track to be laid. An example of this was at the Schwabentor. The larger width made it possible to make trams slightly bigger than the first series. Both storeys across the two series were very high, but were now accessible in the second series by means of three normal steps. The seats were also laid out 1+2 enabling more standing passengers to board the tram. Instead of the mechanics of the first series, the second series used a direct current controller, which was operated via a set point transmitter. It enabled acceleration and deceleration to take place without jerking. In comparison to the first series, which had scissor pantographs, the second series used single-armed pantographs. Interior of a GT8K Tram 205 is now used as an historic motor coach, tram 207 was scrapped in 2007 and trams 208 and 209 were sold to Ulm's tram network, where they were merged to form number 17 and used as a bi-directional rail grinder. From 2012, trams 206 and 210-214 were used full-time due to the refurbishment of the GT8Zs. Previously, they were only used during peak hours and for transporting spectators to SC Freiburg home matches. Tram 206, which had already been marketed for sale, was now reactivated. In addition, they were all equipped with LED indicators. They are the only trams, alongside the Combinos, to have fitted LED indicators. The remaining trams were still being used until the completion of the GT8Z refurbishment and the delivery of the new CAF Urbos in 2017. = Third Series (1990/91) = GT8N 222 at Hornusstra√üe In 1990 and 1991, a further eleven motorised trams were obtained with numbers 221 to 231. In contrast to the second series, they were equipped with a low-floor middle section. Because of their low-lever, they are also referred to as GT8N. Otherwise, they differ from their predecessor series by means of shear current pickups. They replaced the GT4, now used in Stuttgart, in the short-term. All vehicles of this series were fitted with a dot-matrix display in 2001 and run on lines 1, 3 and 5.

To date, only seven bulls have been inducted, which is the highest honor a bucking bull can receive in the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA). The California Rodeo Salinas inducted Oscar into its hall of fame in 2013. In 2018, the Bull Riding Hall of Fame inducted Oscar. In over 300 attempts, only eight bull riders made qualified rides of the requisite eight seconds on Oscar. Eight- time world champion bull rider Don Gay made the highest-scored ride on him at the time, earning 97 points, just 3 points short of a perfect score. Oscar's owners retired him in 1979 as a living exhibit to the ProRodeo Hall of Fame in Colorado Springs, Colorado. He remained at the hall until his death in 1983.  Background  Bob Barmby, a well-known innovator in breeding bulls and a stock contractor, bred and raised Oscar at his ranch in Lockeford, California. Barmby named Oscar after his trainer, Oscar Heard. According to one of Rodeo Stock Contractors (RSC) original owners and Barmby's son, Oscar's sire was Wirley Gig. Wirley Gig was himself a notable bucking bull. Even while still at Barmby's ranch, Oscar had a reputation for bucking off cowboys. He was a Brahma bull who was gray in color. Oscar was smaller in stature than most professional-level bucking bulls, weighing in at about . He was known for his powerful left spin out of the chute when first bucking. When he was a young bull, first beginning bucking, he attempted to hook dismounted riders with his horns. Later as he matured, he passed them by.  PRCA Career  In 1972, Barmby sold his second rodeo string, including Oscar, to RSC. This was his final sale of bucking stock, and he retired from contracting. Oscar bucked in the PRCA for his entire career, which began with RSC shortly after they bought him. For the first five years that RSC bucked Oscar, over 100 bull riders tried and failed to get a qualified ride on him. To incentivize the riders, RSC offered a bronze \\"Oscar\\" to the first rider to make 8 seconds on him. In 1973, Oscar made his debut in a documentary film due to a challenge from a Mexican charro named Elias Arriolla. The documentary was a Disney film titled \\"The Great American Cowboy.\\" Arriolla was permitted to use both hands (bull riding rules specify one hand) and he only needed to stay on for five seconds instead of the normal requirement of eight seconds; nevertheless, Oscar tossed him in less than two seconds. Finally, in 1975, John Davis succeeded in being the first bull rider to ride Oscar and win the bronze statue. Davis conquered Oscar in July 1975 at the California Rodeo Salinas. Davis also won the championship gold buckle that day. Also in 1975, Randy Mager obtained one of his two rides from Oscar at the National Finals Rodeo when he finished as the Reserve World Champion. Even after these rides, Oscar still was ridden very infrequently. In 1977, Oscar's highest scored ride in his career came at the Grand National Rodeo in San Francisco, California, at the Cow Palace, when Don Gay rode him for 97 points, just 3 points short of a perfect score. The score was a record in the PRCA for any livestock ride (horse or bull) at the time. The ride also won Gay the bull riding event and the bull riding world championship that year. Gay, an eight-time World Bull Riding Champion, ultimately managed to get three qualified rides on Oscar during the bull's career. Some of the few other bull riders that got a qualified ride on Oscar include Randy Magers, Jerome Robinson, Allan Jordan, and Guy Barth. Magers and Jordan each got qualified rides twice from Oscar. There is some conflict in the accounting of qualified rides; the ProRodeo Hall of Fame counts 10 qualified rides. Ultimately, only eight qualified rides are accounted in Oscar's career in the 300+ attempts taken. In 1978, Allen Jordan, a prominent judge for several bull riding circuits including the PRCA, Professional Bull Riders, and the American Bucking Bull, Inc., won a challenge with the bull. He marked a high score of 96 on Oscar. It was not uncommon in those days for bull riders to fill in as judges and vice versa. \\"He was just so fast,\\" remembers Jordan. \\"He was small enough that you could lose him.\\"  Retirement and honors  When RSC retired Oscar in 1979, he was sent to live at the ProRodeo Hall of Fame in Colorado Springs, Colorado, where he spent his years in retirement as a living exhibit there until his death in 1983. Oscar became a very influential sire for breeding with Barmby and for the American Bucking Bull, Inc., registry. One of Oscar's sons, originally named Oscar II, Barmby later renamed Oscar's Velvet and branded him #34. Barmby sold Oscar's Velvet for $10,000 - a previously unheard-of price - to Christensen Brothers Rodeo Company. This sale must have occurred at some point before 1972, at which time he had liquidated his stock contracting business. When Oscar's Velvet won the PRCA Bucking Bull of the Year, it more than paid off for the buyer. Oscar's Velvet went on to produce a line of sons that became notable bucking bulls.

He had more life than the guys who rode him.\\" Oscar bucked immediately out of the chute, making his already remarkable speed more challenging. \\"Usually when people tried to ride, they didn‚Äôt ride him for more than a jump or two,\\" Bobbie Cook of RSC said. \\"He came out of the chute very quickly and kicked over his head.\\" In 2018, Oscar was inducted into the Bull Riding Hall of Fame.

It commemorated the Confederate prisoners of war that died at Camp Morton. At tall and located in the city's oldest public park, it had been the most prominent of the very few Confederate memorials in the Union state of Indiana. It was dismantled and removed by the city of Indianapolis in June 2020 after a yearslong debate, part of a national wave of removal of Confederate memorials during the Black Lives Matter movement.  Background  Inscription Shortly after the start of the Civil War, the original Indiana State Fairgrounds site in present-day Herron‚ÄìMorton Place Historic District was converted into a Union mustering ground and training camp known as Camp Morton. In 1862, the U.S. government assumed control of the camp and established a prison camp for Confederate soldiers. It quickly became one of the largest prison camps in operation; at its height in 1864, it housed nearly 5,000 prisoners. Due to poor conditions‚Äîwhich included overcrowding, lack of sanitation, malnutrition, disease, and lack of medical care‚Äîthe mortality rate was high. By the end of the war, more than 1,700 prisoners had died at Camp Morton.  Description  The monument was located within a circular walking path north of Pagoda Drive, just within Garfield Park's south road entrance on East Southern Avenue. It was made of white granite, and measured tall and wide. On its north face, the granite shaft contained the following inscription: \\"ERECTED BY THE UNITED STATES TO MARK THE BURIAL PLACE OF 1616 CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS AND SAILORS WHO DIED HERE WHILE PRISONERS OF WAR AND WHOSE GRAVES CANNOT NOW BE IDENTIFIED\\". Six wide bronze plates along the north and south sides of the base listed the names and regiments of the dead. History = Origin and placement = Modern tour marker A small number of the Confederate dead from Camp Morton were identified and returned to their families after the war, but 1,616 soldiers were buried in a mass grave at Greenlawn Cemetery. In 1909, General William C. Oats, a one-armed confederate former congressman from Alabama, was commissioner in charge of identifying confederate soldiers who died in federal prison camps. A during a visit to Indianapolis in 1908 Gen. Oats spent time trying to identify specific graves, but was unsuccessful due to a fire that had destroyed the original records. Because of this, Oats recommended that a single shaft be erected bearing the names of the soldiers. In May 1909 Van Amringe Granite Company of Boston was awarded the commission to build the monument and the U.S. Congress allocated $6,000 for the work. In 1911, the Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Monument was dedicated at Greenlawn Cemetery during a Memorial Day service with around 300 people in attendance. In 1919, Indiana Senator Harry Elliott Negley proposed that the monument be moved from its unsightly location to that of a public park; possibly University or Military Park. Soon thereafter, The Southern Society, Governor Goodrich and J.H. Lowry (superintendent of Indianapolis parks) undertook review of the two proposed parks as well as Garfield Park. After investigation of the proposed sites, it was recommended that its new location should be Garfield Park. The monument was separated from the grave site and moved to its present location near an entrance of Garfield Park; it was officially re-dedicated on Memorial Day in 1929. The Confederate dead were reinterred 1931 at a new plot known as the Confederate Mound in Crown Hill National Cemetery, with a small grave marker bearing no names. There was speculation that the monument may be moved again and re-erected in Crown Hill Cemetery, but no further action was taken. = Management = Plaque listing names In the early 1990s, the local Sons of Confederate Veterans organization began lobbying federal officials to move the monument from Garfield Park to Crown Hill Cemetery to mark the actual Confederate grave site, which had no names listed. While ultimately unsuccessful in moving the monument, the effort resulted in a new memorial being installed in 1993 at Crown Hill's Confederate Mound that includes all of the soldier's names and regiments on 10 new markers with bronze plaques. In 2014, the local Sons of Confederate Veterans organization partnered with Indy Parks and the Indy Parks Foundation on a plan to restore the monument, which had fallen into disrepair. While some members expressed dissatisfaction with the monument, the Indy Parks board ultimately voted unanimously for the proposal to allow SCV to raise funds for the project on behalf of the Indy Parks Foundation. In 2015, the Friends of Garfield Park, with funding from the Nina Mason Pulliam Charitable Trust, launched a new audio tour throughout the park, which includes two soundbites discussing the monument. Vista markers shaped like phonograph speakers are at tour sites within the park, and one was placed northwest of the monument. = Controversy = In 2017, there was renewed public interest in the monument in the wake of the Charlottesville Unite the Right rally and the removal of Confederate monuments in other cities. On August 17, City- County Council President Maggie A. Lewis released a statement expressing a desire to start a conversation about the monument's location in Garfield Park. Monroe Gray, the council's Democratic majority leader, separately stated that he does not believe Garfield Park is an appropriate location, and noted that the monument \\"holds no historical significance to President Garfield,\\" the park's namesake. Lewis and Mike McQuillen, Council's Republican minority leader, suggested an inventory of all public monuments in Marion County be conducted, so there can be a better understanding of their content, and whether they might cause offense. Following councilors' remarks, the city's Department of Parks and Recreation stated that the monument was \\"not in a location appropriate for its original purpose,\\" and that it intended to work with the council and partners to \\"explore all available options to remove the monument from Garfield Park\\" so that it can be displayed in a setting that provides historical context. On August 19, 2017, a man was reportedly arrested in the act of vandalizing the monument with a hammer. After the incident, the monument was put under watch by park rangers; it was also reported that a man armed with an AK-47 was guarding the monument, along with others. On August 21, the city added a fence around the monument. That same day, Maggie Lewis stated that there had been \\"productive discussions\\" about the monument's potential relocation, and she urged calm. = Removal = A construction crew uses a hydraulic jackhammer to break up the monument's base on June 9, 2020, one day after the main pieces were hauled off. After 2017 public discussion around the monument, the Indy Parks and Recreation board passed a non-binding recommendation that the monument be removed, but the city never followed through on funding the proposed project or directing the monument's removal. The protective fencing was later removed. On June 4, 2020, after days of Black Lives Matter protests in Indianapolis and throughout the country after the killing of George Floyd, Mayor Joe Hogsett announced that the city was currently identifying the source of an estimated $50,000‚Äì$100,000 which would be required to dismantle the monument, which he said could happen within a week. In his statement, Hogsett said that the city believed the monument belonged in a museum instead of its location in the public park, but that no organization stepped up to assume responsibility, and so \\"time is up.\\" The monument was dismantled and removed by city crews on the morning of June 8, 2020. This monument was commissioned in 1912 by Greenlawn Cemetery and memorializes Confederate soldiers who died at Camp Morton, a Union prison camp. Efforts by public officials active in the Ku Klux Klan in 1928 lead to the monument's relocation to Garfield Park to make it more visible. A resolution to remove the monument passed the Indianapolis Parks Board in 2017, but was not funded. Mayor Joe Hogsett announced the monument would be removed from the park.

The bank's insolvency in 1900, known as Black Saturday and referred to in the Isle of Man as the Dumbell's Bank Crash, resulted in a run on the bank with many individuals losing their life savings and the ruin of numerous local businesses causing poverty, depression and bankruptcy.Mona's Herald. Wednesday, September 19, 1900; Page: 7 The effects were profound and lasted for a considerable number of years.Ramsey Courier. Friday, March 13, 1959; Page: 6Isle of Man Times. Friday, January 07, 1955; Section: Front page, Page: 1 History =Origins= In comparison with established institutions in the United Kingdom banking in the Isle of Man was recent in origin. At the beginning of the 19th Century the entirety of the Isle of Man's banking business was confined to the firms of Litter, Dove & Co., and Beatson & Copeland; later in the first decade Messers Quayle, Taubman & Kelly formed a banking operation in Castletown, however these concerns did not last very long. By 1817 there were five banks in the Island authorised to transact banking business and issue notes. In 1843 Forbes Bank collapsed which in turn resulted in great hardship for many in the Isle of Man. In 1854 the Isle of Man Commercial Bank became the Bank of Mona, a branch of the City of Glasgow Bank, but in this instance also there was a failure of the parent institution and they stopped operations in 1878. The insecurity of banking operations in the Isle of Man was also illustrated by the collapse of Holmes' Bank in 1854 with total liabilities of ¬£300,000. George W. Dumbell =Establishment= Douglas and Isle of Man Bank In 1853, following the failure of Holmes' Bank, George Dumbell, a local advocate and Member of the House of Keys, established a private bank of Dumbell, Son & Howard,Mona's Herald. Wednesday, August 26, 1857; Page: 3 in association with his son William Dumbell and Louis Howard, with its branch situated in St. George's Street, Douglas. Following this branches were opened in Ramsey and Castletown. Dumbell, Son & Howard did a significant amount of business with the agricultural community in the Isle of Man, however in August 1857, only four years after the commencement of business a notice was posted by Dumbell's advising: http://www.isle-of- man.com/manxnotebook/fulltext/ms1900/p001.htm In addition the Bank of Mona also suspended business for a time. In time both banks reopened and in October 1861 George Dumbell, together with his partner Louis Howard, took over new premises on Prospect Hill, Douglas. In 1862 Dumbell's Bank secured the account of the Great Laxey Mining Company. At that time George Dumbell was Chairman of the Great Laxey Mining Company, and by securing the account it gave an outlet for the circulation of the bank's notes - every miner whose weekly wage exceeded 20 shillings would be paid with a Dumbell's Bank note. In September 1864 William Dumbell, eldest son of George Dumbell, became a third partner of the bank. With the passing of the Companies' Act on the Isle of Man in 1864, the Isle of Man Banking Company Limited opened with premises in Athol St, Douglas, and became the main rival to Dumbell's Bank. Dumbell's Banking Company Limited A new prospectus was issued for Dumbell's Bank in 1874 and the capital was much over subscribed. Dumbell's Banking Company Limited was created, with a subscribed capital ¬£180,000, in 30,000 shares of ¬£6 each, of which ¬£2 per share to be paid, namely, ¬£1 on application and ¬£1 on allotment, making a paid-up capital of ¬£60,000. The directors of the new company comprised: Ridgway Harrison, Esq.; Woodside, Receiver-General of the Isle of Man; George W. Dumbell, Esq., M.H.K., Belmont, Managing Director; William. Baring Stevenson, Esq., J.P., Balladoole; Richard Penketh, Esq. M.H.K., Hampton Court; James Spittall, Esq., Ballaughton House. Several big accounts were at that time held by Dumbell's and included: the Isle of Man Mining Company, the Isle of Man Government, Douglas Town Board, the Isle of Man Railway Company and the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company. Dumbell's ¬£1 banknote Following the Great Manx Bank Robbery of 1878 when the Bank of Mona was robbed of almost ¬£9,000 there was a run on other local banks. The Isle of Man Bank chartered a special steamer to convey ¬£20,000 to the Isle of Man, but Dumbell's got by without any special provision. Alured Dumbell, a son of George Dumbell, was appointed Second Deemster in 1880 and as a consequence was obliged to resign his directorship with the bank. In 1882 a new bank opened in the Isle of Man named the Manx Bank Ltd which continued until 1900 when it was absorbed by a bank based in Lancashire. In 1883 a local advocate, Charles Nelson, joined the bank's directors. Nelson came from an old Manx family, he was Chairman of the Manx Northern Railway and his father and grandfather had both been Rectors of Kirk Bride. By the latter part of the 1880s certain signs of the direction in which Dumbell's Bank was moving towards were starting to become apparent; one of which was the loss of ¬£15,000 which the bank invested into the Peel Chemical Company. Following the death of George Dumbell in 1887 the bank continued in its liberal approach to its business. This was a period of economic boom in the Isle of Man with the bank lending money to builders and speculators on a grand scale - two years later Dumbell's Bank paid a dividend of 15%. One incident at the time which indicated there was a degree of mistrust in Dumbell's Bank centered around a transaction involving Douglas Town Commissioners. The Town Commissioners had bought a water supply from a local businessman, Henry Noble, the consideration being ¬£147,247; however Noble refused to accept a cheque drawn on the bank and insisted on payment in cash. There may however be another dimension to this as Henry Noble was a founder of the rival Isle of Man Bank. However suspicions of Dumbell's Bank existed in other financial circles. Dumbell's Bank had been instrumental in financing the Douglas & Laxey Electric Tramway Company Ltd and it became a constant drain on the bank. =Black Saturday= The climax to the business of Dumbell's Bank came on Friday 2 February 1900 when there was a run on the bank, forcing it to close its doors at its head office on Prospect Hill. Many working people had not received their weekly wages and the following day, referred to as Black Saturday, continued to see the bank besieged. Trade underwent a period of stagnation and shares were unmarketable for many months. Shares in the Tramway Company fell from 27 shillings to 1 shilling, shares in the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company fell from 19 shillings to 12 shillings and Amalgamated Breweries share price fell from 20 shillings to 11 shillings. So acute was the crisis that certain merchants from Liverpool closed the accounts which they held in the Isle of Man. Another consequence of the bank's failure was the fact that those in business who had incurred liabilities with Dumbell's were unable to arrange with other financial institutions to take over their liability to Dumbell's, and this led to a series of failures with a further knock-on effect and the closing of the bank resulted in a long list of bankruptcies. There were similar scenes outside the branch offices. In Ramsey a further bank run resulted in a big rush of people coming in from the surrounding countryside. News of the suspension of Dumbell's Bank caused consternation in Laxey. Most of the local tradespeople and residents held accounts with the bank, and a large proportion of the monthly remittances, sent back to the Island by Manx miners working in South Africa, was deposited in the bank. Anxiety was felt for the miners employed in the Great Laxey Mine who received their months pay mainly in Dumbell's notes, and this was only allayed when it was discovered that the Isle of Man Bank was prepared to receive the miners' wages in return for gold.Mona's Herald, Wednesday, February 07, 1900; Page: 7 On Monday February 5, the bank's Laxey Branch was besieged by people wishing to withdraw their money.Mona's Herald, Wednesday, February 07, 1900; Page: 7 Over 200 shareholders attended an extraordinary general meeting of Dumbell's on 12 February. One director sharply criticised the general manager and manager, with other shareholders in turn criticising the directors, accusing them of profligacy and a cavalier lending policy which had contributed immensely to the bank's demise. Accusations and counter- accusations were in turn levelled at the bank's directors. Alexander Bruce, the principal manager, wrote from his sick bed to deny a statement from the Chairman that the balance sheet had been drawn up irregularly. Another manager, John Shimmon, wrote to refute an allegation that there was an undisclosed liability to the Tramway Company in the sum of ¬£65,000 (this liability would later be proven during the liquidation). In April 1900 there was a creditor's petition to the Chancery Court for the winding up of the company. Dumbell's premises and goodwill were acquired by Parr's Bank for ¬£40,300.http://heritagearchives.rbs.com/companies/list/dumbells-banking-co- ltd.html =Liquidation= The liquidators of Dumbell's Bank found the bank's affairs in such a complicated state that it took several months to unravel the accounts, to find out its true position and to crystallise it so in order for exact charges to be formulated. On 13 June 1900, four months after the collapse the preliminary inquiry began before High Bailiff Samuel Harris who had himself on a former occasion been a trustee of the founder of the bank when it had closed for a time in 1857 and had also wound up Holmes' Bank. The accused were: Charles Nelson (advocate and director); John Shimmon (secretary and manager) and three accountants - John Rogers, William Aldred and William Vincent Aldred. The charges against Alexander Bruce were withdrawn due to the state of his health (he subsequently died before the end of the trial). The preliminary proceedings before the High Bailiff were followed by a Court of Criminal Inquiry, again before High Bailiff Samuel Harris, at which a jury of six decided there was sufficient evidence for the defendants to stand trial. =Trial= First Indictment The Court of General Gaol trial of the accused commenced on 5 November 1900, with the Tynwald Court specially fitted out for the trial. Presiding at the trial was the Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man, Lord Henniker (President), Harry Shee QC, Recorder of Burnely, who was specially commissioned and sworn in as a Manx Deemster and Deemster Stevenson Moore. In the first part of the trial, which lasted for nine days, Shimmon broke down under cross examination and wept bitterly. It was revealed that Dumbell's Bank had in the region of 8,000 investors and 750 shareholders, all chiefly in the Isle of Man. The charge against the defendants was one of: \\"unlawfully making, circulating and publishing three balance sheets which they knew to be false in certain material particulars, and which were intended to deceive the shareholders and creditors.\\" The liquidator in his evidence stated that he had extracted from the bank accounts ¬£470,000 in bad debts to June 1898 of which approximately ¬£200,000 was irrecoverable. Another point of criticism was the sum of ¬£65,000 owing to the London City and Midland Bank which actually appeared as a credit to Dumbell's. The sum was connected with the Tramway Company. Nelson was said to of handled in the region of ¬£871,000 in the 20 years of his association with the bank and in one five-year period he dealt with ¬£270,000. His own balance sheet showed a profit of ¬£20,000 for 1893 but this was down to ¬£827 by 1898. Nelson's defence was that he'd been: \\"drawn into a whirlpool of speculation by Alexander Bruce, and knew little of the inner workings and he had no intention whatsoever to deceive.\\" After 2 hours of deliberation the jury returned a verdict of guilty against Nelson, however his sentence was postponed until further charges against him and Shimmon had been heard. Second Indictment The second indictment was that Nelson and Shimmon had fraudulently appropriated to their own use money belonging to the bank. On the 12th day of the trial (the 3rd day of the second part of the proceedings) the jury returned a verdict of guilty against all the defendants. Sentence Nelson and Shimmon each received 5 years penal servitude for fraudulently appropriating money belonging to the bank. On the charge of issuing false balance sheets Nelson and Shimmon received 3 years to run concurrently. For his part, Rogers received 18 months imprisonment with hard labour whilst William Aldred received 12 months with hard labour and William Vincent Aldred 6 months with hard labour. In January 1901 William Aldred was released on the grounds of poor health - he was 77 years old. * After serving his sentence Nelson resumed practice as an advocate.

On August 1, 1917, at the age of 18, Valenstein borrowed $100 and started his own company located at 309 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. He named the company the Grey Agency because the walls of the office were grey. The company's original focus was to publish direct mailings for the furrier industry which morphed into a magazine named Furs and Fashions. In 1925, the firm, renamed the Grey Advertising Agency, became a full-fledged advertising agency and differentiated itself from its competitors by using a team approach to advertising that closely worked with its customers and conducted extensive marketing research. Valenstein focused on developing a brand through pre- selling and building a market for it. In the 1930s the firm focused on soft goods. In the 1940s, the firm was billing $1 million per year. In 1947, after winning Gruen watch account, billings reached $10 million. In 1955, after winning the Block Drug account, Grey's billings reached $30 million. In 1956, Valenstein became chairman of the board and Arthur C. Fatt (hired in 1921 at the age of seventeen) became president. In 1957, Grey developed the widely successful \\"Leaving now for Trenton, Philadelphia and Cucamonga!\\" campaign for Greyhound Bus with the tagline \\"Go Greyhound and leave the driving to us.\\" In 1961, billings reached $59 million and Valenstein became chairman of the executive committee; Fatt was named chairman and Herbert D. Strauss its president. In 1961, the firm expanded by opening an office in Los Angeles; and he expanded internationally by opening offices in London in 1962 and Japan in 1963. In 1964, billings reached $100 million. In 1965, the firm went public trading on the Nasdaq exchange and the firm also expanded into the use of psychographics (the analysis of consumer lifestyles). In 1965, Valenstein retired and was named founder/chairman.

The court held that when the relevant raw material was worked into another product it ceased to exist as a separate type of property, and accordingly it was no longer possible for a seller to retain title to it. Facts Borden (UK) Ltd were manufacturers of chipboard resin. They were the main suppliers of that product to the company, Scottish Timber Products Ltd, who used it to manufacture chipboard. The resin was sold on credit terms. Those terms included a retention of title clause.There was actually an issue between the parties as to whether the clause formed part of the contract. The judge at trial held that it did, and there was no appeal against that finding. The company could store approximately two days' worth of resin on their premises. As part of the manufacturing process, the resin was mixed with hardeners and wax emulsion. This process created what was referred to as \\"glue mix\\" and was irreversible. On 16 September 1977 the company went into receivership, and then subsequently into insolvent liquidation. Borden sought declarations from the court that they could trace their title to the resin under the retention of title clauses into the glue mix and the worked products.[1981] Ch 25 at 32, 33. Decision The main decision of the court was delivered by Bridge LJ. He considered carefully the earlier decision of Aluminium Industrie Vaassen BV v Romalpa Aluminium Ltd [1976] 1 WLR 676 in relation to retention of title, and the decision in Re Hallett's Estate (1880) 13 Ch D 696 in relation to the right to trace. He held that the process of working the resin destroyed that product, and the title of any person which was vested in it. Accordingly, the title which was retained under the agreement was extinguished. He went on to elaborate: Buckley LJ and Templeman LJ gave short concurring judgments. They added in their judgment that acquiring title in the worked product would generally result in the interest being treated as an equitable charge, which would be void if not properly registered under the Companies Act 1948 (now the Companies Act 2006).

The telenovela is an original story by Valentina P√°rraga, and produced by Jos√© Gerardo Guill√©n for Telemundo. It stars Ana Belena and Lambda Garc√≠a as main characters, along to Santiago Ramundo as main villain, with Miguel de Miguel, Antonio de la Vega, Carolina G√≥mez, Gloria Peralta, and the special appearance of Daniel Elbittar.  Plot  From left to right, The Montiel Family composed by Juan Jos√© (Lambda Garc√≠a), Natalia Mart√≠nez de Montiel (Carolina G√≥mez), Paco Montiel (Miguel de Miguel), and Luis Montiel (Gabriel Rossi). Crisanto Casta√±eda (Antonio de la Vega) and Natalia Mart√≠nez de Montiel (Carolina G√≥mez) are people from the land and the vineyards. For them, the grape, its cultivation, the elaboration of the musts and the quality of its wines is not a trade or a way of sustaining itself. It is a passion. A way of life. The only way to breathe and feel. This is the story that we are going to tell. Two intense and complicated families, Los Casta√±eda and Los Montiel, their encounters, their enmity, their loves, their hatreds and their intolerances, within the framework of the great passion they share: life. Crisanto Casta√±eda came to Napa thirty years ago, from his native Michoac√°n, without a dime. After many years of hard work, he has conquered his world: he has a faithful wife, Mercedes (Gloria Peralta), four children: Emilio (Daniel Elbittar), Aurora (Ana Belena), Paloma (Josette Vidal) and Leonardo (H√©ctor Medina); It has its splendid vineyards, but above all, it owns its bodega of strong and powerful wines, just like him. Natalia Mart√≠nez de Montiel (Carolina G√≥mez) was born in the great vineyards of Napa, and grew picking grapes next to her parents, Joaqu√≠n (Rub√©n Morales) and Emilia Mart√≠nez, humble braceros who fought to give her a better future in this new land and, thanks to them, she was able to achieve a career university. She married Paco Montiel (Miguel de Miguel), an educated and good man, who supported her in her dreams of becoming a winemaker and today is still planted with expansion plans. He had only one son, Luis Montiel (Gabriel Rossi), married to Anita Carmona (Estefany Oliveira), and a winemaker, like his father. In addition, she had to raise the eldest son of her husband, the problematic Juan Jos√© Montiel (Lambda Garc√≠a). Los Casta√±eda and Los Montiel have a friendship of years. Joaqu√≠n Mart√≠nez (Rub√©n Morales) helped Crisanto (Antonio de la Vega) buy his first land, and Crisanto, many years later, lent the money to Los Montiel to open their small cellar. The harmony of the relationship ends with the death of Emilio (Daniel Elbittar), the eldest son of Crisanto, in a car accident caused by the imprudence of his best friend, Juanjo Montiel (Lambda Garc√≠a), the son of Paco (Miguel de Miguel). From that family tragedy, a war between families and wineries is established. Because Crisanto, taken by the pain and the rage for his loss, puts a demand that aggravates the sentence of unintentional homicide of Juan Jos√©, Juanjo lasts a year and a half to jail, and terminates his relationship with Aurora (Ana Belena) the daughter of Crisanto. But in the midst of hatred, love underlies: Juanjo's love for Aurora, who is now married with Roberto (Santiago Ramundo). There is also a passionate love between Paco, Natalia's husband, for Paloma (Josette Vidal), the youngest daughter of the Casta√±eda. This relationship ends up aggravating the continuous fights and traps that are inflicted Natalia and Crisanto. And at the height of this enmity, there is a murder, which will put the two families in check, since many had reasons to commit it. Added to the suspense created by the murder, each of the members in both families will have to fight against their own and particular demons until they are defeated.

History Built from 1889 to 1891 to a design by the American architect John Pearce Hill (1849 ‚Äì 1920), the four-storey Neo-Romanesque building was constructed from imported Scottish Old Red Sandstone for Morgan's department store (which HBC acquired in 1960).

Reception The Moving Picture World wrote, \\"This is a strong melodramatic picture, with plenty of romance, sympathetically acted by the firm's Southern stock company. It is a story of a theif's reformation through a clergyman's love, and presents in the telling a good many dramatic and interesting situations. Like all these plays from the Kalem studio, the development of the plot is strongly dramatic... The scene is laid in the South and carries with it the picturesque features common to that locality, but which seem, when properly introduced, to add a stronger touch of romance than is possible under most other conditions. The Kalem people have always used these backgrounds to good advantage, adding materially to the attractiveness and interest of their pictures.\\" Variety said, \\"The Kalem people having gotten through with their epidemic of Indians, offer a polite drama... The minister is not a conspicuously good actor. For example, at one time a door is opened just at his back, but he does not start and turn until two seconds after it has been closed again. The best actor in the company is a tough truckman, who comes to the rooms of the brother and sister to take away the girl's trunk...

It was founded in 2017 following CIBC and the supermarket chain Loblaw Companies mutually deciding to end their 20-year joint venture of providing consumer banking services under the President's Choice Financial brand. Codes Instead of having its own Institution Number (or Bank Number), Simplii Financial shares Institution Number 010 with its parent CIBC. Its SWIFT code is CIBCCATT. And all Simplii clients share a branch-transit number of 30800. History Simplii traces its history to the 1996 President's Choice Financial co-venture between CIBC and Loblaws to provide low-fee banking services. President's Choice Financial operated out of pavilions in various Loblaw-owned supermarkets but had no formal branches; instead, CIBC and PCF customers could use either brands' bank machines for no charge. In August 2017 the two co-venture partners decided to end the relationship. Effective November 1, 2017 all 2 million President's Choice Financial bank accounts ‚Äì as well as loans, mortgages, and investments ‚Äì were transferred to Simplii, with Loblaws retaining their credit card portfolio issued by the separately chartered President's Choice Bank.. Because CIBC was already the account provider for PCF bank accounts and other consumer products (excluding credit card and insurance services), all account numbers and terms remained the same.

It was passed by the Massachusetts General Court in 1974 and took effect in April 1975. Studies on its effectiveness have been mixed, and its strict provisions have been subject to criticism. __TOC__ Background and passage The Bartley-Fox Law was co- sponsored by, and named after, Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives David M. Bartley and retired judge J. John Fox. The text mandates a one-year prison sentence for anyone convicted of possession of a firearm without a license in the state of Massachusetts, and added two years to the sentence of anyone convicted of committing a crime with a gun. Bartley- Fox passed the Massachusetts General Court without any significant opposition, becoming the first such law ever to be enacted in the United States. The law was originally intended to come into effect in January 1975, but Bartley led an effort to delay it until April 1 to ensure that the state's citizens were fully aware of the significant penalties. To accomplish this, Bartley-Fox was accompanied by extensive publicity of the fact that the ban on unlicensed possession of handguns would now be strictly enforced. As part of the campaign, TV spots aired beginning in February 1975 with the slogan \\"If you are caught with a gun, you will go to prison for a year and nobody can get you out.\\" Despite these efforts, newspapers reported in April that authorities were \\"swamped\\" with individuals trying to obtain the legally required gun licenses and firearm identification cards. In July 1975, Bartley and Fox authored an op-ed in The New York Times, where they stated that the law was \\"designed to remove the temptation to carry guns and thereby reduce the chance that they will be used ... Only the person who insists on carrying a weapon without legal authority need fear this law.\\" Two months later, they wrote a letter to the editor of the same paper after the two attempted assassinations of US President Gerald Ford: Effects Politically, the Bartley-Fox Law was criticized by both sides of the United States' gun debate. Pro-gun advocates like the National Rifle Association (NRA) opposed it for placing restrictions on a person's ability to carry a gun, with one NRA spokesperson stating that \\"it only affects the lawful gun owner, who is turned into a criminal.\\" Gun control advocates, on the other hand, opposed the law's one year mandatory minimum sentence. Still, a 1981 Gallup opinion poll indicated that 62% of Americans would support state-level legislation like Bartley-Fox, although 58% would oppose any law that would ban handguns‚Äîincluding Massachusetts, which in the same year rejected such a measure for the seventh straight time. As of 2017-08-29, the article's title in ProQuest is \\"[ Globe Staff ... ]: [4]\\". Also in 1981, the administration of Governor Edward J. King removed what they called \\"unfriendly\\" signs on Massachusetts state borders that advertised the Bartley-Fox Law, in an effort to increase tourism. Early research and reporting on the law's effects was mixed. In May 1975, one month after Bartley-Fox went into effect, The New York Times reported that year-over-year gun violence was down for April‚Äîa \\"fragmentary kind of statistic, the sort of preliminary number from which it is dangerous to generalize,\\" in the paper's view, but Massachusetts officials saw it as the \\"first faint suggestion that the tough new legislation may work.\\" One year later, James Vorenberg released a report concluding that in the first year of the law, it had not significantly affected Massachusetts' violent crime rate, nor had it significantly reduced the rate at which guns were used in robberies and other premeditated crimes. A 1977 study by James A. Beha, II concluded that after the law had taken effect, people were being sentenced to prison for illegally carrying firearms five times more often than before it had taken effect. His findings also indicated that criminal justice officials did not frequently attempt to evade the mandatory sentences imposed by the law; instead, people charged with illegal carrying of firearms were generally either convicted in accordance with the law, or were found not guilty. Another 1977 study by Deutsch and Alt reported that the law was associated with a decline in gun assaults and armed robberies, though this finding has been challenged by other researchers. In 1979, Glenn L. Pierce, William J. Bowers, and other researchers reported that the law reduced the rate of gun assault and armed robbery in Boston, and that it also had the unintended effect of increasing citizens' reporting of crime there. Similarly, Pierce and Bowers reported in 1981 that the law reduced the rate of gun assaults and criminal homicides in Boston, but that the punishments actually imposed by the law did not seem to be responsible for this reduction. They also reported that the decline in gun assaults was more than offset by an increase in non-gun armed assaults. In 1983, James Q. Wilson argued in The Atlantic that: In 1986, the law was subject to criticism after Sylvester Lindsey, a Massachusetts citizen from Cambridge, was sentenced to the one-year mandatory minimum sentence after using an unlicensed gun in an undisputed case of self-defense. In a unanimous opinion, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court stated that there was no leeway in the law for the court to consider any alternative, even though \\"it is possible that the defendant is alive today only because he carried a gun that day for protection.\\" The controversy led to a series of articles in The Boston Globe, and Lindsey's sentence was eventually commuted by the Massachusetts Governor's Council.The Boston Globe articles included:   * * In 1989, the Globe noted that crime had increased significantly in the lower-income neighborhoods of Boston, leading \\"some public officials to question whether Bartley-Fox has lived up to its promise.\\" The same article noted that some officials had been critical of the law for not being tough enough, stating, \\"The one-year mandatory jail term, officials say, applies to people who illegally carry a firearm on their person, but not to those who unlawfully maintain a gun on private property.\\" One year later, the Globe reported that increased enforcement of the law had resulted in a reduction in the number of pending cases working through Boston's legal system, from 86 to 8. In addition the force caught 36 fugitives who had been evading their prison sentences, and were able to remove 16 names due to court acquittals and deaths. In a 1997 book Targeting Guns: Firearms and Their Control, criminologist Gary Kleck argues that even if one assumes that the Bartley-Fox Law was effective in reducing crime in Massachusetts, this may not mean that different mandatory sentencing gun-carrying laws would be effective if they were implemented elsewhere. A 2004 National Research Council report concluded that \\"collectively, this body of research seems to suggest [that the Bartley- Fox Law had] a broad impact on gun crime in Boston. However, it is unclear whether the firearms sentencing enhancement or the mandatory sentence for illegal gun-carrying generated the impact.\\"  See also  * Constitutional carry * Gun laws in Massachusetts References Category:Firearm laws Category:Massachusetts law Category:1974 in Massachusetts Category:1974 in American law ","title":"Bartley-Fox Law"},{"id":"54926537","text":"Caulerpa simpliciuscula is a species of seaweed in the Caulerpaceae family.

His laboratory studies neurotransmission and artificial neural networks by combining in vitro and in vivo experimental approaches with quantitative analysis and computational models developed in silico. Education Silver was educated at Coventry Polytechnic where he graduated in 1986 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Physical Sciences. He completed postgraduate study at University College London where he was awarded a PhD in Neuroscience in 1990 for research investigating calcium signalling and second messenger systems in neural growth cones. Research and career Silver's work has contributed to our understanding of synaptic and neuronal function and to information processing in the brain. By developing and applying methods for quantifying synaptic properties his work has shown how central synapses transmit and transform signals and can sustain high frequency signalling. He has quantified the functional properties of electrical synapses and established how neurons can perform certain arithmetic operations. Using theoretical approaches, he has provided insights into the structure and function of neural circuits, showing that synaptic connectivity within the cerebellar input layer is optimal for encoding information and separating overlapping activity patterns. Silver's group have developed new tools for studying circuit function. These include a high-speed random access 3D scanning fluorescence microscope that uses an acousto-optic lens to scan and focus the laser beam, enabling measurement of spatially distributed neuronal activity at high speed. He has also coordinated the development of software for building models of neural circuits, (neuroConstruct), a language for standardising model descriptions (NeuroML), and a repository of standardized models and infrastructure for collaborative model development, OpenSourceBrain.

Forbes is known for leading a 2013 investigation into alleged misspending by the Te K≈çhanga Reo Trust Board.  Early life  Forbes was born as Joanne Forbes in and grew up with her mother in Feilding, New Zealand. Her father is a MƒÅori bushman of NgƒÅti Paoa and NgƒÅti Maniapoto heritage, and her mother is PƒÅkehƒÅ (non-MƒÅori). Although Forbes' grandmother was fluent in the MƒÅori language (te reo), she rarely spoke it at home and preferred to speak English to her granddaughter. As a child, Forbes was deeply interested in journalism and storytelling, using a tape recorder to deliver fictional news and weather bulletins for her family. Forbes graduated from Feilding High School in 1990. When she turned 19 or 20, she attended a MƒÅori- language immersion college and became fluent in te reo. Despite originally being known as Joanne, Forbes changed her name to Mihingarangi after her immersion experience ‚Äì she and her fellow students had translated their names into MƒÅori during the programme, and the new name stuck.  Career  After finishing school, Forbes worked at a bar for a year before moving to Auckland. In 1993, she read community news for Tainui Radio. Despite her lack of formal journalism training, in the 1990s Forbes was offered an internship with TVNZ's MƒÅori news programme Te Karere. Following the birth of her first child in 2001, she worked briefly as a producer for Radio New Zealand. After that, Forbes worked as producer for the TV3 current affairs show 20/20. In 2008, Forbes was working at TV3's current affairs show Campbell Live, earning a Qantas award for 'Best Reporter for Daily Current Affairs'. During her time on the show, she conducted an infamous interview with businessman Alasdair Thompson, challenging his earlier comments about women earning less pay because of their menstruation cycles. = MƒÅori Television = In 2012, Forbes joined MƒÅori Television as the producer of news show Te KƒÅea. In February 2013, Forbes became presenter of MƒÅori Television's current affairs show Native Affairs. During a well-known 2014 interview with Jamie Whyte ‚Äî a political candidate for ACT New Zealand ‚Äî Forbes exposed his ignorance of the MƒÅori health initiative Whanau Ora.  K≈çhanga Reo National Trust scandal  In October 2013, Native Affairs aired an investigation led by Forbes into alleged misspending by the Te K≈çhanga Reo Trust Board. The show had obtained credit card transaction details of one board member and the general manager of the trust fund's charitable subsidiary. The day after the show aired, Education Minister Hekia Parata and MƒÅori Affairs Minister Pita Sharples met several trust board members at Parliament to discuss the allegations.  Resignation  On 4 June 2015, Forbes announced her resignation from MƒÅori TV on Twitter. Media reports suggested that her departure from MƒÅori TV was related to increasing editorial pressure on her work ‚Äì her followup story on the Kohanga Reo National Trust had been held back, delayed without a clear explanation why.

Their plan involved a return to steam boilers, which had been replaced by diesel engines in all ships designs after the Type 1942 destroyers. No ships were ever built, as the end of the war was rapidly approaching.  Development  The Type 1945 destroyer was designed in 1945, based upon the design of the Type 1936D and E destroyers, the plans for which were later accidentally destroyed by fire. They were designed during a time when Germany was prioritizing construction of submarines, with little to no effort going into her surface fleet, making the odds of the Type 1945 destroyers, or any other type of ship which was designed after 1942, being constructed, near zero. However, the Konstruktionsamt (Construction Department) continued to create designs for surface ships until the end of the war. Before the design was even created, Germany was restricting the use of her surface fleet; after the sinking of the German battleship Bismarck on 27 May 1941, heavy restrictions were placed upon surface ship commanders' tactical freedom. Around the time the design was created, after the sinking of the German battleship Tirpitz on 12 November 1944, most of Germany's surface ships were being pulled back entirely, to serve only in the Baltic Sea. From the spring of 1945 to near the end of the war, the Kriegsmarine was almost entirely focused upon resupplying and supporting garrisons along the Baltic Coast. Later on, in May, the Kriegsmarine embarked upon the task of evacuating hundreds of thousands of civilians and soldiers from the east, ahead of the Soviet forces which were rapidly pushing westward. The Type 1945 destroyers were designed to be able to defend against submarines, light naval forces, and aircraft, particularly torpedo bombers. Their design differed greatly from previous ones in that it utilized steam turbines, rather than diesel engines. Overall, their design gave them 12% higher engine performance despite having lighter machinery, and a more powerful main armament with a shorter hull. The project never made it past the drawing board, and no ship of the class was ever ordered or laid down.  Characteristics  The ships of the Type 1945 destroyer class were to be long at the waterline and long o/a, have a beam of , a draught of , and displace at standard load, at full load, and at deep load. They were to have a complement of 350, and carry two motor pinnaces, one torpedo cutter and a motor dinghy. They were to be armed with eight SK C/41 guns, placed in four twin turrets, with 1,440 rounds of ammunition, four L/76.5 guns, with 5,000 rounds of ammunition, twelve L/66.6 M-44 guns, with 24,000 rounds of ammunition, eight total torpedo tubes, placed in quadruple tubes on her deck, with 16 torpedoes, and 100 mines. They were to have high- angle (anti-aircraft) director ship gun fire-control systems, placed on their fore and aft, which were to be fitted with radio direction finders. They were to be propelled by two three-bladed propellers, two sets of Wagner turbines, four Wagner-Deschimag boilers feeding high-pressure superheated steam (at and ), intended to give her , and a speed of , , or , depending on if they were at standard load, full load, or deep load, respectively.

He was born at Westminster and died at Chelsea, both in London. Whymper was educated at Eton College and at Trinity College, Cambridge. He played cricket as a middle- or lower-order batsman at Eton and appeared twice in the annual Eton v Harrow cricket match. At Cambridge, he played several times for the university side in 1849 without ever making much impact, sometimes batting as low as No 11; despite an unimpressive record, he was picked for the 1849 University Match against Oxford University, when he made 7 and 5 in his two innings. After 1849, he played only single first-class matches in each of the next three seasons. While at Cambridge, Whymper was also reported to have been involved in the formulation of the Cambridge rules of 1848 for football. Whymper graduated from Cambridge University in 1851 with a Bachelor of Arts degree, being placed third in the Classics Tripos list for his year; earlier, he had been awarded the Craven Scholarship. He was admitted as a lawyer at Lincoln's Inn in 1851, but then pursued a career as a factory inspector, responsible for the enforcement of workplace safety and employment law under the various Factories Acts.

It solves a problem by evolving a small population of candidate solutions by means of relatively simple arithmetical operations. MPS is a metaheuristic as it makes few or no assumptions about the problem being optimized and can search very large spaces of candidate solutions. For problems where finding the precise global optimum is less important than finding an acceptable local optimum in a fixed amount of time, using a metaheuristic such as MPS may be preferable to alternatives such as brute-force search or gradient descent. MPS is used for multidimensional real-valued functions but does not use the gradient of the problem being optimized, which means MPS does not require for the optimization problem to be differentiable as is required by classic optimization methods such as gradient descent and quasi-newton methods. MPS can therefore also be used on optimization problems that are not even continuous, are noisy, change over time, etc.  Background  In a similar way to Differential evolution, MPS uses difference vectors between the members of the population in order to generate new solutions. It attempts to provide an efficient use of function evaluations by maintaining a small population size. If the population size is smaller than the dimensionality of the search space, then the solutions generated through difference vectors will be constrained to the n - 1 dimensional hyperplane. A smaller population size will lead to a more restricted subspace. With a population size equal to the dimensionality of the problem (n = d), the ‚Äúline/hyperplane points‚Äù in MPS will be generated within a d - 1 dimensional hyperplane. Taking a step orthogonal to this hyperplane will allow the search process to cover all the dimensions of the search space. Population size is a fundamental parameter in the performance of population-based heuristics. Larger populations promote exploration, but they also allow fewer generations, and this can reduce the chance of convergence. Searching with a small population can increase the chances of convergence and the efficient use of function evaluations, but it can also induce the risk of premature convergence. If the risk of premature convergence can be avoided, then a population-based heuristic could benefit from the efficiency and faster convergence rate of a smaller population. To avoid premature convergence, it is important to have a diversified population. By including techniques for explicitly increasing diversity and exploration, it is possible to have smaller populations with less risk of premature convergence . = Thresheld Convergence = Thresheld Convergence (TC) is a diversification technique which attempts to separate the processes of exploration and exploitation. TC uses a ‚Äúthreshold‚Äù function to establish a minimum search step, and managing this step makes it possible to influence the transition from exploration to exploitation, convergence is thus ‚Äúheld‚Äù back until the last stages of the search process . The goal of a controlled transition is to avoid an early concentration of the population around a few search regions and avoid the loss of diversity which can cause premature convergence. Thresheld Convergence has been successfully applied to several population-based metaheuristics such as Particle Swarm Optimization, Differential evolution , Evolution strategies , Simulated annealing and Estimation of Distribution Algorithms. The ideal case for Thresheld Convergence is to have one sample solution from each attraction basin, and for each sample solution to have the same relative fitness with respect to its local optimum. Enforcing a minimum step aims to achieve this ideal case. In MPS Thresheld Convergence is specifically used to preserve diversity and avoid premature convergence by establishing a minimum search step. By disallowing new solutions which are too close to members of the current population, TC forces a strong exploration during the early stages of the search while preserving the diversity of the (small) population.  Algorithm  A basic variant of the MPS algorithm works by having a population of size equal to the dimension of the problem. New solutions are generated by exploring the hyperplane defined by the current solutions (by means of difference vectors) and performing an additional orthogonal step in order to avoid getting caught in this hyperplane. The step sizes are controlled by the Thresheld Convergence technique, which gradually reduces step sizes as the search process advances. An outline for the algorithm is given below: * Generate the first initial population. Allowing these solutions to lie near the bounds of the search space generally gives good results: s_k =(rs_1 * bound_1/2, rs_2 * bound_2/2, ..., rs_n*bound_n/2) where s_k is the k-th population member, rs_i are random numbers which can be ‚àí1 or 1, and the bound_i are the lower and upper bounds on each dimension. * While a stop condition is not reached: * Update threshold convergence values (min\\\\\\\\_step and max\\\\\\\\_step) * Calculate the centroid of the current population (x_c) * For each member of the population (x_i), generate a new offspring as follows: ** Uniformly generate a scaling factor (F_i) between -max\\\\\\\\_step and max\\\\\\\\_step ** Generate a vector (x_o) orthogonal to the difference vector between x_i and x_c ** Calculate a scaling factor for the orthogonal vector: *** min\\\\\\\\_orth = sqrt(max(min\\\\\\\\_step^2 -F_i^2,0)) *** max\\\\\\\\_orth = sqrt(max(max\\\\\\\\_step^2 -F_i^2,0)) *** orth\\\\\\\\_step = uniform(min\\\\\\\\_orth, max\\\\\\\\_orth) ** Generate the new solution by adding the difference and the orthogonal vectors to the original solution *** new\\\\\\\\_solution = x_i + F_i * (x_i - x_c) * orth\\\\\\\\_step * x_o * Pick the best members between the old population and the new one by discarding the least fit members. * Return the single best solution or the best population found as the final result.

After reading German and French at Durham University, he was both a student and instructor in the Joint Services School for Linguists, during which time he studied Russian at Cambridge. He arrived in Glasgow in 1963, and taught and developed courses at Strathclyde, where he received a PhD in 1977. He had a successful stint as chairman of the university's Department of Modern Languages from 1985 to 1993. In the course of what The Scotsman described as his \\"55-year love affair with the Russian language\\", Wade wrote a dozen books about grammar and linguistics, including his Comprehensive Russian Grammar (1992) and Russian Etymological Dictionary (1996). The Times has called his works \\"classics in their field\\", and Wade is considered one of Britain's pre-eminent Russianists. He was awarded the Russian government's prestigious Medal of Pushkin in 1996. Biography =Early life= Wade was born in 1930 in Southend-on-Sea, Essex ‚Äì his father Leslie was a cellist, and his mother Jessica a harpist. He was an only child. His mother's family was from Cloughjordan, County Tipperary; her uncle was the Irish revolutionary leader Thomas MacDonagh, and her brother the oboist Terence MacDonagh. Wade has written that \\"my late mother ... first encouraged me to learn Russian\\". He lived above a shop selling musical instruments, which his parents ran. After attending Southend High School for Boys, Wade went on to study German with subsidiary French on a scholarship at University College, Durham, graduating with first-class honours in 1953. After graduating, Wade spent a year at King's College London teaching German. =Joint Services School for Linguists= The military base in Bodmin, where Wade studied and taught Frustrated by his postgraduate research, and at his mother's suggestion, he undertook two years of military service and enrolled in the Joint Services School for Linguists. The JSSL had been established in 1951 to teach the Russian language, as the British government feared a lack of Russian linguists when faced with the threat of Soviet invasion. Its other recruits included Alan Bennett, Michael Frayn and Dennis Potter. Wade was first taught Russian intensively at the University of Cambridge by Professor Elizabeth Hill, and transferred to the Victoria Barracks, Bodmin in Cornwall. After gaining a first-class interpretership, he became an instructor () in Russian and Polish for the JSSL at Bodmin. In 1956, he transferred to Crail Airfield, Fife. His style of teaching has been described as similar to a conventional schoolteacher or university don, when compared to the eccentricity of non- British staff members. Wade met his wife Mary McEwan, then a classics undergraduate at the University of St Andrews, when the two took part in an avant-garde production of Aristophanes' The Clouds ‚Äì they married in 1958. In 1960, Wade and his wife moved to Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, where he joined the Royal Army Educational Corps. =University of Strathclyde= The Livingstone Tower on the John Anderson Campus, former home of the University of Strathclyde's Division of Russian Studies Three years later, Wade helped to establish the postgraduate diploma in Russian at the Scottish College of Commerce in Glasgow, which became part of the University of Strathclyde the following year ‚Äì it was an intensive course in Russian intended for teachers of other languages, and later for graduates in fields like politics and economics. Wade taught classes on Russian grammar, literature and political thought, and also helped to design the new university's Bachelor of Arts degree in Russian. In 1968, Wade graduated from the University of London with a first-class degree in Russian with Polish, and in 1977 he received a PhD from Strathclyde: his dissertation was about Russian prepositions. As well as teaching and planning courses, Wade served as a mentor to his colleagues and a counsellor to his students. He was promoted to senior lecturer in 1969, reader in 1981, and professor in 1987. In 1985, at the behest of his colleagues, he became the chairman of the university's Department of Modern Languages, serving two terms in the role until 1993. In 1988, the University Grants Committee decided that the university's Italian and Spanish sections should be closed as they lacked the resources to provide for their students; Wade successfully campaigned for their survival. He worked to strengthen the university's link with the University of ≈Å√≥d≈∫, and for several years, he and his wife travelled to the isolated village of Konopnica, southwest of ≈Å√≥d≈∫, to teach English to academics without pay. The Scotsman describes his leadership as \\"quiet [and] unassuming but very effective\\", and \\"enormously successful in strengthening the image of the department throughout the university\\". The Times writes that Wade's knowledge of conflict and other cultures allowed him to \\"lead the department with sensitivity, and without being corrupted by the power he could command as chairman\\". Wade formally retired from his post in 1995, but remained an honorary research fellow. The university began to discontinue its BA in Russian shortly before Wade's death in 2005, and the postgraduate diploma that he developed was transferred to the University of Glasgow in September 2004. In a letter to The Scotsman in June 2004, Wade denounced \\"the dismantling of innovative Russian departments at Heriot-Watt and Strathclyde universities\\" and Russian's \\"virtual disappearance from [school] timetables\\" in Scotland. =Other work= Wade set and marked examinations for the Scottish Examination Board, and served as an external examiner for other universities. He was a member of the Russian, Slavonic and East European Languages Panel of the Research Assessment Exercises from 1992 to 1996, and a member and fellow of the Scottish branch of the Institute of Linguists. Wade was the British representative on the presidium of the International Association of Teachers of Russian Language and Literature (). He was also chairman and president of the Association of Teachers of Russian, and edited its journal.

The company was founded in 2012 and became well known through its participation in Techstars in 2013, Shark Tank in 2014 and Beyond the Tank in 2015. Plated's founders, Nick Taranto and Josh Hix, earned a deal on Shark Tank that fell through, but negotiated a deal with another investor after the show was filmed. The company accepted several rounds of venture capital investments and remained private until it was acquired by Albertsons in September 2017. History Plated delivered meals in the form of weekly boxes that contain ingredients and also include recipes to be cooked by hand by the customer using the pre-ordered ingredients. Founded by Harvard Business School classmates Nick Taranto and Josh Hix in 2012 and launched that November, the company was selected to be in the Spring 2013 Techstars NY class. It raised $1.4 million in seed round financing in May 2013 led by ff Venture Capital with angel investors that included TechStars, Manischewitz Company CEO Alain Bankier, Facebook's Andrew McCollom, and Paige Craig. The company surpassed 100,000 meals delivered in the northeast and midwest regions of the United States by July 2013 and sought series A financing to begin nationwide service. That month, Plated appeared on episode 22 of the fifth season of Shark Tank, which aired on April 4, 2014; on the show, Plated struck a deal with Mark Cuban of $500,000 for 6% of the company. However, the deal never closed because Taranto and Hix, who had initially asked for a $500,000/4% deal on the show, wanted to renegotiate the deal based on growth after the show. Four months after the deal with Cuban fell through, the Plated founders made a deal with Shark Tank's Kevin O'Leary for an undisclosed sum. In January 2014, Plated earned $5 million of Series A venture capital funding. The company raised an additional $15 million in funding in August 2014 of what was called new Series A funding from Venture Capital Dispatch. In the company's first three years, the company moved into sequentially larger fulfillment centers 14 times due to growth. The company was featured in the second episode of the first season of Beyond the Tank, which aired on May 8, 2015. By the following month, the company was expected to surpass $100 million in revenue for the year. In July 2015, Plated raised $35 million in Series B funding. It extended its series B funding by $20 million in the third quarter of 2016. On September 20, 2017, Plated was acquired by Albertsons for $200 million. In April 2018, Albertsons began selling Plated meal kits in some of its stores. In November 2019, Albertsons announced it was ending Plated's subscription service with the last delivery date being November 27, 2019.

She made eight voyages for the EIC before she was sold. She participated in two notable incidents in which East Indiamen bluffed superior French naval forces from engaging. In January 1797, on her third voyage, in the Bali Strait Alfred and five other Indiamen sent off a French squadron of six frigates without a shot being fired. In February 1804, at Pulo Aura, during her sixth voyage she participated in a notable engagement with a French squadron. After her last voyage for the EIC Alfred served as a storeship and a hulk. Career =EIC voyage #1 (1791-1792)= Captain James Farquharson sailed from Torbay on 2 February 1791, bound for St Helena, Madras, and China. Alfred reached St Helena on 28 March, St Helena on 13 June, and Penang on 17 July. She arrived at Whampoa anchorage on 25 August. Homeward bound, she crossed the Second Bar on 23 October, reached St Helena on 22 February 1792, and arrived at Long Reach on 18 April. Long Reach. =EIC voyage #2 (1794-1795)= War with France broke out in 1793, so following the EIC's standard operating procedure on 22 February 1794 Farquharson received a letter of marque. The British government held her at Portsmouth, together with a number of other Indiamen in anticipation of using them as transports for an attack on √éle de France (Mauritus). It gave up the plan and released the vessels in May 1794. It paid ¬£241 17s 6d for having delayed her departure by 9 days. Farquharson sailed on 2 May 1794 from Portsmouth, bound for China. Alfred arrived at Whampoa on 6 October. Homeward bound, she crossed the Second Bar on 23 December, reached St Helena on 13 April 1795, and arrived at Long Reach on 25 July. =EIC voyage #3 (1796-1798)= Farquharson sailed from Portsmouth on 17 May 1796 bound for China. Alfred reached the Cape on 2 August, Madras on 11 November and Colombo on 28 November. There she gathered five other Indiamen, , Canton, , , and . As the senior EIC captain, Farquharson was the commodore of the fleet. Together they sailed for Canton. On 28 January 1797 the Indiamen were off Java when they encountered six French frigates. Farquharson proceeded to organize a bluff. To give the impression that the convoy consisted of the powerful ships of the line that the Indiamen resembled, Farquharson ordered his ships to advance in line of battle, and the French retreated, convinced they were facing a superior force. The Indiamen sailed east and then up towards China. Ocean wrecked in a storm the next day. Alfred was at Amboina on 9 February 1797 where she advised that Ocean had wrecked. Alfred arrived at Whampoa on 8 April; the other four surviving East Indiamen also arrived that day or the next. Homeward bound, Alfred crossed the Second Bar on 9 June, reached the Cape on 2 December and St Helena on 3 January 1798, and arrived at Gravesend on 3 April. On his return, the EIC thanked Farquharson and awarded him 500 guineas.Biden (1830), p.210 =EIC voyage #4 (1799-1800)= Farquharson sailed from Portsmouth on 2 April 1799, bound for Madras and China. Alfred reached Madras on 31 July, Penang on 18 September, Malacca on 10 October, Balambangan on 6 December, and Sulu on 25 December. She arrived at Whampoa on 16 February 1800.

Homeward bound she crossed the Second Bar on 20 March, reached St Helena on 10 July, and arrived at Northfleet on 17 September. =EIC voyage #6 (1803-1804)= Captain Farquharson sailed from the Downs on 6 May 1803, bound for China. War with France had resumed so Farquharson required a new letter of marque. He received one on 1 July 1803, i.e., in absentia. Alfred arrived at Whampoa on 13 October. The Royal Navy was unable to provide an escort and the captains of the EIC's China Fleet debated about setting out for home. Farquharson in particular opposed sailing without an escort. Still, the Fleet crossed the Second Bar on 31 January 1804. On 14 February 1804, the China Fleet, under the command of Commodore Nathaniel Dance, intimidated, drove off and chased a powerful French naval squadron at Pulo Aura. Dance's aggressive tactics persuaded Contre-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Durand Linois to retire after only a brief exchange of fire. Dance then chased the French warships until his convoy was out of danger, whereupon he resumed his passage towards British India. Alfred was one of the Indiamen that actually exchanged fire with the French, in her case for about 15 minutes, and that at long range. Alfred reached Malacca on 19 February. On 28 February, the British ships of the line and joined the Fleet in the Strait and conducted them safely to Saint Helena in the South Atlantic.Lloyd's List, n¬∞4478. Alfred was at Penang on 1 March, and reached St Helena on 9 June. escorted the convoy from St Helena to England. Alfred arrived at Northfleet on 16 August. On their return to England Nathaniel Dance and his fellow captains were highly praised. Saving the convoy prevented both the EIC and Lloyd's of London from likely financial ruin, the repercussions of which would have had profound effects across the British Empire.Maffeo (2000), p. 193. The various commanders and their crews were presented with a ¬£50,000 prize fund to be divided among them, and the Lloyd's Patriotic Fund and other national and mercantile institutions made a series of awards of ceremonial swords, silver plate and monetary gifts to individual officers.James (1837), Vol. 3, p.251. Lloyd's Patriotic Fund in particular gave each captain a sword worth 50 pounds. =EIC voyage #7 1807-1808)= A change of captain necessitated a new letter of marque. Captain George Wellstead received one on 23 December 1806. He sailed Alfred on 26 February 1807 from Portsmouth, bound for St Helena, Bencoolen, and China. Alfred reached St Helena on 15 May and Bencoolen on 9 September. She was at Penang on 20 November and Malacca on 20 December, and arrived at Whampoa on 14 February 1808.

Biography  Herbert was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1829 to Irish immigrant parents Catherine and Nicholas Michael Herbert. She began writing at a young age, following in the footsteps of her older half-sister Sarah Herbert. Herbert also had four younger siblings, Catherine Anne (b. 1831), John Otway Cuffe (b. 1833), Nicholas Livingston (b. 1836), and William Black (b. 1838). Herbert was active in the Wesleyan Methodist evangelical group and the temperance movement. Herbert was a member of the Benevolent Society and the Temperance Society. Herbert died in at her father's home in Halifax on July 15, 1872 after a long illness of \\"chronic gastroses\\" which was likely tuberculosis.  Career  Herbert founded The Mayflower, or Ladies' Acadian Newspaper in 1851 as a periodical directed at women featuring local writers devoted to Methodism. Much of her work with The Mayflower was published under the pseudonyms Marion, M.E.H., M., and H.. The Mayflower's last publication was in February 1852. Through The Mayflower, Herbert published her novellas \\"Emily Linwood; or The Bow of Promise\\" and \\"Ambrose Mandeville\\". Herbert was the first Nova Scotian woman to edit and publish a magazine. After her sister Sarah's 1846 death, Mary Eliza Herbert published The Aeolian Harp, a collection featuring poetry from both Sarah and herself, in 1857. Herbert published Flowers by the Wayside: A Miscellany of Prose and Verse in 1865 at her own expense. Flowers by the Wayside thematically focuses on women's struggles. Herbert's novels were exclusively self-published as Nova Scotia had no book publishing firms in her lifetime. Her shorter works were published in several Halifax newspapers including the Acadian Reporter, the Halifax Morning Sun and The Nova Scotian.

Early life  Corley Smith was born 9 June 1922 in Bolton, then in Lancashire, the younger son of Thomas Smith (born 1874-?) a teacher, and Nena Alice Brown (1887-1932). His elder brother was Gerard Thomas Corley Smith who went on to become a British diplomat. In the 1930s, he took a modern languages degree at Cambridge University. During the Second World War he fought with the Manchester Regiment in Italy. The Manchesters saw much action during the Battles for the Gothic Line in August‚ÄìSeptember 1944, including the Battle of Montegridolfo. At the end of the War he began a newsman's career initially editing a frontline newspaper for the military.  Journalism  In the early 1950s he joined Reuters as a correspondent in Asia. His first assignment was covering the Korean War and he then moved to Saigon until 1956, and then took various other posts before becoming freelance in 1963. He continued to write for a variety of publications and journals including This is Japan where he wrote an article on the Katakana where he mentions that he was a regular visitor to Tokyo.  Author  Corley Smith's first novel was Two Drops of Blood published by Ernest Benn, in 1959. In reviews, this was described as a fast moving novel about the day-to-day lives of foreign correspondents. It is set in Vietnam against the background of the Indo-China War. The Deep-Freeze Girls was written in collaboration with Eva Defago and was first published by Michael Joseph in the UK, in 1964. Defago - an alumni herself - and Corley Smith took the lid off girls' finishing schools in Switzerland in a comic novel that takes on increasing overtones of pathos as it moves along. A review of the book summarised, \\"The common ‚Äúdumping‚Äù of wealthy teenage girls from throughout the world into the deep freeze of a Swiss finishing school such as the fictional Pensionnat de Jeunes Filles Villa Joyeuse by what the author regards as ‚Äúthoughtless, selfish parents‚Äù has prompted her to write the book. It's entertaining, if somewhat sensational, and the story is balanced and told with the sometimes amusing idiom of youth.\\" Defago was said to have run a hotel in the Swiss Alps and was an alumnus of such schools. The novel became a minor best seller and there were plans to turn it into a film starring Nancy Kwan, Sue Lyon and Grayson Hall, and directed by Zoe Clarke-Williams. Jay Weston is quoted as saying, \\"Ray Stark and I once developed a movie called The Deep Freeze Girls, based upon the novel about a group of spoiled rich girls in a posh boarding school in Switzerland. It was never made when we could not get a suitable script\\" Corley Smith is also quoted in the 1967 edition of This is JapanThis is Japan, Vol 14, Publisher Asahi Shimbun that he had written or was writing a book called Maiko dealing with Kyoto‚Äôs apprentice geisha but no record of a published book has been found.

The film stars Blake Lively, Jude Law, and Sterling K. Brown, and follows a grieving woman who sets out for revenge after discovering the plane crash that killed her family was a terrorist attack. The Rhythm Section was released in the United States on January 31, 2020, by Paramount Pictures. The film received mixed reviews from critics and was a box-office bomb, having the worst wide- opening weekend of all time and the biggest drop in theaters, with Paramount projected to lose $30‚Äì40 million.  Plot  Three years after her family's death in a plane crash, Stephanie Patrick has become a drug-addicted sex worker in London. She is approached by journalist Keith Proctor, who believes the plane crash was a terrorist attack covered up by the government. Escaping her brothel, Stephanie starts living with Proctor and studies his research on the crash, which he explains was caused by a bomb made by a man named Reza, who attends university in London. Stephanie buys a gun and finds Reza, but cannot bring herself to shoot him and is humiliated when he indirectly mocks her and leaves. Hours later, she returns to Proctor's apartment and finds him murdered. Through Proctor's notes, she discovers his confidential source is \\"B\\", a disgraced MI6 agent named Iain Boyd. She travels to Scotland and finds Boyd living in seclusion; after she explains that she has nothing to lose and wants revenge, he reluctantly agrees to train her to hunt down Reza. Boyd explains that Reza was hired by a terrorist known only as U-17, who downed the plane to kill liberal Muslim reformer Abdul Kaif; Kaif's father Suleman funded Proctor's investigation into the crash. Stephanie trains for months to assume the identity of Petra Reuter, an assassin killed by Boyd whose body was never found. As Petra, Boyd sends her to Madrid to find Marc Serra, an ex-CIA agent turned information broker, who may lead her to U-17. Stephanie asks Suleman to finance her mission; he refuses, but Kaif's mother Alia offers her the money. Stephanie tracks down Reza and leaves him to die in a bus bombing. Alia thanks her and returns her father's ring. Realizing that Serra is U-17 and has been lying to her from the beginning, Stephanie kills him with a syringe at his home. Two weeks later, Boyd confronts Stephanie in London, revealing that he will be allowed back into MI6 if he eliminates \\"Petra\\". Warned to disappear, Stephanie walks away having finally found peace.  Cast  * Blake Lively as Stephanie Patrick, a woman who lost her entire family in a plane crash, causing her to develop a drug addiction and become a prostitute to support her habit. Upon learning that the crash was staged, she trains for months under a former spy, learning combat, intelligence-gathering, and disguise skills, and taking the identity of freelance assassin Petra Reuter. * Jude Law as Iain Boyd, a former MI6 operative who now lives in a cabin somewhere in rural Scotland.

It had a production budget of around $50 million, and was produced by EON Productions, the film company known for producing the James Bond films. Principal photography on the film began in December 2017 in Dublin, Ireland. Production was halted temporarily after Lively was injured on the film set, with filming scheduled to begin again in June 2018. Sterling K. Brown joined the cast, as production resumed in Spain in mid-2018. In July 2018, filming took place in Almer√≠a with Law and Lively. Steve Mazzaro composed the film score, with additional music provided by Lisa Gerrard, and Hans Zimmer serves as score producer to the film. Remote Control Publishing has released the soundtrack. Release The film was originally scheduled to be released on February 22, 2019, but was pushed back to November 22, 2019 following Lively's on-set injury, and later again to its ultimate release date, January 31, 2020. Reception =Box office= In the United States and Canada, the film was released alongside Gretel & Hansel, and was originally projected to gross $9‚Äì12 million from 3,049 theaters in its opening weekend. However, after making just $1.2 million on its first day (including $235,000 from Thursday night previews), projections were lowered to $3 million. It went on to debut to $2.8 million, marking the worst opening weekend ever for a film playing in over 3,000 theaters. It is estimated the film will lose the studio $30‚Äì40 million. The film made $1 million in its second weekend, and then its third weekend made $25,602. It was pulled from 2,955 theaters (97.5%, 3,049 to 94), marking the largest third-weekend theater drop in history, beating The Darkest Minds record of 2,679. =Critical response= On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 28% based on 159 reviews, with an average rating of 4.74/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Blake Lively delivers an impressive lead performance, but The Rhythm Section plods predictably through a story that could have used some flashier riffs.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 45 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews.\\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"C+\\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported it received 2.5 out of 5 stars in their polling, with 35% of people saying they would definitely recommend it. Peter DeBruge, writing on the film in Variety, noted that Stephanie‚Äîunlike the female assassin protagonists in Atomic Blonde, Red Sparrow, and La Femme Nikita‚Äîdisplayed a realistic \\"near-incompetence in the face of danger [that] makes her relatable in ways very few cinematic assassins have ever been.\\"  References   External links  * Category:2020 films Category:2020s action drama films Category:2020s spy films Category:2020s vigilante films Category:American films Category:American action drama films Category:British films Category:British action drama films Category:English- language films Category:American films about revenge Category:British films about revenge Category:Films about aviation accidents or incidents Category:Films about terrorism in Europe Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films set in London Category:Films set in Madrid Category:Films set in Marseille Category:Films set in New York City Category:Films set in Scotland Category:Films set in Surrey Category:Films set in Tangier Category:Films shot in Ireland Category:Films shot in Spain Category:Paramount Pictures films Category:Eon Productions films Category:Films directed by Reed Morano ","title":"The Rhythm Section"},{"id":"54930152","text":"Catherine J√©r√©mie (1664-1744), was a midwife and botanist in New France.  Early Life and Family  Catherine J√©r√©mie was baptized in Champlain, Quebec on September 22, 1664 to Jeanne Pelletier and trader No√´l J√©r√©mie. She was the eldest of 11 siblings; She is proceeded by Marie-Charlotte (baptized April 26, 1667), Nicolas (baptized February 1669), Francois (baptized 1671), Marie- Madeleine (born 1674), Louis (born 1676), Ignace (born October 29, 1684), Marie-Jeanne (baptized July 28, 1678), Charlotte-Judith (baptized November 23, 1705), and finally Joseph (baptized August 6, 1687). J√©r√©mie married Jacques Aubuchon in Champlain, Quebec, on January 28, 1681, and together they had one daughter. On November 3, 1688, J√©r√©mie married Michel LePailleur in Batiscan, Quebec. J√©r√©mie and LePailleur together had 10 or 11 children. J√©r√©mie died July 1, 1744 in Montreal, Quebec.  Scientific career  In 1702 J√©r√©mie settled in Montreal with husband Michel LePailleur where she pursued her studies and research in botany and midwifery. She was particularly interested in the medicinal practices of the Indigenous populations of Canada. She studied these medicinal plant uses and further discovered many remedies. She applied these findings to her knowledge of women's bodily experiences. J√©r√©mie was one of the earliest botanists in Canada and the first female naturalist known to date. She was known in the French scientific world for providing the French naturalist scientists with detailed reports of the plants they collected and sent their collections to the Jardin des Plantes in Paris, encouraged by the French Acad√©mie des Sciences in order to collect Canada's flora and fauna. Colony intendant Gilles Hocquart noted her practices as significant in his reports to France and these collections are now preserved at the Mus√©um National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris. Overall, J√©r√©mie made a large contribution to natural science in New France. J√©r√©mie's knowledge of herbal plants increased her reputation and practice as a midwife, as she was able to apply these uses specifically to women's bodily experiences such as abortion, pregnancy and birth. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, most midwives engaged in a private practice, were less costly than doctors, and stayed at their client's homes for longer periods of time while helping with household chores. J√©r√©mie used the interventionist approach to healthcare, which contradicted the laissez-faire approach of many English scholars. She soon became known as a famed midwife and was referred to as \\"la magicienne de ma vie au Quebec\\" (the magician of my life in Quebec) by one of her clients.

He was eventually trusted to hunt down his former comrades. History Thomas Henley departed Boston for the Red Sea in 1683 alongside Thomas Woolerly and Christopher Goffe. Successful, they returned to the Caribbean the following year. In May 1685 Goffe and Henley arrived in Bermuda with a Dutch prize ship. Governor Coney tried to have Henley arrested but his own citizens and soldiers refused to prosecute him and Coney was forced to release Henley. Though Henley had a privateering commission from Governor Lilburne of the Bahamas, the governments of Jamaica and New York publicly proclaimed both Henley and Goffe to be pirates. Goffe was prolific enough in the area that a small island was named for him, known as Goff's Caye; another nearby island was named for pirate Joseph Bannister. Woolerly sailed to New Providence in June 1687 asking to resupply. He announced that he had Goffe aboard, having taken him in when he was in dire need of assistance. Because Goffe had been named as a pirate, Woolerly was denied entrance, despite having his own commission from Lilburne. Instead Woolerly left and sailed to Andrews Island where he burned his ship, shared out his loot, and purchased another vessel to return to New England. Goffe made his way to Boston, and ‚Äúin a very sick and weak condition‚Äù asked for and received a pardon for his piracies in late 1687. Goffe, members of Henley‚Äôs crew, and others admitted to having been pirates, but were not prosecuted for lack of evidence and witnesses, and were allowed to keep their treasure. By August 1691 Goffe had been commissioned as a privateer by Massachusetts Governor Simon Bradstreet. Assigned to patrol Cape Cod and Cape Ann, he was tasked with bringing in pirates George Dew and Thomas Griffin.

It is based in Burnham, Slough, England. The concept behind Pickle is to provide a streamlined, peer-to-peer platform that allows users to complete jobs for one another, while challenging the stigma of seeking help by incorporating social media. Users can negotiate how tasks are completed as well as payment, which is processed through PayPal. Pickle takes a 10% commission from the both users in each transaction. One unique feature of the app is the ability to facilitate dares which users are then rewarded for completing. Examples include shaving one's head or streaking in public. Pickle has been compared to rival services TaskRabbit and Handy, however the integration of social media and commenting allows for more flexible transactions than in other services, according to the creators. The app is specifically targeted at Millennials and Generation Z. Development Pickle founder Daneh Westropp was inspired to create the app after herself running away from home and school at the age of 15 and discovering a niche for Millennials wanting to make money while remaining independent. According to Westropp, Pickle aims to remedy the \\"boring interactions with the consumer\\" found on rival platforms by being \\"a social platform for jobs\\". The app's name refers to the ability of on-demand, outsourced labour to get oneself out of a 'pickle'. The app was launched on iOS and Android in June, 2015, to widespread acclaim from publications including Gizmodo and ShortList. Pickle gained over 1,500 user registrations in its first month of operation, the majority of whom are in the United Kingdom. In January 2017 Pickle was relaunched on iOS, with an updated Android app currently under development. Within months the userbase grew to over 90,000 people around the world. Features As the app does not impose a definition of what a job is, users are free to request everything from mundane tasks to elaborate dares. Pickle uses geolocation to connect users located near each other, however jobs which do not require physical presence can be completed from anywhere. Pickle users are divided into two groups: Do and Need. Users who \\"do\\" are those looking to complete jobs for payment, whereas users who \\"need\\" are those who post job listings. Each job listing includes several criteria such as a deadline for completion or specific instructions. Other users can then bid to be accepted for the job. As the payment can be advertised from the beginning, the bidding process also incorporates completion time and quality of execution, as well as users asking questions about the job. Job-posters are also able to cover additional costs of purchasing items that might be needed to complete their task, so as not to leave the user completing the job out of pocket. Users looking to complete jobs can search on a map for opportunities near them. The app includes a filtering system through which users can search only for jobs matching their specific skillset, such as hairdressing or handyman work. These skillsets can also be viewed by job-posters, giving them insight into the background and abilities of each bidder. Users can also choose to be notified if a job is advertised matching their skillset, location and price range. Pickle also links with users' Facebook and Twitter profiles, while additional social features allow users to negotiate payment either publicly or privately. Users who have successfully bid to complete a job can also make phone calls with the job-poster. Other social features include public comment threads on each job listing, the use of hashtags, and galleries on users' profile pages.

Some of Henley‚Äôs crew left his ship while in the Indian Ocean, sailing back to the Caribbean and then to New England with Woolerly. They were tried for piracy (which they openly admitted) but were acquitted for lack of evidence and witnesses, and were allowed to keep their treasure.

Origin of name  The exact origin of the name is not known, but there are two thesis: * The first, defended by Sauval and Cenalis who think the name Truanderie comes from the word ugly meaning in old language and popular term lazy, worthless, beggar . Those who maintain this aphorism say that in 1313 this street was called la Truanderie because it was at the northern end of Paris, along the walls of Philippe- Auguste because it was inhabited by rascals, fortune-tellers, and it was a real court of miracles. * The second, defended by Jaillot who thought the name comes from truage , meaning taxes. Indeed, there were street from Great Truanderie, office or were perceived import duties on goods entering Paris.  Location  In 1817, the Rue de la Petite-Truanderie, a length of 52 meters, began at number 16-18 rue Mond√©tour and finished at number 13-18 rue de la Grande-Truanderie. It was located in the former 5th district in the Montorgueil. The numbers in the street were black one. The last number were odd number 15 and the last was the even number number 16. Currently, part of the 1st district Halles district , with a length of 34 meters, began at number 16 Mondetour Street and ends at number 11 Rue Pierre Lescot and Rue de la Grande Truanderie.  History  Place formed by the side of the even numbers of the Rue de la Grande-Truanderie (left) and the side of the odd numbers of Rue de la Petite-Truanderie (right). The Rue de la Petite-Truanderie, like Rue de la Grande-Truanderie, was already built in 1250. Its location was formerly part of the small fief of Th√©rouenne, about half of which was ceded to Philippe-Auguste by Adam, archdeacon of Paris, then Bishop of Th√©rouenne. Robert Cenalis, in his History of France, dedicated in 1555 to Henry II , named the Rue de la Petite-Truanderie Via Mendicatrix minor. She also wore the street names of Puits-d'Amour and Rue de l'Ariane . It is quoted in Le Dit des Rues de Paris by Guillot de Paris under the name Rue de la Petite-Truanderie. A ministerial decision of 28 Prairial year IX (17 June 1801), signed chaptal fixes that the least width of this public road be 10.5 meters. At the junction of Pirouette, Mondetour, La Petite-Truanderie and Grande-Truanderie streets were the crossroads of the tower on which the Puits-d'Amour was located. It forms the south side of a triangular square, the north side of which is formed by the Rue de la Grande-Truanderie and the west by Mond√©tour Street. Formerly, this square was occupied by buildings.  Access  The street in Little Truanderie is served by the line at the metro station Les Halles , by the station Ch√¢telet - Les Halles.

He was employed under Hofkapellmeister Ludwig Daser until September 1559, when his voice broke and he was given a stipend to study in Venice. Presumably his teachers would have included Claudio Merulo, the organist at San Marco, and Annibale Padovano. Italian influence is evident in a 6-part Battaglia printed in a Venetian anthology of 1564. In 1563 he returned to Munich as organist, a post shared with two Italian colleagues in the newly expanded Hofkapelle now led by Orlando di Lasso. Vento was fostered by the famous composer, as shown by inclusion of his work in a collection of 6-part masses (1564/65) as well as the 1569 Madrigals and its 1575 sequel. In summer of 1568 the crown price Wilhelm V, having married Renata of Lorraine, moved part of the court to Landshut and made Vento director of the affiliated kapelle. For unknown reasons this position was taken over a year later by Antonius Gosswin, Vento remaining as organist and director of the boys, among whom was Leonhard Lechner. Vento was back at the Munich court as organist at the start of 1570, months before the dissolution of the Landshut Kapelle. Though Lasso's letters give no evidence, Vento could have studied with him, since the masses found in mss of the 1560s and 70's show his influence, and a number of the 5-part Latinae cantiones (1570) are on texts also set by Lasso. Nevertheless, his style is not especially dependent on Lasso's. From 1569 on Vento was unusually productive, the Munich printer Adam Berg issuing 11 collections, including four volumes of motets and a Viersprachendruck, a title which alludes to Lasso's own four-language publication. Ivo de Vento died in Munich in September 1575, barely 31 years old and leaving a widow and at least one son, Ferdinand de Venndo. Ferdinand succeeded him at the Munich court, became trumpeter to Archduke Ferdinand in Graz in 1599 and remained in the Emperor's service, dying in 1623.

The family was circumscribed in 2017 by mycologists Otto Miettinen, Alfredo Justo and David Hibbett to contain the type genus Gelatoporia and three other related genera, Cinereomyces, Obba, and Sebipora. Taxonomy In a 2012 publication, Miettinen and Mario Rajchenberg introduced the name \\"Cinereomyces clade\\" to accommodate a small group of white-rot polypores of uncertain position in the order Polyporales. Further analyses confirmed that this clade represents a separate lineage from the Polyporaceae. The genus Gelatoporia, upon which the family is based, was defined by Tuomo Niemel√§ in 1985 to contain poroid crust fungi with a monomitic hyphal structure, clamped hyphae, and producing white rot. Description The fruit bodies of the Gelatoporiaceae are crust-like (resupinate), and have a poroid hymenophore. The hyphal system is typically monomitic (containing only generative hyphae), although in genus Cinereomyces it is dimitic (containing both generative and skeletal hyphae). Clamp connections are present in the hyphae. Spores made by the family are hyaline, smooth, and usually thin-walled but they are somewhat thick-walled in genus Obba. They are non-amyloid and non-dextrinoid. Cystidia are absent from the hymenium, although cystidioles may be present. The mating system is heterothallic, bipolar or tetrapolar, while the nuclear behavior is astatocoenocytic. Habitat and distribution Gelatoporiaceae fungi are saprophytic, and cause white-rot in coarse woody debris. Many of the species have been reported frequently from burned wood, although none absolutely require it as a substrate. Cinereomyces and Gelatoporia have a temperate-boreal distribution in the Northern Hemisphere; the distribution of Obba is similar but it is also found in the Southern Hemisphere. Sebipora is found in tropical Asia. Genera *Cinereomyces J√ºlich (1982) ::C. dilutabilis ::C. lindbladii *Gelatoporia Niemel√§ (1985) ::G. subvermispora *Obba Miettinen & Rajchenb.

Early life Geraldine Fuller was born on September 23, 1933 in Apache, Oklahoma to Sarah (n√©e Ataumbi) and Earl Fuller. Her mother was a member of the Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma, and her father was a member of the Comanche Nation. She was a great-niece of the noted Kiowa artist Silver Horn. Fuller studied at Riverside Indian School in Anadarko, becoming involved in Native American apparel when she was asked to model in 1951 at the fashion show of the Peoria, Illinois Indian Arts and Crafts Association. From the age of twenty-one, she wore nothing but American Indian-inspired clothing. She attended courses at the University of Oklahoma in the early 1950s, before moving to St. Louis, Missouri, where she worked at McQuay-Norris. In 1954, Fuller married Richard Greeves, an artist and the couple moved to Fort Washakie, Wyoming, where Jeri set up a studio on the Wind River Indian Reservation. They had their two daughters Teri (born 1970) and Keri (born 1971), who would both become noted Native American artists. Career In 1965, Fuller established a gallery and trading post for American Indian arts and crafts. She also began collecting Native American apparel. Though it was unusual for an American Indian woman to operate a business at that time, Fuller had wanted to find ways to help Native artists promote their work since she was a child. Many of the works she carried featured the beadwork of the nearby Arapaho and Shoshone artists, but she carried a wide variety of arts and crafts made by diverse indigenous Americans. She began giving fashion shows to showcase various examples of tribal dress. She operated the trading post until her divorce in 1988 and then relocated to Santa Fe, New Mexico. Fuller volunteered at the Indigenous Language Institute and worked at both the Institute of American Indian Arts and the Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian, as a docent. In 1990, she legally changed her name to Jeri Ah-be-hill and began working at Arrowsmith's Gallery, providing year-round fashion exhibitions. Ah-be-hill did not see herself as an artist, but rather someone who had gained knowledge from buying for many years and who could educate others about Native American dance regalia and historical clothing. In 1991, she was elected to the board of directors for the Southwestern Association for Indian Arts (SWAIA) and began directing the fashion show and contest for the Santa Fe Indian Market. Ah-be- hill was quick to point out the differences in Native fashions from more mainstream clothing. They were not \\"costumes\\", which she equated to dress-up games, but rather culturally significant clothing and often handmade in tribally specific styles. Over the years that she directed the fashion contest, she saw an increase in contemporary design, which was judged in a separate category. After seventeen years of directing the popular style show at the Santa Fe Indian Market, Ah-be-hill stepped aside as chair in 2008, but continued to serve as an event advisor. When she was not involved with the Indian Market, Ah-be-hill traveled widely presenting educational talks on Native fashions both throughout the United States and internationally. She also curated events such as the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History traveling exhibit on Silver Horn, which toured the country in 1995 and included pieces from her collection of her great-uncle, Silver Horn's work. In 2010, she served as a Native representative for the Caen Festival of Normandy, France. In 2011, she was the recipient of the Povi‚Äôka Award of the Santa Fe Indian Market in recognition of her leadership and support to Native American artists and communities. Death and legacy Ah-be-hill died on March 11, 2015, in Santa Fe. Between 2014 and 2016, an exhibit held honoring Native American women artists, featured part of the collection of Jeri Ah-be-hill, and works by Margarete Bagshaw, and Josephine Myers-Wapp and were displayed at the Museum of Indian Arts and Culture (MIAC) in Santa Fe. The three were honored in 2016 by the MIAC for Women's History Month.

History  The Hontoria guns were designed by Jos√© Gonz√°lez Hontoria a Spanish inventor, field marshal of marine infantry and brigadier of the navy. During the 1800s Spain lagged behind other European powers in industrialization and Spain imported weapons from Krupp, Armstrong Whitworth and Schneider et Cie. During the 1860s and 1870s, Hontoria studied explosives, metallurgy, and industrial production with the aim of developing an indigenous arms industry.  Construction  In 1879 Hontoria designed a series of naval guns ranging from to which would lay the foundation for his later guns. The 1879 series like Ord√≥√±ez guns of the same period were breech loading, black powder, built up guns, with steel A tube and cast iron reinforcing hoops. The 1883 series was a step forward in that they were breech loading, built up guns, with forged steel A tube and forged steel reinforcing hoops. The Hontoria 1883 series ranged in size from to and were 35 calibers in length. They were produced by the Arsenal de la Carraca in Cadiz and the Royal Ordnance Works at Trubia in Asturias. During the 1890s some 12 cm, 14 cm and 16 cm were converted to quick fire guns with assistance from Schneider et Cie. Criticisms of the 1883 series guns: * Outdated design - Some argue that the 1883 series production methods were outdated compared to its European rivals. The counter argument is Spain only recently switched to producing steel weapons and purchasing a foreign design would do nothing to promote self- sufficiency in weapons design and production. Also that the cost of retooling to produce another design would have meant that recent infrastructure improvements were a wasted investment. * Slow rate of fire - Some argue that the 1883 series should have been designed as quick firing weapons from the beginning and that attempts to convert them to quick firing were unsuccessful. The counter argument is that Spain didn't have that experience and it would have meant delaying production schedules when they were already delayed due to insufficient industrial capacity. * Short barrel length - Some argue that the 35 caliber length was too short when compared to its European rivals who were producing 45 caliber guns and that the short barrel length didn't leverage the power of new smokeless powders efficiently. The counter argument is that Spanish industry didn't have the capacity to produce longer barrels, having only recently switched to steel production. Also that the powders of the time needed reformulation to increase efficiency and increasing barrel length was only partial fix.  Naval Use  14 cm Hontoria 1883 guns armed a variety of ships such as armored frigates, armored cruisers and ironclads of the Spanish Navy. Armored Cruisers: * Infanta Maria Teresa-class - The three ships of this class had a secondary armament of eight single mount 14 cm guns. Four were in sponsons, while four were in casemates amidships. All three were sunk during the Battle of Santiago de Cuba in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. * Emperador Carlos V - The secondary armament of this ship consisted of eight single mounts 14 cm guns. Four shielded guns were in upper deck sponsons amidships, while another four were in lower deck casemates amidships. Armored Frigates: * Numancia - The tertiary armament of this ship consisted of eight single mounts 14 cm guns after a 1900 refit. Ironclad Battleships: * Pelayo - The tertiary armament of this ship consisted of nine single mounts 14 cm guns. Eight were in casemates amidships, with a ninth chaser gun in the bow. The Pelayo was in the middle of a refit during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War which was supposed to replace her 16 cm and 12 cm Hontoria guns with 14 cm Hontoria guns. She was recalled to service before the refit was complete and saw no action during the war.  Ammunition  The guns used separate loading, bagged smokeless powder charges weighing and projectiles.

History It was founded by Phagmo Drupa Dorje Gyalpo (, 1110‚Äì1170) who was the elder brother of the famous Nyingma lama Ka Dampa Deshek (1122‚Äì1192) founder of Katok Monastery. Before meeting Gampopa, Dorje Gyalpo studied with Sachen Kunga Nyingpo (sa chen kun dga' snying po) (1092‚Äì1158) from whom he received lamdre transmission.Stearns, Cyrus. Luminous Lives: The Story of the Early Masters of the Lam dre in Tibet. Wisdom Publications. In 1158 Dorje Gyalpo built a reed-hut hermitage at Phakmo Drupa (\\"Sow's Ferry Crossing\\") in a juniper forest in Nedong () high above the Brahmaputra River. Later, as his fame spread and disciples gathered, this site developed into the major monastic seat of Dentsa Thel (). Following his death the monastery declined and his disciple Jigten Sumg√∂n sent Chenga Drakpa Jungne () (1175‚Äì1255), a member of the Lang () family, to become abbot and look after the monastery. Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen (1302‚Äì1364) was born into this Lang family. In 1322, he was appointed by the Sakyapas as the Pagmodru Myriarch of Nedong and given the title \\"Tai Situ\\" in the name of the Yuan emperor. Soon he fought with a neighboring myriarchy trying to recover land lost in earlier times. This quarrel displeased the Sakya ruler (dpon- chen) Gyelwa Zangpo () who dismissed him as myriach. Following a split between Gyelwa Zangpo and his minister Nangchen Wangts√∂n (), the former restored Changchup Gyeltsen to his position in 1352. Taking advantage of the situation, Changchup Gyeltsen immediately went on the offensive and soon controlled the whole of the central Tibetan province of √ú. Gyelwa Zangpo and Changchup Gyeltsen were reconciled at a meeting with the Sakya lama K√ºnpangpa (). This angered Nangchen Wangts√∂n, who usurped Gyelwa Zangpo as Sakya ruler and imprisoned him. In 1351 Changchup Gyeltsen established an important Kagyu monastery at the ancient Tibetan capital of Tsetang. This was later dismantled during the time of the 7th Dalai Lama (18th century) and replaced by a Gelugpa monastery, Gaden Chokhorling.Dorje, Gyurme. Tibet Handbook: The Travel Guide. Footprint 1999. p.185 In 1358, Wangtson assassinated Lama Kunpangpa. Learning of this, Changchup Gyeltsen then took his forces to Sakya, imprisoned Wangts√∂n, and replaced four hundred court officials and the newly appointed ruling lama. The Pagmodrupa rule of Central Tibet (U, Tsang and Ngari) dates from this coup in 1358.Berzin, Alexandra A Survey of Tibetan History: 4 The Pagmodru, Rinpung, and Tsangpa Hegemonies As ruler, Changchup Gyeltsen was keen to revive the glories of the Tibetan Empire of Songts√§n Gampo and assert Tibetan independence from the Yuan dynasty of the Mongols and from Ming China. He took the Tibetan title \\"Desi\\" (sde-srid), re-organized the thirteen myriarchies of the Yuan Shakya rulers into numerous districts (), abolished Mongol law in favour of the old Tibetan legal code, and Mongol court dress in favour of traditional Tibetan dress.Norbu, Dawa \\"China's Tibet Policy\\".

The subsequent rule of the Phagmodrupa Dynasty lasted until 1435 followed by the Rinpungpa kings who ruled for four generations from 1435‚Äì1565 and the three Tsangpa kings 1566-1641. In 1406 the ruling Phagmodrupa prince, Drakpa Gyaltsen, turned down the imperial invitation to him to visit China. From 1435 to 1481 the power of the Phagmodrupa declined and they were eclipsed by the Rinpungpa () of Tsang, who patronized the Karma Kagyu.

Clark and later owned and maintained by Anaconda Copper. During its 74 years of operation, it was the only major amusement park in the entire state. History The St. Ann Street site that became the Columbia Gardens was actually the second park by that name. The first was established in 1888 by John Gordon and Frederick Ritchie, on land leased from William Adams in the Horse Canyon section of East Butte. The first site did not have sufficient trolley service to make visits worthwhile for every day visitors, and so it was not financially successful. Adams sold out to William A. Clark in March 1899, who was looking for a way to curry favor in an attempt to become a U.S. Senator. He decided on a public park for the benefit of the citizens of Butte. He won election in 1898, but was unseated by the Senate after 14 months of his term due to rumors of corruption in his election. (He would be sent back to the Senate in the 1900 election.) Clark had Jesse R. Wharton (1857‚Äì1923), manager of his Butte Electric Railway Company, scout for a better location near their trolley routes. The location at the east end of St. Ann Street was chosen, and the first 21 acres were purchased (later expanded to 68 by 1925). After relocation and new construction, the new park was opened to the public on June 4, 1899. Clark died in 1925, and his copper holdings and the trolley line (which included the park) were sold to Anaconda Copper in 1928. The park continued to be a tourist attraction for local residents and visitors to the \\"Richest Hill on Earth\\", with Anaconda investing more into the park to benefit its workers and lessen the impression it did not care about them or the community. Amenities The park had one of the last operational gravity-fed wooden roller coasters (installed 1906), in addition to an airplane ride and a carousel designed by Allan Herschell Company (installed 1928). The original roller coaster was named \\"Figure 8\\" from its shape, and was a three level ride; after a 1917 accident, it was reduced to two levels for 1918, and Anaconda changed the layout to a more out-and-back style in 1929. The park included picnic tables and a playground which included special tandem swings that riders tried to \\"crack\\" by getting them to their maximum swing distance. They also had a greenhouse where they grew the flowers used in all the custom floral arrangements for the grounds, in such shapes as a butterfly, a harp, and Anaconda's arrowhead logo. Up to the 1930s, they also had a petting zoo and a lake; the lake was turned into a parking lot in 1937. The site also had a baseball park for Butte's earliest amateur and minor league teams, and a grand pavilion with arcade which housed the park's concessions and a world-class ballroom, which hosted local proms and many of the Big Band era performers. The park did not charge admission, banking on revenues from the trolley line to the site; Anaconda continued this policy, even after replacing the trolley with bus service in 1937. Children 16 and under rode the trolley/bus to the park free every Thursday, \\"Children's Day\\", during the summers from 1903 until the park's final Thursday, August 30, 1973. 1973: Closure and fire When Anaconda's copper mines in Chile and Mexico were nationalized in 1971, the company lost most of its revenue sources. The Berkeley Pit was encroaching on the north side of the park, and local residents were wondering how long it would take \\"the company\\" to take the park, too. In early 1973, Anaconda announced the park's 1973 season would be the last. The park closed September 3 (Labor Day), and the usual fall storage for the park rides was accomplished, mostly in the grand pavilion's arcade. Before efforts for relocating the rides to a new site could be fulfilled, the park caught fire and burned down on November 12. The official fire investigation report cited an overloaded electrical transformer, even though power to the site had been shut off two months before. Local residents who knew the way Anaconda conducted its business assume they used the oldest trick in its book when needing to clear land they wanted for mining: arson. The Continental Pit would soon eat up the former park site. Legacy In Montana, known as \\"The Treasure State\\" for its mineral resources and natural beauty, the stories of the Columbia Gardens would be passed down for generations. The surviving tandem swings were relocated to city parks. The southbound lanes of Interstate 15 pass just east of the former park site before intersecting with Interstate 90. Despite all the smaller temporary amusement rides at the state and regional fairs, and a few water slide parks, no major amusement park of the scale of the Columbia Gardens has been attempted in Montana since. When Butte broadcaster and historian Pat Kearney wrote his 1994 book about the park, the publisher's summary described the park as \\"a treasure more valuable than all the copper, silver and gold taken out of the mines in Butte.\\" The story of the park is the subject of a 1999 documentary film by Montana PBS, Remembering the Columbia Gardens, featuring interviews with Kearney and local residents who visited or worked there. Some of these interviewees were also later featured in the 2008 PBS documentary film Butte, America, which covered the larger legacy of Anaconda Copper in American history. The Spirit of Columbia Gardens Carousel The Spirit of Columbia Gardens Carousel is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization that operates in Butte, Montana. Created in 1996, the organization‚Äôs main goal was to recreate the carousel destroyed by the Columbia Gardens fire in 1973. The organization reached its goal and the carousel was open for operation July 27th, 2018. The completed carousel has 32 horses and several low riding carriages. Each completed horse took about 1,000 hours to complete. Most of the labor needed to complete the carousel was donated, as well as the materials. The Spirit of Columbia Gardens has semiotic relation to the original Columbia gardens. The carousel serves as a reminder of the Columbia Gardens, for the community of Butte to ‚Äúreclaim, restore, and preserve an important part of Butte‚Äôs history.‚Äù The meaning of the carousel is as an object, to which it refers to Butte‚Äôs history.

Biography  Uzi Peres was born in Geneva, Switzerland on 21 February 1951 and raised in Tel Aviv. His father, Gershon Peres (1925-2011, better known as Gigi) was a building contractor, and the younger brother of future Prime Minister and President of Israel, Shimon Peres; his mother, Carmela Keyla Peres, was an athlete. His first cousin once removed was American movie star Lauren Bacall. He went to Ironi Dalet High School in Tel Aviv, and then served in the Israeli Defence Force and fought in the Yom Kippur War. After being discharged, he studied Film at Tel Aviv University and the New Sorbonne in Paris. Peres died aged 41 on 31 July 1992, when he was one of 113 people killed on the Thai Airways International Airbus that crashed into a hillside whilst trying to make a bad weather landing in Kathmandu. He left a wife, Bracha, and three children, Sara, David and Michael. Together with the Israel Film and Television Directors Association, the Peres family established an annual prize in Uzi's name, awarded in conjunction with the Tel Aviv Cinematheque, to the director of an outstanding short film. A plaque dedicates to Peres at Tel Aviv Cinematheque includes a quote from one of his early films, Pareil pas pareil (1978), which reads: \\"I would like to be able to turn every moment of life into a celebration, to build memorials to everything beautiful, to all that exists ... in order to preserve and endlessly multiply all that a dream allows.\\"  Film career  Peres began his career with The Wait, a short 16mm film made in Israel in 1974. He continued to work in France, making three more short 16mm works: Choisir (1975), Cath√©drales (1976), which won first prize at the short film festival in La Raincy, and Sans Draps (1977). He also worked as an editor on Fr√©d√©ric Rossif's film La F√™te Sauvage (The Wild Nation, 1976) and television series L'Op√©ra sauvage (1975-1981). Returning to Israel in 1977, Peres became a founding member of Kayitz, also known as the Young Israeli Cinema group, with other filmmakers including Nissim Dayan, Nadav Levitan, Rachel and Yehuda Ne'eman, and Renen Schorr. The group published a manifesto in Kolnoa magazine, insisting that they shared no single ideology or aesthetic principles, but were united by their search of an innovative Israeli film language. Responding to the government's preference to support other arts ahead of cinema, they suggested that Israeli films should be produced with small crews and low budgets, but they also lobbied for increased funding for non-commercial cinema, which led to the foundation of the Fund for the Encouragement of Original Quality Films in 1978. He only made one more short in Israel, however - 1978's Hand Exercises, which won a Best Actor award at an Israeli short film competition.Plaque at Tel Aviv Cinematheque, witnessed 30 March 2017. Peres returned to France to make his first feature films: Pareil pas pareil (1978), L'amour mensonge (1979) and Shadow of a Game (1980). The first he directed in Israel was First Love (1982), produced by his sister, Ruth. Here, Yitzhak (played by Hanah Goldblatt) leaves his kibbutz during a midlife crisis returns to his first love, Ziva (Gila Almagor) now aged 40 with two teenage children, with inevitable complications for all involved. His final film, Me and My Wife's Lover, was also made in Israel and produced by Ruth Peres, and released in 1983.

Although based in Australia, its operations eventually extended to six continents. By the late 20th century the company had become the fourth largest iron ore exporter in the world with expansion underway which would have made it equal third. Its biggest asset was a majority stake in Robe River, a major miner of the Pilbara iron ore deposits of Western Australia and the world's lowest cost producer of iron ore. History The company was formed in 1888 as North Broken Hill Silver Mininghttp://www.gabr.net.au/biogs/ABE0860b.htm#related to exploit the rich silver, lead and zinc deposits at Broken Hill in western New South Wales, the name was shortened to North Broken Hill in 1905. Production at the original North Broken Hill mine wound down and it finally closed in 1993.Perilya ramps up efforts to breathe new life into old North Line ABC News 21 October 2016 However over the years the company had diversified into other mining provinces. In 1988 they took over Peko Wallsend Limited, changing their name to the unwieldy North Broken Hill Peko Limited, before settling on the snappier North Limited in 1994.A Proud History North Limited At Broken Hill the company had been known as 'North' to distinguish it from other miners in the area such as Broken Hill South and The Broken Hill Proprietary. The nickname continued long after the company's focus had moved away from Broken Hill, so the new name just formalized what the company had always been known as. By 2000, while North was a widely diversified resource company, iron ore assets represented 44% of its value and investing to begin production at the new West Angelas iron ore mine in the Pilbara was the company's major focus. However money had also been committed to increase production at the Iron Ore Company of Canada and the Northparkes copper and gold mine.. Takeover Like its peer Western Mining, North developed into a large diversified resources company with one special world class asset that attracted attention from huge mining companies across the world. In the case of Western Mining it was the Olympic Dam copper, gold and uranium deposit, for North it was Robe River Iron. In 2000 a bidding war for North broke out when Rio Tinto launched a hostile takeover at $3.80 a share.North Limited Delisted Australia This was topped by an Anglo American bid of $4.20, Rio Tinto responded with a successful offer of $4.75 per share.Rio Tinto sets its sights on North Ltd PM 23 June 2000The battle for North Limited ends AM 5 August 2000Rio Tinto ¬£1.3bn bid wins for North The Daily Telegraph 5 August 2000 The company was delisted and after the takeover, Rio Tinto integrated most of North's assets into its own operations, but sold others such as the Northparkes.

A reprint edition was published by Last Gasp in 2011. The photographs were taken by Tee Corinne, Michael Perry, Jill Posener, and Michael A. Rosen. The photographs are presented without commentary, except for Blank's brief introduction to the volume as a whole. The author wanted to present accurate images of the subject, in contrast to pornographic or medical ones.  History  The word used as the book's title, femalia, was taken from the novel Vox by Nicholson Baker. The photographs by Corinne and Perry had been taken years before the book's original publication in 1993; those by Posener and Rosen were taken specifically for inclusion in the first edition of Femalia. Femalia grew out of Blank's long-term work as a feminist sex educator. She felt that medical and pornographic images of the female genitals were inadequate to her purposes. In her introduction to the first edition, Blank lamented the absence of readily available photographic representations of the vulva other than heavily edited images in male-oriented pornography, and the resulting feeling on the part of a majority of women that \\"in one way or another, their genitals are not quite ‚Äònormal‚Äô\\".  Feminist response  Feminist authors have sharply contrasted the portrayals of vulvas in Femalia with those in typical male- oriented pornography and in biomedical sources. Femalia's portrayals are characterized as accurate, honest, open, and truthful, as exhibiting \\"stark reality\\"; as promoting a positive view of the vulva; as emphasizing the diversity of the vulva in different women, as well as the diversity of opinions and perspectives about the vulva on the part of both men and women; and as emphasizing female autonomy. By contrast, portrayals of the vulva in pornography and in biomedical science are characterized as stylized and uniform, excluding women whose genitalia do not match their models. Pornographic portrayals are further characterized as commodified, and medical portrayals as sterile. Feminist sex educators have advocated perusal of the images in Femalia as an exercise to help women to regard their genitals in a more positive light.  Civil liberties  Librarian Sanford Berman has cited Femalia as an example to illustrate his thesis that libraries engage in inappropriate self-censorship, often motivated by concerns about controversial sexual content, in deciding which books to stock. Berman comments, \\"A detailed, artistic picture of a seashell adorns the cover. Were the contents strictly shell photos, the book might make it into at least some libraries. Shells, yes. Vulvas, no.\\"  Science and medicine  = Research on depiction and perception of female genitals = In a study of systematic differences in the depiction of female genitals in online pornography, anatomy textbooks, and feminist publications, Femalia was used as one of three sources of sample depictions in the feminist-publications category. This study found a statistically significant difference between online pornography and feminist publications in depicted protuberance of the labia minora, with greater mean protuberance shown in the feminist publications. It also found greater variation in measured genital proportions shown in the feminist publications than in the other two categories of sources. Femalia was used as one of two sources of sample depictions of female genitals (the other was Penthouse) in a psychological study of the relationship between women's aesthetic perceptions of female genitals and their attitudes toward gynecological examinations. More specifically, the examinations in question were Pap smears, and the relevant attitudes were anxiety, embarrassment, and likelihood of making or keeping an appointment for a Pap smear. = Educational role in clinical practice = The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) has published a guideline document, authored by Dr. Magdalena Simonis under authority of the RACGP, intended to inform healthcare professionals about female genital cosmetic surgery (FGCS), such as labiaplasty, and to advise them about management of patient requests for FGCS. In this document, Dr. Simonis identifies lack of appreciation of female genital diversity, not only on the part of the public but also on the part of healthcare professionals, as a contributing factor to the demand for FGCS. She advocates the use of Femalia as a tool for patient education about genital diversity, in part because it depicts female genitals without digital enhancement. Dr. Simonis has further referenced this educational use of Femalia in slide and poster presentations intended to promote better management of the demand for FGCS on the part of healthcare professionals. Medical anthropologist Eric Plemons has stated that: :The feminist commitment to ostensibly unmediated representation of ‚Äònatural‚Äô female genitals is one whose value has also been recognized by medical experts; Femalia has had an unanticipated life in clinical literature. Plemons documents the use of Femalia as a resource to demonstrate the existence of female genital diversity, and to educate both clinicians and patients as to the range of normal vulval appearance. He attributes its widespread use by healthcare professionals to their belief that \\"it is one of very few photographic collections of ‚Äònormal‚Äô vulvas that exists\\". = Transsexual genital cosmesis = Femalia has been used as a way of assessing preferences for perineal and genital cosmetic appearance, to improve cosmesis in male-to- female transsexuals (trans women) undergoing genital sex reassignment surgery (GSRS). Beginning in the year 2000, surgeon Neal Wilson began showing photographs from Femalia to his prospective GSRS patients and asking them to indicate which vulvas they found most aesthetically pleasing, as well as which ones they would choose for themselves. Dr. Wilson attempted to approximate through surgery the appearance of the photographs from Femalia selected by his prospective patients, even though he held that they set \\"impossible standards\\" because of the limitations of early 21st-century surgical technique. Dr. Wilson has republished, in an online journal article, the three photographs most often selected by his patients. He has also provided summary statistics concerning his patients‚Ä≤ choices of vulval photographs from Femalia, as well as a short narrative summary of the specific anatomical features that he believed to be characteristic of the most popular photographs.

It formed part of the South African Army Infantry Formation as well as the South African Territorial Reserve. History =Origins= Batavian era Swellendam Commando can trace its origins back to around 1795 with the Republic of Swellendam and the unsafe situation for farmers on its eastern border with Xhosa tribes. =Operations= With the Republic of Swellendam An independent republic had been declared from the Dutch East India Company, declared with a National Assembly and Hermanus Steyn as president. It was a momentous event, but at the same time the British occupied the Cape and the new republic was called on to assist in battle. The republicans refused initially, but a commando of 70 soon left for the Cape. By 1806 with the Second British Occupation, at the Battle of Blaauwberg (6 January 1806), the Swellendam Commando again held the British off long enough for the rest of the Batavian army to retreat to safety. With the Cape Colony The Government dreading a Khoi rising, made peace with the Xhosas. In 1801, another rebellion began where farms were abandoned en masse, and Khoi bands under Klaas Stuurman, Hans Trompetter and Boesak carried out widespread raids. The Swellendam commando under Commandant Tjaart van der Walt, who was killed in action in June 1802, achieved no permanent result. With the UDF By 1940, rifle associations were under control of the National Reserve of Volunteers. These rifle associations were re-designated as commandos by 1948. UDF era National Reserve of Volunteers shoulder tab With the SADF  During this era, the unit was mainly used for area force protection, search and cordones as well as stock theft control assistance to the rural police. With the SANDF =Disbandment= This unit, along with all other Commando units was disbanded after a decision by South African President Thabo Mbeki to disband all Commando Units. The Commando system was phased out between 2003 and 2008 \\"because of the role it played in the apartheid era\\", according to the Minister of Safety and Security Charles Nqakula.

He is best known as being an associate of Ja Rule, Irv Gotti, Cadillac Tah, Chris Gotti and the Murder Inc Records crew. He appeared on hit singles with Ja Rule, such as Murda 4 Life with Memphis Bleek and various songs with Ja Rule and other members of Murder Inc. Early life Gill was born in Brooklyn, New York. His family moved to Queens when he was young. During his childhood years, one of family friends wrote verses for him at the age of 11. While Gill was spitting rhymes in his neighborhood, he began to write some of his own rhymes to use that motivation from his family and friends. Learning his ways of life, he had a few run-ins with the law, doing time in jail for a gun case that lasted only 30 months, while after being signed by Jam Master Jay Records (now defunct after Jay's death in 2002) in 1993, which was a label owned by the late DJ Jam Master Jay. Before that, he was already making songs with a few other aspiring upcoming artists who were trying to make a name for themselves, including Irv Gotti who was under the moniker DJ Irv (whose Gill was around at that time) produced \\"Can I Live\\" for Jay-Z off the Reasonable Doubt album and Ja Rule with \\"Cash Money Click\\" featuring Nemesis and Chris Black. While being incarcerated, he began to write rhymes, joining freestyle battles and showing his unique talent to infiltrate the rap world. After spending a few years in jail, Gill reached out to Ja Rule, showing him his lyrical ability to prove himself as a rapper which Ja Rule liked and accepted him to sign with Murder Inc after being released from Jam Master Jay Records due to a gun charge. Feud with 50 Cent Black Child has also been involved in the Murder Inc. and G-Unit feud, where he, Ja Rule, and other Murder Inc. associates had an altercation with 50 Cent, Tony Yayo, and G-Unit associates at The Hit Factory in New York City, March 2000. Black Child admitted that he stabbed 50 Cent, saying it was in self defense and 50 was the one reaching for a gun. He released a diss song called \\"The Real Wanksta\\" which attacked 50 Cent labeling him as an Informant, which Black Child claims that 50 Cent had filed an order of protection on Murder Inc.

It was the first British-produced talking picture ever shown in England, but it was actually made in Hollywood since that is where the needed sound equipment was at that time. Wilcox sent Neilan to the U.S. to film the picture there, using a mostly American cast and crew. (Alfred Hitchcock's Blackmail (1929) is often said to be the first British talking picture, but it was actually released after Black Waters.) Wilcox went on to star American actors in many of his later British films as well, to make them more appealing to British filmgoers, a practice that Hammer Films did away with after 1957. Black Waters was written by American John Willard, based on his play Fog. Willard was the writer of the successful play The Cat and the Canary (1922), which was filmed several times and ripped off by a number of other filmmakers, and he was trying to repeat his success with this film, only replacing the \\"old dark house\\" setting with that of an \\"old dark houseboat\\". The cast featured Hollywood actor Noble Johnson (of King Kong fame). Black Waters is today considered a lost film. Plot A weird night watchman lures a group of people onto a rundown old yacht at a San Francisco pier at midnight. Once the boat sets sail, the passengers are murdered off one by one, until only two of them (Charles and Eunice) remain, along with a kindly old reverend who turns out to actually be the murderer, a crazy ship's captain named Tiger Larabee who disguises himself as a reverend to pull off a succession of murders.

He rented a soundproofed studio from Charles and Al Christie in Hollywood for five days at ¬£1,000 a day. Wilcox claimed it was the fifth talking picture ever made. He later obtained a license from Western Electric to equip the first sound studio in Europe.Wilcox p 84 Reception Wilcox struggled to get the film exhibited in England, as only a few British cinemas were equipped to handle sound pictures.Wilcox p 84 Historian Chris Howarth stated \\"The film was long thought to have received scant attention upon its initial release, though some modern film critics who have studied the original reviews suggest that it might have been more inventive than originally assumed....\\".

Indigenous peoples of the NSW coast; the Birrbay are spelled \\"Biripi.\\" Language The Birpai language was the speech of the Birpai centred in Port Macquarie. Gadjang is a community language spoken by the six tribes of the Worimi when required to meet. W. J. Enright found 4 elderly speakers of Birpai at Wauchope in 1932. Country Birpai were in possession of some of Mid North Coast land, from Gloucester eastwards to the where the Manning River debouches into the Pacific at Taree. They were mainly located north of the Manning, and on the Forbes, Hastings (Dhungang) and Wilson rivers. Social organization The Birpai, according to A. R. Radcliffe-Brown, had no moieties, but did divide their hordes into 4 intermarrying groups, 4 male phratries: * Wombo * Kurraboo * Wirraw * Murrong marrying into 4 female groups: * Gooran * Karragan * Wangan * Wirragan. Traditions differ as to whether the Birpai alternated between the coast and the hinterland seasonally. According to one tradition, they were divided into two distinct groups: inland women being called Winmurra and those of the coast Mari. The northern birpai pronounced bil pi alternated between inland and coastal camps according to the seasons, heading to locations that would provide best food sources. The modern families quite often still follow these protocols when the modern world allows An annual reunion of the MoB is held on the northern side of the hastings river in October. With descendants attending from far and wide, numbers for these group gatherings continue to increase annually, being held in a culturally significant location known in modern parlance as the coal wharf in contrast to assertions of near extinction claimed by John Heath in his recently released book Birrpai. Beyond the lens of Thomas Dick. The double r spelling relates to the southern mob, whilst one is the hastings river centric northern clans. Then the Biripi lands run along the western borders of said tribes. The Birpai also had personal totems, called mari. The shark, dolphin and stingray are among the main totems of the clans. Murrawin ceremony The Birpai practiced a form of ceremonial, Murrawin, found also among the Dunghutti and Gumbaynggirr. It was described by R. H. Mathews in 1900. Unlike other native rites, this did not require the presence of entire communities: two or three adjoining tribes would meet, choose initiated men from among each, and send them into the bush. They would select a spot several miles away, clear it, and create a 20-foot diameter circle on level ground with banked earth. There they would make bullroarers (gheewarra/guarra, according to the dialect) and return to the main camp. Over the following nights, once some elders had set up another site hundreds of yards away, whirl the bullroarers, while chanting incantations, and strike coolamons rhythmically with a nulla nulla. Gradually, the initiated men trickle over to this thoorapee site until all are gathered in. At this point, a slanging match is started as each tribe hurls invectives at another, The morning after, the whole tribal assembly shifts camp, and women and the young are separated from the men, who then file off, clicking their boomerangs, as they make their way to the ceremonial ring prepared several days earlier, where they dance. On their return, they hunt game, and harvest honey, or grub up edible roots, to bring to the women's camp in procession (ngooraykoo binbinnie), where they all supper together. The men then return to the thoorapee, strip bark and form torches which they set alight and, swinging their firebrands, charge into the women's camp. Three times a boy, whom the women, on seeing the torches, prepare by stripping near their fire, is charged as if he were to be captured. A guardian, in tribal terms his brother-in-law, then, on the third attempt, takes him by the arm, and the tribesmen swing him up onto his shoulders as he is carried off. In the thoorapee camp, the novice is placed prone, and two men straddle his midriff. Two grasp his shoulders, two his legs, and a fifth his loins, and he is raised high off the ground, with the two men still astraddle, and then lowered, thrice. The 7 men then grab their genitals and ask the novice to pay attention. Each then rubs the boy's nose and mouth, and he is then placed on a bed of leaves near the campfire. Feinting forays to poke his eyes out with sticks are fended off by two men wielding nulla nullas. The attackers back off, turned their backs, and walks backwards towards the boy, bending over him and threatening to shit on him. The men armed with nulla nullas intervene to save his honour. Buried in leaves, he must then lie there all night, motionless. When morning breaks, two women elders edge near the camp, and throw boomerangs in, which fall short, and then are joined by the other women, who bear bundles of sticks. They all move towards the men's camp, singing incantations. The boy is once more set astraddle on a man's shoulders and the men tramp to the women's site, where he is let down, while his guardian stands nearby. He is then made to stand, a foot on the each shoulder of the two men who support him, and shown to the women, who throw sticks their way. Then men swarm together and, with spears and shields, form a wall to hide him, and place him back on a man's shoulders and take him back to their camp, where he is again buried in leaves. A group of elders among the men, then return to the women's camp, and successively hand over, first clumps of grass, which the younger boys receive and hold at their chests, and then bundles of sticks, which they grasp after throwing the sheaves of grass away. The men then leave, gathered grass and place it back at their camp on the initiand, while the women pack up and shift camp several miles away. While doing so, they must sing certain songs and eat a restricted diet. The men return to their old camp, and hunt as preparations are made for the last stage, the goorooyoonbang. A dozen men standing astride a twenty-foot pole, three or four inches in diameter, which had been prepared earlier, raise it simultaneously between their legs to knee-height, as the boy sits downcast near the fire. The pole is pointed his way, and the lead man has another on his shoulders, grimacing as he gesticulates wildly. The pole is then placed almost flush to the boy, who must look at it, and the tunnel of legs, and feints are made to thrust it into him, while obscene remarks are made. They back off, turn the pole 90 degrees, and swaying together, hold it before the novice. The pole is dropped with a thud, raised and dropped again several times, bringing the rite to an end. He was rudely awoken by a din of boomerangs thumping shields near his head the following morning, shown a \\"stranger\\" who has been poised, grasping two branches, as if he were trampling on air, and then told to reveal to no one the secrets revealed. They then all return to the women's camp, save for the novice, who must approach it in slow steps, pitching his gunyah every evening closer until, finally, he can enter the men's camp. History of contact The area around Taree was first settled by a naval man, William Wynter, who took up a selection of 2,560 acres there in 1831. Wynter appears to have had very amicable relations with the Birpai, something inferred by the fact that his son William, who grew up among the Birpai, was allowed to go hunting with them, and learnt their language. This is thought to bear witness to the peaceful character of the indigenous peoples themselves. Three years later cedar-cutters were establishing camps along the Manning river. The highland areas and the Falls country around the Manning and Hastings rivers were still sufficiently wild to serve the aboriginal outlaw Jimmy Governor as a sanctuary at the turn of the 20th century.

Biography  Little is known of the details of Francisque's life. Francisque was born in Saint-Quentin circa 1570. On 23 February 1596, in Cambrai, he married Marguerite Behour [Bonhour], daughter of a tavern keeper. The marriage contract, registered in 1605, did not mention Francisque's profession.Jules √âcorcheville, Actes d'√âtat Civil de Musiciens insinu√©s au Ch√¢telet de Paris (1539-1650) (Paris: Soci√©t√© Internationale de Musique, 1907), 41. He moved to Paris shortly afterwards, publishing his Le tr√©sor d'Orph√©e in 1600. On 28 September 1601 he was identified as Anthoine Fran√ßois, a \\"lute player in Paris,\\" in a document registering a mutual beneficiary relationship between him and his wife. The couple had no children at that time and lived in rue Sainte-Genevi√®ve, Saint- √âtienne-du-Mont parish, facing the Coll√®ge de Navarre. He died in Paris on 5 October 1605. He lived in rue de la Huchette and was buried in the √âglise Saint-S√©verin parish.Brossard 1965 (p. 125).  Works  Title page of Le Tr√©sor d‚ÄôOrph√©eLe Tr√©sor d‚ÄôOrph√©e on data.bnf.fr (Paris, 1600). In 1600, Francisque published a unique collection of lute pieces: :: Le tr√©sor d‚ÄôOrph√©e, livre de tablature de luth contenant une Susane un jour, plusieurs fantaisies, pr√©ludes, passemaises, gaillardes, pavanes d‚ÄôAngleterre, pavane espagnolle, fin de gaillarde, suittes de bransles tant √† cordes aval√©es qu‚Äôaustres, voltes & courantes mises par Antoine Francisque. ‚Äì Paris: Pierre I Ballard, 1600. ‚Äì 2¬∞, 32 f., French tablature.RISM FF 1612 I,1 ; Guillo 2003 1600-B. Unique copy in Paris BNF (Mus.): R√©s Vm7 369 (prov. S. de Brossard). Cat. Brossard 529. The sole surviving copy of Le tr√©sor d'Orph√©e is held in Paris, in the D√©partement de la Musique of the Biblioth√®que nationale de France, under the shelfmark RES VM7-369. The volume is dedicated to Henri II de Bourbon-Cond√© (who was only 12 in 1600), with a rather developed preface, rich with several allusions to antiquity. This dedication suggests that this nobleman was Francisque's pupil. The volume contains 71 pieces, including a transcription of Susanne un jour by Roland de Lassus, and a gaillarde made on a lavolta by Perrichon.This is Julien Perrichon, Parisian luthist who still lived in 1595. These are purely instrumental pieces: preludes and fantasies, passemaises and pavanes, gaillardes, branles (simple, double, from Poitou, and Montirand√©) and gavottes, a prelude followed by lavoltas, ballet, and finally a Cassandre.Il s‚Äôagit d‚Äôun branle coup√© ainsi nomm√©, already mentioned by Thoinot Arbeau in 1588. There is no mention of court ballets of the time. Modern editions include: * Transcription for piano by Henri Quittard: Paris, 1908. * Free transcription for piano by Henri-Gilles Marchex : Paris, 1927. * Facsimil√© Minkoff, 1973, 1975 and 1993. Francisque is not named as a composer in any other tablature.Two pieces under the name of Francisque in the manuscript R√©s. Vm7 765 of the BNF actually refer to Francesco Corbetta. Some pieces of the Tr√©sor are in an anonymous form in the Elias Mertel (Hortus musicali novus, Strasbourg, 1615) and Alessandro Piccinini (Intavolatura di liuto, Bologna, 1639) collections.  Legacy  The music in Francisque's 1600 collection Le tr√©sor d'Orph√©e is transitional in style between the Renaissance and Baroque periods, and shows a number of progressive features. The collection contains only one vocal intabulation (Suzanne un jour), two contrapuntal fantasias, and five pr√©ludes; the majority of the seventy-one pieces are dances. These include not only older, Renaissance types like the bransle and passamezzo, but newer, Baroque types like courantes and the first printed gavottes to be written for lute. The music calls for a nine-course instrument, where previous books had never required more than seven courses. It also makes significant use of stile bris√©e, and includes the first French lute music to use an altered tuning. This last point is especially significant, because French composers would embark around 1620 on the exploration of a bewildering array of modified tunings, a period of experimentation that would last about five decades before stabilizing around the standard Baroque D-minor tuning, a radically different system from the tuning in fourths that had been in use since the middle ages. Francisque may therefore be reasonably considered a forerunner of an important historical trend. His altered tuning, which he termed accordes aval√©es, tuned the courses, lowest to highest, to B-flat, E-flat, F, G, B-flat, F, B-flat, D, G; departing from standard tuning or vieil ton by raising the third course by a semitone, lowering the fifth course by a whole tone, and lowering the ninth course by a major third. Georg Fuhrmann, in his large collection of lute music Testudo Gallo-Germanica, printed in Nuremberg in 1615, incorporates instructions in German for intabulating polyphonic vocal music for the lute, which were supposedly based on a French text by Francisque. Francisque's original, however, has not been found. The single surviving copy of Le tr√©sor d'Orph√©e is held by the Biblioth√®que nationale de France in Paris; it contains no such instructions. If Francisque's authorship of Fuhrmann's material is accurate, it points to another publication by Francisque that is now lost. If, on the other hand, it was invented by Fuhrmann, it indicates that his reputation was such that Fuhrmann believed he could use it to add prestige to his own work. Francisque's compositional style has been described as similar to that of Jacobus Reys, who served as lutenist to French kings Henry III and Henry IV, and whose music is known for audacious use of dissonance and difficulty of execution. Henri Quittard's 1906 edition of Le tr√©sor d'Orph√©e for piano is possibly the only transcription of lute music into modern notation that accounts for octave stringing on the lower courses and its effect on voice leading. He accomplished this with the use of small parenthetical noteheads in the higher octave where judged appropriate, similar to the practice in later editions of Baroque guitar music, such as Robert Strizich's edition of de Vis√©e.

She may have assembled a collection of writings and music, the Ledenburg Collection from the manor house where she was born. The collection held music by notable 18th-century composers that seemed lost until it was rediscovered in 2015.  Life  Schloss Ledenburg, the manor house where she was born and lived Born in Schloss Ledenburg, Lower Saxony, Eleonore Elisabeth Helene Sophie von Grothaus was the eldest daughter of the general Ernst Philipp von Grothaus, who served Hanover and the Kingdom of Great Britain, and his wife Anna Friederike von Oldershausen, who inherited considerable properties.Belehnungsurkunde from King Frederick William II of Prussia She grew up in the manor house. She wrote poems, and was interested in art and the sciences. Walter Schwarze, who published her biography in 1928, wrote: In 1759, she married Count Georg von M√ºnster zu Surenburg (1721‚Äì1773), Hofmarschall of the Prince-Bishopric of Osnabr√ºck. He was a widower with seven children. The couple had six more children, including a son, Count Ernst Friedrich Herbert zu M√ºnster-Ledenburg, Freiherr von Grothaus. After her husband died in 1773, she devoted her time mostly to raising the children.

Winter attempts to seduce Ally but is interrupted by the power going out. Harrison alleges that there is a multi-state power outage. Winter flees and abandons Ally by herself with Oz. Ivy, after a frantic phone call with Ally is cut short by Ally's phone dying, sends Pedro to the house with a charger and some other supplies.

Plot On election night, Ally Mayfair-Richards is horrified as Donald Trump is elected President of the United States. Ally's wife Ivy comforts her. Elsewhere, Kai Anderson is delighted by the news, remarking that \\"the revolution has begun\\". Kai's sister Winter, having worked for Hillary Clinton's campaign, is devastated. Winter expresses her fear and Kai contentedly notes that everyone is afraid. Kai attends a city council meeting about security for a local Jewish community center. Tom Chang, a city council member and neighbor of Ally and Ivy, belittles Kai and the motion for increased security is unanimously passed. Ally speaks with her therapist Dr. Rudy Vincent about her fears. She credits Ivy and Barack Obama‚Äôs presidency for the previous assuagement of her anxiety. He suggests medication and a social media purge. Later, Ally visits a grocery store and becomes increasingly paranoid as she shops. In the produce section, she witnesses a pair of clowns having sex. She wields a bottle of Ros√© to defend herself as clowns start to pursue her. She eventually flees the store and calls Ivy in a panic. She crashes her car after a clown pops up in the backseat. At home, Ivy relays that there is no evidence to support Ally's experience in the store. The next day, Ally and Ivy discuss the state of their shared business, a restaurant called The Butchery on Main, and their marriage. They encounter Kai on the street, who unapologetically spills hot coffee on them. Later, Ally and Ivy interview and hire Winter as Oz's new nanny. Privately, Kai interviews his sister, who reveals her deepest fear is of him. Kai harasses a group of Hispanic men on the street by yelling racist slurs and throwing a urine-filled condom at them. The men proceed to beat Kai up while an unseen party films it. While Ally and Ivy have a date night at the restaurant, Winter attempts to desensitize Oz to violence by showing him videos of murders on the dark web. In a moment alone, Oz peers through his bedroom window and observes a group of clowns (the same ones Ally saw in the grocery store) exiting an ice cream truck. Meanwhile, the date at the restaurant falters when Ally claims to have seen another clown. Ally and Ivy arrive home to a cordoned crime scene. Tom Chang and his wife are dead. Oz claims to have witnessed the clowns murder them. Winter dismisses Oz's recollection, claiming that he has an overactive imagination.

The English edition, translated by story consultant Alexis Niki, was published in May 2017 by Le Clown & l‚ÄôEnfant. Content Upon the re-publication of the French version of Writing Drama in 2011, Yves Lavandier decided to extract the book‚Äôs most useful chapters and to create two stand-alone books: Construire un r√©cit and Evaluer un sc√©nario (Analyzing a Script). Construire un r√©cit grew from 50 pages in the French version of Writing Drama to 170, and then to 220 for the 2016 edition. Constructing a Story is a practical handbook on how to write a narrative. Yves Lavandier‚Äôs ambition is to help authors who want to tell a story convey their thoughts and their universe in an accessible way. For this he proposes a method that starts from the meaning the author wants to communicate to arrive at the complete narrative via the steps of the pitch, the foundations, the milestones, the step outline, and the treatment. The general principle of Lavandier‚Äôs approach is: \\"You don‚Äôt build a house starting with the wallpaper.\\" As in Writing Drama, the author puts forth a vision of the three- act structure that differs to that of many Anglo-Saxon theorists and that he considers \\"simple, logical, and more importantly, natural: before the action, during the action, after the action.\\" In addition to several passages covering the work of characterization, a large chapter is dedicated entirely to the character arc, the potential for psychological transformation for one of the characters. The author proposes tools to justify such a transformation and analyzes some twenty works from the specific angle of the character arc. Among these are: The Apartment, Casablanca, A Christmas Carol, Groundhog Day, The Lives of Others, Oedipus Rex, One Flew Over the Cuckoo‚Äôs Nest, One Thousand and One Nights, Schindler‚Äôs List, The Taming of the Shrew, and Toy Story. In his analysis of the beginning of Tootsie, for example, Yves Lavandier points out that contrary to many other analyses, the protagonist (Dustin Hoffman) is not actually characterized as a chauvinist who needs to learn to respect women.  Front cover The cover photo represents romanesco broccoli, a natural example of fractal structure. Yves Lavandier considers the objective- obstacle pairing to be the basic pattern of story, and to follow the fractal principle. In Lavandier‚Äôs view, narrative is the combination, at different scales, of thousands of objective-obstacle pairings and of their resulting mechanisms: the protagonist, the inciting incident, the three-act structure, the climax, etc. The author uses Once Upon a Time in the West to illustrate his point. Reception In the magazine L‚ÄôAvant-Sc√®ne Cin√©ma issue 609 (January 2014), Jean-Philippe Gu√©rand writes : \\"Constructing a Story is a veritable guide of writing know-how in which the author prods his reader and pushes the emerging screenwriter to give his best with sections such as \\"Be ferocious to your protagonist\\" or \\"Make the audience participate,\\" and is applicable to both cinema and television.L‚ÄôAvant-Sc√®ne Cin√©ma (janvier 2014)\\" Screenwriter and game designer Antoine Bauza states: \\"While it can‚Äôt replace the reading of the sacrosanct tome Writing Drama, Constructing a Story is a gold mine in its own right (and an excellent complement) for writers.

COC, CPI(ML) occupied a middle position between the pro-Charu Majumdar group led by Mahadev Mukherjee and the anti-Majumdar group led by Satyanarayan Singh. Failing to articulate a common ideological position, COC, CPI(ML) soon suffered internal divisions and splits. Two of the splinter groups of COC, CPI(ML) in Andhra Pradesh are predecessors of the present-day Communist Party of India (Maoist). Split between Mukherjee and Sharma, emergence of COC, CPI(ML) The emergence of COC, CPI(ML) began in 1973 as the erstwhile secretary of the Punjab branch and Central Committee member of the original CPI(ML), Jagjit Singh Sohal (\\"Sharma\\"), began to distance himself from the line of the late CPI(ML) general secretary Charu Majumdar. Sharma had emerged as the secretary of the pro-Majumdar faction of CPI(ML) but soon developed differences with the other main leader of the faction, Mahadev Mukherjee. Sharma began to distance himself from Majumdar's line of annihilation of class enemies and the original CPI(ML) slogan 'China's chairman is our Chairman'. Mukherjee declared Sharma expelled from the party.Karat, Prakash. Naxalism Today; At an Ideological In October 1973 Sharma formed a new Central Committee consisting of himself, Suniti Ghosh, Sham Chopra and Ram Nath. The Sharma-led group constituted COC, CPI(ML) as a separate party in February 1974, after having established contacts with a number of state committees. COC, CPI(ML) gathered Sharma's group in Punjab, the Andhra Pradesh Committee, Suniti Ghosh from West Bengal and some party cadres from Uttar Pradesh. COC, CPI(ML) published an organ called Liberation. COC, CPI(ML) sought to unite all groups that had been part of CPI(ML) by the time Majumdar had died in 1972, reaffirming that Majumdar's party was the sole true CPI(ML) (thereby rejecting Satyanaryan Singh's break-away CPI(ML)). In Andhra Pradesh The strongest group that had joined COC, CPI(ML) was the Andhra committee under the leadership of Kondapalli Seetharamaiah. As of 1974 the Andhra committee was based in Nagpur. The Andhra committee had five active armed squads and a number of district-level party committees. The squads continued to carry out annihilation actions. Whilst the squads of the original CPI(ML) had been virtually dismantled by January 1974, COC, CPI(ML) reorganised squad actions 1974‚Äì1976. COC, CPI(ML) squad activities were largely limited to Telangana. In Medak district a squad led by Kotagiri Venkati was particularly active, conducting nearly 30 robberies in 1974 and a similar number in 1975. The squad disintegrated after the killing of Venkati on June 25, 1976 in Mupparam, Warangal district. In some parts of Andhra Pradesh COC, CPI(ML) mobilised agitations against landlords and moneylenders. COC, CPI(ML) sought to mobilise the Adivasi population in Godavari forest, although this effort was unsuccessful as no organisation was built amongst the local population. In Dharmavaram taluq, Anantapur district COC, CPI(ML) organised peasants and seized some 1,000 acres. The Dharmavaram struggle came to an abrupt end when the leader of the movement, Sriramulu, and a number of peasants were killed by landlords. COC, CPI(ML) claimed a role in industrial strikes in Nizamabad Cement Factory, Usha Engineering and other locations. COC, CPI(ML) organised agricultural workers' strikes in Hyderabad district (Ankusapuram area), Ongole district, Nellore district and Nalgonda district (Kandakura area), all ended with limited concessions from landlords. The Andhra committee also began organising some mass organisations such as the Radical Students Union and Radical Youth League. COC, CPI(ML) managed to obtain support from intellectuals, writers and poets, organised in the Revolutionary Writers Association (RWA). Sri Sri served as the RWA president. RWA members toured Andhra Pradesh and organised mass meetings, accompanied by musical teams from Jana Natya Mandali. Other states Another group that joined COC, CPI(ML) was the Mass Line group in Kerala. In Kashmir the group of R.P. Saraf agreed to join COC, CPI(ML) but rejected the notion of a centralised party at this stage. Rather Saraf demanded that COC, CPI(ML) would solely function as a coordination body for the time being. Likewise the Uttar Pradesh committee asked that COC, CPI(ML) should be open to all Maoists. Thus COC, CPI(ML) did not agree with the suggestions from Saraf and the UP committee, and these two groups opted not to join the party. Failed attempt at united front In 1975, in response to the Emergency COC, CPI(ML) participated in a meeting organised by Satyanarayan Singh's CPI(ML). The Unity Committee and UCCRI(ML) also participated. The meeting issued a declaration calling for the formation of an 'anti-fascist united front'. However, the united front never materialised as COC, CPI(ML) and UCCRI(ML) denounced the declaration. Soon thereafter COC, CPI(ML) started to disintegrate. 'Road to Revolution' and splits in COC, CPI(ML) COC, CPI(ML) suffered a protracted organisational crisis from the onset of the founding of the party. It failed to re-unite the communist revolutionary movement and formulate a common ideological line for the party. Rather, there were three separate documents issued by different groups, one by Sharma, one by Ghosh and one produced by the Andhra committee of the party. COC, CPI(ML) lacked a unifying theoretical analysis. Rather the members of the party leadership were united by rejection of the two other main lines of the Naxal movement at the time, i.e. those of Mahadev Mukherjee and Satyanarayan Singh. COC, CPI(ML) disagreed with continuation of Majumdar's line without any modifications (i.e. Mukherjee's position), but it could not digest the programme of Singh calling for economic struggles, mass organisations, united fronts, forest base areas and an outright rejection of the annihilation line. In October 1975 the three documents were withdrawn and 'Road to Revolution' was adopted as a compromise measure. 'Road to Revolution' argued that the principal contradiction in Indian context stood between feudalism and the broad masses of the people. It argued in favour of armed struggle, but stated that mass organisation struggles were also valid and that methods of struggle would be determined from local dynamics. The 'Road to Revolution' failed to resolve the political crisis in COC, CPI(ML). The Andhra and Bihar committees of COC, CPI(ML) continued to adhere to the line of annihilation of class enemies. Nevertheless, M. Appalasuri, one of three members of the Andhra committee, called for participation in Lok Sabha elections. As of 1976 the Andhra committee broke away from COC, CPI(ML). Kondapalli Seetharamaiah would later merge his faction to create the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) People's War. Appeal for release of prisoners After the 1977 Lok Sabha election, many political detainees arrested under the Emergency were released. Naxal prisoners, however, did not benefit from this move. On April 9, 1977 Suniti Ghosh of COC, CPI(ML), Satyanaranyan Singh of CC, CPI(ML), Khokan Majumder of Unity Committee, CPI(ML) and Apurba Roy of UCCRI(ML) signed a memorandum to Prime Minister Morarji Desai, calling for the unconditional release of 12 000 revolutionary prisoners and restoration of civil liberties. During the anti-Emergency struggle, the Janata Party had promised to release political prisoners. Once in power however, they had back-tracked on that promise.Mohanty, Manoranjan. Revolutionary Violence. A Study of the Maoist Movement in India. New Delhi: Sterling Publishers, 1977. p. xxv‚Äìxxvi Further disintegration In 1977 a faction led by Ram Nath, gathering the majorities in the Delhi, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh committees of COC, CPI(ML), broke away and formed the Communist League of India (Marxist-Leninist). Suniti Ghosh broke away from COC, CPI(ML) and continued to run a small faction also named COC, CPI(ML). The secretary of the Punjab committee of COC, CPI(ML), Sham Chopra, broke away and joined the T. Nagi Reddy group. In 1979 what remained of Sharma's COC, CPI(ML) suffered yet another split, as some party leaders in Punjab rejected his support for Deng Xiaoping in China and the Three Worlds Theory. In 1982 M. Appalasuri's COC, CPI(ML) faction merged with Bhowani Roy Chowdhury's West Bengal-based CPI(ML) Unity Organisation, forming the Communist Party of India (Marxist- Leninist) Party Unity.Singh, Prakash, The Naxalite Movement in India.

He is known for his work on consumption and material culture as well as icons and nostalgia which are all themes of his book with Ian Woodward, Vinyl: The Analogue Record in the Digital Age (2015). Early life and education Dominik Bartmanski was born on 27 November 1978. He received his Master of Arts degree in sociology and European studies from the University of Exeter in 2005 and his Master of Philosophy degree in sociology from Yale University in 2007. In 2011 he received his Doctor of Philosophy degree with distinction in sociology from Yale University. Career Bartmanski's first academic position was as a Lecturer in the Department of Sociology, TU Darmstadt from 2012. From 2012 to 2015 he was a European Social Fund Postdoctoral Fellow at Masaryk University and for 2014 to 2015 a Visiting Lecturer at Bard College Berlin. Since 2015 he has been a Research Associate in the Sociology Department at DFG-Projekt, TU Berlin. His research relates to material culture, urban sociology, and the sociology of consumption, knowledge, and music. His book with Ian Woodward, Vinyl: The Analogue Record in the Digital Age (2015), received positive reviews for its treatment of the resurgence of the vinyl record as a recording medium from the point of view of material culture and the sociology of consumption. Nabeel Zuberi in the journal of the International Association for the Study of Popular Music praised the authors for the throughness of their research, saying \\"Vinyl is a vital work to spin, mix and play off more textualist feminist scholarship and critical race studies on phonographic culture\\" but felt that the authors could have given more attention to the economic aspects of the vinyl resurgence and noted that most of the interviewees were white European men. Likewise, Paul Winters' review in Popular Music and Society found the book's greatest weakness to be its \\"focus on urban, independent, and electronic users\\", a focus that necessarily leaves much of \\"the story of the vinyl revival untold\\". Anne-Kathrin Hoklas in Information, Communication & Society notes Bartmanski and Woodward's argument that the vinyl revival is not purely nostalgic and that it has occurred not despite digitization but partly because of it. She praised the book for \\"providing a refreshing perspective on contemporary vinyl culture informed by cultural sociology and material culture studies\\". Robin Bartram in Qualitative Sociology praised the authors for the \\"meticulous detail\\" with which they investigated their subject. Writing in the Association for Recorded Sound Collections annual journal, Edward Komara commended the authors for being \\"sturdy academics who know exactly when to leave the discussion of the musical aspects to the musicologists\\". The book's discussion of the physical manifestations of recorded media relates to Bartmanski's work on icons about which he had co-edited and authored a book in 2012 titled Iconic Power: Materiality and Meaning in Social Life and his work on the nostalgic power of the physical symbols of superseded forms such as the vinyl record or the former communist regimes of eastern Europe as evidenced in the streetscapes of Berlin and Warsaw.

It operates in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE, Oman, Qatar, Jordan, and Egypt. Talabat is the largest online food ordering company in the Middle East.  History  Previous logo In 2004, Talabat General Trading and Contracting Company was founded by Abdulaziz Al Loughani and Khaled Al Otaibi in Kuwait. The name \\"talabat\\" derives from the Arabic language and literally means \\"orders\\" or \\"requests\\". As Talabat‚Äôs popularity grew locally, it won the \\"Best E-Business Award\\" repeatedly in 2008 and 2009 with special recognition from the Emir of Kuwait, HH Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah. In 2010, the business was operating out of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia with an average of 1,250 daily transactions. Talabat then underwent key changes such as the re- branding from 6alabat.com to Talabat.com, a shift from a hybrid form of Arabic and English spelling to a pure English spelling. In 2011, a revamp of the platform took place with a new website layout and improvement in user interface. In 2012, Talabat expanded to Bahrain, UAE and Oman. On 19 January 2012, Talabat released its mobile application for Android devices. An app for iOS devices was also released. In 2013, it continued its expansion to Qatar. In 2015, Talabat was acquired by the global German e-commerce group Rocket Internet for US$170 million. It became part of Rocket Internet's business unit Global Online Takeaway Group. In 2016, Rocket Internet's food delivery business, including Talabat, was taken over by online food marketplace Delivery Hero. In line with this acquisition, Abdulhamid Alomar took over as the CEO of the company. In 2017, Talabat expanded its operations to Jordan. In 2019, former Grab executive Tomaso Rodriguez was appointed as CEO, after the stepping down of Abdulhamid Alomar. Lawsuits were filed against the company after they were found violating fair competition rules in Kuwait. A settlement plea made by Talabat was also turned down. In January 2020, food delivery company Carriage, also owned by Delivery Hero, was absorbed by Talabat. In August 2020, it has been confirmed the Egyptian food delivery service Otlob, which was in operation since 1999 and became a Delivery Hero subsidiary in 2016, is getting rebranded as Talabat. As of 1 September 2020, Talabat officially operates in Egypt.  Operation  Restaurants on Talabat benefit from an online ordering presence and are the alternative to telephone orders and pickup options. Talabat users have access to thousands of restaurants according to the user‚Äôs location and the restaurants in the area while filtering by cuisine, ratings, delivery time, minimum order value, payment options or restaurant name. Placed orders are sent to the restaurant‚Äôs point of sale machines, processed and then delivered to the customer‚Äôs address. The service is free to users without any charges. However, variable amount of delivery charges may be incurred depending on the restaurant receiving the order.

It is found in estuarine habitats and saltmarshes on either side of the North Atlantic and the North Pacific Oceans. Description A. modesta grows to a length of about when fully expanded. The foot is broader than the body, and the sides and upper surface, apart for the front third, are covered with cerata (finger-like outgrowths). In young individuals these are organised in up to seven rows, but in adults, the rows are no longer apparent. The anus is set on a papilla on the upper surface near the rear. The integument is translucent, and the branching gut and digestive gland can be seen through the cerata and the surface of the foot. The cerata are involved in respiration and pulsate regularly; this helps move the blood around the body, there being no heart in this genus. The general colour of this sea slug is pale fawn, blotched with brown, green and white. Distribution and habitat The range includes both sides of the North Atlantic; in Western Europe its range extends from Norway to France and in North America, from Newfoundland to New York State. It also occurs on the Pacific coast of North America from British Columbia to California and in northeastern Asia where it is present in Peter the Great Gulf and the Yellow Sea. Its habitat is tidal saltmarshes and estuaries. Ecology A euryhaline species, A. modesta is able to tolerate a wide range of salinities. It is nearly always associated with the yellow-green alga Vaucheria litorea on which it feeds in saltmarshes. Its eyesight is poor and in order to breed, individuals probably locate each other by smell and touch. Having found a partner, they push against each other and probe each other with their oral tentacles. They then each extend their penis, which is armed with a sharp stylet, and push this through the body wall of the partner and transfer sperm by hypodermic injection. The gonad occupies most of the body interior, and the injection can be anywhere on the body wall. Reciprocal injections usually take place at the same time, especially in larger individuals. These sea slugs are able to transfer sperm in this way within two days of metamorphosis when only long.

R. Sharma, the Manhai pillar capital displays realistic depictions of animals and architectural styles, particularly floral designs, which are characteristic of Hellenistic art. He suggests that the capital can only have been made by a Greek artist, working for the Indo-Greek ruler Menander I, whose campaigns brought him to central and eastern India. Shamal suggests that the Manhai pillar capital is one additional element proving the presence of Menander in Kausambi circa 160 BCE. =Double-humped camel of Menander= Coin of Menander I coin with double-humped camel, a unique occurrence in Indo-Greek coinage. The motifs in the abacus incorporate numerous animal, several depictions of lions, a horse, and in particular a double-humped camel, which, Sharma says, is probably characteristic of Menander I, who is also known to have used camels on his coins.

He was the maternal grandfather of U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Early life Delano's father, Capt. Warren Delano Delano was born on July 13, 1809 in New Bedford, Massachusetts. He was the eldest son of Captain Warren Delano, Sr. (1779‚Äì1866) and Deborah Perry (n√©e Church) Delano. After his mother's death in 1827, his father, who was involved in the New England sea trade, remarried to Elizabeth Adams, a widow of Captain Parker of the United States Navy. Among his siblings were brothers Frederick Delano, Edward Delano and Franklin Hughes Delano, was married to Laura Astor, a daughter of William Backhouse Astor Sr. and a sister of, among others, John Jacob Astor III and William Backhouse Astor Jr. A descendant of Philip Delano (a Pilgrim who arrived in Plymouth, Massachusetts in 1621), Warren Jr.'s paternal grandparents were Ephraim Delano and Elisabeth (n√©e Cushman) Delano, and his maternal grandparents were Joseph Church and Deborah (n√©e Perry) Church. He graduated from the Fairhaven Academy at the age of 15 and by age 17 was a trader in the import business. Career Sara and son Philippe in 1865 after returning from Hong Kong Delano made a large fortune smuggling opium into Canton (now Guangzhou), China. Opium, a highly addictive narcotic related to heroin, was illegal in China. By the 1800s, European demand for Chinese luxury products such as silk, tea, porcelain (\\"china\\"), and furniture was immense, but Chinese demand for European products was relatively weak. As a result, Britain, France and other European nations ran large trade deficits with China. Foreign traders such as the Scottish merchant William Jardine of Jardine Matheson introduced large-scale opium smuggling into China in order to reduce this trade imbalance and to gain further access to coveted Chinese products. The vast increase in opium smuggling into China resulted in millions of people becoming newly addicted to opium in China, and in an unprecedented Chinese trade imbalance with foreign powers, which in turn resulted in the First Opium War of 1840‚Äì1843. Delano first went to China at age 24 to work for Russell & Company, which had pioneered trading with China. John Perkins Cushingalso a Russell & Company partnerhad preceded Delano and initiated a close relationship with a Chinese official called Howqua. The two men had established an offshore basean anchored floating warehousewhere Russell & Company ships would offload their opium contraband before continuing up the Pearl River Delta to Canton with their legal cargo. By early 1843, Delano had prospered greatly in the Chinese opium trade, rising to become the head partner of the biggest American firm trading with China. He had witnessed the destruction of the Canton system, the humiliation of the Chinese government, and the creation of New China. In the 1850s, Delano, along with his brother Franklin and Asa Packer (the builder of the Lehigh Valley Railroad and founder of Lehigh University), headed a land company that purchased several thousand acres and established the town of Delano, Pennsylvania. Delano lost much of his fortune in the Panic of 1857. In 1860, he returned to China, except this time he went to Hong Kong where he rebuilt his fortune. During the U.S. Civil War, Delano shipped opium to the Medical Bureau of the U.S. War Department. Personal life Catherine Robbins Lyman Delano Delano's daughter, Katherine Robbins Collier by Lallie Charles, 1910 On November 1, 1843, Delano was married to Catherine Robbins Lyman (1825‚Äì1896), a daughter of Joseph Lyman and Anne Jean (n√©e Robbins) Lyman, during a short visit to Massachusetts. Together, they were the parents of: * Susan Maria Delano (1844‚Äì1846), who died young. * Louisa Church Delano (1846‚Äì1869), who died unmarried. * Deborah Perry Delano (1847‚Äì1940), who married merchant William Howell Forbes.

In 1851, Delano bought 60 acres on the Hudson River in Balmville, New York (two miles north of Newburgh). On the estate, he built a large family home called Algonac. His grandson Franklin Roosevelt was married at Algonac in 1905. His wife Catherine died on February 10, 1896 in Newburgh. Delano died at Algonac on January 17, 1898 of bronchial pneumonia. After a funeral there, he was buried next to his wife in the Delano Family Tomb at Riverside Cemetery in Fairhaven, Massachusetts (which Delano had established in 1850).

He was the first SPD member of the national parliament (Reichstag) from Erfurt.  Life  =Family provenance and a career before and beyond politics= Hermann Paul Rei√ühaus was born in Burg, a small manufacturing town a short distance to the north-east of Magdeburg in central northern Germany. The town had been extensively settled by Huguenots after 1685 and sources describe the Rei√ühaus family as \\"dissident\\" (in religious terms, non- conformist). His father was a master-tailor: he himself undertook an apprenticeship in tailoring between 1869 and 1872. From 1878 he was working as a self-employed tailor. From 1892 he was the proprietor of a ladies' and gentlemen's fashion outfitters in Erfurt. =Politics= In 1874 Rei√ühaus joined the Social Democratic Party (\\"Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / SPD). By 1878 he had relocated to Berlin. That was the year of Bismarck's Anti-Socialist Laws, however, and in 1880, as a political activist, he was deprived of his Berlin residence permit.Heinzpeter Th√ºmmler: Sozialistengesetz ¬ß 28. Ausweisungen und Ausgewiesene 1878-1890, 1979, p. 151. He moved to Erfurt in December.Willibald Gutsche: Geschichte der Stadt Erfurt, pp. 305-306 Like many Social Democrats excluded from Berlin he was able to shape the new political party in his new home region. He became the dominating figure in the Erfurt district SPD, a position he retained till his death in 1921. In the context of the Anti-Socialist Laws, the 1884 Health Insurance Law (\\"Krankenkassengesetz\\") offered one route for progressive political work that could be undertaken legally. The Erfurt Social Democrats received a visit from Wilhelm Liebknecht in February 1882 and in July of that year there was a visit from . The purpose was to offer support and encouragement. In the 1884 General Election, for the first time, in Erfurt the SPD topped the poll with 2,662 votes in the city (through nationally they were still being outperformed by several centre and right of centre parties). Still in 1884, Rei√ühaus found himself banned from distributing printed material. He produced and wrote for the Thuringia party newspaper Trib√ºne following its launch. The first issue of the Th√ºringer Trib√ºne, the organ for everyman from the people appeared on 1 September 1889. In it Rei√ühaus proclaimed that it represented a Social- Democratic agenda, embracing all the interests of the people, striving to improve the condition of the working class and promoting the introduction of a universal, equal and direct voting entitlement in respect of all parliamentary bodies.\\"An unsere Leser!\\" Facsimile reproduced in: Willibald Gutsche: Geschichte der Stadt Erfurt, p.308. = International and national politics = During the week of 14‚Äì21 July 1889 Rei√ühaus was in Paris where he took part in what became the founding congress of the Second Socialist International.Heinz Habedank and others(compiler-editors): Geschichte der revolution√§ren Berliner Arbeiterbewegung. Vol 1. Von den Anf√§ngen bis 1917. Dietz Verlag, Berlin 1987, p. 311. In October 1891, sitting alongside August Bebel und Wilhelm Liebknecht, he opened the SPD (party) congress in his home city. The congress agreed the \\"Erfurt Program\\" which now became the reference point for party strategy and objectives through several decades. During this period he was also a co-founder of the \\"German Tailoring Association\\" (Deutsche Schneider- und Schneiderinnenverband), serving between 1888 and 1892 as the union's \\"Vertrauensmann\\" (chief spokesman) and administrative head. In the 1890 General Election the SPD won more votes than any other party, although application of the infamous \\"Three-class voting system\\" meant that this translated into just 35 of the 397 seats in the national parliament (Reichstag). One of those seats was nevertheless won by Paul Rei√ühaus, who was thereby the first Social Democrat from Erfurt to secure election to the parliament. His election leaflets proclaimed, \\"Down with the Cartel! - the oppressors of the people, the food-price manipulators\\".Facsimile reproduced in: Willibald Gutsche: Geschichte der Stadt Erfurt, p. 309. From June 1893 to January 1907, and then again from January 1912 until the imperial political structure ended in November 1918, Rei√ühaus sat as an SPD member of the imperial Reichstag, representing what was identified as the Saxe-Meiningen 2 electoral district. During the politically confrontational decade that opened the twentieth century he continued to use the Th√ºringer Trib√ºne, the organ for everyman from the people (party newspaper) to campaign on important themes. In the issue of 2 July 1911 he called for a struggle to put a complete end to the contentious (and for most purposes unfathomable) \\"Three-class voting system\\" (Dreiklassenwahlrecht) ( which had the effect of weighting the vote in elections so that the votes of higher tax payers counted for more than the votes of those who paid less in tax).Facsimile reproduced in: Willibald Gutsche: Geschichte der Stadt Erfurt, p.338. = War = As late as 30 July 1914 the Erfurt Social Democrats were calling, at a meeting with banners, for \\"War against the war\\".Facsimile reproduced in: Willibald Gutsche: Geschichte der Stadt Erfurt, p.348. Two days later, as the Imperial Russian Army mobilised in support of Serbia, on 1 August 1914 the German empire declared war in the Russian empire. On 4 August 1914 a meeting tool place in Berlin of the (since 1912) 110 SPD Reichstag members to decide on the parliamentary party's position over the war. Paul Rei√ühaus was one of those who believed that, war having been declared, the party should support parliamentary votes to provide \\"war credits\\" to finance the fighting.Willibald Gutsche: Geschichte der Stadt Erfurt, p. 349 Slightly more than three months later, on 12 November 1914, a meeting of party members in Erfurt, acting under the influence of Rei√ühaus, backed the party's so-called \\"Burgfriedenspolitik\\", which amounted to a comprehensive parliamentary truce for the duration of the war.Steffen Kachel: Ein rot-roter Sonderweg?, pp. 139, 143 The decision was resisted by left-wing party members from the outset and would lead, in 1917, to a split of the SPD itself. Despite his initial public support for the leadership line, Rei√ühaus, like many on the political left, continued to be badly conflicted over political support for the war. On 21 December 1915, with slaughter on the frontline and acute deprivation on the home front mounting, he signed a declaration opposing the fifth vote for war credits and absented himself from the chamber before the actual vote was held.Willibald Gutsche: Geschichte der Stadt Erfurt, S. 354. Eugen Prager: Die Geschichte der USPD. Berlin 1921, p.86. On 25 March 1916 Rei√ühaus spoke out against the exclusion from the party of 18 SPD Reichstag members who had voted against war credits. The group of eighteen, known as the \\"Haase-Ledebour Group\\", went on to form the \\"\\" in the Reichstag, which adumbrated the wider party split of 1917.Willibald Gutsche: Geschichte der Stadt Erfurt, p.354. Riehaus himself nevertheless stayed with the \\"mainstream\\" SPD. In January 1917 he gave a speech in Erfurt setting out his vision for the party and criticising the leadership: \\"The underlying cause of these splits is the overall political strategy which representatives of the party majority have been following since 4 August 1914 .... The former majority wanted to direct the party towards socialist reform. That is the clear and simple objective of the majority of representatives .... Getting rid of the capitalist social order was the defining goal of the old Social Democratic Party. Now they just want a seat at the table of government.\\" = Postwar developments = Revolution broke out in Erfurt on 8 November 1918.Willibald Gutsche: Geschichte der Stadt Erfurt, p.365. This was part of a wider revolutionary wave that had started in the northern ports earlier in the month. In Erfurt Rei√ühaus and quickly emerged as leaders of the city's Workers' and Soldiers' Councils. They called for the creation of a \\"German Socialist Republic\\", with freedom to assemble and hold street demonstrations, the lifting of censorship and the liberation of all political prisoners. In several German cities the revolutionary movements of those time clearly took inspiration from the Russian Revolution which had broken out a year earlier and was still unfolding. In Erfurt the demands of the Workers' and Soldiers' Councils were seen by many in the local political establishment as relatively moderate. On 9 November 1919 , the city's venerable mayor,co-opted Rei√ühaus and a fellow SPD politician called Richard Friedrich to become members of the as representatives of the Workers' and Soldiers' Councils.Willibald Gutsche: Geschichte der Stadt Erfurt, p.370. The central part that Rei√ühaus had played in the formulation of the Erfurt Program nearly thirty years earlier meant that his socialist credentials were still in good order: he carried considerable authority, and there are indications that it was as a result of his involvement and leadership that the city was spared much of the internecine violence that accompanied the year of revolutions in other German industrial cities. In the aftermath of war Paul Rei√ühaus also made a return to national politics. In January 1919 was elected to the Weimar National Assembly, representing the SPD and Electoral District 36 (Thuringia). The National Assembly was the body mandated to produce a constitution for a new post-imperial - some dared to use the adjective \\"republican\\" - Germany. Election to the assembly took place through a far more democratic election than any that had gone before. Even women were permitted to vote, and for both sexes the minimum voting age was reduced to 20. As part of his own election campaign Rei√ühaus distributed a leaflet with a characteristically defiant message: \\"...accordingly, the National Assembly will have a composition that will hold back all capitalist and reactionary pressures. The old capitalist tyranny is defeated for good\\". In the event, things did not quite turn out that way. The Weimar National Assembly turned out to be the precursor to a new kind of national parliament (Reichstag) for a new kind of post-imperial Germany. In June 1920 Paul Rei√ühaus again secured election as SPD member representing Thuringia. However, he died on 21 September 1921. He was absent from the first Reichstag sitting of 24 June 1920, and there is no mention in the minutes of his having spoken in the new Reichstag. His party colleague Wilhelmine Eichler took over his parliamentary seat.  Personal  Paul Rei√ühaus was married to Anna Schumann (1859‚Äì1945). They had two recorded children: Oswald Rei√ühaus (1877‚Äì1934) and Elfriede Rei√ühaus (1893‚Äì1944).  Honours  There are streets names after Paul Rei√ühaus in Erfurt and Weimar.

His castle, which had been largely destroyed, was rebuilt in the 19th century and is now a pilgrimage destination for followers of Saint Bernard. Family Tescelin le Roux was born about 1070, son of Tescelin (), a knight of the lord of Ch√¢tillon and Saruc de Grancey. The sketchy available evidence indicates that Tescelin was a miles castri, a dependent knight unrelated to his lord. Alberic of Trois-Fontaines wrote in the 13th century that Tescelin's mother married Fulk, lord of Aigremont, as well as Tescelin's father. She had a son named Gui by Fulk, Tescelin is described as having a reddish complexion, almost yellow- haired, commonly known as Sorus, or Le Roux. William of St-Thierry said he was \\"a man of large possessions, gentle in manners, a great lover of the poor, of devoted piety, and of an extreme zeal for justice ... He never took up arms except in defence of his own lands, or in company with his lord...\\". In 1085 Tescelin married Aleth de Montbard ( ‚Äì 31 August 1106). Aleth, also called Alith, Elizabeth or Alix, was daughter of Bernard, lord of Montbar. Their children were Guy, seigneur de Fontaine, Saint Gerard of Clairvaux, Saint Bernard de Clairvaux (1091‚Äì1153), Andr√©, Barth√©l√©my, Nivard, Abb√© of Hautvilliers and Blessed Ombeline (1092‚Äì1141). A chronicler of Saint Bernard says that his parents were \\"illustrious by their rank and high descent, but more illustrious by their virtues.\\" Career Fontaine-l√®s-Dijon is a steep, tree-covered hill beside the highway from Paris to Dijon. Tescelin and his followers were assigned to protect this strongpoint. A strong house was built on the hill in the 11th century, entrusted to Tescelin le Roux as seigneur de Fontaine. Tescelin is often listed among the witnesses of ducal donations. For example, he is found around 1100 at the time of the donation of the lands of Marcennay by Odo I, Duke of Burgundy, who was leaving for Jerusalem, in 1100 and 1101 in the second and third renewals of the donation of Marcennay, and between 1102 and 1111 during the judgment of the ducal court against Hugues de Chatillon concerning the forest of Marcennay. Tescelin Sorus is among the signatories of a diploma of Hugh II, Duke of Burgundy, in favour of the Monastery of Saint Marcellus at Chalon-sur-Sa√¥ne. On 16 February 1106 Tescelin was one of the witnesses when Pope Paschal II consecrated the Church of Saint- B√©nigne de Dijon. He received \\"between his hands\\" the donation of the village of Pouilly by his cousin Milon de Montbard around 1113. Tescelin is among the witnesses of the charter of foundation of Molesme Abbey. Al√®the died in 1105 and was buried at the Abbey of St. Benignus at Dijon. The Abbot Jarenton had the images of her six sons engraved on her tomb. Towards the end of his life, in 1116 Tescelin became a monk. His death on 11 April 1117 is recorded in the register of deaths of the Church of St. Benignus at Dijon, where Alith had been buried many years earlier. Legacy Saint Bernard was born in what is now the large tower of the present Couvent et Basilique Saint-Bernard. Tescelin's castle was held for three centuries by the Sombernon family, Tescelin's descendants in the female line. During the reign of Louis XIII of France (1609-43) the castle was converted into a convent for the Congregation of the Feuillants.

Member of the Jaqeli family and son of Atabeg Kaikhosro I Jaqeli. His failure to capture the throne at the death of his father Kaikhosro may have been caused by the ambition of his uncle Mzetchabuki, who had seized Atabeg's title from him. Despite this Mzetchabuk Jaqeli declared Qvarqare as his successor. During his uncle's reign Qvarqvare actively involved in state affairs. In 1515 ill Mzetchabuk resigned from the throne and came to the Monastery as a monk. Qvarqvare couldn't ascend to the Meskhetian throne, because his second uncle Manuchar I had revolted. Qvarqvare went to Safavid Persia, became vassal of Shah Ismail I and lived at his court in Tabriz until his accession. In 1518 Qvarqvare commanded Qizilbash army and invaded Samtskhe. Persians dethroned Manuchar I and placed Qvarqvare on the throne. Manuchar invited Ottomans to fight against Safavids and overthrow his nephew, but Qvarqvare's forces defeated him at the battle near Erzurum, after which Manuchar escaped to the Ottoman empire.Georgian Soviet encyclopedia, volume 6, page 658, Tbilisi, 1983 During Qvarqvare's reign Persian influence on Samtskhe was growing day by day. Because of that Turks greatly damaged the country and especially its southwestern region. Meskhetian lords had recognized that under Qvarqvare's rule Samtskhe would finally turn to the Enemy's hands. They made an alliance with the Georgian kings, Bagrat III of Imereti and Luarsab I of Kartli to end up Jaqelian rule and protect Samtskhe from dominant Muslim empires (Ottomans and Safavids).Georgian Soviet encyclopedia, volume 10, page 638, Tbilisi, 1986 In 1535 King Bagrat III invaded Samtskhe. He defeated and captured Qvarqvare III at the Battle of Murjakheti near Akhalkalaki, Georgians had annexed Principality of Samtskhe. Qvarqvare died in prison. A few years later, his survived youngest son Kaikhosro II requested Ottomans to expel Imeretian and Kartlian forces from Samtskhe. In 1545, at the Battle of Sokhoista, Kaikhosro defeated Bagrat III, after which he reinstated his legitimate throne. Samtskhe became vassal of the Ottoman empire.Georgian Soviet encyclopedia, volume 10, page 658, Tbilisi, 1986 Qvarqvare III's descendants ruled Samtskhe-Saatabago (until 1628) and then Childir Eyalet until 1820s.
