She was best known for her work as the director of the Austin Music Awards (AMA) in the South by Southwest festival and for her career in music journalism and criticism, which lasted more than thirty years. Moser also supported young artists, helping them get started and finding appropriate venues where they could play. She has been called the \\"patron saint of Austin music\\" by the Paramount Theatre.  Early life  Moser was born in Chicago to educated parents, Phyllis Jackson Stegall and Willard Cummings Moser, and raised in New Orleans, Houston, and San Antonio. She dropped out of high school. In 1973, Moser moved from San Antonio to Austin with her boyfriend Gary Kellaher. Groupie years For several years, Moser was a groupie, getting into \\"where the action was.\\" She often was seen with a group of other women called \\"The Texas Blondes\\", as John Cale, with whom Moser had a five- year relationship, named them. The couple met in 1979, as Moser was getting out of her first marriage. The Texas Blondes partied with musicians and were given free tickets and backstage passes. Moser was the leader of the group. They were active in the groupie scene until around 1982. Moser also performed as a backup singer in the 1980s for Dino Lee, as one of the \\"Jam & Jelly Girls.\\" Journalism career Moser worked at the Austin Sun starting in 1976, initially as a janitor before writing about music. She got her first interview when she told the newspaper's Backstage columnist that she knew Randy California and could interview him. When the Sun went out of business, the Austin Chronicle hired Moser in 1981 for its gossip column, \\"In One Ear.\\" The column \\"became essential reading for Austin music fans,\\" according to the Austin American-Statesman. Moser's writing about music and the scene in Austin was honest and included her own experiences with the \\"rock and roll lifestyle\\" in Austin. Alvin Crow said of her music criticism, \\"She knows how to draw the distinction between serious rock & roll and bubblegum. She's a true critic. She tells me somebody's good, I believe it.\\" On December 4, 1984, Moser married Mike Malone, a tattoo artist also known as Rollo Banks, and moved to Hawaii. The couple separated in the early 1990s; Moser returned to Austin and to the Austin Chronicle, where she began to write about the history of the Austin music scene. She worked on the history of rock, punk music and the blues, and the origins of music in Texas. In 2012, Moser, along with Michael Ann Coker, established the South Texas Popular Culture Center (known as \\"Tex Pop\\") in San Antonio. Moser's husband, Steve Chaney, also helped her found the museum, of which Moser acted as curator. The museum's collection focuses on South Texas music from the 1950s to the 1980s. Cancer diagnosis and death Margaret Moser Plaza In February 2013, Moser was diagnosed with Stage IV colon cancer. She retired as director of the Austin Music Awards (AMA) in 2014. Before she retired, a small area next to the Austin Music Hall was named Margaret Moser Plaza. In that same year, she also retired from the Austin Chronicle. In 2016, the AMA started the Margaret Moser Award to recognize women in the Austin music community. Around June 2017, Moser ended treatment for her cancer and had gone into hospice care. She invited friends to visit her before she died, holding a Sunday Open House. On August 25, 2017, she died at her home in San Antonio.

It grows to a length of about and lives in a burrow in soft sediment in the intertidal and subtidal zones. The scientific name refers to 2,4-dibromophenol, a secondary metabolite present in this worm. Description Like other acorn worms, this soft cylindrical worm is divided into three parts, the proboscis, the collar and the trunk. The proboscis is long and slender with a groove along the top. The mouth is located on the underside where it joins the thick, fleshy collar. A fold at the back of the collar overhangs the trunk, and the anus is at the tip of the trunk. The total length is up to , the proboscis is white to beige, the collar is orange, red or reddish-green and the trunk is either brownish-green or rather pale. Distribution and habitat The species is native to the northwestern Atlantic Ocean where its range extends from Maine to Nova Scotia. It is also present in the northeastern Pacific Ocean, in Padilla Bay and Willapa Bay in Washington state, where it is thought to have been introduced with a consignment of oysters from the east coast. It is typically found burrowing in mud, mostly in the intertidal zone, but also subtidally down to about . Biology S. bromophenolosus moves through the sediment by thrusting its proboscis forward and then contracting it longitudinally to form a swelling. This bulge is then worked backwards along the proboscis, which pulls the worm forwards. The collar and trunk follow passively. The beating of cilia also helps move sand and silt. Food particles are trapped in mucus and moved to the mouth by ciliary action, and the worm also swallows a lot of sediment and presumably obtains some nourishment from detritus. The sexes are separate. Fertilisation takes place in the water column. The eggs are yolky and large and development is direct, without a mobile larval stage. The worm contains high concentrations of 2,4-dibromophenol in its tissues. It is unclear what function this serves, but it may deter predators or convey some measure of resistance to microorganisms.

Her union, IDATU, had issued directions to its members not to handle South African produce in protest of South African apartheid policies. When Manning and shop steward Karen Gearon continued to refuse to handle South African produce, they were suspended and ten IDATU members working in the store went on strike. The additional striking workers were * Liz Deasy, * Michelle Gavin, * Vonnie Munroe, * Alma Russell, * Tommy Davis, * Sandra Griffin, * Theresa Mooney, * Cathryn O'Reilly & * Brendan Barron. While the strike lasted the strikers got only ¬£21 a week strike pay. At first, the strikers received support from few individuals and groups, such as Nimrod Sejake, but they were encouraged when Archbishop Desmond Tutu met with the strikers on his way to receive the Nobel Peace Prize and invited them to visit South Africa. Eight of the strikers travelled to South Africa in 1985, but were not permitted to enter the country. Their deportation from South Africa received extensive news coverage in Ireland. The strike lasted until April 1987 when the Irish government banned the import of South African goods. The ban came about as a result of public pressure in support of the strikers and was the first complete ban of South African imports by a Western government. Recognition The workers eventually met Nelson Mandela on the occasion of his conferral of the Freedom of the City of Dublin in 1990. Mandela said that the strikers demonstrated to South Africans that \\"ordinary people far away from the crucible of apartheid cared for our freedom\\" and helped him keep going when he was in prison. A plaque, presented by South African President Thabo Mbeki, commemorating the action was unveiled in Dublin in June, 2008, and a street has been named after Mary Manning in Johannesburg. Manning was invited to attend the funeral of Nelson Mandela in 2013.

It was founded in 1856, and was originally called The State Garden. The park includes differente tree types such as elm, oak, aspen, maple, pine, spruce, poplar, and birch; artificial water reservoirs, attractions such as a water park, Rodina cinema, sports complex, cultural venues, and public catering establishments. There are also children's attractions, which include a children's railway, an aqua park and other entertainment venues. History =Early history= The history of the park goes back to the emergence of civil settlements around the fortification of Verniy and the development of fisheries. For the first time, the park was laid as a state garden by a scientist-gardener G. Krishtopenko in 1856; in the floodplain of the Malaya Almatinka river, as a place for walking and resting officers of the Vernensky garrison. Krishtopenko, who had experience in the Crimea, planted the first deciduous and coniferous trees in the garden. For his work, Krishtopenko drew lovers of gardening-vernentsev Kutaberdin, Sergeev, Chvanov and others. After studying the climatic conditions and the structure of the soil, Krishtopenko came to the conclusion that not only Central Asian plants, but also species characteristic of Central Russia could grow in the garden, as well as in the entire fortification of the city. In 1868, the seedlings and the seeds were delivered to Verniy from the Nikitsky Botanical Garden, and the Penza School of Horticulture in Tashkent. =Baum- Karlu period= In 1874, Krishtopenko handed over his leadership the brother of the famous forester of Verniy, Eduard Baum-Karlu. Because of this, the park turned into a place of national holidays. The State Garden was intended for the cultivation of fruit, ornamental plants, vegetables, raising silk and the creation of apiaries. In the years from 1869 to 1875, a greenhouse was built, flowerbeds were broken, a children's playground was set up for planting, and the Eduard Baum, a school of horticulture was opened for 10-15 pupils. With the creation of the city, Verniy Park became a place of rest for the townspeople: here they set up buffet and kitchens, built dance floors, gazebos, installed a yurt for billiards and tables for games. In Tsarist times, the entrance was paid accessed. =Later history= During the 1905 Russian Revolution, laborer workers along with the youths held rallies and gatherings at the logs. During the Russian Civil War in 1918, a defensive Red Army line was located in the park. In 1919, an Aytysh was held in the park with the participation of the city Aulie-Ata (present day Taraz). In 2014, a street workout location was launched at the park.

Reception In the November- December 1977 edition of The Space Gamer (Issue No. 14), Tony Watson thought the game, although well-written, was just okay, saying, \\"The rules themselves are good, faithful to their inspiration. They are not very innovative, but they certainly provide all major components thus giving the players some interesting and accurate miniatures battles.\\" In the October 1979 edition of Dragon (Issue #30), Kenneth Hulme thought that most of the 18-page rule book was \\"top-notch\\", but had issues with a number of the rules, which he felt prevented the game from truly bringing Piper's novel to life.

Consequently, the left side of the forebrain mostly represents the right side of the body and the right side of the brain represents mostly the left side of the body. The contralateral organization involves both executive and sensory functions (e.g., a left-sided brain lesion may cause a right-sided hemiplegia). The contralateral organization is present in all vertebrates but in no invertebrate. According to the current theory, the forebrain is twisted about the long axis of the body, so that not only the left and right sides, but also dorsal and ventral sides are interchanged (see below).  Anatomy  Some afferent decussations. Pyramidal decussations. Anatomically, the contralateral organization is manifested by major decussations (latin: the Latin notation for ten, 'deca', is an uppercase 'X') and chiasmas (after the Greek uppercase letter 'Œß', chi). A decussation denotes a crossing of bundles of axonal fibres inside the central nervous system. As a result of such decussations, the efferent connections of the cerebrum to the basal ganglia, the cerebellum and the spine are crossed, and the afferent connections from the spine, the cerebellum and the pons to the thalamus are crossed. As a result, motor, somatosensory, auditory, and visual primary regions in the forebrain represent predominantly the contralateral side of the body. Two of the cranial nerves show chiasmas: the chiasm of the optic tract (cranial nerve II) which originates from the eyes and inserts on the optic tectum of the midbrain, and the trochlear nerve (nerve IV) which originates in the ventral midbrain and innervates one of the six muscles that rotate the eye (superior oblique muscle). = The contralateral organization is incomplete = Although the forebrain of all vertebrates shows a contralateral organization, this contralaterality is by no means complete. Some of these exceptions are worth mentioning: * Olfaction (smelling sense): Each olfactory lobe connects to the ipsilateral centers of the frontal cerebrum. * In chondrichthyans (sharks and skates) the thalamus does not retrieve a branch from the optic tract but only from the contralateral optic tectum, so that the optic path decussates twice and the forebrain represents the ipsilateral eye. * In large brains, some functions tend to be strongly lateralized. E.g., the language regions (Broca's and Wernicke's area) are in the left side in most humans. * Most afferent and efferent connections of the forebrain have bilateral components, especially outside the primary sensory and motor regions. As a result, a hemiplegia that is acquired at very young age can be completely compensated over time.  Theories  According to current understanding, the contralateral organization is due to an axial twist (see below), which is the only theory that has been tested independently. A number of alternative proposals have been published earlier, the most popular of which is the visual map theory. A popular-science video explains these theories in brief. = Visual map theory by Cajal = > Cajal's schema of the visual map theory. O=Optic chiasm; C=Visual (and > motor) cortex; M, S=Decussating pathways; R, G: Sensory nerves, motor > ganglia.

As a result, the retinal map show the visual periphery on > the medial side. However, the central point of the theory was exactly to > obtain a faithful visual map with the medial field projecting to the medial > sides of the visual cortex. = Twist theories = Two twist theories have been proposed independently, the axial twist hypothesis by de Marc Lussanet and Jan Osse and the somatic twist hypothesis by Marcel Kinsbourne.  Axial twist hypothesis  Schema of the developmental twist according to the axial twist hypothesis. A, B: The early embryo turns onto its left side; B, C: Symmetry is retained by a further left turn in the anterior head region and a compensating right turn in the rest of the body. D, E: Growth of the optic tract leading to the optic chiasm. Colors refer to early embryo: Red=right side, blue=left side, black=dorsal, white=ventral The axial twist hypothesis was designed to explain how the pattern of contralateral organization, decussations and chiasms develops, and why this pattern is evolutionary stable. The evolutionary stability is truly remarkable, given that there are no known exceptions throughout the 500 million years of vertebrate evolution. According to the theory, the contralateral organization develops as follows. The early embryo is turned onto its left side, such that its left is turned to the yolk and its right is turned away from the yolk. This asymmetric orientation is compensated by asymmetric growth to regain superficial bilateral symmetry. The anterior head region turns to the left, as shown in the schema. The forebrain is not a superficial structure, but it is so intimately associated with superficial body structures that it turns along with the anterior head. These structures will later form the eyes, nostrils and mouth. The body behind the head compensates the asymmetric body orientation in the opposite direction, by turning to the right (see schema). Due to these oppositely directed compensations of the anterior head and the rest of the body, the animal becomes twisted. The optic tract grows from the retina to the optic tectum, as dorsal and ventral are inverted in the anterior head region, the tracts grow at first to the ventral side to meet in the midline to form a chiasma. Since the optic tectum lies on the dorsal midbrain, each tract then continues dorsally to the contralateral optic tectum. The heart and bowels are internal organs with no strong integration in external body structures, so there is no evolutionary pressure to make them turn also. Rather, these organs retain their original asymmetric orientation in the body. The axial twist hypothesis predicts that small asymmetries of face, brain and (in the opposite direction) in the trunk remain into adulthood, and this has been confirmed experimentally.  Somatic twist hypothesis  The idea of a somatic twist was inspired by the dorsoventral inversion hypothesis; the idea was worked out by Marcel Kinsbourne. According to the dorsoventral inversion hypothesis, an ancestral deuterostome turned on its back. As a result, vertebrates have a dorsal nervous system whereas protostomes have a ventral one. According to the somatic twist hypothesis, not the entire animal turned on its back but just the ‚Ä≥somatic‚Ä≥ part, i.e., everything behind the eyes, mouth and nostrils, including the forebrain.  Comparing inversion, somatic twist and axial twist  The three theories are closely related. The somatic twist hypothesis was proposed as an improvement to the inversion hypothesis, and thus has a much wider explanatory power than its predecessor. It not only explains the inversion of the body but additionally the contralateral forebrain. The axial twist hypothesis was defined independently of the other two. In addition to the inverted body and the contralateral forebrain it explains why the heart and bowels are asymmetric. Moreover, it is the only of the three that is supported by evidence from embryological growth.  Evolution  A remarkable property of the contralateral organization is that it is present in every vertebrate. Even the most distant clades agnathans possess an optic chiasm, and even the skull impressions of early vertebrates from the Ordovician show the presence of an optic chiasm: this idea was worked out by Kinsbourne. There is molecular evidence for the inversion hypothesis in almost all groups of deuterostomes. It is not known, however, what exactly was the selective pressure that caused the inversion. Twisting and asymmetric development are well known from other deuterostomians such as Hemichordata, Echinodermata, Cephalochordata and Tunicata. Turning in the side or upside- down also occurs frequently in these clades.  Developmental malformations  In holoprosencephaly the hemispheres of the cerebrum or part of it are not aligned on the left and right side but on the frontal and occipital side of the skull, and usually remains very small. According to the axial twist hypothesis, this represents an extreme case of Yakovlevian torque, and may occur when the cerebrum does not turn during early embryology. Cephalopagus or janiceps twins are conjoined twins which are born with two faces, one on either side of the head. These twins have two brains and two spinal chords, but these are located on the left and the right side of the body. According to the axial twist hypothesis, the two nervous systems could not turn due to the complex configuration of the body and therefore remained on either side.

Generalising the result, Lipkin found nine related conservation laws, all unrelated to the stress-energy tensor. He named the quantity zilch because of the apparent lack of physical significance.Wheeler, N.A. Classical electrodynamics course notes. Reed College. 1980/81. p. 241-245 Zilch can also be expressed using the dual electromagnetic tensor \\\\hat{F}^{\\\\mu u}=(1/2)\\\\epsilon^{\\\\mu u\\\\rho\\\\sigma}F_{\\\\rho\\\\sigma} as Z^\\\\mu_ u\\\\rho = \\\\hat{F}^{\\\\mu\\\\lambda}F_{\\\\lambda u,\\\\rho} - F^{\\\\mu\\\\lambda} \\\\hat{F}_{\\\\lambda u,\\\\rho} . It was later demonstrated that zilch is part of an infinite number of zilch-like conserved quantities, a general property of free fields. Zilch has occasionally been rediscovered. It has been called \\"optical chirality\\", since it determines the degree of chiral asymmetry in the rate of excitation of a small chiral molecule by an incident electromagnetic field. A physical interpretation of zilch was offered in 2012; zilch is to the curl or time derivative of the electromagnetic field what helicity, spin and related quantities are to the electromagnetic field itself. The conservation of zilch is not associated with duality transformations, but instead with a more subtle symmetry transformation, which has no special name.

Despite the murder of several of its leaders, it has continued to fight for peace, and in 1990 it was awarded the Right Livelihood Award in recognition of its work.  History  Following decades of fighting in the region between guerrilla groups and the Colombian army, later joined in the 1980s by paramilitary fighters, the community of La India had reached breaking point by 1987. A group of peasants asked for a meeting with the guerrillas which took place on May 21, 1987, and asked to be left in peace. The guerrillas accepted the request of the group, and a meeting the following week with the commander of the military forces achieved the same result. Following the meetings the ATCC was formed. Its aim was to promote economic growth and peace in the region by holding talks with all parties involved in the conflict, while avoiding taking sides. The ATCC obtained a government grant for six million pesos to build a community store and two purchase two canoes to provide transport to the area along the Carare River. The organization also developed a six-year plan, costing almost three thousand million pesos, to develop the region. The ATCC's plan covers six municipalities in the region and has five goals: to create a program of building a culture of peace and symbolic reparation; a health care and community rehabilitation plan; an agroforestry program to restore the environment and work for the community; a program of organizational strengthening and institutional recovery; and the restoration of collective property. The plan was finally approved on December 15, 2012. The ATCC's greatest setback was the murder on February 26, 1990 of its co-founder and president Josu√© Vargas, its secretary Sa√∫l Casta√±eda, and its technical advisor Miguel √Ångel Barajas, along with London-based BBC journalist Silvia Duz√°n who had been interviewing them in a restaurant in Cimitarra. However, on October 8 of the same year the organization was awarded the Right Livelihood Award (popularly known as the \\"Alternative Nobel Prize\\") in recognition of its work in standing up to the violence. During the 1990s the ATCC was involved in a struggle to convince local farmers not to accede to the demands of guerrilla groups and plant coca. Between 2001 and 2004 the organization also had to stand up to further outbreaks of violence that took place in the area.

Background Allan R. Rosenberg was born on April 21, 1909, in Dorchester, Massachusetts. In 1926, he graduated president of his class from Boston Latin School. In 1930, he graduated from Harvard College. In 1936, he graduated from Harvard Law. Career =Government service= NLRB under Ware Group spy member Nathan Witt (center, 1937) Rosenberg associated with members of the Ware Group of Soviet spies, set up by Harold Ware. Upon Ware's unexpected death in 1935, Nathan Witt succeeded him, while Whittaker Chambers oversaw the group and couriered Government documents it obtained from Washington to New York. In 1936, Rosenberg was working \\"as an unpaid volunteer\\" for the La Follette Civil Liberties Committee, in fact a subcommittee of the U.S. Senate Committee on Education and Labor (where Ware Group member John Abt worked); Charles Kramer and Charles Flato (another \\"secret communist\\") would join them there. Witt placed Rosenberg in charge of a group of six to eight attorneys during a Congressional investigation into the questionable activities of the National Labor Relations Board (NRLB) in 1938 and 1939. At the NLRB, Rosenberg \\"helped litigate charges of union- busting against Republic Steel, and he want to Harlan County, Ky., to investigate abuses in towns controlled by coal companies. In 1937, he transferred briefly to the Railroad Retirement Board and then in April 1937 joined the National Labor Relations Board through 1941 at the suggestion of Max Lowenthal. There, Charles Kramer joined him the following year. In 1941, Rosenberg transferred from the NRLB to the Board of Economic Warfare (or Office of Economic Warfare). \\"A couple of years later,\\" he joined the Foreign Economic Administration (FEA). Rosenberg became a member of the Perlo group of Soviet spies during World War II. (Perlo had been a member of the Ware Group earlier.) In November 1943, Earl Browder turned control of the Perlo Group over to Jacob Golos two months before his death; it subsequently was taken over by Elizabeth Bentley. While employed as the Chief of the Economic Institution Staff for the Foreign Economic Administration, Rosenberg allegedly supplied the Soviet Union with voluminous observations, recommendations, plans and proposals made by various government officials concerning the handling of postwar Germany. He also worked on the Board of Economic Warfare since 1941. Rosenberg's name appears in clear text in a December 1944 Venona decrypt as the source of a State Department memo. Rosenberg appears in the Venona project under his real name. =Private practice= Rosenberg's name appeared on a list of alleged Communists promulgated by US Representative George Dondero (here, 1953) After World War II, Rosenberg left government service and went into private practice. He opened a law firm in Washington, DC. On July 9, 1947, US Representative George Anthony Dondero included Rosenberg when publicly questioneing the \\"fitness\\" of United States Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson for failing to ferret out Communist infiltrators in his department. The cause for concern arose from what Dondero called Patterson's lack of ability to \\"fathom the wiles of the international Communist conspiracy\\" and to counteract them with \\"competent personnel.\\" Dondero cited ten government personnel in the War Department who had Communist backgrounds or leanings: * Colonel Bernard Bernstein * Russel A. Nixon * Abraham L. Pomerantz * Josiah E. DuBois Jr. * Richard Sasuly * George Shaw Wheeler * Heinz Norden * Max Lowenthal * Allan Rosenberg (member of Lowenthal's staff) Dondero stated, \\"It is with considerable regret that I am forced to the conclusion the Secretary Patterson falls short of these standards.\\" In June 1948, after the 1947 conviction of Carl Marzani for false and fraudulent statements Rosenberg represented Marzani in appeal, with Arthur Garfield Hays pro hac vice plus Charles E. Ford and Warren L. Sharfman, while Belford V. Lawson Jr. filed a brief on behalf of the National Lawyers Guild and Joseph Forerfiled a brief on behalf of the Civil Rights Congress as amicus curiae urging reversal. In 1949, Rosenberg joined the firm of Putnam, Bell & Russell, where he became a partner. In April 1951, Rosenberg argued for the complainant Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee in Anti-Fascist Committee v. McGrath before the U.S. Supreme Court. On June 23, 1952, and again on February 21, 1956, Rosenberg testified in Congress before HUAC. Counsel in 1952 was David Scribner, counsel in 1956 Benjamin Loring Young. Rosenberg served on the legal team of Benjamin Spock (here, 1976) in a case regarding Vietnam War draft- dodging In January 1969, Rosenberg represented Dr. Benjamin Spock. In 1962, Spock had joined The Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy, otherwise known as SANE. Spock was politically outspoken and active in the movement to end the Vietnam War. In 1968, he and four others (William Sloane Coffin, Marcus Raskin, Mitchell Goodman, and Michael Ferber) were singled out for prosecution by US Attorney General Ramsey Clark on charges of conspiracy to counsel, aid, and abet resistance to the draft. Spock and three of his alleged co- conspirators were convicted, although the five had never been in the same room together. His two-year prison sentence was never served; the case was appealed and in 1969 a federal court set aside his conviction. Spock's legal team included Leonard Boudin with Victor Rabinowitz of Rabinowitz, Boudin & Standard (New York City) and Allan R. Rosenberg of Putnam, Bell & Russell (Boston).See United States v. Spock, 416 F.2d 165 (1st Cir. 1969). In March 1969, Rosenberg wrote a letter to the U.S. Senate in which he upheld the reputation of Henry S. Kahn MD of Harvard Medical School in the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service. For Putnam, Bell & Russell, Rosenberg represented the United Electrical Workers union in New England, as well as the New England Subaru Dealers Council. He also counseled \\"hundreds of workers\\" in front of the Massachusetts Industrial Accident Board. In 1987, Rosenberg had been living in Boston when he retired from the firm that year. Personal life and death Rosenberg married Erna Rothschild; they had two sons and two daughters. Rosenberg was a friend of Charles Kramer (the only member of the Ware Group known to continue on into the Perlo Group). Rosenberg was also an amateur photographer with a dark room in his home. In 1937, Rosenberg joined the National Lawyers Guild, where he remained a member as a late as 1956 during his second appearance before HUAC). Allan R. Rosenberg died age 81 on April 1, 1991, at his home in West Newton, Massachusetts, following surgery on a brain tumor.

The new equipment reads the local temperature in Marysville, Michigan, and obtains the current time via a GPS unit that receives the time from the United States Atomic Clock in Boulder, Colorado. The forecast is recorded several times a day by Tim Root, a meteorologist with Weather Watch Service in the state of Florida. Because of the advanced capabilities of the new equipment, the firm also had assigned the old AT&T; Time number from the 1960s, (313) 985‚Äì3121, now (810) 985-3121 because of the area code change in 1993; both numbers are connected to the new equipment and both provide the same information, date, time, current temperature, and forecast. In 2016, the firm re-released the service as the new Blue Water Weather Telephone Service as a community service. The firm sells no advertisement on the service and does not profit directly from providing the weather telephone service to the community.

Meryre is so far only attested in his tomb at Saqqara, that was discovered in the 1980s in the temple area known as the Bubasteum. The tomb is decorated with reliefs.

The island was thick with trees, had beaches all around the perimeter and was home to nesting Bald Eagles and several species of seabirds. Coconut became a weekend haven for Marco islanders and Naples boaters and offered magnificent shelling, great fishing and ample camping and picnic areas. Between Coconut and Hideaway Beach was a tremendous anchorage for locals and cruising boaters. As erosion had its way, the island started to recede slowly. But nature was not the only culprit in the death of this barrier island. In the late 1990s, the Rookery Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve removed all the trees on Coconut, claiming the non-native trees were suffocating the natural foliage. With no trees to protect the sand from wind and water erosion, the island started to disappear rapidly. Each week there was less and less beachfront. The final blow came in 2005 when dredging equipment, used for the beach re-nourishment project on the mainland, altered the flow and natural currents. Coconut Island was gone in a few weeks.  Island reemergence  But, with the ever-changing coastline, a new island had emerged six years later in 2011. Rookery Bay has roped off an area of this island for nesting seabirds, leaving the perimeter beaches for picnics, shelling and fishing. Once again, there is a protected anchorage for traveling boats and a weekend destination for all to enjoy.

After his first course at the Polytechnic University of Madrid, the brilliant student discovered that his true passion was not the ships, but art history. Once the decision was made, he presented himself at home in front of his father, delivered his honour grades in his first course of naval engineering, and communicated to his family his desire to devote himself to his passion. He studied art history at the Complutense University of Madrid from 1961 to 1965, where he began teaching after writing a doctorate thesis entitled \\"Iconography of the miniature of the eleventh and twelfth centuries in the kingdoms of Castile and Le√≥n. For several years he combined the positions of professor at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid (1965-1969) and the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid (1968-1974). From 1974 to 1981, he was a professor of art history at the University of Barcelona and later at the Autonomous University of Barcelona where he was professor of art. Joaquin Yarza did most of his research and literary works on the study of medieval Hispanic art and Byzantine art. In spite of his almost exclusive dedication to the medieval period, he has also made explorations in the field of the history of Renaissance painting, with studies dedicated to Navarrete el Mudo and Alonso de Herrera and within the field of sculpture, Pedro Berruguete. He has published works of a general nature, such as Art and Architecture in Spain, 500-1250 (1987) and The Middle Ages (1988) and coordinated others on written artistic sources, such as Medieval art, I and II (1982). He has also been interested in the miniature of both the tenth century (Blessed Gerona, Antiphon of Leon) and Romanesque (Burgos Bible). He is the director and co- author of an Art History manual for high school students (1978). He has participated in divulgative works such as Gothic Painting (1987) or Gothic Art (1991). He collaborated actively in the production of the catalog of the medieval Museo Frederic Mar√®s of Barcelona. He directed the magazine Of the Department of Art History of the Autonomous University of Barcelona Locus Amoenus from its creation in 1995. He was also part of the next magazines Cuadernos de Historia de Espa√±a (Buenos Aires), Traza y Baza (UB), D‚ÄôArt (UB), Quaderns d‚ÄôEstudis Medievals (Art Estudi) and Artigrama (Universidad de Zaragoza). He was member of the Spanish Committee of History of the Art between 1982 and 1988. From 1990 he was part of the Board of Museums of Catalonia and of the Board of Qualification, Valuation and Export of Goods of the Cultural Patrimony of Catalonia.

The player takes the role of a formerly active user of a Usenet newsgroup for a fictional Japanese role-playing game (JRPG), also titled Arc Symphony, and reads messages from the game's characters. As part of the game's release, fake game boxes for the JRPG, in the style of those for PlayStation JRPGs, were created and given to the developers' friends, who shared photos of it on social media with comments pretending that the JRPG was a real game; additionally, a fake fan site for the JRPG was created to further the illusion that it was real. Critics liked the game and its marketing, calling them accurate to fan communities in the 1990s. Overview Arc Symphony is a text-based adventure game, and is presented as an old computer through which the player reads messages in a Usenet newsgroup dedicated to a fictional Japanese role-playing video game (JRPG) for the PlayStation game console, also titled Arc Symphony. The player takes the role of a formerly active user of the group, and begins the game by taking a personality quiz. Messages include discussions about the fictional Arc Symphony characters and writing, and about the newsgroup users' usernames. The characters the player interacts with include a couple who chat on IRC at the same time by using two phone lines, a new user who provokes people, and a university professor who wants to be called by his username rather than his real name when in the newsgroup. Development and release Arc Symphony was developed by Matilde Park and Penelope Evans using the game engine Twine. Both of them had prior experience with fan communities: Evans mentioned having been a member of message boards for the game The Sims 2 as a child and having nostalgic feelings for it, while Park said that although she did not miss old websites, bulletin board systems and mailing lists, they still were a part of her. Evans described the game's interactions as feeling like a real forum experience, saying that while people look at pixels at their screen, a real person is on the other side, and that both parties get to accept or reject the other, with the possibility of hurting them. After the completion of the development, they thought about how to launch the game, and came up with the idea to put together fake game boxes for the fictional Arc Symphony, consisting of a PlayStation-style jewel case and JRPG-like cover art with inaccurate Japanese text. A few of these were given out to friends as keepsakes, who would play along with the illusion that the Arc Symphony JRPG was a real video game by posting about it on social media, sharing photographs of the jewel cases on the internet accompanied with comments about the nostalgic feelings they supposedly had for the game. Park said that she liked this idea, since it replicated the game's premise of learning about a game through its fan community in real life. Park and Evans brought the remaining cases to the Toronto Comic Arts Festival, where more people joined in; according to Park, some people insisted that they remembered playing the Arc Symphony JRPG, something she described as feeling surreal. In addition to the case, a fake fan site for the JRPG was created in the style of fan sites from the 1990s; it was coded by Park, and includes fake fan fiction. As she had never been interested in fan fiction herself, she described what she had written as \\"accurately bad\\". Following a countdown on the fan site, the game was released on May 15, 2017 through Park's Itch.io page, and is available both as a browser game and in a downloadable version playable on Microsoft Windows, MacOS and Linux. The game is also accessible from within Park and Evans' game Subserial Network. Reception Julie Muncy of Wired called the game \\"engaging [and] incredibly polished\\" despite its short playtime, and described it and its marketing as similar to performance art. Polygon Allegra Frank found the game \\"amusing and quirky\\", and also commented positively on the marketing, saying that she was amazed by how it manipulated people's memories. Gita Jackson at Kotaku said that the marketing fooled her due to how accurate the fan site was to real performance of fandom in the 1990s, and called it part of what makes the game work, as it sets up nostalgia for the JRPG, making it easier to pretend to be a fan of it within the game. She described the game as feeling \\"like a snapshot of [a] world long lost\\", with an accurate cast of characters. Brendan Caldwell at Rock, Paper, Shotgun included Arc Symphony on a list of recommended free games, where he called its characters and the interactions between them realistic, and described it as fun to see the \\"quirks and squabbles\\" of fandoms as an unseen observer.

He was suffect consul during 122 as the colleague of Tiberius Julius Candidus Capito.Werner Eck, \\"Hadrische Konsuln Neue Zeugnisse aus Milit√§rdiplomen\\", Chiron, 32 (2002), p. 481 Flamininus is primarily known from inscriptions. The Vitrasii were originally an equestrian family of Campania; the earliest known member, Vitrasius Pollio, served as a Procurator of Egypt under the Emperor Tiberius. Flamininus was the first known member of the Vitrasii to be a Senator. Flamininus' cursus honorum can be reconstructed in part from an inscription found in Cales, erected by his father Lucius Vitrasius Ennius Aequus. Following his consulate, Flamininus is described as legatus or governor of \\"Italia Transpadana and the province of Moesia Superior and exercitus, and the province of Dalmatia\\". Ronald Syme examines this peculiar combination of provinces and a military command, and considers the possibility that Ernst Stein first raised that Flamininus held these commands simultaneously but could not provide a reason; it was another scholar, Zwikker, who suggested that the demands of the Marcomannic Wars was the reason. Syme notes, \\"The notion of a single command tenuously extended all the way from Piedmont to Serbia is highly vulnerable. Let the Transpadana therefore be dissociated.\\" Syme argues that Flamininus governed at least some of these at different times, and that his command of an exercitus or military force was to \\"clean up latrones in Bosnia and western Serbia, whether recalcitrants or conveniently deemed such.\\"Syme, review of Die Statthalter der r√∂mischen Provinz Dalmatien von Augustus bis Diokletian by Adolf Jagenteufel, Gnomon, 31 (1959), pp. 513f Werner Eck provides the date of 130 to 133 for Flamininus' administration of the imperial province of Moesia Superior.Werner Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten der senatorischen Statthalter von 69/70 bis 138/139\\", Chiron, 13 (1983),pp. 169-173 The next office listed on the inscription is curator alvei Tiberis riparum cloacum urbi, or one of the officials responsible for public works inside the city of Rome, regulating the Tiber and the maintenance of the city's sanitation system.

The idea to construct a memorial to Sedgewick County Civil War veterans began with two local GAR posts in 1904, but sufficient funds were not available until in 1911. In that year the Kansas State Legislature passed a one-time county tax levy to fund the building of monuments in counties with a population of over 72,000. The monument consists of a Second Empire granite pavilion adorned with five statues. Its dome is crowned by a hammered copper figure of Liberty holding a flag and a laurel wreath, made by the W. H. Mullins Company of Salem, Ohio. At the base of the dome are four life-sized bronze figures by Hibbard representing the Infantry, Cavalry, Artillery, and Navy.Polk, Chris Paulsen, Beautifying Wichita Through Sculpture (Wichita, KS: Project Beauty, Inc., 1980, revised and enlarged 1996), pp. 14-15. Inscriptions on the monument's four facades list the battles, dates and locations in which local soldiers fought. The Liberty figure originally faced the courthouse, but after its installation the veterans decided that the statue should face outward. Rotating it 180 degrees delayed the monument's dedication from Lincoln's Birthday to Flag Day. The monument's interior features a Memorial Hall, 12 feet square, with two marble-and-glass cases displaying war relics. The Hall remained locked for 25 years because the key had been lost. The key was found again in 1948.Baughman, Joe and Linda, Sedgwick County Soldiers and Sailors Civil War Monument, pamphlet created by the Historic Preservation Alliance, Wichita River Festival, 2002.

After the war he worked for the National Bureau of Standards, becoming the director of its national measurements laboratory. He was a professor and director of the engineering materials program at the University of Maryland from 1982 to 1985, director of the Michigan Molecular Institute, and a professor of materials science and engineering at Johns Hopkins University. Early life John Drake Hoffman was born in Washington, D.C., on November 26, 1922. He grew up in Bethesda, Maryland, and attended Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School. He entered Franklin & Marshall College in Pennsylvania, graduating with a B.S. in chemistry in 1942. Manhattan Project Hoffman served in the U.S. Army during World War II. In 1944, he was posted to the Special Engineer Detachment at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. In August 1944, he was one of ten enlisted men to volunteer for a dangerous special assignment: along with four civilians, they were sent to learn about a prototype liquid thermal diffusion uranium enrichment plant at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, part of the Manhattan Project's S-50 Project. This knowledge would be put to use at a larger, production plant then under construction at Oak Ridge. On 2 September 1944, a cylinder of highly corrosive uranium hexafluoride exploded. Nearby steam pipes ruptured, the steam reacting with the uranium hexafluoride to create hydrofluoric acid. Hoffman ran through the toxic cloud to rescue Private Arnold Kramish and two civilians, Peter N. Bragg Jr. (a United Naval Research Laboratory chemical engineer) and Douglas P. Meigs (a Fercleve Corporation employee). Bragg and Meigs died from their injuries but Kramish, Hoffman, and nine others recovered from burns and other injuries. Hoffman received the Soldier's Medal, the United States Army's highest award for valor in a non-combat situation, and the only one awarded to a member of the Manhattan District. Post-war Hoffman left the army in 1946, and entered Princeton University, where he earned M.S. and Ph.D. degrees, writing his 1949 doctoral thesis on \\"The Dielectric Properties of Long Chain Compounds\\" under the supervision of Charles Phelps Smyth. He married Barbara Smith in 1949. They had three sons: James, John and Robert. After her death in 1980, he married Dolores Garcia. Through his second marriage he acquired two stepdaughters, Carol Wichers and Valerie Wichers-Calder. After graduation, Hoffman worked at General Electric as a researcher from 1949 to 1954. He then joined the National Bureau of Standards as a research chemist. He became the chief of the Dielectrics Section in 1957, and of the Polymers Division in 1964. In 1967, he became the director of the Institute for Materials Research. Finally, in 1978, he became the Director of the National Measurement Laboratory. He retired from the Bureau of Standards in 1982. He was a professor at the University of Maryland from 1982 to 1985, and Director and CEO of the Michigan Molecular Institute from 1985 to 1990. Finally, he was professor of materials science and engineering at Johns Hopkins University. He was awarded the Department of Commerce Gold Medal in 1965, the Samuel Wesley Stratton Award of the National Bureau of Standards in 1967, and the Presidential Rank Award of Meritorious Executive. He published over 60 scientific papers, but is best remembered for his 1961 work with John I. Lauritzen on Hoffman nucleation theory.

He moved to D√ºsseldorf in 1860 and entered the studio of Rudolf Jordan. In 1864 he travelled to Paris, where he studied the work of the old masters, and afterwards to Brittany and the Netherlands. He then settled in D√ºsseldorf, where he painted genre scenes, partly serious, partly humorous, taken from ordinary life and the doings of young people; among these Der Verbrecher nach der Verurteilung (\\"The Criminal after the Judgement\\") established his reputation.

Jacob Copeman defines the deras as \\"monasteries or the extended residential sites of religious leaders; frequently just glossed as sect\\". Several deras started out as non-orthodox Sikh sects, and many of them are now centres of distinct non- Sikh religious movements. Many Deras have attracted a large number of outcast Dalits, who earlier embraced Sikhism to escape the Hindu casteism, but felt socially excluded by the Jat Sikh-dominated clerical establishment.  History  The word Dera derives from the Persian word Derah or Dirah, which literally means a camp, abode, monastery or convent. The phenomenon of Dera, as sectarian institution, is not new in Punjab and it is much older than the Sikh faith and Panth. Deras in Punjab, before the Sikh faith, belonged to Sufi Pirs, Yogi Naths, and Sants of Bhakti movement. In Punjab, the popularity of Sufi Pirs/Sants or their Shrines can be seen through their veneration across the communities such as Hindu, Sikh and Muslim. Shrines of Sufis were known as khanqahs. The major function of khanqah was to provide relief to people of all communities, particularly the lower strata of different communities. Several khanqahs were built and facilities were provided to lower castes of Hindu populace in rural areas. Khanqahs with modest hospitality and generosity offered spiritual guidance, psychological support and counseling that was free and open to all people. By doing so, khanqahs challenged the establishment of stratified social structure either Hindu or Muslim societies. Soon, khanqahs became epicenters of socio-cultural and theological activities of people from all ethnic and religious backgrounds and genders. Sufi shrines of Sakhi Sarvar Sultan, Sheikh Farid, Bulhe Shah, Sheikh Fattha, Khwaja Khizr, and Five Pirs (Panj Pir) were the manifestation of the shared devoutness of Punjabis. During the lifetime of the Sikh Gurus, several deras had been established, many of them by the rival claimants to the \\"Guru\\" title. These deras included those of the Udasis, the Minas, the Dhirmalias, the Ramraiyas, the Handalis, and the Massandis. During the consolidation of the Sikh religion, several more deras cropped up. These included the deras of Bandei Khalsa (Bandapanthis), Nanakpanthis, Sewapanthis, Bhaktpanthi, Suthrashahi, Gulabdasi, Nirmalas and the Nihangs. 19th century onwards, several more deras came into being. The distinguishing characteristic of these new deras was that they acted as centres of Dalit mobilization. The majority of the followers of these deras were people of Dalit background, who had embraced Sikhism to escape the casteist Hindu varna system. However, they continued to experience social exclusion in the caste hierarchy of the Sikh society, which pushed them towards the deras and other organizations that promise social equality. The increasing politicization of the Sikh institutions - the Akal Takht and the SGPC - and their domination by Jat Sikhs has driven a large number of people to the Deras as well. The affluent Dalits among the Punjabi diaspora have also contributed to the growth of the deras.  Major deras  According to a 2006-2007 study, there were more than 9,000 Sikh and non-Sikh deras in the rural areas of Punjab. A number of deras are also located in the neighbouring states of Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. = Sikh deras = The Sikh deras strictly observe the Rehat Maryada (Sikh code of conduct). However, there are instances where such deras also observe their own 'Code of Conduct' which is slightly different than Sikh code of conduct published by SGPC.https://www.damdamitaksal.com/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=80&Itemid;=68 Some of the prominent Sikh deras include those of: * Damdami Taksal-led Sant Samaj * Dera Nanaksar * Sant Ajit Singh Hansali * Sant Daya Singh Sursingh Wale * Sant Sewa Singh Rampur Khera * Parmeshwar Dwar Gurmat Prachar Sewa Mission * Dera Baba Rumi Wala (Bhucho Kalan) = Non-Sikh deras = The non- Sikh deras do not abide by the Sikh Rehyat Maryada. Along with the Sikh gurbani, they also recite non-Sikh texts, and some of them also indulge in idol worship. Unlike the Sikh deras, where the holy book Guru Granth Sahib is considered as the only current guru, the non-Sikh deras practice devotion towards a contemporary human guru. Some of the major non-Sikh deras include: * Radha Soamis (Dera Beas) * Dera Sacha Sauda * Sant Nirankari Mission * Namdharis * Divya Jyoti Sansthan * Bhaniarawala Dera * Dera Baba Bhuman Shah (Sanghar Sadha) * Ravidasis (including Dera Sach Khand) 0069 Sawan Singh, portrait.jpg  Sawan Singh of Dera Beas Sant Hari Dass Ji of Dera Sach Khand Ballan.jpg  Hari Dass of Dera Sach Khand Rev Saint Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh Ji Insan.jpg  Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh of the Dera Sacha Sauda The majority of the followers of these deras are Dalits, Backward castes, and the poor among the Jat Sikhs. However, most of the deras are led by people from upper-caste backgrounds. As of 2007, the Nirankaris were led by a Khatri; the Dera Sacha Sauda was led by a Jat Sikh of Sidhu sub-caste; and the Radha Saomis were led by a Jat Sikh of the Dhillon sub-caste. The Dalit-dominated deras have emerged as major centres of counter-culture, where the Dalits assert their pride, customs and tradition.  Conflicts with the Khalsa Sikhs  The deras are seen as a challenge to the mainstream Sikhism represented by the Khalsa Sikh identity. The total number of the followers of the various deras far exceeds the number of followers of the Golden Temple-based clerical establishment (the Akal Takht). The tensions between the Dalits and the Jats have manifested in form of conflicts involving the Deras. Some of these incidents include: ; Sikh‚ÄìNirankari clashes (1978) : In 1978, the orthodox Sikhs denounced the Sant Nirankaris as false Sikhs, and demanded closure of all the Nirankari centres. In 1978, some Sikhs tried to forcibly shut down the annual Nirankari convention in Amritsar. In the ensuing clash, 12 Sikhs and 3 Nirankaris were killed. In 1980, the Nirankari leader Gurbachan Singh was shot dead. ; Bhaniarawala crisis (2001) : The dera leader Piara Singh Bhaniara imitated Guru Gobind Singh, and launched a new holy book Bhavsagar Granth, after his followers were disallowed from carrying the Sikh holy book Guru Granth Sahib. This led to violent clashes between the Khalsa Sikhs and the followers of Bhaniara. ; Meham dispute (2006) : In the Meham village, the Ad Dharmi Dalits had been maintaining the Udasi dera of Baba Khazan Singh for six decades. They offered liquor as prasad at the dera, and also distributed it among the devotees. In 2003, the Sikhs placed a copy of Guru Granth Sahib at the dera, and later objected to the liquor offering, arguing that it was against the Sikh Rehat Maryada. In 2006, they forcibly took control of the dera, and replaced all Udasi symbols with the Khalsa symbols. This led to a clash between the two communities. However, the timely police intervention prevented escalations. The dera was placed under a government official, and the dispute was referred to the court. ; Vienna killings (2007) : On 25 May 2007, six orthodox Sikhs attacked the Ravidassia members of Dera Sach Khand with a gun and knives, at a gurdwara in Vienna, Austria. The Dera leader Niranjan Das, who was visiting the gurdwara built by the Dera members, was seriously wounded in the attack. Two people died in the attack, including Das' deputy Rama Nand. The incident led to clashes in India as well, and prompted the Ravidassias to explicitly declare their religion as separate from Sikhism. ; Sikh-Dera Sacha Sauda clashes (2007) : In 2007, the Dera Sacha Sauda leader Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh was accused of imitating the Sikh Guru Gobind Singh. The resulting controversy escalated to civil unrest in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Delhi. Several people were killed in the clashes, and in 2008, there was an attempt to assassinate the Dera leader.  Politics  Various political parties, including the Shiromani Akali Dal, and the Bharatiya Janata Party, and the Indian National Congress, have patronized the deras to attract the Dalit vote bank. During the election season, several political leaders and candidates visit the Deras, seeking support from the leaders of the various deras. This trend first became visible during the 1997 Punjab Legislative Assembly elections. The Akali Dal has openly sought electoral support from the Sikh deras. The Sant Samaj deras have openly supported Akali Dal. Among the non- Sikh deras, the Dera Sacha Sauda is influential in the Malwa region, and has a political wing. It has supported multiple political parties in various elections. The Dera Sach Khand asked its Dalit followers to vote for the Bahujan Samaj Party in 2012 Punjab elections, which was responsible for the dismal performance of the Congress in the Doaba region. The Bhaniarwala Dera has not openly supported any political party, but disfavours the Akali Dal candidates. The Dera Beas (Radha Soami) has not openly supported any particular party either, but in the past it used to tilt towards the Congress. In the 2012 Punjab elections, it favoured the Akali Dal, after daughter of a former Dera chief married an Akali Dal leader.

The screenplay was written by Harold Shumate, based on a story by Tay Garnett and Howard Higgin. Prior to filming the studio had been warned by the MPAA that the film did not comply with its code, but it is unclear whether changes were made to the script. Plot Jo is a hostess, also known as a \\"B\\" girl (a euphemism for a prostitute), in a \\"cliphouse\\", a seedy waterfront nightclub where the patrons are set up for a pickpocket operation. The club is owned by Eddie Morgan, who keeps an eye on things by posing as the piano player. A former hostess, Annie, returns to the club in order to tell Morgan off and let him know that he ruined her life. Not getting satisfaction, she attempts to get Jo to turn witness against Morgan in order to get him arrested, but Jo is too afraid. While there, Annie witnesses Jo being treated roughly by a local hood, Red Connolly (William Pawley), who she accosts, which turns into a brawl. Dan Walters, a sailor, and two friends show up at the club, and Jo begins to flirt with him. Finding that she likes him, she does not want to follow her usual routine of getting him drunk and taking his wallet, but Morgan insists. However, she is clumsy in her attempt, and is thwarted by Walters, who leaves, disillusioned with Jo, who he was beginning to like. Jo realizes that she would like to get out of her occupation, but Annie's failure to start a new life after leaving makes her unsure. Morgan is furious that she failed to lift the wallet, and slaps her around, leaving her bruised. When Walters returns to the club later, he notices the bruises and in an effort to get Jo out of the situation, offers to marry her and move away with her. To assist in his plan to rescue Jo, Walters begins to snoop around in order to get dirt on Morgan. He uncovers quite a bit of illegal activity, and approaches Steve Mason, an undercover detective, with the information. Morgan learns from Nellie, the owner of another local establishment, of Walters' plan to take Jo away, and also discovers that Walters has spoken to Mason. He attempts to do away with Walters; the result is an all-out brawl, during which Morgan himself is knifed to death. Annie confesses to stabbing Morgan and gives herself up to Mason, who takes her away. Cast * Preston Foster as Dan Walters * Ann Dvorak as Jo * Douglas Fowley as Eddie Morgan * Wynne Gibson as Annie * Arthur Loft as Steve Mason * Bruce Bennett as Budge * Eddie Acuff as Scotty * Bradley Page as Al * Linda Winters as Tricks * Beatrice Blinn as Daisy * Dick Wessel as Willie * Peggy Shannon as Nellie Production Before filming began, the Production Code Administration (PCA) of the MPAA issued a complaint to Columbia that the script was in violation of three of the production code tenets. They were its \\"general sordid, low-toned background and flavor\\"; the fact that the film's hero is a thief who does not face punishment; and that Annie, a confessed murderess, is also allowed to escape without punishment. The PCA made several suggestions to the head of Columbia, Harry Cohn, on changes that should be made, although it is unclear whether Cohn had any changes made to the script. The film was originally titled Street of Missing Women. It began production in the last week of September 1939. Members of the cast announced at that time included Ann Dvorak, Preston Foster, Arthur Loft, Wynne Gibson, Betty Compson, and Peggy Shannon. Compson, Gibson and Shannon had been stars during the silent era, and were now cast as \\"B\\" girls in the film, meaning prostitutes. Still under the title Street of Missing Women, the film's shooting wrapped the week of October 24. On October 25, Variety released the names of several additional cast members: Bruce Bennett, Don Beddoe, Douglas Fowley, Lorna Gray, Linda Winters, and Beatrice Blinn. This was Bennett's first film under this stage name; prior to this he had been billed as Herman Brix. On October 31 Columbia announced that they were retitling the film to Cafe Hostess. By November 11, it was announced that the film would be released on November 30. The Legion of Decency gave the film an \\"A-2\\" classification, meaning it was only suitable for adult audiences. One of the title cards at the beginning of the movie read: \\"B-Girls...Bar Girls...Cafe Hostesses...Products of a man-made system, these girls whose stock in a trade is a tireless smile, a sympathetic ear and a shoddy evening gown, they prey on the very men who made them what they are. The Cafe Hostess knows only one law...A lady must live!\\" At least two local censorship boards, in Alberta and Pennsylvania, required the removal of that title card. Reception Motion Picture Daily gave the film a lukewarm review, calling it a \\"routine melodrama\\", although the reviewer did praise the efforts of the cast. The Motion Picture Herald gave the film a more positive review, although the reviewer felt the story was \\"unexciting\\". He noted \\"occasional outstanding melodramatic moments\\" and complimented the acting of the entire cast and especially Salkow's direction, stating that his deft pacing sustained the film despite the flawed story.

She has been described as \\"New Zealand's Julia Child\\". Early life and family Born in Matamata on 23 November 1925, Flower was the daughter of Leonard Flower, a postmaster, and Constance Ruby Irene Flower (n√©e Mincher). She grew up in Matamata and Tauranga, and received her secondary education at Epsom Girls' Grammar School, where she was a boarder. In 1944, she went on to study at the University of Otago, obtaining a Diploma of Home Science. Career After leaving Otago, Flower taught home science at Pukekohe High School. In 1951, she travelled to the United States, where she attended a number of Cordon Bleu courses. She was awarded a bursary to study at the √âcole h√¥teli√®re de Paris in 1954‚Äì55, and was subsequently employed by Unilever in Wellington as a home economist. In her nine years at Unilever she worked initially on laundry and cleaning products and packaging, and later on frozen, dehydrated and canned foods. Visits to family in the United States exposed Flower to food journalism, and in 1965 she was appointed as the food editor of the New Zealand Woman's Weekly. She established New Zealand's first magazine-based test kitchen, using her scientific background for recipe testing and adapting traditional recipes for modern equipment and busy lives. Likened to the American food writer Julia Child, Flower is credited with helping New Zealanders move away from their traditional meat, potato and vegetable dinner, and was among those who popularised ingredients perceived as exotic, such as garlic, capsicum and avocado. When Flower retired from her role at the New Zealand Woman's Weekly, her test kitchen had a staff of nine. In addition to her regular food editorial column and recipes in the Woman's Weekly, Flower contributed to the Auckland Star and the New Zealand Home Journal, and wrote or edited a number of cookbooks. In 1982, she established the Star‚ÄìWoman's Weekly School of Cooking. Flower was instrumental in the formation of the New Zealand Guild of Food Writers in 1988, and served as its inaugural chair. Personal life In 1980, Flower married Keith Thomas Aitken, who was editor of the Auckland Star newspaper from 1977 until his retirement in 1983. He died in February 1985. Honours In the 1983 New Year Honours, Flower was awarded the Queen's Service Medal for public services. She was also a life member of the New Zealand Guild of Food Writers. Later life and death In her retirement, Flower lived in the Auckland suburb of Mount Eden, in a house that had been owned by her maternal grandparents. She continued to write and edit cookbooks, and mentored many New Zealand food writers. In 1998 she published her autobiography, Self-raising Flower. She was still involved in the food industry in 2016, when she worked with Eggs Incorporated to promote World Egg Day. Flower died in Auckland on 15 August 2017.

He was also known as Baba and Shri Dabral Baba. Dabral Baba hailed from Ujjain in the state of Madhya Pradesh. He adopted his surname (Dabral) after his maternal uncle's who virtually brought him up at Dhar and later to Ujjain. He was also unusual among Indian yogis who was a householder - he got married, raised a family, worked in Vikram University in Ujjain. Dabral Baba lived with his family at his home (Bhairav Niwas) located in Rishinagar in Ujjain. Dabral Baba attainted substantial enlightenment and earned popularity among highest ranks of yogis in 20th and 21st century period. In the later part of his life, he was visited by many great saints both physically and spiritually primarily Mahavatar Babaji who took him to his gupha as well. Dabral Baba unveiled Vikrant Bhairav temple in Bhairavgarh, Madhya Pradesh the idol of Vikrant Bhairav was deep buried in mud for years, Dabral Baba was guided to unveil this temple and he later attained enlightenment with the guidance of his guru.  Biography  =Early life= Dabral Baba was born at Timli, a village in Pauri Garhwal district in the state of Uttar Pradesh (now in Uttarakhand), India. He spent his childhood at Timli with maternal grandparents and at Kathoor with paternal grandparents. Later he came to Dhar, a district headquarters in Indore Division and to Ujjain, a divisional headquarters in the state of Madhya Pradesh. = Vikrant Bhairav Temple Discovery by Dabral Baba = thumb Dabral Baba discovered this temple in 1960. He used to meditate at Kal Bhairav and strongly driven by divine impulse he reached to Shipra River to wash his hands. A saint sitting at bank of river told Baba that he was waiting for him told him to walk on north side of river. Walking on his own destiny in the jungle around bank of Shipra, on soggy ground he reached to deserted place at a time when darkness was all over, no later Baba stood in front of now known as Vikrant Bhairav idol, deeply covered in mud. He scratched, uncovered hard mud coat and unveiled the idol of current Vikrant Bhairav. Eventually, the image of Vikrant Bhairav gradually appeared before Dabral Baba who stood with folded hands for some time. He then filled an earthen lamp with oil, lit it, placed a few roses and lighted a bunch of incense sticks. A shudder of awe ran through Dabral Baba who left the mysterious place charged with a feeling of happiness, joy, pleasure and surprise at having reached the place of his dream. = Honor with 'Baba' = In year 1960, on windy night during Diwali festival. Baba went to light up earthen lamp before the image of Vikrant Bhairavji and immediately left the awe-inspiring solitary place. As air was blowing strongly, he turned back to see if the lamp was still burning and Dabral Babaji was astonished to notice that the whole area was brightly lit up with hundreds of earthen lamps and the image of Vikrant Bhairavji was radiantly shining. It was a terrifying experience for Dabral Babaji who couldn't believe his eyes. He moved fast to the temple of Kaal Bhairav where a person was sitting. Dabral Babaji narrated him everything and both of them returned to the river bank to witness the same sight. The old man was the first person to touch the feet of Dabral Babaji and addressed him 'BABA'. This enlightening event transformed Dabral Babaji's life altogether. Since that day Dabral Babaji has been worshipping Vikrant Bhairavji with unflinching faith and sincere devotion. =Link with Mahavatar Babaji= In the later year of his life, he revealed, his communion with Mahavatar Babaji, famous known deathless guru as acknowledged in Autobiography of a Yogi , the guru of Lahiri Mahasaya visited him periodically and guiding his journey to the thee, he used to speak less, was childlike in behavior, rarely revealed his spirits. In one communication, he manifested his journey of how Mahavatar babaji took him to his cave to him often take him in his dera (group) to stay forever and often visit to him. He consistently address baba sitting in front of him directly guiding him all time, he claimed the there are many other saints including two white foreigners in his group (addressed as Dera by him) he said Mahavatar Babaji quite often travel with his dera and says 'Dera Danda Uthao' meaning group lets leave. Dabral Baba said, when Mahavatar speaks, now one talks you just listen and his picture becomes red, he can speak any language but he address in Hindi all the time. = Mahavatar Babaji spotted in Ujjain (Kumbh 2016) = First Instance : During Kumbh Mela 2016 in Ujjain, Babaji at his home in Bhairav Niwas asked his disciple to turn on tv while sitting in deep meditation . He pointed his finger on tv, asking his wife and one of his devotee Yogesh to look at live telecast of the Kumbh Snan, he addressed his finger pointing to tv on a very young around 25 years old sadhu taking dip in river Shipra in mid of crowd as shown on tv-channel live feed of Kumbh Snan (Kumbh Mass bath). Yogesh asked ensuring by pointing his finger on tv to young sadhu, Baba said that young boy is Mahavtar Babaji. Dabral baba said, this Sadhu will shake his head (Jata) to wash his hair. Yogesh and Maa (wife of Babaji) witness that boy shaking his head to the camera and washing his jata. Babaji saluted him and then camera moved pointing to other place. Second Instance : Many saints during Kumbh Mela 2016, claim to visit and spiritual guided by Dabral baba at periodically at different instances. Baba himself wanted to visit Pilot Baba. While sitting in deep communion with him, he again showed his close ones pointing to white foreigner lady walking in the crowd with a bag on her shoulder made of cloth, they both together acknowledge that she is Mahavtar Babaji visiting in womanly body in ujjain for the bath and prasad and went back in communion. Third Instance : In 2015, he was sick on his bed, wasn't able to walk, couldn't visit temple regularly because of his swelling on legs and deep pain in aging body, he said I requested Mahavtaar Babaji that I want to do puja ritual, at Bhairav Jayanti. Babaji told him back 'Kal Tumhe hum 25 saal ka bana denge' (ill make you 25 years old tomorrow). Babaji said at morning he felt in different body of youth, he walked by himself to perform puja all day and yagna. He said while in puja, baba himself was present there and he regained his body when at bed after baba was with him. = Selfless Guru = During Kumbh Mela (2016) in Ujjain, majority of spiritually enlighten yogi from all part of India and great Himalayas acknowledge his as param-avatar, assuring he is one who received direct guidance from Mahavatar Babaji and known to jointly visit him physically and spiritually to seek guidance and bowed down in his honor of visiting him. Every day he used meet people average (~250 people) at his residence seeking for his blessings to redress their sufferings and spiritual guidance. Babaji used to address visitor by their name as they walk in, talk about their problem without them sharing. Dabral baba often link it back saying ‚Äòbaba bol rahe‚Äô (His master is saying) addressing to his spiritual master and treating himself as mediator. Babaji never sought popularity, known for childlike attitude and total self-less guru who reflected the guidance of thee through his body always state in deep sub-conscious meditative communion with higher bodies. His simplicity, selflessness and compassionate demeanor and equality for all managed to attract many people from the nation and abroad. Babaji never took anything from visitors and any donation he received in his temple went back to serve devotee as prasad. He always pray on behalf of visitor for their problems, he was true master who demonstrate selfless spirit that visited earth as drop of the divine.

Confraternities Since the early 1860s, Miki Nakayama had asked her followers to form confraternities (ko Ë¨õ). One of the earliest examples was the Shinmei confraternity, formed sometime in April 1878.The Life of Oyasama, p.106 Obtaining government authorization From the 1870s, Miki Nakayama and her followers were constantly being persecuted by local government authorities and from members of established religions for expressing their beliefs and performing the Service. To put an end to the persecution, various followers sought for recognition from different religious and state authorities, even though this was against the wishes of Nakayama. Tenrikyo could not apply as a completely independent religion because Japanese law during the Meiji period did not grant civil authorization to churches outside of the established traditions, which at the time were Shinto, Buddhism, and Christianity.Tenrikyo: The Path to Joyousness, 59.Tenrikyo Overseas Mission Department. A Historical Sketch of Tenrikyo. Translation of Oyasama Nensai to Tomoni. Tenri, 1990. p.6-7. In 1880, Nakayama's eldest son, Shuji traveled to the Jifuku Temple at the foot of Mount Kong≈ç, a Buddhist temple belonging to the Shingon sect. The Jifuku Temple agreed to Shuji's request to establish a church, and on September 22, 1880, the \\"Tenrin-O-Kosha\\" church was formally inaugurated with a Buddhist fire rite and sermons by Buddhist priests.The Life of Oyasama, p.110-1. The Meisei confraternity spread Nakayama's teachings as moral philosophy and thus escaped persecution. Following this example, a petition was submitted on May 9, 1884 to establish an organization named, \\"Tenrin-O-Sha: Institute for the Study of Practical Ethics.\\" Thought the office denied the request because of the lack authority to grant the request, an office called \\"Tenrin-O-Sha\\" was nevertheless opened in Osaka.The Life of Oyasama, p.200. In March and April 1885, the followers approached the Shinto Headquarters for the appointment of Shinnosuke Nakayama (Nakayama's grandson) and nine others as religious instructors. On May 22, Shinnosuke was appointed as a religious instructor, and the next day, May 23, the other religious instructors were also appointed, and permission was granted for the establishment of a sixth-degree church to be directly supervised by the Shinto Headquarters. On June 2, a letter accepting these appointments was sent to the Shinto authorities.The Life of Oyasama, p.202. The first attempt to obtain civil authorization happened on April 29, 1885, when the followers filed a petition to the governor of Osaka for permission to form the Tenrikyo Church. Attached with the petition were four texts ‚Äì The Twelve Songs, Ofudesaki Part IV, Ofudesaki Part X, and the Story of Creation. The request was denied. On July 3, the followers filed a second petition to the governor of Osaka, which read, \\"Request to Establish the Shinto Tenrikyo Church.\\" Again, the request was denied.The Life of Oyasama, p.202-4. =Death of Nakayama Miki= Cemetery of Nakayama Miki. On January 26, 1887 by the lunar calendar (February 18 by the Gregorian calendar), the foundress of Tenrikyo, Nakayama Miki, died at around two o'clock in the afternoon, after a performance of the Service.Tenrikyo Overseas Department. An Anthology of Osashizu Translations. Tenri, 2007. p.20-1. On February 25, 1887, a funeral for Nakayama Miki was conducted, with over 10,000 people in attendance.A Historical Sketch of Tenrikyo, p.3. Initially, she was buried in the graveyard at Zenpuku-ji (a Buddhist temple in modern-day Tenri City), along with other members of the Nakayama family. However, in 1892, Tenrikyo followers, led by Nakayama Shinnosuke, constructed a new cemetery on Mount Toyoda, and the ceremony for her reburial was held on December 13. The reburial ceremony was attended by over a hundred thousand people.A Historical Sketch of Tenrikyo, p.10-12. Under Shinto Main Bureau A petition for the legal recognition of a church was sent to the government office of Tokyo prefecture. On April 10, 1888, the governor of Tokyo approved this petition, establishing Tenrikyo Church Headquarters as a \\"sixth class\\" church belonging to the Shinto Main Bureau (Á•ûÈÅìÊú¨Â±Ä Shinto Honkyoku).A Historical Sketch of Tenrikyo, p.6. The legal authorization removed the threat of suppression and allowed followers to seek permission to establish branch churches and to gain official recognition for missionary work.Tenrikyo: The Path to Joyousness, 56-58. Later in 1888, Koriyama and Yamana were established as the first two branch churches under Tenrikyo Church Headquarters.A Historical Sketch of Tenrikyo, p.7. On April 6, 1891, the Shinto Main Bureau changed Tenrikyo's designation from a \\"sixth class\\" church to a \\"first class\\" church.A Historical Sketch of Tenrikyo, p.10. =Rise in membership= The membership rose sharply in the first decade of the Headquarters' existence. In 1892, the number of Tenrikyo followers had allegedly reached over one million, a thirty-fold increase in membership in five years. By December 1896, Tenrikyo had 3,137,113 members belonging to 1,078 churches, and there were 19,061 ministers. This growth invited negative reactions from Buddhist institutions, which were concerned about losing adherents, and from newspapers such as Chuo Shinbun, Yorozu Chouho, and Ni- Roku Shinbun, who labeled the religion as \\"anti-social.\\"Tenrikyo: The Path to Joyousness, 56-58.A Historical Sketch of Tenrikyo, p.19. =Home Ministry's directive= On April 6, 1896, the Home Ministry (ÂÜÖÂãôÁúÅ Naimu-sh≈ç) issued \\"Directive No. 12,\\" which ordered strict and secretive surveillance over Tenrikyo Church Headquarters under the pretense of maintaining and strengthening the state polity of Japan. Issues raised by authorities were the congregation of both men and women together (which could potentially lead to disgrace), the obstruction of medical treatment, and the alleged policy of enforced donations.Tenrikyo: The Path to Joyousness, 59-60. The Tenrikyo leaders complied to the state demands in several ways. They changed several aspects of their prayer ritual, known to adherents as the Service.As for the exact changes made in the prayer ritual: \\"Only the second and third sections of the Service were allowed to be performed; only male performers could perform the Service; only men's instruments could be played; and the kagura masks were to be placed in front of the Service performers instead of being worn by them\\" (Tenrikyo: The Path to Joyousness, 61). The name of the Tenrikyo deity Tenri-O-no-Mikoto was changed to \\"Tenri-no-Okami.\\"A Historical Sketch of Tenrikyo, p.21. Tenrikyo Church Headquarters' conformity with the state demands resulted in a dual structure of the Tenrikyo faith, where on the surface, Tenrikyo complied with the state demands, while adherents disregarded those changes and maintained the teachings and rites as initially taught by Miki Nakayama.Tenrikyo: The Path to Joyousness, 61-63. Drive toward sectarian independence In 1899 the Shinto Main Bureau advised the Tenrikyo Church Headquarters officials about the possibility of official recognition as an independent religion (independent meaning to be classified directly under the Meiji government, which upheld State Shinto ideology). Tenrikyo leaders worked to systemize the Tenrikyo doctrine and institutionalize the organization so that the petition for independence would pass. Tenrikyo Church Headquarters made a total of five attempts before it finally achieved independence in 1908. On April 1, 1900, Tenri Seminary, Tenrikyo's first educational institution, was founded as a training school for ministers. In 1902, Tenrikyo arranged its mission administration system in Japan, which divided the country into ten dioceses and appointed superintendents to supervise regional missionary activities. In 1903,A Glossary of Tenrikyo Terms, p. 4. an edition of Tenrikyo's doctrine was compiled (known today as the Meiji kyoten, or the Meiji version of Tenrikyo's doctrine). This edition of the doctrine differs significantly from the present editionFor instance, the Meiji kyoten contained ten chapters: 'Revering God,' 'Respecting the Emperor,' 'Loving the Nation,' 'Morality,' 'Accumulating Virtues,' 'Cleansing of Impurities,' 'Founding of the Teachings,' 'Repayment to God,' 'the Kagura', and 'Peace of Mind.' See Tenrikyo: The Path to Joyousness, p. 64 because the teachings of State Shinto were incorporated in order to gain the Home Ministry's approval. Although Tenrikyo Church Headquarters complied with many of the state's requests, it did not compromise on the request to completely eliminate the Mikagura-uta (\\"The Songs for the Service\\"), one of Tenrikyo's main scriptures. Around this time, Tenrikyo began to open its first churches overseas in Taiwan (1897) and Korea (1904). Sect Shinto The fifth petition for independence was submitted to the Home Ministry on March 20, 1908 and accepted later that year in November 27. Tenrikyo Church Headquarters set up its Administrative Headquarters, formally appointed Shinnosuke Nakayama as the first shinbashira, the spiritual and administrative leader of Tenrikyo, and established its constitution. On February 25, 1912, the Home Ministry invited representatives from seventy-three religious groups to the Three Religions Conference (‰∏âÊïô‰ºöÂêå Sankyokaido) including a Tenrikyo representative (the three religions represented were Shinto, Buddhism, and Christianity, and Tenrikyo was categorized under Shinto). This conference initiated a program of national edification, and with the support of the government, Tenrikyo was able to hold lectures at 2,074 places through Japan, drawing nearly a quarter million listeners.Tenrikyo: The Path to Joyousness, 64-7 Due to the relative relaxation of state control on Tenrikyo rituals, the performance of section one of the Mikagura-uta was restored in 1916, after two decades of prohibition under the Home Ministry's directive. In 1925, a school of foreign languages was established for missionaries, including what would become Tenri Central Library. The same year saw the establishment of a printing office, a department for researching of doctrinal and biographical materials, and a major expansion of the church's education system, including a new girls‚Äô school, nursery, kindergarten, and elementary school. In 1928, the Ofudesaki was published. Three years later, in 1931, the publication of the Osashizu was completed, making the three main scriptures of Tenrikyo available to all followers for the first time. On the occasion of the completion of the South Worship Hall of the Main Sanctuary in 1934, the Kagura Service was restored for the first time since it had been prohibited in 1896. During this period, churches were opened in Manchuria (1911), the U.S. (San Francisco Church, 1927),The Headquarters of Tenrikyo Church. The Short History of Tenrikyo Church. Nara, 1956. p. 159. Brazil, and Southeast Asian countries. In 1910, missionaries were sent to England to propagate the Tenrikyo teachings, but they were not able to establish themselves permanently there.The Short History of Tenrikyo Church. p. 157. It was only a number of decades later, in 2000, that a mission center (Tenrikyo UK Centre) was established in England. Wartime Japan As the war between Japan and China grew from the Mukden Incident to the Second Sino-Japanese War, state control of religious and secular thought intensified. For example, in December 1935, state authorities destroyed the buildings of Omotokyo Headquarters and arrested the organization's leaders. One week later, on December 16, 1935, around four hundred policemen were sent to investigate Tenrikyo Church Headquarters on suspicion of tax evasion, even though there were no grounds for that accusation. After the National Mobilization Law was passed in 1938, Japan's wartime polity strengthened. In 1939, Tenrikyo Church Headquarters announced that it would reform its doctrine and ritual, under threat of forced disbanding of the organization by state authorities. Under the reformation, copies of the Ofudesaki and Osashizu were recalled, certain chapters were deleted from the Mikagura-uta,Specifically, Yorozuyo, Song Three, and Song Five. See Mikagura-uta. and the Kagura Service, an important Tenrikyo ritual, was not allowed to be performed. All preaching, rites, and events were to follow the Meiji version of Tenrikyo's doctrine from 1903. The 1940 Religious Organizations Law further increased state surveillance and oppression in Japan. After World War II Tenrikyo Church Headquarters viewed from the south gate. In its own historical account, Tenrikyo refers to the years following the surrender of Japan and the conclusion of World War II as fukugen, or \\"restoration.\\"Tenrikyo: The Path to Joyousness, 77. One of the significant aspects of the \\"restoration\\" was the republishing and reissuing of the three scriptures of Tenrikyo in their entirety: the Mikagura-uta in 1946, the Ofudesaki in 1948, and the Osashizu in 1949. In addition, the doctrine, which for decades had been colored by State Shinto ideology, was revised to reflect the teachings conveyed in the main scriptures and authorized in 1949. Another aspect of the \\"restoration\\" was the construction of the Oyasato- yakata, begun in 1954. As of 1998, twenty four wings have been completed and are used for various purposes, such as educational facilities, medicinal facilities, institutes for doctrinal studies and religious training, and followers' dormitories. The construction continues to this day.Tenrikyo: The Path to Joyousness, 78.

Our soldiers today are descended from those very same warriors of antiquity, while structurally, the Pakistan Army is directly descended from the grand old regiments of the old Indian Army, some of which predate Pakistan by nearly two hundred years. It has a rich and proud history extending both sides of Partition (1947) ‚Äì always defending Pakistan. Taken together, Pakistan's military history and the overlapping history of Pakistan Army form a substantial part of our nation's history. Add to this the need for our officers and men to be well-versed in general military history - a matter very close to their hearts - and one can see the case for a single organisation to handle these subjects. The COAS (Chief of Army Staff) General Qamar Javed Bajwa is credited with approving a proposal to establish the Army Institute of Military History on 2 June 2017 ‚Äì the day AIMH was officially born. It has been set up as a semi-autonomous research body with a broad outreach both within the civilian and military domains and is steered by a designated governing body, the Army History Board (AHB). Located in Rawalpindi and close to the Army Museum and the Army Central Library, the institute is mandated to archive, record, research, teach and promote military history, along with allied subjects such as physical history (in all its dimensions), battle honours, regimental lineages, customs of the service, matters of dress and accouterments, and so on. The institute also serves as a forum for veterans, academia, subject experts and concerned civil society members to gather and air their learned views on subjects of interest to the Army. AIMH also encompasses outreach to academia and students. With a Military History Wing, Composite Wing and Current Affairs Wing, the institute is emerging as a centre for both historical and current affairs; a melting pot for serving and retired officers, and civilians to meet and exchange views. Our forte remains military history, with research directors assigned to regularly visit the Army's schools of instruction, and the nation's universities and colleges as visiting faculty and guest speakers. Military history buffs will also find themselves welcome in our lounges. Historyurl=https://www.aimh.gov.pk location=Rawalpindi Canttlanguage=en-pk}} Its mission is to advise the army staff on historical matters in an event of conflict or peacetime, as well as preserving the history and heritage of the Pakistan Army. The AIMH is attached with the IG T&E; Br, currently based at the Army GHQ.

It is a remake of the 2006 video game Yakuza 2, and is the series' second remake title following 2016's Yakuza Kiwami. It was developed using the Dragon game engine from Yakuza 6. The game was released for PlayStation 4 on December 7, 2017 in Japan, and worldwide on August 28, 2018. It was released for Microsoft Windows worldwide on Steam on May 9, 2019 and released for Xbox One on July 30, 2020.https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/14/20965416/yakuza-xbox- one-game-pass-announcement-release-date  Gameplay  Yakuza Kiwami 2 is a remake of Yakuza 2, and is an action-adventure game set in an open world environment and played from a third-person perspective. Similar to the previous remake title, Yakuza Kiwami, Kiwami 2 follows the same plot structure of Yakuza 2 while adding new gameplay features and enhancements from later titles, as well as new story elements to resolve confusing plot points in the original release and tie the game more closely to other titles in the series. The player controls series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu as they explore the fictional Japanese districts of Kamurocho, Tokyo and Sotenbori, Osaka, based on the real life locations of Kabukicho and D≈çtonbori, respectively. Combat is based on that previously seen in Yakuza 6, though with a variety of new moves and special cinematic 'Heat Moves'. A new story scenario, entitled \\"The Majima Saga\\" features recurring series anti-hero Goro Majima as a playable character. The Cabaret Club minigame from Yakuza 0 returns, as does the Clan Creator from Yakuza 6, bringing in New Japan Pro Wrestling stars Keiji Mutoh, Masahiro Chono, Riki Choshu, Genichiro Tenryu, and Tatsumi Fujinami. Plot A year after leaving his former life in the Tojo Clan behind, ex-yakuza Kazuma Kiryu is called back into action when the clan's Fifth Chairman, Yukio Terada, is murdered by assassins from a rival organization, the Omi Alliance. Returning to Kamurocho, Kiryu must find a new chairman for the Tojo Clan and prevent an all-out war between the Tojo and the Omi, bringing him into conflict with Ryuji Goda, the legendary \\"Dragon Of Kansai\\" of the Omi Alliance. A new scenario, entitled \\"The Majima Saga\\" exclusive to Kiwami 2 explains how Majima came to leave the Tojo Clan following the death of his patron, Futoshi Shimano, a year earlier and form a legitimate enterprise, \\"Majima Construction\\", between Yakuza and Yakuza 2. The scenario also features the return of Makoto Makimura, a major character of Majima's story in Yakuza 0. =Majima Saga Plot= In February 2006, Tojo Clan's Fifth Chairman Yukio Terada announces a reformation plan for the clan, which requires a replacement for the clan captain position. Up in the run for the position were newcomer Akinobu Uematsu, Kei Ibuchi and Goro Majima, who were making the most profits among the clan. Having no interest in the position and only participating to ensure the other families can band together to keep the newcomers from seizing power, Majima returns to Kamurocho, where he finds himself ambushed by several assassins. After quickly dealing with them, Majima returns to his family office, where he finds his men beaten supposedly by the Uematsu Family. Majima heads to Uematsu's office, but finds Uematsu himself shot dead. After reporting the incident to Tojo Clan members, Majima is tipped by Kazama Family patriarch Osamu Kashiwagi to find the Florist of Sai, who can provide him information. Upon meeting up with the Florist, he agrees to help Majima in exchange for the latter's agreement in running the Florist's old base in Purgatory. Majima then learns that one of his subordinates, Ryota Kawamura, was last seen at the crime scene. He travels back to Sotenbori to track down Kawamura, and eventually learns that he's a regular gambler who frequents the massage parlor Hogushi Kaiken. While at the parlor, Majima receives service from a woman named Tateyama, who turns out to be Makoto Makimura, who Majima saved from the Tojo Clan 18 years prior. Majima, while attempting to hide his identity, learns that Makoto still kept her old watch as a memento of her savior. Majima later picks up a tip that Kawamura murdered an Omi Alliance officer at the Cabaret Grand. He heads there and confronts Kawamura. The latter is easily defeated, but is then shot dead by Kei Ibuchi, a Tojo Clan patriarch who exploited Kawamura's debt to use him to get rid of Uematsu, in order to spark a war between the Omi Alliance and the Tojo Clan, leading to their eventual merging and Ibuchi seizing power from Terada. Majima defeats Ibuchi, but the latter commits suicide rather than allowing himself to be arrested to incite conflict between both sides. In the aftermath, Majima and Terada come to an agreement to disband his family, as a gesture of apology for Kawamura's action against the Omi Alliance. Majima and the remnants of his family then form Majima Construction, and begin work on the Kamurocho Hills complex. Some times later, Makoto leaves the country with her family; she received an anonymous gift prior to her departure, which turns out to be a replacement strap for her watch. Realizing that her customer that day was also her savior 18 years ago, Makoto finally finds comfort knowing she has no regrets leaving Japan. Development Yakuza Kiwami 2 was initially leaked on August 24, 2017 via a listing on the Taiwanese PlayStation Store. The title was officially announced two days later alongside Yakuza: Like a Dragon, Yakuza Online, and Fist of the North Star: Lost Paradise. The game runs on the Dragon Engine which was previously used in Yakuza 6. Several characters were recast for the remake, including Hakuryu as Ryo Takashima, Houka Kinoshita as Wataru Kurahashi, Yuichi Kimura as Tsutomo Bessho, and Susumu Terajima as Jiro Kawara. The in-game arcade features playable versions of Virtua Fighter 2 and Virtual On: Cyber Troopers. Music Japanese rock band SiM provided theme song in Kiwami 2. The first song \\"A\\" serves as opening theme while the second song \\"Sound of the Breath\\" serves as an insert song. Both of these themes are also featured in the ending credits of the game. Reception Yakuza Kiwami 2 was well received by critics. It was the best selling game in Japan during its debut week, selling 131,931 units; this was the lowest debut for a Yakuza game, which was noted as expected due to being the first stand-alone PlayStation 4 title that is not a new main entry. The PC version was among the best-selling new releases of the month on Steam. Famitsu liked the seamless transitions when entering shops or starting battles, and enjoyed being able to use various items in the city as weapons. The game was nominated for the Freedom Tower Award for Best Remake at the New York Game Awards, and for \\"Animation, Technical\\" and \\"Game, Classic Revival\\" at the National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers Awards.

The grey regions are lower density fields. The four densest dune fields are shown in black. The prime meridian is at the bottom of the map. Hyperboreae Undae is shown on the left, between longitude 302.92¬∞E to 316.02¬∞E (43.98¬∞W ‚Äì 57.08¬∞W). Hyperboreae Undae (Latin: \\"Far Northern Waves/Dunes\\") is one of the largest and densest dune fields of Planum Boreum, the Martian North Pole. It is named after one of the classical albedo features on Mars. Its name was officially approved by IAU in 1988. It extends from latitude 77.12¬∞N to 82.8¬∞N and from longitude 302.92¬∞E to 316.02¬∞E (43.98¬∞W ‚Äì 57.08¬∞W). Its centre is at latitude 79.96¬∞N, longitude 49.49¬∞W, and has a diameter of . Hyperboreae Undae is southwest of the Boreum Cavus depression, an arc-like depression at the northeastern boundary of Chasma Boreale. From there, Hyperboreae Undae continues in a southwestern direction through Chasma Boreale, and into the lowlands of Vastitas Borealis. It overlays the eastern part of Hyperboreae Lingua and the region above Escorial crater. Hyperboreae Undae is well known for the barchanoid and linear dunes that have formed at its location, although they are seemingly incompatible. Research has been ongoing to explain the coexistence of these types of dunes at Hyperboreae Undae and elsewhere on Mars. Another type of formation found at Hyperboreae Undae is the yardang. __TOC__ Dune characteristics Hyperboreae Undae dunes shown with surface frost. The dunes become darker when the frost sublimates from solar heating and the dark sands are revealed. Although the dunes surrounding the Martian north pole show no signs of movement, two possible exceptions may be the dunes in parts of Abalos Undae, and the dunes of Hyperboreae Undae. In the case of Hyperboreae Undae, the dunes close to its eastern boundary appear to be buried under the Planum Boreum 3 unit. At that area, some of the dunes exhibit dark streaks that may have been caused by katabatic winds. This may indicate sand movement, due to Aeolian activity, which is recent enough to retain the streaks, otherwise these marks tend to disappear with time; other dunes do not exhibit such marks. The dunes of Hyperboreae Undae, according to data provided by the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars, exhibit the weakest signature for the presence of surface ice in the area of Chasma Boreale. Hyperboreae Undae, along with Abalos and Siton Undae, contributes sand to mainly medium-density dune fields east of Olympia Undae and extending to the Martian prime meridian, Image analysis research, using the method of spectral derivatives, has indicated that Hyperboreae Undae, as well as the other dense officially-named northern circumpolar dune fields (Olympia Undae, Abalos Undae, and Siton Undae), show the highest density of gypsum in the area. A geomorphic comparison of Hyperboreae Undae with Rub' al Khali, Earth's largest contiguous dune field, has determined that the morphologies of the two ergs follow similar developmental patterns. Coexistence of linear and barchan forms Coexistence of linear and barchan forms at Hyperboreae Undae. A study has been undertaken to explain the coexistence of these two forms. The location of the initial study site is at the boundary of Hyperboreae Undae with Boreum Cavus. Linear dunes form primarily in bidirectional (bimodal) wind fields. Transverse dunes, also called barchan, form when there is a unidirectional (unimodal) wind regime. A third type of dune, the star dune, is typically formed in multidirectional (multimodal) wind regimes. The presence of each of these dune forms, suggests the wind regime that produced it. Linear and star dunes are rare on Mars. The existence of both linear and barchan dunes in the same location is apparently incompatible, as that would seem to imply the co- existence of unidirectional and bidirectional winds in the same place. Research has been undertaken to explain the coexistence of linear and barchan dunes in Hyperboreae Undae. One paper explains the change from linear to barchan dunes in adjacent locations, by proposing a wind model that changes from bidirectional to unidirectional due to the influence of local topography; it is proposed that bidirectional winds change to unidirectional due to funneling action introduced by local geomorphology. Although valid for neighbouring dune locations, this theory cannot explain how linear and barchan dunes can coexist in the same location. Another study, proposes that the linear dunes have become crusty (indurated), and thus resistant to changing form with changing wind directions. The study also proposes that the bimodal wind direction changed with time to unidirectional, which would produce barchan-type dunes, while the preexisting indurated linear dunes, due to their hardening, would remain in place. This theory is plausible, although it cannot be easily verified, because the time profile of the wind patterns for Hyperboreae Undae would need to be recovered. Hyperboreae Undae barchanoid and linear dunes from NASA's Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) A third study combines images taken by the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter with the deployment of the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) to obtain local coordinates of the topography shown in the HiRISE images, and then maps the HiRISE image data into a computer simulation which registers the spatial computer model of the local topography of Hyperboreae Undae in the vicinity of Boreum Cavus. From the crestline orientation of the numerical model, the local wind vectors can be computed, and the results can then be compared to the measured wind data of the area under investigation. Conversely, if the wind vectors are known, the bedform morphology can be predicted. By comparing the numerical simulation results to measured real-world data, the computer simulation parameters can be refined, leading to better convergence between numerically-predicted and field-measured results. Limitations for the computer model include the resolution limits of the numerical model, the small area under investigation, and the complexity of the local wind conditions. The numerical study obtained results that demonstrate that Hyperboreae Undae was formed under modern wind conditions and that its form, the coexistence of barchan and linear dunes, can be established by the numerical model. Further research plans include the extension of the field of study to include modelling all of Hyperboreae Undae.

It was named after Phidippides, the famous Greek runner who died after running from Marathon to Athens in 490 BC. It was coined by Dr Justin E. Trivax MD, director of the Beaumont Cardiovascular Performance Clinic and Associate Professor at the Oakland University / William Beaumont School of Medicine, during his fellowship at Beaumont Health.http://www.iowaheartfoundation.org/upl/downloads/presentations/heart- disease-in-the-endurance-athlete-phidippides-cardiomyopathy-and-beyond.pdf This has been quoted in the literature multiple times and has been inaccurately thought that Dr. James O'Keefe had coined the term. He was speaking about the sudden death of Micah True, a 58-year-old ultrarunner and cult hero a.k.a. Caballo Blanco who died on a 12-mile training jog in the rugged Gila Wilderness of southwest New Mexico. After an autopsy, the Albuquerque coroner wrote that ‚ÄúMicah True died as a result of cardiomyopathy during exertion‚Äù. Since then, multiple websites have warned their readers on the possible damage from prolonged endurance training. The suggested etiology for Phidippides Cardiomyopathy is the cardiac remodeling from prolonged strenuous exercises. The repeated prolonged states of volume overload in the right atrium and right ventricle from endurance training will lead to chronic structural changes. Long term changes include patches of cardiac fibrosis which can allow zones of re-entry for cardiac arrhythmias.http://www.iowaheartfoundation.org/upl/downloads/presentations/heart- disease-in-the-endurance-athlete-phidippides-cardiomyopathy-and-beyond.pdf It is suggested that Cardiac MRI is the best imaging modality to investigate this condition.  Controversy  There is not much evidence describing this condition and other than a case report, no other studies have corroborated the pathophysiological changes suggested by O'Keefe. Not all experts agree with Trivax and O'Keefe. Many feel that further research is necessary to understand this condition better.

The Group's origins date from discussions held at the Sydney Pride Centre in between 2003 and 2004. The Group's Patrons are Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore, artist William Yang and Meredith Burgmann. History By August 2003, Sydney's Pride History Group had incorporated as an Association, and now operates out of the suburb of Glebe. Australian LGBT rights activist, historian and political scientist Lex Watson served as President of the Group between 2010 until his death in 2014. Other Presidents include LGBTIQ activist Robert French who had previously served as Convenor of the New South Wales Gay and Lesbian Rights Lobby and Vice President of ACON http://www.starobserver.com.au/features/community-spotlight/community-hero- robert-french/143974 and current President, Shirleene Robinson, an academic historian and marriage equality activist with Australian Marriage Equality.http://www.starobserver.com.au/news/national-news/new-south-wales- news/forget-the-library-the-pubs-the-new-place-to-learn-about-lgbti- history/140657https://www.australianmarriageequality.org/theboardandtheteam/ Activities The main activity of Sydney's Pride History Group involves the collection of oral histories. The bulk of interviews have been collected as part of the 100 Voices Collection, which includes memories dating back to the 1950s.Jeffrey Weeks, What is Sexual History? (Oxford: Polity Press, 2016) The 100 Voices Collection also includes interviews about what would become known later as Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, the HIV/AIDS epidemic, decriminalisation and the marriage equality movement. The 100 Voices Collection was launched in 2013 at Paddington Town Hall by New South Wales Governor Marie Bashir and Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore. The Group has also published a number of books. These include Camp as a Row of Tents: The Life and Times of Sydney's Camp Social Clubs, Camp Nites: Sydney's Emerging Drag Scene in the '60s, New Day Dawning: The Early Years of Sydney's Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. and Out and About: Sydney's Lesbian Social Scene, 1960s-1980s.

The Group is currently also working on an LGBTIQ Pioneer Names Project, which was launched by Lord Mayor Clover Moore and aims to record the individuals who played a role in shaping LGBTIQ Sydney. Most recently, the Group launched PridePod, a podcasting series about Sydney's LGBTIQ history. Partnerships Sydney's Pride History Group works closely with the City of Sydney, as well as a range of other organisations, including groups representing the 78ers who marched at the first Mardi Gras, local libraries, Australian Lesbian and Gay Archives and groups from across the LGBTIQ and the broader community.

The trail begins in the village of Saint-Eug√®ne and goes to the eastern boundary of the City of Ottawa, passing through the townships of East Hawkesbury, Champlain, The Nation, Alfred and Plantagenet, and Clarence- Rockland. The trail primarily passes through farmland, with some forested sections. Because it runs along a railway right-of-way, it is extremely flat. The trail surface is mainly stone dust, although it is paved near population centres. Notable sights along the trail include the former railway station in Bourget and the bridge over the South Nation River near Plantagenet. Pavilions are located along the trail in Saint-Eug√®ne, Vankleek Hill, Plantagenet, Bourget, and Hammond. The trail is used for a variety of purposes, including hiking, cycling, and snowmobiling (in the winter). Neither ATVs nor horse- riding are allowed on the trail, although horse-riding is allowed on the Prescott-Russell Trail Link. The route runs along the former roadbed of the Canadian Pacific line between Ottawa and Montreal, which is now owned by Via Rail. The rails were lifted in 1986, while the trail was inaugurated in 2006. The agreement between Via and Prescott-Russell lasts until 2020. Potential Closure In 2016, the Prescott-Russell announced that it was studying the idea of closing the trail, due to its $400,000 per year maintenance cost. The county ultimately decided in the 2017 budget to cut the trail maintenance budget to $200,000 a year. Further consultations on the viability of the trail have been held. Prescott-Russell Trail Link The Prescott-Russell trail link is a 26-km extension of the Prescott-Russell Recreational Trail into Ottawa, following the same former railway right-of-way. It goes from the western end of the Prescott-Russell trail at the eastern border of the Ottawa, passing near Navan and Orleans before ending in a dead end near Highway 417. It is maintained by the City of Ottawa.

The area It lies opposite the Quinault Reservation. From the map, it is clear the Quinault River drains into the Pacific Ocean, opposite Quinault Canyon. The north of the Copalis National Wildlife Refuge is also a bit east, as are a few cities and sites, as Kalaloch, Queets, Taholah, Point Grenville (a headland), Moclips, and Pacific Beach. Also, Quinault, Washington and Lake Quinault are both onshore. The canyon is dynamic area where humans do not detect massive submarine landslides which occur on its steep side walls, and the bottom collects sediment deposited from above. Its dimensions Quinault Canyon is from shore, and is 378 square nautical miles in area. Nearby submarine canyons All of the following submarine canyons are near, headed north to south: * Clayoquot Canyon * Father Charles Canyon * Loudon Canyon * Barkely Canyon * Nitinat Canyon * Juan de Fuca Canyon * Quileute Canyon * Quinault Canyon * Grays Canyon * Guide Canyon * Willapa Canyon * Astoria Canyon Of local submarine canyons, Quinault canyon is deepest. Quinault Canyon has a maximum depth of . Quinault Canyon's relationships to volcanic eruptions Both the 1980 eruption of Mount Saint Helens and the eruption of Mount Mazama in about 5677 BC left turbidites, in Quinault Canyon. On Quinault Canyon's role as a pathway Quinault Canyon has acted as a funnel for north- and northwestward- moving sediment along Washington‚Äôs continental shelf, and it is a major pathway between the continental shelf of Washington and deep sea. Silt and clay originating from the Columbia River move down Quinault Canyon. On Quinault Canyon's aquatic life It also serves as a conduit for dense, cold, nutrient-rich seawater pulling toward shore, where upwelling feeds surface productivity at the base of the food web. Due to productive topographically induced upwelling that occurs, Quinault Canyon is important for many fish, invertebrate, and whales. High relief is offered by boulders, vertical walls, and ridges. Rockfish have used this. As of June 14, 2016, there has been low sampling, but there are 14 records of *corals, *sponges, and *pennatulids, including black coral and glass sponge. Quinault Channel A deep-sea channel, Quinault Channel, connects Quinault Canyon to Cascadia Channel. Exploration of Quinault Canyon As of August 2017, there is an expedition to explore Quinault Canyon, something never before done. Results are forthcoming. Remotely operated underwater vehicles or autonomous underwater vehicles have never before explored Quinault and Quileute Canyons. These canyons are of great interest. The mission is to map habitats that support many of the Quinault Nation‚Äôs treaty fisheries, sample for harmful algal blooms, to map the ocean floor, to check oxygen levels, and investigate ocean acidification. Methane seeps Methane seeps have been found, inside and near Quinault Canyon.

The film concerns Matt's childhood from that of the death of his mother as well as Smith's terminal cancer diagnosis which leads to them growing closer to each other through professional wrestling after being near estranged for many years. Production and marketing Director Kurt Spenrath had long been a fan of the Harts as a child since he grew up in Alberta where the family is near universally known. He began interacting with the them after doing a project about Teddy Hart (Smith's nephew) that was put on hiatus due to legal reasons which were later settled. Spenrath has explained that he spent a lot of time coming up with different \\"heart\\" related puns for the project but settled on \\"still beating\\" for fitting the theme that Matt Hart is continuing on with his life after the misfortune that befell on him. The film was intended by the filmmakers to follow in the footsteps of Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows, the first documentary about Bret Hart (Smith's younger brother) which is one of the most acclaimed works about professional wrestling ever made. Much of the film was shoot at Ranchman's Cookhouse and Dancehall in Calgary, where Matt wrestled regularly. Matt's stepmother, wrestling promoter Stacey Olaszak asked to not be mentioned in the film as she wished for it to focus only on Smith and Matt, despite this she did participate in the making of the film and received a special thanks in the credits. Spenrath has stated that he loved working on the story and that he hoped that it would be successful enough to get him the opportunity to make more similar films about the Canadian wrestling scene, he also expressed gratitude to Olaszak for lending her crew to welcome and help during the making of the film. Upon the films completion Spenrath promoted the film in various ways, including appearing on the Pro Wrestling Torch radio show. The film was announced to the public with an accompanying content summary in early August 2016 and the trailer was released shortly after. Promotional material for the film noted its focus on Matt and Smiths relationship as well as Smith's cancer diagnosis. Summary The film begins with Matthew declaring his love of professional wrestling. It is followed by a montage of Matt wrestling in different matches while his father looks on, as Matt continues to explain his family's history in the industry, how it has shaped them and made them a unit. He concludes his monologue with stating that professional wrestling has saved his life. Matt explains further in the next scene that wrestling is an outlet for him that keeps him in the right state and helps him after his traumatic background. He and his cousin Harry Smith spend the scene demonstrating wrestling moves to young children and training them how to perform, Matt likes his situation to some of the children who come from less prosperous conditions and says that he hopes he can help them use wrestling to channel their feelings as well. Matt's aunt Diana narrates the next scene, continuing where Matt left of previously and expands on their family history, from her father Stu to her brothers Bret and Owen and to Matt generation. There is more footage of Matt, this time being trained himself by his father as his Smith explains more elements of the industry. As Matt and Smith continue to train there are spliced in interview segments of them discussing their relationship. This is followed by an interview with Teddy Hart (Edward Annis), Matt's oldest cousin in the wrestling business who says he finds it heartening to see his uncle train his own son as the other third generation members of the family were taught by their uncles. After some more conversations with various family members it is revealed that Smith has been diagnosed with cancer. Smith's brother Ross and their nephew Harry both express their hopes that Smith can recover in time. Matt also expresses this, going on to explain that his mother is already gone, so he does not know how to deal with both his parents potentially being dead soon. The film shows a flashback with a young actor portraying a 13 year old Matt finding his mother dead on her bed. He speaks about how it was his 13th birthday and he and his mother had planned to spend the day together having fun but that when he arrived to the house she had passed out and been found by another person already dead. Diana explains that this led to Matt being placed in foster care as the authorities did not deem his father a stable enough security to the boy at that time. Matt explains how he was separated from his family and his only way to keep contact with his past was watching wrestling videos on YouTube at a friends house, wishing that he would find his way back and reclaim his dream of stepping into the ring himself. He talks about addiction and how he exchanged harmful addictions to constructive ones, such as training and performing wrestling. He says that it's those things that keeps one alive in his situation. The film continues on showing more family interactions, most with Matts older half-sister Tania and their father. The next scene shows Matt suiting up in his wrestling gear to have a match for his family's promotion while Teddy talks about how proud he thinks Smith must be to see his son continue on the family tradition. Both Teddy and another family member Bronwyne Billington express how they wish they could have had their fathers (B.J Annis and Dynamite Kid respectively) be there for their first matches, like Matt has. The film ends with everyone expressing their happiness for professional wrestling helping to bring their family back together again. Release and reception The film aired on August 31, 2016, and was released on video on demand in September. The VOD debut was followed by an issued press release about the film. Andre Corbeil of The Brand stated that even big Hart family fans would learn something from the documentary. Alt URL Former WWE producer and wrestling reporter Randy Helms expressed that the documentary was very good in his opinion and that it gave him a newfound understanding of what some of the Harts have gone through in their lives, inside and outside of the wrestling business. Alt URL Nick Hausman of WrestleZone said that it was good but very short. He likened the story of Matt being taken away from his father to that of Harry Potter, where a young boy with special talents is bereaved of the opportunity to use them until he is reunited with the world he lost, but instead of a world with literal magic it's the fantastical heightened world of professional wrestling. Isabel Rodriguez of SocialSuplex enjoyed the film feeling that its focus on the younger Hart over anything else was a good choice as it was the most engaging subject. Rodriguez did feel the film was short as well as lacking in some context in parts and she wondered if there was some material cut. She concluded that it was \\"a very enjoyable film that leaves the viewers with a greater understanding of the wrestler known as Matt Hart\\".

Personal William de Leybourne, first Lord Leybourne, was the eldest son of Roger de Leybourne from his marriage to Eleanor Ferrers. He married Juliana de Sandwich (1245-1327) on 16 October 1265; she was the daughter of Sir Henry de Sandwich. Juliana inherited all his estates and money in Kent. She was only four years old when her father died. William had three sons with Juliana, Thomas de Leybourne, Henry de Leybourne, John de Leybourne and three daughters, Idonea, Katherine and Joan. After his marriage William lived at his wife's manor of Preston-next-Wingham, Kent. In 1275 he was involved in a dispute with a Jewish moneylender, involving a large loan supposedly made to his father. In 1278 he decided to sell the manor and Leeds Castle to Queen Eleanor, who took over his financial debts, she cancelled all of the arrears that he inherited from his father, and payment for Castle Leeds. In the period leading up-to the death of his first son Thomas in 1307 he bequeathed him and his wife, Alice, who was the sister of Guy de Beauchamp, 10th Earl of Warwick, with the Manor of Leybourne.

The tunnels will constitute the first mountain crossing constructed as part of California High-Speed Rail, connecting the San Francisco Bay Area and Central Valley portions of the system. The tunnels are planned to consist of two diameter tunnels. At long the main tunnel is expected to become North America‚Äôs longest rail tunnel, surpassing the Mount Macdonald Tunnel in British Columbia. An additional rail tunnel is planned to be constructed to the west. The tunnels are expected to cost around $5 billion. The right-of-way runs parallel to the existing Pacheco Tunnel and Santa Clara Tunnel, two contiguous water tunnels connecting the San Luis Reservoir into Santa Clara County.  History  In 2004, two options were in consideration for the Diablo Range crossing: the Pacheco Pass option and a \\"direct\\" tunnel between San Jose and Merced significantly north of the Pacheco Pass. A route through the Altamont Pass even further north was also considered. In July 2008 the Pacheco Pass option was selected. The reasons were that the Altamont alignment would require the track to split west of the pass to serve different parts of the Bay Area, would require a new crossing of the San Francisco Bay using a rehabilitated Dumbarton Rail Bridge or a new bridge or tunnel nearby, and would require more homes to be seized by eminent domain. The Pacheco alignment, however, would increase travel times between the Bay Area and points north of Merced, and passes through more environmentally sensitive areas. A November 2009 court ruling however reopened the environmental review process. The suit was brought by the cities of Palo Alto, Menlo Park, and Atherton, which opposed elevated high-speed rail tracks running through them and preferred the Altamont Pass route. By September 2010, the rail authority had completed extra studies and reapproved the same route. However, a November 2011 ruling again overturned the approval. The Pacheco Pass alignment was upheld by the California Court of Appeal for the Third District in July 2014. In June 2017, the California High-Speed Rail Authority began performing geological sampling of the tunnel area, with a design-build contract expected to be awarded in 2018. The rock under Pacheco Pass is known to be of the Franciscan Assemblage formation. On February 12, 2019, Governor Gavin Newsom in his first State of the State address announced that parts of the system outside the Central Valley segment from Bakersfield to Merced would be indefinitely postponed, including the Pacheco Pass Tunnel. Nonetheless, the CaHSRA board chose the tunnel alignment as their preferred build alternative in September 2019. this section of the system has a projected start of service in 2031.

It is the debut novel by the writer.  Writing background  The story takes place in the imaginary Silicon Isle. The Chinese word Á°ÖÂ±ø for Silicon Isle shares a similar pronunciation with Guiyu (Chinese: Ë¥µÂ±ø) in Mandarin. In the real world, Guiyu is a town in the Shantou prefecture of Guangdong province in China. And it is Shantou where Chen Qiufan was born and grew up before he entered Peking University. Situated on the South China Sea coast, Guiyu got famous in the global environmentalist community for its reception of E-waste. The town held the record for being the largest E-waste site up to 2013. Though some residents got rich by electronic recycling, pollution became serious in the town. Talking about the background of writing the novel, Chen said: Choosing my hometown as background to write the story, is related to my thinking of China. To depict the pain of changing China, is just because I desire for she getting better gradually.  Setting  The Waste Tide depicts a dystopian China in the post-2020 era. In the Guiyu island, the large electronic recycle industries are in full control of local lineage associations. The laborers who undertake dangerous work for the profit of the Chinese and foreign businessmen who employ them are depicted not as humans, but cyborgs whose bodies and minds have been altered permanently through bio- engineering.  Plot introduction  Mimi is a 'waste girl', a member of the lowest caste on Silicon Isle. Located off China's southeastern coast, Silicon Isle is the global capital for electronic waste recycling, where thousands of people like Mimi toil day and night, hoping that one day they too will get to enjoy the wealth they've created for their employers, the three scrap families who have ruled the isle for generations. It all changes when a ship bearing a dangerous cargo arrives at Silicon Isle. What looks like normal e-waste, is actually infected by a virus born out of one of the darkest episodes of WWII, Project Waste Tide. In a fateful accident, Mimi is infected by the virus and becomes the host for an omniscient consciousness, hell-bent on righting all the wrongs that have been done to her people. A class war ignites, one that draws in environmental extremists and waste workers, and involves family feuds and darker conspiracies.

Originally part of the Village of West Park, it was annexed by the city in 1923. Formerly known as Puritas‚ÄìLongmead, the neighborhood takes its name from the two streets which form its northern boundary: Puritas Avenue and Bellaire Road. About the neighborhood The area which became Bellaire‚ÄìPuritas was initially organized as part of Rockport Township in 1819. It remained a highly rural, thinly-populated area until the end of the 1800s, when the Linndale development began to be built. In 1900, Cuyahoga County created West Park Township from what remained of Rockport Township. Transportation in West Park was limited to a few rutted dirt roads, which led to the area's nickname as the \\"lost city.\\" West Park agreed to be annexed by the city of Cleveland in 1923. The Chicago Line of the Norfolk Southern Railway (NS) (completed in 1851) forms the western boundary of the neighborhood. The NS' Rockport Yard, CSX Transportation railroad tracks (completed in 1910), and Interstate 480 (opened in 1987) form the neighborhood's southern boundary, and CSX tracks (constructed in 1851) largely define its eastern boundary. Another set of NS tracks run diagonally southwest-to-northeast, cutting the neighborhood roughly in half. Interstate 71 forms the area's western boundary. These highways and railroad tracks leave the neighborhood relatively cut off from surrounding neighborhoods and cities, and break the neighborhood into two distinct residential districts. More than 20 percent of Cleveland's industrial activity occurs within the Bellaire‚ÄìPuritas neighborhood. A large number of industrial parks exist along I-480 and the NS and CSX railroad tracks in the southern part of the neighborhood. This is the heaviest concentration of industrial parks in the city of Cleveland. Manufacturing is the predominant economic activity in Bellaire‚ÄìPuritas, followed by employment in the education, healthcare, and social welfare assistance fields. The main retail corridors in the area are on Puritas Avenue between W. 156th and Bellaire Road, and on W. 130th between Bellaire Road and Sprecher Avenue. Most of the housing in the neighborhood dates from the period immediately after World War II. Houses were built first in the neighborhood's eastern section, with development moving west. Single- family homes are generally small, under . Much of this housing stock is deteriorating, even though residents of Bellaire‚ÄìPuritas have a median household income of $32,900 (20 percent higher than that of Cleveland as a whole). Residents in the neighborhood have relatively low levels of education, with just 14 percent of citizens having an associate degree or better. Almost 30 percent of all Bellaire‚ÄìPuritas residents depend on Social Security as their sole source of income.

The meeting was about if American Merchant Seamen should support French Indochina Colonial actions. To quote: \\"THAT WHEREAS, we. as loyal American Merchant Seamen fought and sacrificed for the democratic principles and ideals as outlined at the Teheran, Yalta and San Francisco conferences, to which our country was a signatory; and whereas our Government continues to charter American owned and operated, ships flying the American flag to a foreign government, in this instance, the British Government. At which government, in turn, is permitting the French Government to transport French Colonial Combat Troops to Indochina for the purpose of suppressing the attempts of the native population to establish a free and democratic government of its own choosing, a right that has been guaranteed them at all the Three conferences. \\"AND WHEREAS, the fact that these troops are equipped with American weapons, clothing and food, that are being transported on American ships by American seamen, make it appear in the eyes of the native populations that our Government is carrying out the imperialist policies of the French and British And then this one: \\"AND WHEREAS, we, as American Merchant Seamen, as far back as 1936. attempted by strikes and protest to bring before the American public the then dangerous policy that our government was following in allowing certain selfish and greedy vested interests to sell and ship guns, cotton, oil and scrap iron to Japan. Our protests and strikes against this policy were condemned by this powerful and reactionary group.\\"Abilene Reporter-News from Abilene, Texas, Page 13, February 2, 1946 She departed Sydney with 1400 troops steaming to Glasgow in the United Kingdom. She stopped for water and fuel at Fremantle in Australia, Colombo in Sri Lanka and Aden in Yemen via the Suez Canal. On April 30, 1946, just before midnight, Georgetown Victory ran aground hard, at near top speed, 100 yards south of Killard Point, in County Down, Northern Ireland, north of Ballyhornan. All of the 1400 Royal Navy and Royal Marines aboard were rescued by life boats and breeches buoy to a tug started at about 5.00am. The wreck was close to shore so some men waded ashore through heavy fuel oil and were cared for in nearby homes. The Irish Cloughey and Newcastle lifeboats were launched on the afternoon of 1 May to help. Winter storms later broke the wreck into two parts. Later, all remaining portable gear not already taken by looters was removed and the ship abandoned. The ship sections were salvaged in 1951 and consigned to the ship-breakers at Troon in Scotland. Parts of the ship are still at , where she ran aground, now a dive site.Georgetown University library, S.S. Georgetown Victorywrecksite.eu, S.S.

This genus is characterized by presence of three petals (along with the genera Stussenia & Lithobium) as opposed to five in the other members of the family. Most members of the genus prefer growing in shady habitats. It is a large genus including about 175 species. This is primarily an Asiatic genus of the tropical and subtropical regions distributed from India and Sri Lanka to the Indo-Pacific. The members of the group are generally herbs or under shrubs, including some stemless members. Leaves opposite, leaf margin entire or serrulate. Inflorescence usually scorpioid cymes. Flowers in most species purple, some members with reddish or white flowers. Stamens 3, (in one whorl) or rarely 6 (in two whorls). Ovary inferior, 3-celled. Many species of this genus have restricted distribution and very small populations and would thus be regarded as Vulnerable (VU) or Endangered (EN) based on IUCN Red List criteria though this taxon has not yet been assessed for the IUCN Red List.

Its inhabitants because of the Ottoman domination were forced to resort to safer areas and thus abandoned it around the middle of the 19th century (1850-1860), and settled in the present villages of Lofos and Rachi (which were a single village which the inhabitants originally called it also Ziaziakos).

Emmylou Harris has said of Delia Bell: \\"If Hank Williams and Kitty Wells had married and had a daughter, she would have sounded like Delia Bell.\\" Grant was recognized as \\"Ambassador of Bluegrass Music\\" by three Oklahoma governors. Biography =Early career= Delia Bell was born Francis Leona Nowell on April 16, 1935 in Bonham, Texas. Bell moved to Hugo as a child. She started playing music with her sisters and brother as a child, and began singing in her teens. She married Bobby Bell in 1959. Bill Grant was born Billy Joe Grant on May 9, 1930, a Choctaw tribal member, and grew up on a ranch near Hugo, Oklahoma. Inspired by the music of Bill Monroe, he took up mandolin. In 1959, Bell began singing with Bobby's friend Bill Grant. Bell accompanied herself on guitar, and Bill Grant played mandolin, and Bell sang tenor to Grant's lead. In 1960, Bell and Grant were regulars on the Little Dixie Hayride radio show on KIHN radio. When Bill Monroe heard them perform, he invited them to perform at his festivals in Bean Blossom, Indiana. This introduced the duo to a wider audience. =Performing and recording career= In the late 1960s, Grant and Bell formed the Kiamichi Mountain Boys (also known as the Bonham Brothers), named after the Kiamichi Mountains near their home. They recorded more than a dozen albums for their own label Kiamichi Records as well as albums on County Records, Rebel Records, Rounder Records, and Warner Brothers. They toured England and Ireland 11 times during the 1970s. The Kiamichi Mountain Boys were disbanded in 1980. After that, Grant and Bell worked either worked with the Johnson Mountain Boys or as a mandolin/guitar duo. Emmylou Harris picked up Bell's solo album Bluer Than Midnight at a California record shop. Impressed by Bell's version of Ruth Franks' song \\"Roses In The Snow\\", Harris recorded it as the title track of her 1980 bluegrass album. In 1982, Harris produced Bell's self-titled solo album on Warner Bros. Records. One of the songs, \\"Flame in My Heart\\", was a duet with John Anderson. The album reached #35 on the Billboard charts, but Warner Bros. dropped her and other artists from their roster. During the 1980s, Bell and Grant recorded three albums for Rounder featuring accompaniment and harmonies by members of the Johnson Mountain Boys and Del McCoury. The 1989 album Dreaming collected songs from their Rounder albums. Bell and Grant continued to perform as a duo until 2006 when their partnership ended. Grant was diagnosed with a brain tumor which was successfully removed, and he recovered. In 2007, Grant began singing on a limited basis with his stepdaughter Amy Patrick. =Awards= In 2006, Grant received the International Bluegrass Music Association (IBMA) Distinguished Achievement award. Grant and Bell have each been recognized as a Pioneer of Bluegrass Music by the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Owensboro, Kentucky. Grant was also inducted in to the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame. =Salt Creek Park= From 1969 until 2003, Grant hosted Grant's Bluegrass Festival on a 360-acre cattle ranch near Hugo. He named the festival site \\"Salt Creek Park\\". In 1987, Bell and Grant also launched a March Early Bird Bluegrass Show, which was staged annually for almost 20 years.

Geography and climate Wonder Valley occupies the gently sloping basin between the Sheep Hole Mountains and Bullion Mountains to the north and the Pinto Mountains to the south. Elevations in Wonder Valley range from in the valley's western reaches to near the eastern frontier of population within the valley. The nearest incorporated community is the city of Twentynine Palms, which lies about to the west. State Route 62 and Amboy Road both pass through Wonder Valley; most other roads in the community are unpaved. Due to its low elevation relative to other communities of the Morongo Basin, Wonder Valley lies near the intersection of the higher-elevation Mojave Desert and the lower-elevation Colorado Desert. Wonder Valley's subtropical desert climate is characterized by very hot summers and cool winters with considerable diurnal temperature variation throughout the year. Moisture from the North American Monsoon contributes to summer precipitation and thunderstorm activity, and most non- monsoonal precipitation can be attributed to winter Pacific storms. Wonder Valley is approximately northeast of the east entrance to Joshua Tree National Park. Infrastructure =Local= Wonder Valley is unincorporated and is under the jurisdiction of San Bernardino County. Residents of Wonder Valley are served by San Bernardino County's County Service Area (CSA) 70M, a special services district with taxing authority that provides residents with fire protection, park, and road maintenance services. Many residents of Wonder Valley live on large parcels of land consisting of , a result of the community's growth after the enactment of the Small Tract Act of 1938. =State and federal representation= In the California State Legislature, Wonder Valley is in , and in . In the United States House of Representatives, Wonder Valley is in . History Wonder Valley was not substantively populated until the United States Congress approved the Small Tract Act (STA) of 1938, a homesteading law that facilitated the leasing and public-to-private transfer of ownership of parcels of up to five acres to United States citizens willing to improve the land by developing a residence, business, or recreational structure. Typical ‚ÄúJackrabbit‚Äù homestead cabin remains in Wonder Valley. Thousands of cabins and other structures built by homesteaders, particularly during a period of popularity in the 1950s and 60s, have since been left abandoned. Although a cleanup effort in the early 2000s resulted the demolition of hundreds of abandoned structures, numerous structures built by Small Tract Act homesteaders still exist in various states of use and repair. More recently, Wonder Valley has earned a reputation for being a fashionable destination for artists, a trend which is frequently attributed to Wonder Valley's association with nearby Joshua Tree National Park.

Completed in 1941, it was merged with the adjacent Queens General Hospital to form Queens Hospital Center in the 1950s, and converted into a general hospital by the 1970s. Now primarily used for administrative purposes, several plans have been proposed to reuse the site, or to preserve the building as a historic landmark. On January 31, 2019 the hospital was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.Weekly list 20190201; aggregate list (National Register of Historic Places) Description Triboro Hospital overlooking the surrounding neighborhood Triboro Hospital is located the west end of the Queens Hospital Center campus on Parsons Boulevard between 82nd Drive and Goethals Avenue. It is located at the top of a hill, part of the terminal moraine that runs west-to-east across Long Island. The building was designed by architect John Russell Pope, and later by the Eggers & Higgins firm after Pope's death, in Art Moderne-style. New York City Commissioner of Hospitals Dr. Sigismund Goldwater and Department of Public Works architect Isadore Rosenfield supervised the design. The hospital served Queens, as well as Brooklyn and the Bronx. The building is a total of eleven stories high, with nine floors for patients and two additional mechanical floors. The building was sited at an angle to the north-south grid, with its main entrance facing southwest towards the intersection of Parsons and 82nd Drive. The orientation allowed afternoon sunlight to hit the front of the building. It features one main wing facing southwest, with shorter wings at each end angled inward to fit the property. The hospital was built with a patient capacity of over 500 with six-bed hospital wards. It was designed with numerous windows and glass interior walls, glass-encolsed sunrooms or solariums, and cantilever balconies, all to maximize natural light entering the facility and exposure of patients to the sun. Each floor of the hospital had three sunrooms. Its basement was built with locker, dining, and storage facilities, along with a tunnel connecting to the then-Queens General Hospital buildings. Triboro Hospital's outer design has a \\"symmetrical facade and a minium of ornamentation,\\" utilizing gray brick and limestone trim. It was built with four elevators installed by the Otis Elevator Company. The T Building is currently used by Queens Hospital Center for administrative offices, storage, and clinic and psychiatric services. Several clinics were relocated to \\"The Pavilion\\" of QHC when it opened in 2007. More services have been relocated from the T Building since then, due to the deteriorating condition of the building. =Transportation= The Q25 and Q34 buses run along Parsons Boulevard, directly serving Building T. The bus route runs north-to-south along 164th Street on the east side of the Queens Hospital campus, serving the main buildings. The bus runs along Union Turnpike several blocks north of the hospital grounds. The closest New York City Subway stations are the Parsons Boulevard station of the IND Queens Boulevard Line on Hillside Avenue to the south, connected by the Q25, Q34, and Q65, and the Kew Gardens‚ÄìUnion Turnpike station to the west connected by the Q46. The Q25, Q34, and Q65 routes also connect with the Jamaica Center‚ÄìParsons/Archer subway station on Parsons and Archer Avenues, and the Sutphin Boulevard‚ÄìArcher Avenue‚ÄìJFK Airport subway and Jamaica Long Island Rail Road stations on Supthin Boulevard and Archer Avenue. History The 22-acre site of Queens Hospital Center was originally the Haack farm, purchased by the city in 1903. The Queensboro Hospital for Contagious Diseases opened on the property on June 29, 1916. Queens General Hospital was opened on October 30, 1935, and absorbed Queensboro Hospital (later the Queensboro Pavilion) on March 1, 1936. =Construction of Triboro Hospital= In 1936, the city planned to construct a new tuberculosis hospital adjacent to Queens General and Queensboro Pavilion, pending funding. The project was approved by the Public Works Administration (PWA). The new hospital would relieve crowding at the Queensboro Pavilion, which treated tuberculosis patients at that time. Architect John Russell Pope began preliminary designs on the hospital in 1937. Groundbreaking on Triboro Hospital took place on August 3, 1938, attended by Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia. Excavating for the hospital's foundation began on September 29, 1938. The cornerstone for the hospital was laid by Mayor La Guardia on September 28, 1939. The hospital was originally to have been dedicated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in November 1940, but the president was unable to attend. The hospital was opened by Mayor La Guardia on January 2, 1941. Costing a total of $3.5 million, 40 percent of the cost (around $1.5 million) was defrayed by a grant from the PWA, with the rest of the money coming from the city. Upon opening, three patients were immediately transferred from Queens General to Triboro Hospital. The next day, nine additional patients were transferred from Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn. Patients were also transferred from Bellevue Hospital in Lower Manhattan. The hospital was officially dedicated on January 28, 1941 by La Guardia, who stated that it was designed to be converted into a general hospital \\"twenty-five years from now.\\" During the various ceremonies, Mayor La Guardia expressed regret for the conditions that ultimately led to the high prevalence of tuberculosis within New York City, making Triboro Hospital necessary. La Guardia attributed the high rates of the disease to a lack of high-quality housing, and the city not keeping up with modern medicine. During the cornerstone ceremony, he referred to the hospital as \\"the Hospital of Mistakes of the Past.\\" La Guardia claimed that slum clearance and improved housing programs would eliminate the disease and the need for institutions like Triboro Hospital. =Later years= In July 1950 Neponsit Beach Hospital, another tuberculosis hospital adjacent to Jacob Riis Park in Neponsit, Rockaway, began operating as an annex of Triboro Hospital, with 24 patients transferred from Triboro to Neponsit. On June 19, 1952, it was announced that Queens General, Queensboro Hospital, and Triboro Hospital would be consolidated into Queens Hospital Center. Three other facilities were also absorbed into the new hospital: Neponsit Beach Hospital; the College Point Outpatient Department, an outpatient dispensary; and the Ozone Park ambulance station. In spite of the unification, Queens General and Triboro Hospital continued to operate largely independent of each other. The College Point dispensary was closed at the end of August 1954, while Neponsit Beach Hospital was closed on April 21, 1955 due to a declining need for tuberculosis treatment. In January 1959, the hospital boards of Queens General and Triboro Hospital were combined to improve efficiency, completing the merger of the hospitals. By the 1970s, the Triboro Hospital transitioned into a normal hospital within the Queens Hospital complex. At this time, Queens Hospital Center was considered antiquated, with over 90 percent of the hospital beds below state health standards, along with overcrowding of hospital wards and shortages of equipment. The large and open hospital wards with dozens of beds that Queens General and Triboro Hospital were built with were now in violation of modern health codes. An entire corridor of Triboro Hospital had been flooded in 1971 due to a broken faucet. The city sought to relocate Queens Hospital Center farther south in Jamaica or South Jamaica. Meanwhile, it was proposed to sell or close Triboro Hospital. Queens Hospital was not relocated, due to community opposition and the city's fiscal crisis at that time. In 1994, the Triboro building received a $10 million renovation to convert its third floor into a psychiatric unit. On October 8, 1998, ground broke on the new main building of Queens Hospital Center, replacing the 1930s-era Queens General main building. At this time, four buildings on the campus that were potential historic landmarks were demolished, but the Triboro Hospital building was preserved by a binding covenant. In 1999, a drug rehabilitation program for senior citizens called \\"It's Never Too Late\\" was opened in the Triboro building. The new QHC building opened in 2001. =Proposals for redevelopment= During the construction of the new Queens Hospital, the city sought to sell or redevelop the sites of several now-obsolete buildings, including Triboro Hospital. In 2003, Margaret Tietz Nursing and Rehabilitation Center sought to lease T building. They planned to create a retirement community within the T Building called \\"Skyline Commons\\". The project was originally envisioned by the company in 1999. The development would consist of 143 independent living units, 19 units for \\"enriched housing\\" (integrated housing for multiple people), and a nursing home. In addition, there would be several recreation rooms, a library, auditorium, restaurant, community center, and a dialysis center. It was promoted as provided apartment-style living, with hotel amenities, and nursing home-style care. The project was approved by New York State Department of Health in August 2007. Skyline Commons was cancelled, however, in January 2009, due to the 2007‚Äì2008 economic crisis. Under the plans, 70% of the apartments had to be sold in order to begin construction; only 50 units had been sold by September 2008. By 2012, the T Building continued to deteriorate, leading Queens Hospital to relocate many services out of the site. $2 million a year was spent on maintenance and utilities for the building. Renovations to bring the building up to proper conditions were estimated to cost $50 million. This would include the removal of asbestos in the building. At this time, QHC sought to lease the building to Comunilife, Inc. in order to create a 251-unit affordable supportive housing complex, which would serve military veterans, people with physical or developmental disabilities, and people with chronic diseases such as diabetes. Patients from QHC and Elmhurst Hospital Center would receive preference in applying for housing in the complex. The plan was opposed by the local community due to fears of increasing crime and disturbances. In January 2014, Queens Community Board 8 (representing Hillcrest) voted to demolish the former Triboro Hospital, in part due to its condition and maintenance costs, but also to prevent the housing plan from moving forward. The decision received opposition from historical preservationists, including 11 architectural conservation groups. Around 2015, the Dunn Development Corporation of Brooklyn proposed another plan for supportive housing within the T Building. The plan would create 205 units of low-to-middle income housing, 75 of which would be supportive housing for patients of Queens Hospital. In 2015, the company signed a 99-year lease with the city. Like the earlier proposal, this plan also was met with community opposition. In January 2018, the New York City Council approved plans to renovate Triboro Hospital for use as affordable housing, with 206 units provided in the building. 131 of the units in the T Building would be reserved for middle income tenants. The remaining 75 would be for individuals who make less than 60 percent of the Area Median Income (AMI), including people who were formerly homeless. During this time, several affordable housing developments were being created on NYC Health + Hospitals property. In June 2018, Triboro Hospital was nominated as a potential landmark on the National Register of Historic Places by New York State. On December 18, 2018, the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development announced that $18.1 million in housing tax credits would be awarded for the creation and retention of 13 affordable housing developments. This included $3.3 million for the redevelopment of the T Building by Dunn Development Corporation.

It is a quadrangular masonry tower covered with white tiles, with blue horizontal stripes and a red lantern. The lighthouse was built on the grounds of the Santa Marta Fort, which now houses a lighthouse museum.  History  The Fort of Santa Marta was probably built in the 1640s, later than of the other fortresses that are distributed along the coast of Cascais, since it was not mentioned in the inventory of forts of Cascais made in 1646. This fortress was built with the intention of preventing the approach of enemies to the Cascais Bay area. In the second half of the eighteenth century the fortress was the object of additional work, the most significant being that of 1762-1763, during which the parapet was widened, and that of 1793, in which battery spaces and quarters were expanded. The Lighthouse In 1864 the fort was considered to be no longer militarily necessary. However, the strategic position its location had for military reasons also applied to navigation and it was decided to build a lighthouse on the site. Concluded in 1867, the Santa Marta lighthouse started to signal its area of the coast of Cascais, crossing with the Guia Lighthouse. In 1868, a small tower was added. A report from 1897 stated that the lighthouse had a fixed red light, given by a dioptric lens directed by a catoptric apparatus. This light was replaced by a 5th-order, fixed-light catadioptric system in 1908. In 1936 the tower was increased in height by 8 meters, due to new buildings in the vicinity that impeded the existing light. In 1949 a foghorn system was installed featuring three seconds of sound followed by seven seconds of silence. The lamp was electrified in 1953, and an automatic light source backup system was also installed, operated by acetylene incandescence. In 1964, a generator was installed thus negating the need for acetylene. Between 1980 and 1981 work was carried out on the complete automation of the lighthouse, which was included in the telecontrol network of the approaches of the Port of Lisbon and in 2000 a new monitoring system was added. The Lighthouse Museum Throughout the twentieth century, the fort and lighthouse of Santa Marta gradually became degraded, leading to a proposal to revitalize the space. The restored fort and new Lighthouse Museum were subsequently opened in July 2007. The combination of a working lighthouse together with a lighthouse museum is unique in Portugal. The collection of the Santa Marta Lighthouse Museum was entirely established by the Portuguese Navy. The exhibition area is divided into two spaces in the former residences of the lighthouse keepers. *Room 1 - Portuguese Lighthouses: This provides information on the history of lighthouses in Portugal and provides exhibits of the technology used. The exhibition includes large Fresnel lenses, with special emphasis on the former optical apparatus of the Berlenga Lighthouse that is 3,70m tall. *Room 2 - Santa Marta, from Fort to Lighthouse and The Craft of the Lighthouseman focuses on the experience of the lighthouse of Santa Marta through the ages. It includes a keeper's diary, which records in great detail the occurrences of foggy days and illuminated nights. *In the small auditorium, a multilingual documentary film, The Lighthouses of Portugal - 5 centuries of history, (15 minutes), tells its story through the testimony of lighthouse keepers. The visitor to the museum also has access to the batteries of the old fort, and its view to the sea and to the Bay of Cascais. Guided tours of the lighthouse are offered for one hour each day.

The film was not released commercially. The film is based on a funny story by Dean Martin's wartime personal problems with hernia. Production How to Smuggle the Hernia Across the Border was a minor production, directed and written by Jerry Lewis who just started his film career. In 1949, he made his first feature film for Paramount, My Friend Irma, along with Dean Martin with whom Lewis had already formed a three-year partnership. From 1946 to 1949, the duo performed shows, until they found great opportunities in the movie business. After My Friend Irma, the two would release 15 more films together until 1956. Their duo ultimately fell apart because of disagreements in the final years. This film can be considered the first solo film by Jerry Lewis, even though he was then a part of the performing duo. The film is also noteworthy for involving actress Janet Leigh, who had appeared in several films before 1949, and actor Tony Curtis, who, as Lewis, just started his film career. Janet Leigh would later work with Lewis two more times: Living It Up in 1954, also with Dean Martin, and Three on a Couch in 1966.

The locality is in the Shire of Mitchell local government area, north of the state capital, Melbourne. At the , Willowmavin had a population of 216. History The traditional owners of Willowmavin are the Taungurong people, a part of the Kulin nation that inhabited a large portion of central Victoria including Port Phillip Bay and its surrounds. Willowmavin was discovered for European use by the famous Overlander and explorer of the Port Phillip District (later Victoria) and South Australia Charles Bonney on about 21 March 1837 on a journey in which he also blazed the trail of the Sydney Road. Willowmavin was settled by Bonney three months later on about 17 June 1837 as a sheep station and he built his head station diagonally across the road from the Willowmavin Primary school, Kennedy's Lane, Willowmavin. Willowmavin would have had its first European building within a couple of days of Bonney's arrival.Williams, Martin. Charles Bonney and the fertile Kilmore Plains, Victorian Historical Journal, Vol. 90, No. 1, June 2019. p108 Bonney's sheep station was unique because the Kilmore Plains on which it was established were permanently watered by three spring-fed creeks and were highly fertile. Thus they were suited for both grazing and high population small acreage farming. After Bonney left, Bonney's station was held successively by Dr Richard Julian Hamlyn, then the partners Frederick Armand Powlett and John Green.Williams 2019, p. 109-111. The most productive part of the property was purchased by William Rutledge on 12 April 1841 in a Special Survey of 5120 acres that was progressively leased or subdivided into small holdings for intensive agricultureWilliams 2019, p. 113-114. whereupon it became the agricultural powerhouse of inland Victoria.Williams 2019, p. 117. The Kilmore Plains had such a concentration of population that in the first Victorian election of 1851 the district controlled two seats.

The books were set in the village of Medeleni, in Ia»ôi County, Romania. The trilogy includes: The Fickle Border () published in 1925, Roads (Romanian: Drumuri) published in 1926, and Between the Winds (Romanian: √éntre V√¢nturi) published in 1927. Teodoreanu‚Äôs inspiration for the novels came from a mansion on the bank of the river Prut where friends from the literary world would gather. On May 21 2016, the mansion became a museum in memoriam of Ionel Teodoreanu. Synopsis At the Medeleni is a novel about an idealised childhood and adolescence, designed in an Edenic patriarchal setting. The plot is centred around two siblings, Daniel and Olgu»õa (Romanian: ) Deleanu, and their step sister, Monica. According to her father, Olgu»õa is an \\"angelic devil, a mixture of purity and inclinations towards little malice.\\" She is constantly shaking, does not accept contradiction, and tries to subordinate everything that surrounds her. Daniel tends to be calm but can often lose his patience and becomes nervous because of his sister, Olgu»õa. He often dreams about saving Monica but is awakened by his sister from time to time. Monica ensures the balance between the siblings, who are in a continuous argument. She is gentle, generous and always jumps in to help others. Monica is in love with Daniel throughout the novel. Daniel realizes at the end that he is in love with Monica as well. They get married and enjoy a happy life. Olgu»õa falls in love with Vania, an older man. She plans to marry him and go to America, but she discovers that she has cancer. In the end, she commits suicide. After the death of Olgu»õa, the Deleanu family sells the estate. Reception Miron Radu Paraschivescu claimed that Olgu»õa is one of the most successful characters in Teodoreanu's literary works. In 1995, a group of experts from Aix-Marseille University reviewed the trilogy and highlighted that Teodoreanu was traditionally considered by Romanians as the novelist of childhood. They remarked that At the Medeleni is a good illustration of life in Romania in the 1920s. At the Medeleni attains the ineffability of sensation and opens with a writing style torn between suffering and voluptuousness, a vertiginous perspective evoking baroque aesthetics. According to the Romanian newspaper Jurnalul Na»õional, \\"At the Medeleni is the book that sealed the literary reputation of the novelist, who, at the age of 30, was already nationally renowned. After his At the Medeleni series, his books became popular items on bookstore shelves[...]\\". Critics and theorists, like George CƒÉlinescu, mentioned that the novel \\"has a lasting value,\\" Camil Petrescu said that the work presents \\"affective aspects\\" of children through a series of life incidents, and, in turn, Garabet IbrƒÉileanu established that the main character, Olgu»õa, is \\"the most striking type[...] and the most successful girl model in our literature.\\" Bibliography =Selected published novels= *Bal mascat (\\"Masquerade Ball\\") *Fata din Zlataust (\\"The Girl of Zlataust\\") *Turnul Milenei (\\"Milena's Tower\\") *IarbƒÉ (\\"Grass\\") =Autobiographies= *√én casa bunicilor (\\"My Grandparents' House\\") *Masa umbrelor (\\"Table of Shadows\\") Notes References External links * Ionel Teodoreanu - How did I write Medelenii (in Romanian) * Ionel Teodoreanu's Biography (in Romanian) Category:1925 novels Category:1926 novels Category:1927 novels Category:Romanian novels ","title":"La Medeleni"},{"id":"55047404","text":"The European School of Alicante is one of thirteen European Schools and the only one in Spain.

Life Henderson was born at Cleish, near Kinross in Scotland, in 1783, son of the gardener to Lord Chief Commissioner William Adam of Blair Adam. He was apprenticed at the age of thirteen to his brother Thomas in General Scott's gardens at Bellevue, Edinburgh, and was subsequently employed in the Earl of Kinnoull's gardens at Dupplin Castle and in the Earl of Hopetoun's gardens at Hopetoun House. His constitution was regarded as not strong enough for outdoor work, so he obtained work in Paisley, Renfrewshire, eventually becoming foreman of a company there. His love of pictorial art led him, however, to attend a drawing-school, and eventually he decided to become an artist. In March 1809 he went to London and studied for three or four years at the Royal Academy. In 1813 Henderson returned to Scotland and settled in Glasgow as a portrait-painter, practising with considerable local success for about twenty years. He exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy in Edinburgh in 1828, 1829, and 1830. He was a founder member in 1825 of the Glasgow Dilettanti Society, and he exhibited there from 1828. His character is described by Lionel Henry Cust in the Dictionary of National Biography: \\"Henderson was a man of extremely original character, of fiery temperament and violent impetuosity in speech, yet full of broad humour, and much beloved by his intimate friends. He was large and ungainly in figure, but possessed a sharp, shrill voice.\\" In 1832 he published in Edinburgh Scottish Proverbs, with etchings by himself, and a preface by his friend William Motherwell; a second edition was published in London in 1876 without the etchings. Henderson, Motherwell and a third friend, John Donald Carrick, were the chief contributors to The Laird of Logan; Anecdotes and Tales illustrative of the Wit and Humour of Scotland. The book contains many anecdotes of Henderson, and the preface supplies biographies of the three friends. It was published posthumously in 1835, and reprinted in 1889. Henderson never married.

According to a 1973 paper in the Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior, the Ranschburg effect is interpreted as a result of a restricted guessing strategy that excludes repetitions of remembered items as possible responses. This term is also described as the deterioration in memory performance when items are repeated in a list of items to be remembered. The Ranschburg effect can also be referred to as repetition inhibition, which should not be mistaken for repetition blindness, which refers to the failure or inability to recall repeated items from the short-term memory when sequences are presented rapidly. The Ranschburg effect is named after Hungarian psychiatrist Paul Ranschburg, who reported the phenomenon in 1901. The bulk of studies of the Ranschburg effect use lists that range from 8 to 10 digits with only one repeated element. A study in The Psychology of Ageing: An Introduction found that Ranschburg effect is greater among older than younger adults since it is suggested that the inhibitory processes act against repeating items.  General overview of research  Early studies of the Ranschburg effect and its outcomes regarding immediate recall suggested that repeated items impaired recall performance regardless of the position of such items within a sequence. Modern studies indicate that positioning of repeated items within a sequence does influence recall performance, where repeated items positioned adjacently within a sequence demonstrate better recall performance than repeated items that are not positioned adjacently. In some experimental instances, sequential presentation of the items was used rather than simultaneous presentation, where both presentation methods report poorer recall of repeated items than non-repeated items. When testing the presence of the Ranschburg effect, major procedural differences suggest the possibility of two separate Ranschburg effects. When repeated items within a sequence are positioned adjacently, an ‚Äòisolation‚Äô effect occurs as a subject is able to recall each repeated item within a context of different non repeated items. This methodological difference when presenting repeated items suggests the possible existence of two separate Ranschburg effects, however it is essentially two method variants as opposed to separate effects. Even when a subject is aware that a sequence may contain a repeated item, the Ranschburg effect can still be present.  Background  Paul Ranschburg was a Hungarian psychologist born in Gy√∂r, Hungary on January 3, 1870. Ranschburg came from an orthodox rabbinate Jewish family and was raised in western Hungary. Ranschburg studied at the University of Budapest and received his M.D. in 1894, and founded a psychological laboratory at the Psychiatric Clinic, which later became an independent state institution in 1905. Ranschburg established the Psycho-Physiological laboratory within the Nervous Disease Department of the Medical Faculty in Budapest in 1899, and was a founding member of the Hungarian Child Study Association and head of the Experimental Psychology Division. Ranschburg primarily researched memory, specifically relating to neurology and psychopathology. Ranschburg received international attention following the publication of his paper about the Ranschburg effect in 1902, which detailed the new phenomenon he had observed that specified homogenous inhibition. Ranschburg first described the phenomenon as a ‚Äòhomogenous inhibition‚Äô that refers to difficulty in memory recall when presented with similar or homogenous elements in a learning list. Ranschburg‚Äôs scientific achievements coincide with the transitional period of psychology occurring when experimental methods were being developed and ideas of behaviourism, Gestalt theory and psychoanalysis were emerging.  Findings  The Ranschburg effect can be attributed to a subject‚Äôs failure to detect repeated items, and the application of inappropriate guessing strategies when attempting to improve short-term memory recall performance. = Guessing strategies = Guessing strategies are utilised by a subject in order to maximise memory span and improve overall recall performance. The Ranschburg effect is eliminated when subjects are instructed to avoid guessing strategies, however this causes the validity and reliability of the test to also become eliminated. Repetition inhibition, otherwise known as the presence of the Ranschburg effect, can be produced by output interference and guessing strategies. The poorer recall of repeated items in a short sequence that occurs when the Ranschburg effect is present is primarily understood as being attributed to the result of restricted guessing strategies. Such guessing strategies disregard the repetition of remembered items as possible responses, and therefore result in poorer memory recall when items are repeated in sequences. If all subjects employed the same guessing strategy of restricting guesses to the set of items they had not already recalled, they would be unable to fully recount the item sequence correctly. This signifies the result of applying an inappropriate guessing strategy when attempting to improve short-term memory recall performance of a sequence containing repeated items. = Sequence configuration = The presence of the Ranschburg effect decreases correlatively as set size increases, suggesting that the extent of the effect is dependent on improved performance on non-repeated items. Situational experience of the subjects when testing the Ranschburg effect also suggests that guessing strategies and biases can be modified. The omission or incorrect recall of a repeated item within a sequence of otherwise different items results in the presence of the Ranschburg effect. Serial recall of repeated items within the short-term memory is more accurate when repeated items are positioned in close proximity within a sequence than when items are positioned far apart. Repeated items positioned at the beginning or end of a sequence also improves the rate of detection and absence of the Ranschburg effect. When repeated items within a sequence are separated by two or more intervening items, there are reports that there is a significant decline in the recall accuracy of the repeated item, and the Ranschburg effect is produced. When repeated items are positioned adjacently to one another, recall facilitation is significantly improved. = Age = The Ranschburg effect is more common in older adults than young adults, with greater response suppression and repetition inhibition results increasing with age. Repetition of an item within a list of items is also shown to impair immediate serial recall of a list of items within subjects. When comparing item recall of sequences with a repeated item and sequences with no repeated items, the recall performance was poorer in sequences with a repeated item than sequences with all different items. When repeated items occur within a sequence, recall of the second repeated item is generally poorer than first repeated item. Poorer recall performance in sequences with repeated items suggests that such experimental conditions have a perceptual or memorial basis, however Ranschburg‚Äôs work does not allow for a differentiation between the two. The presence of the Ranschburg effect is more likely to increase when subjects are presented with items positioned in the middle of a sequence rather than items positioned at the ends of the lists. = Tagging = Noting a repeated item during the encoding process can be referred to as tagging, and is more likely to occur when repeated items are positioned next to each other or close together. Specifically, the immediate repetition of an item can be tagged within the short-term memory in order to increase the probability of accurately recalling the repetition, demonstrating the impact that the position of the repeated items within a sequence can have. Although subjects may correctly encode the repetition of an item within a sequence, they do not necessarily consciously notice it. This results in the omission of the second repetition of an item within a sequence, and results in the presence of the Ranschburg effect. When presented with verbal stimuli, the Ranschburg effect is produced by a response suppression mechanism. The suppression mechanism within the short-term memory is based on the premise that items appearing early within a sequence have the highest activation levels when prompting recall. Items that possess high activation are the items are recalled first when recalling a sequence, which is also referred to as competitive queuing within the short-term memory. The suppression mechanism produces the recall of items with lower activation levels. The presence of a repetition tagging mechanism is also used when recalling repeated items within verbal stimuli. Response suppression rates are improved when the duration of the presentation of a sequence is longer. When an item is suppressed, the recall of its second occurrence is inhibited. This is due to the failure to tag the repeated item within the short-term memory as a repeated item, and therefore facilitates the Ranschburg effect. This suggests that the Ranschburg effect is produced within the retrieval stage of the items, not the encoding stage. = Short-term memory input and output = Repetition inhibition rests on the basic theory that repeated items within a sequence face a negative bias against repetition during recall. When subject resort to guessing strategies in an attempt to improve short-term recall, there is a negative implication for repeated items as there is a natural tendency or reluctance for people to repeat themselves. When a subject detects the event of a repetition but is unable to recall which item was repeated, they can resort to guessing. When a subject fails to accurately retrieve or guess the second occurrence of a repeated item, repetition inhibition occurs. Retrieval and guessing failures suggest the presence of a response suppression during the recall stage. Unless a subject is able to accurately detect, identify and remember the second occurrence of a repeated item, the Ranschburg effect is present. Input and output processes within the short-term memory can influence the production or presence of the Ranschburg effect. During the input process of information within the short-term memory, the encoding, attentional, and perceptual processes play an important role in the ability to accurately output and recall a sequence. Failure to appropriately encode or perceive a repeated item can produce the Ranschburg effect. Output processes within the short-term memory include memory and retrieval, and can also contribute substantially to the production of the Ranschburg effect. Due to the correlative relationship between output interference and the production of the Ranschburg effect, output interference is demonstrated to be a significant contributor to recall inhibition. This correlation suggests that any technique or strategy that reduces output interference should also reduce the likelihood of the Ranschburg effect occurring. This indicates that Ranschburg effect functions as a production of the retrieval procedure. The inhibitory effects of intraserial repetition, otherwise known as the Ranschburg effect, can therefore be reduced through minimising output interference.  Experimental conditions  In order to demonstrate the Ranschburg effect, a subject is briefly presented with a sequential list of stimuli containing a repeated item and instructed to recall them. When the subject is asked to reproduce the items in a serial order, poor recall indicates the Ranschburg effect. Sequences generally contain between six and ten stimuli items, where the inclusion of repeated items is correlative with prompting the Ranschburg effect. Stimuli items can include digits, letters and words, with digits being the original item used during the development of the Ranschburg effect theory. Subjects are tested individually, and are asked to complete several recall sequences. Repetition facilitation and repetition inhibition are robust, where the temporal conditions of sequence presentation impacts the probability and accuracy of detecting repeated items. This can be attributed to an automatic suppression of previously presented items, and a bias against guessing repeated items. A subject‚Äôs ability to detect a repeated item within a sequence is necessary for repetition facilitation, where the failure to detect a repeated item is a result of repetition inhibition. In order to overcome repetition inhibition, the detection of the repeated item must be consciously noticed during presentation, as well as remembering which specific item was repeated when recalling the sequence. Presentation rate refers to speed at which items within a sequence are presented. Presentation modality refers to the positioning of such items within a sequence, specifically items that are repeated.

It was built in 1846 and belongs to Rodionovo-Nesvetayskoe deanery of Shakhty and Millerovo Diocese.  History  The church in Agrafenovka village in the Don Host Oblastfounded on April 16, 1844. It was built of stone and had one single altar. The church was consecrated by Archbishop Ignatius of Voronezh and Zadonsk Diocese on November 3, 1846. In 1890, a parish school was organized there. During the Soviet era the church premises were used as a granary. The last abbot of the Odigitrievsky parish, priest Nikolai Nikolaevich Zykov, was convicted and shot by the Bolsheviks. He was rehabilitated posthumously at the grounds of lack of corpus delicti. Since 2012, the liturgies are being regularly held in the Church of the Virgin Hodegetria again. On March 29, 2012, Priest Anthony Gennadyevich Berezhnoy was appointed rector. Currently, the church is financed by the parishioners. Repair and restoration works are being carried out. In 2013, during earthworks, an old bell tongue was excavated. It is believed that it belonged to one of the bells of the pre-revolutionary church.

The film was one of the most popular pictures in the Soviet Union, it was seen by 30,12 million viewers. Plot The film takes place in the 1950s in a small working village, where the graduate of a pedagogical institute Tatiana Levchenko (Nina Ivanova) arrives. In the city department of education she receives a referral to an evening school. She is to teach the Russian language and literature at the school for the working youth. Nikolay Krushenkov (Gennadi Yukhtin), an old friend of Tatiana and an engineer of a metallurgical plant, helps Tanya rent a room and get acquainted with future students. At school Tatiana Sergeyevna becomes a form teacher of the eighth grade, in which Alexander Savchenko (Nikolai Rybnikov), a smelter, udarnik, joker and the favorite of factory girls is enrolled. Sasha immediately falls in love with the new teacher and in order to attract her attention he persists in talking and flirting with her even during the lessons. However, Tatiana ignores his signs of attention. Sasha, accustomed to easy victories, is surprised by the girl's behavior, and his interest soon turns into resentment. Feeling hurt, Savchenko decides that the educated and intelligent Tatiana is contemptuous of him, a simple boy, a worker-steelmaker who has only completed seven grades, and that she considers him unworthy of her attention. In addition, he mistakes Tetyana's friendship with Krushenkov for a romantic relationship. Resentful and jealous, Alexander drops out of school and tries to forget Tatiana, but soon realizes that he really loves her.

Working as an assistant director in various film groups, he wrote the script for his first feature film. The initial version of the script was not accepted for the production and Khutsiev had to finish it together with Mironer, co-author of his thesis film. In the post-war period, the Odessa Film Studio became the base where many people came to make films. Director of the studio Alexander Gorsky invited Marlen Khutsiev and Felix Mironer to the studio. One of Gorsky's conditions was that they work together. Filming began in 1953, and the premiere of the film took place on November 26, 1956. With the film \\"Spring on Zarechnaya Street\\" Khutsiev paved the way for a new generation of actors: it was the film debut of VGIK graduates Yuri Belov, Nikolai Rybnikov, Gennadi Yukhtin. The role of teacher Tatyana Sergeevna was played by non-professional actress Nina Ivanova. Most of the filming took place in Zaporozhye. Some scenes were shot in Odessa (for example, in the park \\"Victory\\"). In Zaporozhye, the filming was conducted at Zaporizhstal and Dneprospetsstal plants. In addition to the factory scenes, the film crew also worked in the 47th and 4th high schools of working youth in Pavlo-Kichkas, in the park \\"Dubovaya Roshcha\\", the district military enlistment office, the Palace of Culture of the aluminum plant (in the Soviet era - the Palace of Culture named after S.M. Kirov). Nikolai Rybnikov was helped to get into character by 23-year-old Grigory Pometun, who later became a well-deserved steel-maker of Ukraine. At the end of 1956 the film became a box-office leader and gathered more than 30 million viewers, losing out only to the Italian melodrama A Husband for Anna by Giuseppe De Santis. The film was awarded a bronze medal at the VI Festival of Youth and Students in 1957 in Moscow.

The film is about a Parsi boy from Bombay (now Mumbai). The film was well received and won the 1989 Best Gujarati Film Award at the National Film Awards. Plot The somewhat awkward bachelor Percy Bhathena is 27 years old and lives together with his mother in a residential area of the Parsi middle class. He works in a small Unani drugstore, where he is harassed by a Marathi colleague. His mother goes from house to house and sells homemade sweets and pickles. Percy learns of her youth love Vera, that she is going to get married. From that moment on, his thoughts drifts into the past, into his childhood. He reflects on his childhood with his religious mother's quarrels, the reluctant and devastated father, his drowned friend Dara and playing with his childhood friend Vera. Percy proved the misappropriation of funds by colleague and the colleague was dismissed. Percy finds out an old gramophone of his father which has the music of Swan Lake and he recalls the incident of sudden death of the father. With the music he imagines to dance with the adult Vera, he even buys a dance councilor for his imaginary dance exercises. The visit of Vera's wedding party with his mother leaves Percy unhappy despite the good food. Percy's solitude finds a comfort in a music society of his Parsi community, which regularly meets with the common listening of records with Western classical music. Percy is studying Edvard Grieg's piano concerto. On his way home to one of the musical adventures, Percy is hit on the street by the former ex-colleague and his friends. The next day, he has to conclude that the drug trade has been subjected to a fire and that he suddenly has no work and no income. He takes his mother's sales trip, but he does not get rid of anything. Without a goal or as an anesthetic, he strays his time in the streets of Bombay and finally lands in the Music Society. There, in a vision, he experiences his childhood friend Dara as an adult man, who urges him not to waste his lifetime and grab the opportunities at the top. The next day, Percy is unsuccessful in search for jobs, and his mother breaks up on her sales trip. With the death of his mother, desperate Percy stands alone.

It is the home ground of Warrenpoint Town of the NIFL Premiership. The stadium sits in the larger Milltown Sports Complex, in the area of Warrenpoint of the same name. The ground was upgraded in 2013 after Warrenpoint were promoted to the Premiership, to satisfy the rules of that league.  History  In 2008, Warrenpoint Town applied to turn the pitch from natural grass into a 3G pitch, which was granted by the Newry and Mourne District Council. In 2013, Warrenpoint Town were promoted to the NIFL Premiership. Owing to previous consecutive promotions, Milltown did not meet the Irish Football Association's criteria for use in the Premiership. As a result, the ground required renovation. Warrenpoint Town originally applied to play their home games at The Showgrounds, Newry. However the stadium owners at Newry refused them permission. Instead they were obliged to groundshare with Dungannon Swifts at Stangmore Park, Dungannon away whilst Milltown was redeveloped. Newry and Mourne Council granted Milltown ¬£225,500 to assist with the redevelopment. On 21 December 2013, Milltown was opened for its first NIFL Premiership match between Warrenpoint Town and Glenavon. However the match was forced to be abandoned after one of the floodlights failed. Despite the renovations, aimed to assist the ground to meet UEFA standards, observers note that the facilities are still limited at Milltown. It was used as justification for applying for a UEFA licence. Their 2019 application was refused however. In 2018, it was announced that Newry, Mourne and Down District Council planned to redevelop Milltown as the location for a new community hub due to plans to purchase a surplus Police Service of Northern Ireland station falling through. However, this proposal was not recommended to the council's committee. This was due to accessibility and location issues, which led to the council preferring to build the hub at Clonallon Park instead.  Usage  While Milltown is predominantly used by Warrenpoint Town for association football, it has also been used for Gaelic football by Warrenpoint GAA. Milltown is considered by some opposing football managers as being a hard place to play at.

He has represented the Philippines in boxing internationally. Boxing career =Early career= In 2010, Marvin used to fight with others after school for fun but the police had to intervene in one fight and Marvin was told to take up his fight to a boxing gym. He joined the Ventnor Club and trained under coach Darren Green. He later joined the military where he further pursued boxing. After winning the Army Individuals Championship where he knocked out his semifinals and finals opponents in the second round, he was invited to the boxing team of the British Army in 2014. By August 2017, he is a two-time Combined Services Senior Boxing champion and had an amateur record of 23 wins, 11 of which are by knockouts, and 11 losses. =International career= He met up with members of the Philippine boxing team in 2016 in a boxing show in Sweden or Finland. Upon mentioning his Filipino heritage, Marvin was told he could represent the country if he holds dual citizenship. He acquired Filipino citizenship and became eligible to box for the country. There is a lack of national boxers fighting in the welterweight to light heavyweight division in the Philippines and it helped that Marvin fights in the light heavyweight division. Marvin is the first Filipino with foreign heritage absorbed to the Philippine national team since Christopher Camat, who competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics. He went to Guangzhou in July 2017 to train with his countrymen along with Chinese, Kazakh, and South Korean boxers before competing at the 2017 Southeast Asian Games. He won a gold medal at the Games by winning over Adli Hafidz Mohamad Pauzi of Malaysia 21 seconds into the gold medal match. Military career As of 2017, he holds the rank, Lance Corporal in the British Army and is assigned to the Royal Regiment of Wales. Personal life Marvin was born to John Sr., a British retired professional singer, former cruise director and a yacht master, and Teresita Tupas, a Filipina who is native to Pampanga. He has a younger brother who is with the merchant navy. During his childhood, he made frequent visits to his mother's homeland with his family until around 2006.

Functionally, in mature organisms, activation of these receptors typically results in neural inhibition, primarily via the influx of chloride ions, although exceptions to this general principle exist, such as during early development. Structurally, iGABARs are pentameric transmembrane ion channels, meaning they are made up of five subunits. Since there are several classes of subunits and a variety of genes encoding many members of these classes, a wide variety of structurally, and therefore functionally, distinct channels of iGABARs is observed.  Introduction  This is a neuromuscular junction. There is a presynaptic unit (axon), a synapse and a postsynaptic unit (dendrite). Neurotransmitters are released into the synapse. The neuromuscular junction in the CNS can be composed of a presynaptic unit located at an axon terminal with synaptic vesicles and a postsynaptic unit located at a dendrite. Neurotransmitters are chemical molecules that are released from a presynaptic unit into the synapse and received by the postsynaptic unit, resulting in a biological and electrophysiological effect. The two main types of neurotransmitters are amino acid transmitters and GABA transmitters. The release of and binding of glutamate, an amino acid transmitter, to its respective receptor manifests in an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP). On the other hand, the release and binding of gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) to the GABA receptor results in an inhibitory postynaptic potential (IPSP). The ability of the GABA receptor function rests on its molecular structure of multiple binding sites and conductance levels. These receptors are prevalent in interneurons relaying messages among various regions of the brain.  The difference between ionotropic and metabotropic GABA receptors  Cys-Loop receptors. The two types of GABA receptors are the GABAA and GABAB receptors. The pentameric GABAA receptors are ionotropic, meaning that upon binding with the ligand their biological and electrophysiological effect is carried out through the conductance of ions. This is why the physiological makeup for GABAA receptors differs from GABAB in that they are ligand-gated ion channels. The chloride-ion gated channels facilitate the inhibitory effect through the influx of chloride ions. However, GABAB receptors are metabotropic meaning they utilize a G-protein coupled mechanism. Since the G-protein is a heterodimeric molecule, the separation and phosphorylation of its parts result in a signal cascade, resulting in a more steady but amplified response.  Pharmacological implications  Earlier a third type of GABA receptor was discovered and named GABAC, but recently it has been categorized as a sub-type of the GABAA receptor. Thus, the iontropic GABA receptors consist of the GABAA receptor and the GABAA-œÅ receptor.There are pharmacological implications in understanding the molecular structure and function of these ionotropic receptors. Since they are targeted by neuroactive drugs, this characteristic is exploited in order to deduce their molecular structure and function in the CNS. For example, GABAA receptors respond to neuroactive drugs like benzodiazepines. Normally increasing a neuron's permeability to chloride ions results in inhibition; bensodiazepines further propagate this event ensuring inhibition, serving as an indirect factor. Armed with the knowledge of chloride ion permeability leading to inhibition, it is important to note that ethanol and barbiturates can directly increase the influx of chloride ions resulting in inhibition. Further characterization of the allosteric modulations of the active sites in the ionotropic gives insight on new treatments and nervous system disorders, such as panic disorder.

It is a Grade II* listed building. The house has been owned by a succession of families of local gentry and is now used as a wedding venue and for corporate events. The main two-storey chert stone building is accompanied by various outbuildings including barns and a mill. History The Gerbestone estate was created around 1235, when a local knight \\"Gerebert\\" was granted an exemption from paying taxes by Bishop Jocelin of Wells. In 1333 Bishop Ralph of Shrewsbury granted a licence for the addition of an oratory. It then passed through a succession of owners and leaseholders until the 1580s. The current building was largely constructed in the late 16th century including the use of chimneys for the first time. It was further enlarged, with the addition of wings to the house and additional staircases, in the 17th century when owned by the Wyndham family of Orchard Wyndham. In 1612 the owner was Thomas Frances, who married Suzanna, daughter of George Luttrell of Dunster Castle and later it was owned by John Ewell. Suzanna Francis's children married into the families of other local landowners including that of Francis Popham and supported both sides during the English Civil War. In 1693 the house was mortgaged by Nicholas Frauncies and then sold to Sir John Elwell whose descendants lived there until 1894 when it was bought by William Temlett Marke. Further restoration was undertaken in the 1920s and 1930s by Hubert Lidbetter, for the Lloyd-Fox family who were the owners at the time, which included a new staircase and windows and the removal of all the plaster on walls and ceilings. During World War II the house was used to accommodate 30 evacuees. In 2007 the house was bought by the investment banker, Spencer Weir, for ¬£2,5 million. The long barn was converted, with attached watermill, in 2014 and is now used as a wedding and events venue. The main house can sleep 24 guests. The historical records from the manor are held by the South West Heritage Trust. Architecture The two-storey house is built of chert stone with Hamstone dressings and slate roofs. The long barn was built in the 16th or 17th century and has a cruck roof with a bell-cote at its apex. Another 18th-century barn. which had been a pigeon loft, has been converted into a squash court. The estate also had an overshot watermill.

Biography Born on 24 February 1922, Macdonald was from Invercargill. She came to national attention as a 15-year- old in 1937 when she broke her own national intermediate girls' record for the 100 yards backstroke with a time of 1:17.8, which was only 1.4 seconds slower than the senior record for the event, held by Ena Stockley. She was selected to swim for New Zealand in the 110 yards backstroke at the 1938 British Empire Games in Sydney, becoming the first Empire Games representative from Southland. She began well in her heat, being in second place at the turn, but faded in the second half of the race to finish in a time of 1:28.6 and did not qualify for the final. Macdonald also competed in the 3 x 110 yards medley relay at the Sydney games, alongside Winnie Dunn and Mona Leydon, with the trio recording 4:22.3 in finishing fifth. In March 1938, Macdonald broke Ena Stockley's national 100 yards backstroke record at Gisborne, recording 1:16.2. Later that year, in November, she broke the New Zealand 200 m backstroke record, previously held by Marie Farquhar of Auckland, with a time of 3:10.0. In January 1939, she swam the 100 metres backstroke in 1:22.0, breaking the previous record held by Ena Stockley by 2.4 seconds. In February 1940, Macdonald became the first New Zealand woman to swim 200 metres backstroke in under three minutes, with a time of 2:56.8.

Adolescent, he was a boarder at the Fontgombault Abbey (Indre) where he learned to play the organ and learned about choir directing. At the age of 14, he composed a four-voice Domine non sum dignus. He received a classical and musical teaching of high quality, studying harmony with Nadia Boulanger, counterpoint and fugue with Claude Delvincourt, musicology with Yvonne Rokseth who gave him insight into medieval music. At the Conservatoire de Paris, he followed Maurice Emmanuel's class of music history and studied music composition with Henri B√ºsser (himself a disciple of Charles Gounod). At the Sorbonne, he studied music history with Andr√© Pirro, with whom he presented his first musicological work in 1935 (DES, \\"Dipl√¥me d'√âtudes Sup√©rieures\\"). He also took classes of conducting with Pierre Monteux, Willem Mengelberg and Bruno Walter in Amsterdam, while resident in the Descartes House (1935-1936). There, he also studied musicology with Albert Smijers. Passionate about Medieval music for which he devoted much of his musicological activity, he founded in 1934 the choir Psalette Notre-Dame in order to revive it. In the same way, he founded at the Sorbonne under the direction of Gustave Cohen, the theater group the Th√©ophiliens. Finally, he was actively involved in the founding of the Groupe de Th√©√¢tre antique de la Sorbonne (In particular with Jacques Veil and Roland Barthes). In this university, he completed his two theses on music, within the framework of the curriculum of Medieval French literature: L'√âcole musicale de Saint-Martial de Limoges jusqu'√† la fin du XIe as well as Chansons de Gautier du Coinci. It was from this period that his intense musicological production began with works devoted to Medieval music and musical theory and to the evolution of musical languages, to musical notation, as well as to several composers, including Johann Sebastian Bach, Mozart, Schubert, Berlioz, Schumann, Wagner. At the same time, he did not neglect the teaching and popularization works (music history, method of piano reading, guide for young pianists, etc.). Jacques Chailley was a member of a resistance movement gathered around the French Communist Party: the Front National des Musiciens, created in May 1941, during the Second World War, after the invasion of the USSR by the German armies. It was a specific resistance organization for music professionals, created by Elsa Barraine, Roger D√©sormi√®re, Louis Durey (all three close to the French Communist Party), Roland-Manuel (himself a Jew, former student of Vincent d'Indy at the Schola Cantorum), and Claude Delvincourt.Henry Barraud, Un compositeur aux commandes de la Radio : Essai autobiographique, √©dit√© sous la direction de Myriam Chim√®nes et Karine Le Bail, Paris: Fayard / Biblioth√®que nationale de France, 2010, , note 1. From 1946 to 1961, he directed the choir \\"L'Alauda\\". In 1969, he was also appointed the second president of the Consociatio internationalis music√¶ sacr√¶, created in 1963 by Pope Paul VI. Jacques Chailley remained in this position until 1974.Consociatio internationalis music√¶ sacr√¶, Music√¶ sacr√¶ ministerium, Anno XXXIV - XXXVI (1997 - 1999), Rome 1999, p. 31. In 1952, following the defense of his PhD on L‚Äô√©cole musicale de Saint Martial de Limoges and his election as professor at the Sorbonne in the chair of History of music left vacant by Paul-Marie Masson, Jacques Chailley took over the Institute of Musicology of the University of Paris, which he transformed in 1969-1970 in the UER (Unit√© d'enseignement et de recherche, later UFR, Unit√© de formation et de recherche) of music and musicology of the new Paris- Sorbonne University>. He directed this UER until 1973. He directed the doctoral theses of many recognized musicologists (including Barry S. Brook, Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn Kh√™, Simha Arom, Amnon Shiloah, Mireille Helffer, Jacques Viret, Michel Hugo, Jean-R√©my Julien, Annie Labussi√®re, Dani√®le Pistone...). Between 1973 and 1975, he obtained the creation of the CAPES and the Agr√©gation in musical education and choral singing. He thus facilitated the recognition of musicology at the university as an autonomous discipline and enabled many musicians to find a more stable professional situation. He was also Inspector General of Music at the Ministry of National Education and director of the Schola Cantorum in Paris from 1962 until c. 1982. His erudition and eclecticism, but also his distinct character and marked opinions, made him one of the principal figures in the post-war French musical life. Always remained in the post-Debussy French tradition with a modal language close to Ravel, Roussel and Honegger and firmly opposed the atonality and serialism \\"avant- gardes\\" (very much in vogue in the post-war years). He leaves a work of 129 opus numbers.  Controversy  Jacques Chailley was Secretary-General (1937), then Assistant Director (1941) of the Conservatoire de Paris. His role during the war has been subject of controverse. Jean Gribenski,Jean Gribenski on Sym√©trie who taught at the Sorbonne under the orders of Jacques Chailley, mentions in a chapter of the collective book La vie musicale sous Vichy,La vie musicale sous Vichy that in collaboration with Henri Rabaud in 1940, he drew up a list of the Jewish students of the Conservatory of Paris: Jean Gribenski further specifies that the list drawn up by Rabaud and Chailley was not communicated to the Germans, and that the exclusion of Jewish students took place only two years later, under duress, while the Conservatoire was led by Claude Delvincourt.. That a list was used for the exclusion of Jewish students from the Conservatory was challenged by contemporary Jewish witnesses during the symposium where Gribenski first presented the results of his research in 1999.Cahiers Bo√´llmann-Gigout, , dated 1997-1998, but published in 1999. These refutations were published before the article by Jean Gribenski, who does not however mention them in his book of 2001. The controversy reappeared in 2011, after the Sorbonne decided to give Chailley's name to an amphitheater (polemic triggered by an article in the weekly Le Canard encha√Æn√© and furthered in a note in Le Nouvel Observateur.Bibliobs 4 April 2011 ¬´ Sorbonne 1940-1944 ¬ª) Mich√®le AltenMichelle Alten on L'Harmattan has since published an article based on an in-depth study of the archives,Mich√®le Alten, ¬´ Le Conservatoire de musique et d'art dramatique une institution culturelle publique dans la guerre (1940-1942) ¬ª, L'√âducation musicale which sheds light on the events of 1940. She writes: It is to this inquiry that Jean Gribenski's article seems to refer. Alten further writes that Jewish students of the Conservatoire were excluded from participating in the final examinations in 1942, under pressure from the Vichy Government.  Publications  Jacques Chailley has published many outstanding works, both on Greek and medieval music, on the Passions, the chorales for organ and The Art of Fugue by J. S. Bach, the Carnaval by Schumann, Tristan by Wagner. Worth noting is his interest in the exegesis of the Masonic aspects of The Magic Flute by Mozart, the Winterreise by Schubert and Parsifal by Wagner.

This storm followed Typhoon Hato which affected the area a few days prior. Pakhar was the fourteenth named storm of the Pacific typhoon season. Pakhar developed from a tropical depression to the east of Luzon during August 24, and intensified into a tropical storm later that day. Pakhar made landfall over in Aurora on August 25. Pakhar gradually intensified and peaked as a severe tropical storm by August 27, making landfall over Taishan, Jiangmen in Southern China. Meteorological history On August 23, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started to monitor a tropical disturbance that had developed about 895 km (556 mi) to the north of the island of Palau. The next day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a weak tropical depression, while the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA). Six hours after the TCFA, the JMA began issuing advisories on the depression after they have determined that the system contained winds of 55 km/h (35 mph). By 15:00 UTC of the same day, the JTWC had upgraded the system to a tropical depression, assigning the numerical designation 16W. Three hours later, the JMA tracked that 16W had already strengthened into a tropical storm, giving 16W the name Pakhar. Around the same time, the PAGASA began issuing advisories under the local name Jolina. After it was depicted by satellite imagery that there were deep convection obscuring its low-level circulation center (LLCC), the JTWC had upgraded the system to a tropical storm. By August 25, Pakhar slightly intensified after convective banding wrapping to its LLCC was depicted by imagery. Pakhar was also located in a very favorable environment such as low wind shear along with warm sea-surface temperatures of 31 ¬∞C (87.8 ¬∞F). Pakhar slightly intensified after a burst of deep convection developed just prior of making landfall over in Luzon in the province of Aurora. However, due to land reaction from the archipelago and the inclusion of a weakened convective structure, Pakhar weakened to minimal tropical storm intensity. After emerging to the South China Sea on August 26, Pakhar began to re-intensify as the storm entered in an area of a much lower amount of wind shear. However six hours later, Pakhar maintained its intensity after its LLCC became exposed and its deep convective banding became fragmented. By 18:00 UTC of the same day, the JMA upgraded Pakhar's intensity as a severe tropical storm, despite its central convection remaining disorganized. The PAGASA also stated that the storm had already exited their area of responsibility, issuing its final bulletin on Pakhar. By 00:00 UTC of August 27, Pakhar reached its maximum intensity of 100 km/h (65 mph) with a minimum barometric pressure of 985 hPa while making landfall over in South China in the city of Taishan. The JTWC assessed Pakhar's maximum intensity slightly higher with winds of 110 km/h (70 mph), however. Three hours later, the JTWC issued their final advisory. By 06:00 UTC, Pakhar began to rapidly weaken as the JMA downgraded Pakhar to a tropical storm. The JMA tracked the system until 18:00 UTC of the same day when it fully dissipated.  Preparations and Impact  =Philippines= A satellite animation of Tropical Storm Pakhar making landfall on August 25 Tropical Storm Pakhar was locally named as Jolina within the country by PAGASA. As soon as the PAGASA began issuing advisories on the storm, Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal#1 was raised over most of Cagayan Valley and northern Aurora during August 24. Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal #2 was also raised in the same areas with the inclusion of the Cordillera Administrative Region while Signal #1 was extended to the Ilocos Region and Bicol Region. By August 25, a total of 16 provinces were placed in a warning as they were located within a radius of the storm. Classes were suspended for all levels over in Albay, Bicol due to possible threats of flooding and landslides on August 25. The government also announced the suspension of classes for August 26 over in Metro Manila and some parts of Central Luzon and Calabarzon. The province of Ilocos Sur declared the suspension of work in all public and private services that same day. The Office of the Civil Defense warned Cagayan Valley residents of severe flooding in the low-lying areas in Isabela and Cagayan provinces. Kennon Road in Benguet were closed due to the threat of landslides. Hiking, trekking, and caving were suspended over in mountainous areas in the Mountain Province. Heavy rainfall from Pakhar caused the Magat Dam to overflow, which also submerged several bridges over in Isabela. A total of 11 flights to Hong Kong and South China from Ninoy Aquino International Airport were canceled due to the storm. Eight domestic flights were canceled throughout August 25. According to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council, 3,397 people were affected by the storm with 17 reports of flooding.

The Home Affairs Department of Hong Kong opened 27 temporary shelters while the China Ferry Terminal in Tsim Sha Tsui was closed temporarily. Ferry services across the Pearl River Delta were also suspended. Part of the Stonecutters Bridge was closed due to strong winds which made vehicles taller than 1.5 metres and motorcycles barred from using the bridge. Moreover, 51 people sought medical treatment in public hospitals and 231 people have sought refuge in shelters.

When he was 22, he was forced by the advancing Soviets to leave his seminary studies and return to Budapest. He talked his way into the residence of Papal Nuncio Monsignor Angelo Rotta, the Vatican's representative in Budapest. He persuaded Rotta to give him papersMandate paper of Bar√°nszky issued by Papal Nuncio (November 20, 1944) In: that would allow a Jewish family, friends of his aunt, to escape Hungary. Rotta was so impressed by his boldness, he recruited Bar√°nszki to help save other Jews. Over nine weeks, before the Soviets surrounded Budapest, Bar√°nszki orchestrated the rescue of over 3,000 Jews. Baranski was arrested by the Soviets on December 30, 1944 and sent on a 16-day, forced march towards a Soviet prison, during which he ate only four times. He was saved by a sympathetic guard and made his way back to Budapest. After he was hospitalized and released, he was arrested again in 1948 for \\"clerical reaction\\" and in a show trial was sentenced to nine years in prison. He was released after Stalin's death in 1953. He left Hungary during the 1956 revolution and settled with his wife in New York, where both became U.S. citizens and educators and raised a family. On January 11, 1979, Bar√°nszki was recognized as one of the Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem. He was a member of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council.  Early life  Bar√°nszki was the son of Reszl Bar√°nszki and Maria Schelnader. His grandfather was born in Poland and after serving in the Polish army in Budapest, decided to stay. His father married Maria Schelnader and Tibor was raised in Budapest. His father's family had roots in Hungary dating back 700 years. He was educated in Hungarian Gymnasia and became aware of rising antisemitism by 1938. He studied for the priesthood in Vesprem in 1940 and in Kassa (Ko≈°ice) in 1943. He learned of the Nazi government's extermination camps through church channels. As the Soviet army drew near Ko≈°ice, Bar√°nszki was forced to leave for Budapest, sometimes only a few miles from the front lines, and arrived there on October 20, 1944.  World War II  Bar√°nszki's aunt Margit Sterneder had become very close friends over several years with the Jewish family of Dr. Hedvig Szekeres through her work at the Chinoin pharmaceutical factory, in √öjpest, a Budapest suburb. = Background = Starting in 1938, Regent Mikl√≥s Horthy led the government to pass a series of anti-Jewish measures, emulating Germany's Nuremberg Laws. The First Jewish Law passed on May 29, 1938 defined as Jewish anyone who had converted or were born to Jewish parents after 1919. It restricted the number of Jews in many professions to twenty percent. About 5,000 Jews converted to Christianity after the passing of the First Jewish Law. The second anti-Jewish law passed a year later on May 5, 1939 defined Jews for the first time by their race and not their faith. Individuals with two, three or four Jewish-born grandparents were declared Jewish. Jews were forbidden to work in government, as editors for newspapers, and the number of Jews among theater and movie actors, physicians, lawyers and engineers was capped at six percent. All private companies were forbidden to employ more than 12% Jews. Cumulatively, 250,000 Hungarian Jews were put out of work. Virtually all Jews lost their right to vote. At the next elections held in June, only 38 Jews could vote. As a result of the laws and cultural oppression, the Sterneder and Szekeres families became even closer. The Third Jewish Law passed in 1941 prohibited sexual relationships between Jews and non-Jews and classified another 58,320 people as Jewish who did not profess Judaism. The census question about Jewish grandparents was added late in 1941 after some census forms had already been printed, contributing to an inaccurate count. In addition, many Christians of Jewish ancestry did not answer the question truthfully. So while about 62,000 Christians admitted some Jewish ancestry (including 38,000 in Budapest), the actual number of Christians of Jewish origin by mid-1941 may have exceeded 85,000 and up to 100,000.Statisztikai szemle 1944 4-5, p. 96 A census beginning on January 31, 1941 counted a Hungarian population of 13,643,621. Based on the second anti- Jewish law, 6.2% (846,000) were considered Jewish. In April 1941, Hungary annexed the B√°cska, Murak√∂z, and Muravid√©k regions from occupied Yugoslavia. The total population of its annexed territories in 1941 was 1,025,508, including 15,000 Jews. As of May 1941, 5.87% (861,000) of the entire Hungarian population of 14,669,129 were under Hungarian law considered Jewish. According to Jewish religious law, 4.94% (725,000) were Jewish.Volume 3, p. 979, Akad√©miai Kiad√≥, Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Budapest, 1982 = Germans occupy Hungary = Jewish people stand in line to receive protective passports in front of the Swedish legation. In early 1944, Hungarian prime minister Mikl√≥s K√°llay was secretly attempting to negotiate a separate peace with the Allies. To prevent Hungary from leaving the Axis, on March 19, 1944 launched Operation Margarethe, ordering German troops into the country.

Led by Ferenc Sz√°lasi, they formed the Government of National Unity. = Jews sent to death camps = Auschwitz in Birkenau, Poland on 27 May 1944. Mass deportations of Jews to German death camps in occupied Poland began. SS- Obersturmbannf√ºhrer Adolf Eichmann went to Hungary to oversee the large-scale deportations. Between 15 May and 9 July, Hungarian authorities deported 437,402 Jews. All but 15,000 of these Jews were sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau, and 90% of those were immediately killed. One in three of all Jews killed at Auschwitz were Hungarian citizens.Holocaust in Hungary Holocaust Memorial Centre By June the Germans had organized a program to force Hungarian Jews into mini-ghettos. On June 15, 1944, they were ordered to move into Yellow Star Houses, approximately 2,000 single-building mini-ghettos identified by a yellow Star of David over the entrance. Sterneder became active in an underground movement that helped Jews find hiding places and obtain false emigration documents. The Szekeres family fled into hiding, leaving their sick infant son Gabor Szekeres with the Sterneder family. = Moderates regain power = In early July 1944, Regent Mikl√≥s Horthy replaced D√∂me Szt√≥jay, an avid supporter of the National Socialists, with the anti-Fascist General G√©za Lakatos. Under the Lakatos regime, acting Interior Minister B√©la Horv√°th ordered Hungarian gendarmes to prevent any Hungarian citizens from being deported. As the summer progressed, and the Allied and Soviet armies closed in on central Europe, the ability of the Nazis to devote themselves to Hungary's \\"Jewish Solution\\" waned. The Germans backed off from pressing Horthy's regime to continue further, large-scale deportations. Horthy's actions bought the Jews of Budapest a few months of time. = Fascists take over = In October 1944, Horthy attempted to secretly negotiate a cease-fire with the Soviets and ordered Hungarian troops to lay down their arms. In response, Nazi Germany launched Operation Panzerfaust. Troops led by Otto Skorzeny kidnapped Horthy's son and sent him to the Mauthausen concentration camp. The Germans forced Horthy to abdicate in favour of Sz√°lasi, after which Horthy was taken into \\"protective custody\\" in Germany. Sz√°lasi, leader of the Arrow Cross Party, was declared \\"Leader of the Nation\\" and prime minister of a \\"Government of National Unity\\". Sz√°lasi organised the International Ghetto and over the next few months Arrow Cross members conducted frequent raids during which groups of Jews were taken to the banks of the Danube and executed. = Bar√°nszki leaves seminary= In 1944, Bar√°nszki was studying at a Catholic seminary near Ko≈°ice (present-day Slovakia) to become a priest. He learned of Nazi extermination plans through church channels. He was forced to return to Budapest at age 22 on October 20, 1944 as the Russian army drew near. By then the city was under tight control of German forces. Bar√°nszki lived with his aunt, who requested his help contacting Catholic church officials to ask them to intervene on behalf of the Szekeres family. = Gains Catholic church support = Bar√°nszki found a long line of people waiting for passes at Papal Nuncio Monsignor Angelo Rotta's embassy residence, the Vatican's representative in Budapest. It was one of five neutral country's embassies issuing \\"letters of protection\\", and the Swiss, Swedish, Spanish, Portuguese and Vatican embassies were swamped by long lines of people requesting help. Dressed in his priest's cassock, he later said, \\"I was not discouraged. Nonchalantly I pushed my way through the line and said that I was on official business.\\" Germans and Hungarians believed that a \\"family could not be divided. So, if there was one Catholic spouse, for example, only one baptismal certificate was necessary. However, to cover the entire family, individual protection passes were needed, stipulating that the family was under papal protection.\\" Bar√°nszki wandered through the embassy until he found Rotta's office. No one questioned him wearing a priest's cassock. He persuaded Rotta to give him nine letters of protection, one for each member of the Szekeres family. Encouraged by his success, Bar√°nszki returned to Rotta a few days later to ask for another set of letters, this time for another Jewish family. Rotta was impressed that Bar√°nszki spoke excellent German and had bluffed his way to the front of the line and into his presence. He recruited Bar√°nszki to help protect Jews at risk of being sent to the death camps. Rotta provided Bar√°nszki with letters of protection, baptismal, and immigration certificates, and over the next 70 days Bar√°nszki used them to save thousands of Jews in imminent danger of being sent to their death. Two weeks later, Rotta appointed Bar√°nszki as the executive secretary of the Vatican's Jewish Protection Movement in Hungary, serving as a direct emissary of the Papal Nuncio. As head of the Jewish Protection Movement, he soon met other neutral legations at Gresham Palace near the Chain Bridge. The group included Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat later credited with saving tens of thousands of Hungarian Jews from Nazi death camps. Bar√°nszki collaborated with Wallenberg and arranged private, unofficial meetings between the Swedish diplomat and Papal Nuncio Angelo Rotta. Bar√°nszki often led secretive meetings with diplomats including Wallenberg, Swiss Consul Carl Lutz, Spanish Consul √Ångel Sanz Briz and Italian cattle trader Giorgio Perlasca to save Jewish lives in Budapest. During his work with the Papal Nuncio, he saw two handwritten letters from Pope Pius XII encouraging the work to save the Jews. Bar√°nszki personally escorted individuals and families to hiding places, sometimes in secret rooms hidden within factories, and in the homes of other Catholics. Bar√°nszki described Wallenberg's motivation as \\"divinely human love.\\" \\"We knew in a second we shared the same opinion ‚Ä¶ the same recklessness, the same determination, all through,\\" said Bar√°nszki. = Bluffs guards = Rotta asked Bar√°nszki to go the next day to a factory where nearly 50 Jews who had been baptized as Catholic were being held captive before deportation to Germany and almost certain death. Rotta offered to loan Bar√°nszki a small Opel. Bar√°nszki said he didn't want to go the next day, he wanted to go immediately. And he brazenly insisted on borrowing Rotta's diplomatic automobile, a Rolls-Royce limousine flying the Vatican flag. \\"I told his excellency, 'The Nazis are primitive people. A little shoehorn car would not show any representation of power. The Nazis would be impressed by a Rolls Royce.'\\" Bar√°nszki persuaded another young man to act as his driver and brought along a few others. He used the car to impress the Germans. Disguised as a priest, the 22 year old adopted a haughty, authoritarian demeanor. At the factory, the Nazis refused to open the gates, and Bar√°nszki threatened to crash the car through it. They finally opened the gate and offered to show him where to go, but he rudely dismissed them, saying he knew where the Jews were being held. He discovered 2,000 Jews were being held captive inside, and called out the names of the baptized individuals he had been given. Then, while he distracted the guards, his assistants gave the remaining Jews information on how to contact the underground. He boldly intercepted groups of Jews who were being deported to the death camps and using fake Vatican letters of protection, persuaded their guards to allow him to bring some prisoners back to Budapest. In October and November, Eichmann accelerated the program to annihilate the remaining Jews of Hungary before the Soviet Army captured Budapest. About 50,000 Jews were forced to march from Budapest to Hegyeshalom on the Austrian-Hungarian border in November 1944, where they would be transferred to German custody. From 6,000 to 10,000 Jews died of hunger, cold and disease en route. Rotta sent Bar√°nszki to Hegyeshalom with blank letters of protection. He freed hundreds of Jews, bringing them back to Budapest on a train. Acting as the Vatican representative, Bar√°nszki paid for the upkeep of thousands of Jews living in the Vatican's protected houses. With the help of his aunt, who worked for a pharmaceutical company, he distributed medicine, extra food, and supplies to the hidden Jews. \\"I worked night and day and got very little sleep. Some days I didn‚Äôt have a second to eat,\\" he recalled. \\"Besides the grace of God ‚Ä¶ I had some courage and some organizational abilities.\\" If his deception was discovered, Bar√°nszki would have been killed. He credited his deep Catholic faith for the strength to ignore demands by Nazi officers that he stop working on behalf of Jews. When challenged with a gun to his head by a German officer about why he helped the Jews, he replied, \\"You are either silly or an idiot. It is because I am a Christian that I help the Jews.\\" He received a call from Adolf Eichmann, who told him that only 3,000 of the 12,000 protection letters previously authorized by the Nazis would be honored. Not knowing who he was talking to, he told Eichmann, \\"I thought I was talking to a German officer, not a German scoundrel.\\" Baranski helped those whose protection letters were no longer valid to hide in old houses and caves used as wine cellars. Using these methods, he said, \\"We were able to protect between 8,000 and 12,000 Jews,\\" he said. He successfully won the release of dozens and hundreds of captive Jews again and again. He gave the Nazis and Arrow Cross officials meaningless but-official-looking and lifesaving documents and used every other ploy he could imagine. He harbored about 3,000 Jews in the Vatican's protected sector of apartment complexes. Varying sources state he saved up from 7,000 to as many as 12,000 Jews. Bar√°nszki was arrested by the Soviets on December 30. = Arrest and imprisonment = The Soviets began the Siege of Budapest during the last week of December. They arrested Bar√°nszki on 30 December 1944 as they believed he supported the Nazis. He was sent on a forced march to a prison in Russia. He ate only four times in 16 days during the march. He believed he would have died if a religious Soviet guard had not taken mercy on him, preventing another guard from shooting him, and then moving him to a line of prisoners who received medical help. Bar√°nszki was hospitalized and after the war ended, eventually made his way back to Budapest. He finished his studies and became a vicar in Dr√©gelypal√°nk in Northern Hungary. When the Soviets took control of the government, Bar√°nszki liked them no more than the Nazis. He was arrested in 1948 for anti- Communist \\"clerical reaction,\\" and in a show trial, was sentenced to nine years in prison. After Joseph Stalin died and Imre Nagy became Chairman on 4 July 1953, Bar√°nszki was granted amnesty, after 57 months in prison. His only reward for the risks he took, he said, would come from God ‚Äúif‚Äù he was deserving. ‚ÄúI only did what God demanded of me. I‚Äôm only a useless servant.‚Äù  Later life  Freed from prison in 1953 after five years, Bar√°nszki became a freedom fighter during the Hungarian revolution, helping to organize assistance. He went to Rome in 1956 to seek Western support for the revolution. When the rebellion was crushed by the Soviets, Bar√°nszki did not want to return home. He liked Communists as much as he liked Nazis. \\"If you want to think like a cartoonist, Hitler and Stalin would be two cherries on the same tree,\\" Bar√°nszki said. \\"There was no difference.\\" He was sent back to Hungary, but he was able to slip out again among many other refugees. He remained in Italy where he married Katalin K≈ër√∂sy on 8 July 1957. They started a school and camp for refugees,By The Way The Frederick Post Fredericksburg, MD August 29, 1989 page A-4 living in a refugee camp near Rome, Italy, for close to a year. In 1958 they obtained visas to Canada. They lived in Toronto before moving in 1961 to Buffalo, New York, where they raised their family. Katalin had been attending school to become a medical doctor in Hungary, but was kicked out of the university during the Communist-Stalinist period. Based on her education in biochemical pharmacology and biochemistry, she was given a United States visa that stated, ‚ÄúVery important person. Urgently needed by the United States government to do research in biochemical pharmacology, i.e. biochemistry.‚Äù After arriving in Buffalo, she became a professor of biochemistry and cancer researcher at the University of Buffalo. She died in 2011. Bar√°nszki adopted Katalin's son Peter Forgach, who became an eye surgeon, from her prior marriage. Their son Tibor Baranski Jr. learned Chinese as a teenager and became an international lawyer in Beijing, and their daughter Kati is Director of Communications at the Diocese of Buffalo.  Legacy and honors  Wallenberg vanished while in the custody of Soviet forces. Before he died, Bar√°nszki was one of the last witnesses to the efforts to protect the Jews from the Nazis in Budapest. On January 11, 1979, he was named by Yad Vashem as Righteous Among the Nations. Bar√°nszki's aunt Margit Sterneder was also recognized as Righteous Among the Nations on January 11, 1979, and on July 16, 1997, Yad Vashem recognized Monsignor Angelo Rotta as Righteous Among the Nations. Gabor Szekeres, the first person Bar√°nszki saved, survived the war and married. His wife Agnes, who lost both her parents in the Holocaust, said of Bar√°nszki, \\"He fought, and he was willing to sacrifice his life, for what he thought was right.\\" The two families remain close to the present day. In 1980, Bar√°nszki was appointed by President Jimmy Carter to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council where he helped guide the formation of the memorial. Hungarian Ambassador to the United States D√°n K√°roly, presented Bar√°nszki with the Hungarian Honorary Cross of the Order of Merit at his home in Snyder, New York on October 7, 2013. His son Tibor Bar√°nszki Jr., an international lawyer in China, initiated contact with Swedish diplomats in China. This led to five years of negotiation that resulted in contact with the Raoul Wallenberg family. In August 2017, Bar√°nszki Sr. was invited by relatives of Wallenberg to be an honored guest for the annual Raoul Wallenberg Day events in Stockholm. The two men knew each other and met or spoke by telephone many times. The Israeli Postal Authority issued a stamp to honor Bar√°nszki in April, 2017. Bar√°nszki's adopted son Peter Forgach said people used to ask Bar√°nszki how he could believe in God after all he witnessed. \\"These things happened, and there has to be a God to bring justice,\\" Bar√°nszki responded.

Like in other parts of the world, child mortality is declining in Ghana.  Definition Child mortality, which is also known as under-5 mortality, refers to the death of infants and children under the age of five. In 2011, 6.9 million children under five died, down from 7.6 million in 2010, 8.1 million in 2009, and 12.4 million in 1990. About half of child deaths occur in Sub-Saharan Africa. Reduction of child mortality was the fourth of the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals. Child Mortality Rate is the highest in low-income countries, especially countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Many deaths in the third world go unrecorded since many poor families cannot afford to deliver in hospitals due to inaccessibility and misconceptions. https://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/stats_popup1.html History and background Historically, Ghana has the full range of diseases endemic to a sub-Saharan country. According to WHO, common diseases include cholera, typhoid, pulmonary tuberculosis, anthrax, pertussis, tetanus, chicken pox, yellow fever, measles, infectious hepatitis, trachoma, malaria, and schistosomiasis. Others are guinea worm or dracunculiasis, various kinds of dysentery, river blindness or onchocerciasis, numerous kinds of pneumonia, dehydration, venereal diseases, and poliomyelitis. According to a 1974 report, more than 75 percent of all preventable diseases at that time were waterborne. In addition, malnutrition and diseases acquired through insect bites continued to be common. WHO lists malaria and measles as the leading causes of premature death in Ghana. Among children under five years of age, 70 percent of deaths are caused by infections compounded by malnutrition.You D, Hug L, Ejdemyr S, Idele P, Hogan D, Mathers C, et al. Global, regional, and national levels and trends in under-5 mortality between 1990 and 2015, with scenario-based projections to 2030: a systematic analysis by the UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation. Lancet. 2015;386:2275‚Äì86. [PubMed] cited 19 August However, under five mortality remains a prominent concern of global health even though Millennium Development Goal 4 was universally adopted to reduce child mortality by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015. Also, several ‚Äòcalls for action‚Äô to reduce neonatal mortality have been made and in response, both governmental and non-governmental institutions have contributed considerable resources to this global health challenge. Similar to other low- and middle- income countries (LMICs), post-adoption of MDG 4 in Ghana observed construction and implementation of maternal and child health policies and intervention programs towards objectifying MDG 4. For example, from 1988 to 1998, the Safe Motherhood Program (SMP), Life Saving Skills (LSS) program, and Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) program were initiated. The SMP aims to secure safe delivery for women and improve child health services while the LSS seeks to sharpen the clinical skills of midwives. Similarly, the IMCI targeted to improve child survival through the provision of clinical guidelines for management of childhood illnesses, health system strengthening, and improving community health practices. In the subsequent decade, from 1998 to 2008, some additional intervention programs and policies implemented were the Community-Based Health Planning and Services (CHPS), User Fees Exemption for Delivery (UFED), Focused Antenatal Care (FANC), and National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS). The CHPS program aimed to bring healthcare closer to the people through primary health care service while the UFED and NHIS programs seek to ease the financial burden of healthcare service and reduce disparity in healthcare uptake. The FANC pursues improvement in maternal and child survival through individualized antenatal care that entails a comprehensive assessment of pregnant women in terms of their socio-cultural beliefs, lifestyle, and medical characteristics to improve early detection and treatment of illness and pregnancy complications. In addition to these national programs and policies, various regions also implemented different intervention programs, for example, the Kybele program in the Greater Accra region, Accelerated Child Survival and Development (ACSD) sponsored by United Nation Children and Education Fund (UNICEF) in the Northern, Upper East, and Upper West regions, and Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) which commenced in six regions in 2007. Although the deadline for the attainment of MDG 4 has passed, 99% of childhood mortality still occurs in LMICs. Assessment of progress made so far is of utmost importance to inform policy makers and healthcare planners tasked to realize the newly adopted Sustainable Development Goals that seeks to end preventable deaths of newborns and under-five children by 2030.The safe motherhood action agenda: priorities for the next decade.

Glob Health Sci Pract. 2013;1:117‚Äì33. [PMC free article] [PubMed cited 24 August 2017 Causes Pneumonia has been rated as a prime cause of children under five years mortality in Ghana, with an annual death of 4,300 children and 72,000 cases though it is vaccine preventable. Pneumonia alone causes about 1.58 million deaths annually of children under five, which is more than the deaths caused by HIV/AIDS, malaria and measles put together. According to a World Health Organization report (WHO), Ghana however has made phenomenal progress over the years in immunization coverage, from a national coverage of four per cent in 1985 to 90 per cent in 2012. Other causes are pneumonia preterm birth complications intrapartum-related complications diarrhoea malaria Achievements against MDGs As part of the Millennium Development Goals, Ghana has been able to reduce the child mortality in its country, under the following measures: Growth Less children aged under five died from preventable causes than ever before. Between 1990 and 2015 the global under-five mortality rate declined from 12.7 million to 6 million deaths a year. Increased coverage of routine immunization, early and accurate diagnosis of childhood illnesses, along with basic and community- based treatment of pneumonia, diarrhoea and malaria, significantly reduced the numbers of deaths of young children, while preventative measures, such as provision of safe drinking water, improvements in sanitation, distribution of insecticide treated nets, vaccination against rotavirus and pneumococcal infection, Vitamin A supplementation, community-based management of acute malnutrition, and improvements in feeding of infants and young children have contributed to survival and healthy growth. Ghana‚Äôs indicators on child survival was impressive in comparison to other West African countries. Under- five mortality rate Ghana excelled in taking action to bring down the under- five mortality rate, and as a result has seen a progressive reduction in deaths from 155 to 60 per 1,000 live births between 1990 and 2014. Though this did not quite reach the MDG 4 target of 40 deaths per 1,000 live births, it represents an overall reduction of under-five mortality of 58% over the period. Infant mortality rate The first 28 days, or neonatal period, represent the most vulnerable time for a child‚Äôs survival. The risk of a child dying before completing the first year of age, was highest in the African region, but has overall decreased in Ghana, where the infant mortality rate dropped from 66 to 41 per 1,000 live births between 1990 and 2014. However, the neonatal mortality rate stagnated over the period, and this has been one of the main reasons for Ghana‚Äôs inability to achieve the MDG 4 target. At a current rate of 29 per 1,000 live births, neonatal mortality makes up 71% of infant mortality and 48% of under-five mortality. Proportion of children immunized against measles Immunization of children against major childhood killer diseases is a key factor in the decline of infant and child mortality in Ghana. The proportion of infants under one-year old vaccinated against measles increased from 50% in 1990 to 89% in 2014. A number of other interventions and practices also contributed towards the progresses achieved in Ghana between 2009 and 2014: * 74% of babies were delivered at health facilities; * 77% of children aged between 12 and 23 months had been given full basic immunization by 12 months of age; * 47% of children slept under insecticide-treated nets to prevent mosquito bites and thereby malaria; * 41% of children received treatment with antibiotics for management of pneumonia and 49% of children received oral rehydration salts for acute watery diarrhoea; * 65% of children aged between 6 and 59 months benefited from a Vitamin A supplementation programme. =Motivation of success= Political stability, a transparent governance system and universal coverage of primary health care have all contributed to a striking overall reduction in under-five mortality in Ghana. This positive outcome has been achieved through the collective efforts of the Government of Ghana and development partners, the later providing both technical and financial support. The UN system in Ghana has contributed technical assistance in developing policies, strategies and guidelines, and has collaborated with the Government, donors and development partners in implementing them. As a result of the priority given to child health through these partnerships, as well as through the implementation of the National Child Health Policy, Ghana has been able to: * scale up the coverage of vaccines, and introduce new ones, to immunize children; * treat childhood diseases such as malaria, pneumonia and diarrhoea more effectively by applying integrated management within health facilities and communities; * control deaths from malaria by distributing insecticide-treated nets and effectively treating malaria cases; * provide Vitamin A supplements for children aged 6‚Äì 59 months through biannual campaigns; * protect and promote breastfeeding and quality infant feeding; * establish community-based management of acute malnutrition; * increase provision of safe drinking water and environmental sanitation; provide free health care to pregnant women and children through the national health insurance services. =Transitioning to the SDGs= Some of the key challenges Ghana faced in working to meet the MDG 4 target included: * inadequate national data to provide complete and reliable information on child health * inadequate skills in the health service at lower levels to improve the quality of care * high reduction of front-line health workers, especially in the north of the country * limited numbers of front- line health workers, including midwives * inadequate resources for immunization and other interventions necessary to improve survival rates * inequity and disparity in health-care services on the basis of geographical location, wealth and educational background. While Ghana has made substantial progress in reducing child mortality, more remains to be done to end preventable newborn deaths as part of the efforts under SDG 3 to ‚Äúensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages‚Äù. To improve child survival further, it will be essential to reduce neonatal mortality. In 2014, with support from the UN system and other development partners, Ghana launched its National Newborn Strategy and Action Plan (2014‚Äì18). This sets the goal and expectation of reducing newborn deaths from 32 to 21 per 1,000 live births over the period of the plan. If this is to be achieved, implementation of the strategy must be accelerated. Investment in perinatal care during childbirth and the early postnatal period can yield a triple dividend, with reductions in maternal deaths and stillbirths, as well as in newborn deaths. Sustained improvements will also require reinvigorated implementation of all interventions to promote the life and health of young children, and urgent action to address the economic and socio-cultural factors that damage their chances of survival.

(From 1902 this line was leased as the West of India Portuguese Railway.) By 1890, this line extended from Londa eastwards via Guntakal to Bezwada, and northwards to Poona, turning the SMR from an assortment of branches to a real railway network.

Fashion designer Valentin Yudashkin at an inspection by the President of the new Russian Armed Forces uniforms, January 2008. The bands of the Western Military District in their various uniforms. The uniforms of the Russian Armed Forces use an extensive system of uniforms, as inherited from the Soviet Armed Forces and modified across the years. Governance Russian Navy working uniform. The specific items of uniforms and the equipment used in the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation are determined by the governing bodies of the forces and ultimately by the Minister of Defence. The rules for wearing these uniforms, established in the 1990s, are also under their purview.  Types of Uniforms  Typically, uniforms are divided into the following categories, each with summer and winter variations: https://eng.mil.ru/en/career/soldiering/gala.htm = Ceremonial = Exists for honour guard purposes. Issued to and typically worn by the servicemen of the 154th Preobrazhensky Independent Commandant's Regiment, this uniform is also worn by troops of other regiments depending on the nature of the occasion. The colours of the uniform are wave-green for the Army, blue for the Aerospace Forces, and black or white for the Navy. = Parade = Only assigned to officers and service personnel of military bands of the Armed Forces. The colours of the uniform are wave-green for the Army, blue for the Aerospace Forces, and black or white for the Navy. Notable variations between variants of this type of uniform are included in the cockade, type of footwear, and type of tunic. The wreathed cockade or the plain-oval cockade are the most common variants, with the former being standard issue for army bands and the latter being the standard issue for officers. The more formal wreathed cockade is also used by officers on special ceremonial occasions like the Moscow Victory Day Parade and maintains continuity with the style used by the Pilots throughout the existence of the Soviet Union & the USSR Army Officers from 1958-1969. Additionally, there is a wide-wreath cockade design specifically assigned to members of the Alexandrov Ensemble which bears resemblance to the parade cockade used by the officer corps of the Soviet Union between 1969 and 1991. The standard footwear which is used are dress shoes. For the army, this replaced jackboots following the abolition of the Soviet-era uniforms in 1994. Nonetheless, jackboots have returned use for the Army parade uniform on special ceremonial occasions including the aforementioned Victory Day Parade in 2019. Regarding tunic variations, the standard tunic is a standing-collar design, though an open- collar variant is used by the Alexandrov Ensemble and a steel-gray open-collar variant is available to be used by generals. = Dress = The dress uniform is the standard-issue service dress uniform for officers. The colours of the uniform are olive green for the Army, Airborne Forces, and Space Forces, blue for the other Aerospace Forces, and black or white for the Navy. The kit formerly served as the everyday, dress, and parade uniform for enlisted servicemen until its abolition in 2015 due to cost restrictions. Since then, it is only assigned to officers and warrant officers. Additionally, it served as the sole everyday uniform for officers until being supplanted by the office uniform in 2012. = Office = Modelled on the everyday office uniform of the Ministry of Emergency Situations, this kit serves as the standard everyday uniform for both officers and enlisted servicemen. It noticeably features no coloured puggaree or epaulettes between branch distinctions which is common in higher-tier uniforms. With the exception of sporadic issuing of the ceremonial, parade, and dress uniforms to non-warrant officer enlisted servicemen for niche purposes, the office uniform kit is also used for the vast majority of ceremonial purposes by non-warrant officer enlisted servicemen. However, significant variations not covered by the official uniform code exist when used for this purpose including: * White parade gloves * White buckled parade belts * White aiguillettes * Coloured branch epaulettes * Branch-distinctive lapel badges * Pressed-collar buttoned jackets as opposed to the zipper jacket used in the standard office kit * Berets used as the main headdress as opposed to caps or peaked caps. * Occasional jackboots for foot columns and colour guards (now increasingly present for infantry troops during the Moscow Victory Day Parade) These ceremonial variations, with the exception of the headdress and footwear differences, carry over from the now-in-abeyance dress uniform kit which was used for this role. = Field = The VBKO field uniform acts as the primary field/combat uniform which is assigned to all troops who operate in the field. = Examples of Uniforms = Ground Forces enlisted kits in common configuration: File:Russian Federation Army Enlisted Ceremonial Uniform.pngSpecial Ceremonial Uniform File:Russian Federation Army Enlisted Office Uniform.jpgOffice Uniform (with ordinary cap) File:Russian Federation Army Enlisted Office Uniform - Peaked Cap.pngOffice Uniform (with peaked cap) Ground Forces officer kits in common configuration: File:Russian Federation Army Officer Special Ceremonial Uniform.pngSpecial Ceremonial Uniform File:Russian Federation Army Officer Parade Uniform.pngParade Uniform File:Russian Federation Army Officer Dress Uniform.pngDress Uniform File:Russian Federation Army Officer Office Uniform.pngOffice Uniform File:Russian Federation Army & Air Force Officer Field Uniform.pngField Uniform Ground Forces General uniform types: File:Official portrait of Sergey Shoigu.jpgSergey Shoigu in dress uniform File:Vladimir Putin and Sergey Shoigu - Saint-Petersburg 2017-07-30 (2).jpg... closed collar parade uniform (debuted 2017 in the Moscow Victory Day Parade, introduced beginning 2018) File:Official portrait of Sergey Shoigu with awards.jpg... open collar parade uniform (phased out beginning 2018) File:Tsalikov HR-gr.jpgRuslan Tsalikov in a gray dress uniform.

Design & Service Distinctions  In terms of their design, the uniforms currently worn by the Russian Federation's soldiers, sailors, and airmen are, to a greater or lesser degree, a development of those worn by the armed forces of the former Soviet Union. In particular, the customary basic colors of black, green, and blue as worn by those serving in, respectively, the Russian Navy, Russian Army, and Russian Air Force reflect those traditionally worn in earlier periods. Also in the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, there are a number of uniform supplies that were used in the USSR and the Russian Empire. For example, a general view of the girdles and shoulder straps of ceremonial calculations and honor guard units in especially solemn occasions, such as parades on Red Square and other cities on the occasion of state and military holidays, a meeting of heads of state and government delegations, solemn ceremonies and military honors. = Navy = In the navy, the dominant colors are navy blue (for example, flannel, naval suit (work dress)), which in practice are black, and white (for example, summer dress and dress uniform for officers to wear at high air temperatures, as well as foremen). = Ground Forces = The so-called \\"green\\" color of the ground forces, in fact, can mean: # The \\"wave-green\\" color. This serves as the colour of the parade uniform of officers, army bands, and the Alexandrov Ensemble (since 2017). The wave-green colour draws its origins from the 19th and early 20th century Imperial Russian era uniforms where it was known as \\"czar green\\". Following an absence during the early Soviet period, it was restored to all parade uniforms of marshals and generals starting with the 1945 Moscow Victory Parade. Subsequently, the wave-green colored parade uniforms were introduced to all commissioned & warrant army officers in 1969. In 1994, the colour was abolished once again with the establishment of the distinct uniforms of the Russian Federation. This color was once again restored to all officer & warrant officer ranks of the Ground Forces in 2008, thus restoring continuity with previous uniforms. # The olive color used by dress & office uniforms. Between 1994 and 2008, the olive-colored dress uniform served as the parade uniform for all ranks. This color replaced the Soviet khaki color of officer dress uniforms, parade uniforms of non-warrant officer enlisted servicemen, and all-rank everyday uniforms in 1994. In 2013, the olive color of everyday uniforms became a brighter shade of green with the introduction of the office uniform, so that the color differences to that of the Soviet khaki color became stronger.–¢–µ–ª—å–º–∞–Ω–æ–≤ –î. –®–æ–π–≥—É –ø–µ—Ä–µ–æ–¥–µ–Ω–µ—Ç —Å–æ—Ç—Ä—É–¥–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤ –≤ ¬´–æ—Ñ–∏—Å–Ω—É—é¬ª —Ñ–æ—Ä–º—É —Å–æ –∑–≤—ë–∑–¥–∞–º–∏ // –°–∞–π—Ç –≥–∞–∑–µ—Ç—ã ¬´–ò–∑–≤–µ—Å—Ç–∏—è¬ª (izvestia.ru) 16 –∞–≤–≥—É—Å—Ç–∞ 2013. = Air Force = The uniform of the Air Force and Airborne Forces of the Russian Federation and the USSR are traditionally blue. The Air Force command staff wore a blue uniform in the 1920s and 1930s (with interruptions). In the USSR, officer & soldier uniforms were khaki colored with only the parade uniform for the Air Force officers being blue.  Regulations  The wearing of uniforms is subject to regulations applying not only to those serving in the Armed Forces, but also to pupils of the Suvorov military and Nakhimov naval academies, cadet and cadet naval corps, and citizens discharged from active service but still members of the reserve. Ex- servicemen and -women who still have the right to wear a military uniform must also observe these regulations. = History = = 1992‚Äì1996 = On 21 December 1991, the CIS member countries agreed to maintain a unified command of the Armed Forces until they were reformed. On 11 February 1992, following Commander-in-Chief of the CIS Armed Forces Order No. 50 \\"On temporary changes in the military uniform for the period 1992‚Äì1995\\", a description was given of \\"temporary changes\\" in uniforms. For marshals and generals, a ceremonial cap was introduced, modeled on the everyday, parade uniform-dress uniform, according to the pattern of the everyday jacket, but with ceremonial epaulettes, dressed-out trousers without boots, with edges along the line. It also authorized officer's model caps in the summer everyday form.

The edges of the ceremonial uniforms of officers, ensigns, servicemen of the extended service and women servicemen, as well as armor-type arm plates for the latter three categories were abolished. A cockade was introduced for officers, warrant officers, and servicemen of super-long service for everyday and dress uniforms. Berets for military servicemen and caps for ceremonial dress uniforms of military servicemen were replaced by officer-type pilots. The woolen jackets of marshals, generals, officers, ensigns and servicemen of extra-long-term services replaced button fasteners with zippers, and sewn side pockets closed with zippers. Marshals, officers, ensigns and servicemen of extra-long service lost their ceremonial belts as well as the leather shoulder strap. Conscripts and cadets adopted a woolen uniform fitted with sewn epaulets of the same material in place of the parade-out uniform and closed everyday jacket. The letters \\"CA\\" were removed from shoulder straps of service members of urgent service, while the metal letters \\"K\\" on shoulder straps of field jackets and everyday cadets of cadets was added. Buttonholes were removed from collars of service members and cadets, while the golden emblems on cotton tunics were fastened to collar corners. The same document introduced changes in generals' uniforms, compared with the 1988 Soviet Army. Sewing on ceremonial caps and uniforms became similar to every day and disappeared from the cuffs (along with the sutured edge on collar and cuffs). Trousers were set to the gray front-and-back tunic, with cuffs, but without lamphas, in the tone of the tunic. Aa cap with a gray crown and colored band. Since 1994 the field uniform had the special, but unofficial sleeve insignias: the branch of service or the military unit. In 1994, President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree that abolished the Soviet-era uniform and changed military dress for the first time since 1969.https://www.rbth.com/economics/2015/04/14/modern_russian_army_uniform_42567 = 1997‚Äì2008 = = 2008‚Äì2011 = = 2012‚Äìpresent = Ground Forces soldiers taking the military oath in the \\"office\\" uniform introduced in 2013. Note the officer on the right in the obsolete open-collar tunic which is currently being phased out. In November 2012, Sergey Shoygu was appointed the Defence Minister of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation. Following his appointment, a number of changes were instituted. This included the introduction of an entirely distinct \\"office uniform\\" in 2013 as a new everyday uniform for officers (of which the prior everyday uniform was a mostly interchangeable with the dress uniform). The office uniform is blue for the Air Force, green for the Ground Forces, and black for the Navy. It includes a zipper jacket, t-shirt, a cap (typically worn by enlisted troops) or peaked cap without the coloured band (typically worn by officers), and the option of wearing combat boots or dress shoes. For the cold seasons, a branch- corresponding colored jacket was introduced with a snap-on hood with fur lining incorporated. In 2015, the rules surrounding wearing military uniforms were officially changed. This noticeably included the abolition of parade & dress uniform kit for conscripts & all ranks below that of warrant officer. The office uniform was rolled out to all ranks in 2016 & now serves in the parade & dress roles (with various modifications) for all ranks below that of warrant officer in addition to its everyday capacity. Other changes also included the removal of the traditional greatcoat for the parade & dress uniforms for all ranks except the honor guards. In the 2017 Moscow Victory Day Parade, officers wore a standing-collar tunic which replaced the previous open-collar tunic. The tunic resembles that which was used in the latter years of World War II by the Soviet Union for ceremonial purposes. The officer corps buttonholes as used by both the Soviet officers during this period & Imperial Russia were added onto the tunics. Generals have the standard ceremonial insignia instead of this design. The color of the Navy ceremonial uniform was also officially changed to pure white, instead of the off-white/cream used before for the summer version of the ceremonial open-collar uniform. Following a trial, the new tunic design was rolled out beginning in 2018 to all ranks down to and including warrant officer as the standard parade tunic. In the 2018 Moscow Victory Day Parade, the massed bands included musicians of all ranks had noticeably begun using this uniform (similar to the British practice of military bands wearing full dress uniform during parades). Only the Alexandrov Ensemble continues to use the open-collar wave-green design as standard issue instead of the closed-collar variant. = Examples of changes in uniforms since 2012 = File:Moscow Victory Day Parade 2012-05-09 (41d3ea8a049f881a0dcb).jpgGround Forces enlisted troops during the 2012 Moscow Victory Day Parade wearing the former dress uniform.

Bartsch (1915), Report on the Turton collection of South African marine mollusks, with additional notes on other South African shells contained in the United States National Museum; Bulletin of the United States National Museum v. 91 (1915) Description The length of the shell attains 6 mm, its diameter 2.4 mm. (Original description) The milk white shell contains 6 whorls. The 2¬Ω whorls of the protoconch are dextral, forming a low apex. The first whorl is small and smooth, the second much larger, marked by very slender riblets and fine spiral lirations which increase in strength with the growth of the whorls. The subsequent whorls are very strongly shouldered at about one third of the distance between the sutures anterior to the summit. They are marked by strong, somewhat protractive axial ribs, of which 12 occur upon all but the penultimate whorl. Upon this there are 14. Intercostal spaces are about three times as wide as the ribs. In addition to the axial sculpture the whorls are marked by spiral lirations which are of two strengths. Four of the stronger cross the whorls between the periphery and the shoulder. Of these one is immediately above the suture and one at the angle of the shoulder, the other two divide the space between them into three unequal areas. The space between the peripheral and second strong liration is crossed by four slender subequal spiral threads; that between the second and third also by four, that between the third and fourth by five, of which the middle one is a little stronger than the rest. The space between the shoulder and the summit of the whorls is marked by about 20 slender, equal and equally spaced, spiral threads. The sutures are strongly marked. The periphery of the body whorl is well rounded. The base of the shell is attenuated, marked by strong and fine lirations like the spire, those on the columellar portion being stronger than the rest. There are twelve strong threads having a somewhat variable number of finer threads between them. The entire surface of spire and base is also marked by fine lines of growth which give a pitted appearance to the spaces between the fine spiral fines in the intercostal spaces. All the spirals cross the axial ribs and the coarser ones render their junctions with the ribs slightly nodulose. The aperture is of irregular shape. The outer lip is scythe-shaped, the border of the deep-rounded notch which is immediately below the summit representing the handle, the flattened surface of the strongly in- bent outer lip forming the blade; the surface of the latter is finely, spirally striated. The columellar wall is covered by a thin callus which extends upon the parietal wall. Distribution This marine species occurs off Port Alfred, South Africa.

Early life  Annie Clorence Peters also known as ‚ÄúOuma Annie‚Äù, was born in 1920 in Heidedal near Bloemfontein. Her mother was born from a relationship between a Scottish man and the daughter of a Basotho chief. Her mother was classified as coloured but was allowed to travel in whites-only areas due to her fair appearance, while Annie had to travel separately in the trams restricted for black people. She attended school in Heidedal as well as Lesotho.  Political activity  Her political activity started during her schooling when she protested against the Bantu Education System. At the age of 16, she left school and moved with her mother to Sophiatown. In Sophiatown Annie worked as a tap-dancer while participating in defiance against apartheid legislation. Her political activity was particularly against the passbook derogatorily known as the dompas. She said: ‚ÄúI refused to get a passbook.

Lake D√ºden is located northwest of Lake Tuz and east of Kulu town in Konya Province at an elevation of . It is a shallowh brackish water lake covering area. The lake is fed mainly by Kulu Creek, aka Deƒüirmen√∂z√º Creek, in the west. It has no outlet. Spring waters around lake contribute also to the lake's feeding. There are nine islets inside the lake. In the south of the lake, there is a fresh water lake named \\"Little Lake\\" () surrounded by dense reeds. While the ducks generally brooding at the Little Lake in the south, the gulls and common terns prefer the islets in colonies. Lake D√ºden, Lake Little and their surrounding area of wetlands and steppes are declared protected area in 1992. Ecosystem ;Flora Most of the nine islets are covered by grass n the spring season. The lake is surrounded by wheat fields of dryland farming and naked steppe. In the north, there are water- meadows at some places used for cattle grazing. ;Fauna Lake D√ºden is a habitat for around 40,000 waders of more than 170 species during both breeding and migration periods. The area houses summer breeds like marbled duck, ferruginous duck, white-headed duck, avocet, greater sand plover, Mediterranean gull and gull-billed tern. Before and after breeding periods, a great number of waders are observed, including black-necked grebe, ruddy shelduck, white-headed duck, black-winged stilt, avocet and snowy plover. In the winter time, the lake freezes. However, greater white-fronted goose can be observed in great numbers. Other breeding species are Eurasian spoonbill, pratincole, slender-billed gull and black-headed gull . Lake D√ºden is an important breeding habitat in Turkey for the world-wide endangered species white-headed duck. Lately, flamingo colonies came to the lake. It is a popular site for birdwatchers from Ankara. Environmental threat The sinking of water level in the lake is the most important thread. The excessive consumption of groundwater and surface water in the Konya Closed Basin started to affect the lake. Despite the intensive snowfall in 2006, the lake has almost completely dried out. As a result of the sinking of water level, the islets were connected with each other, and the breeding of birds stopped.The untreated waste water of the Kulu district was dumped in the past into Kulu Creek, which feeds the lake. The plan of Kulu municipality to build roads to and around the lake, and to afforest the lake's surrounding would be a threat for the breeding birds. Another important issue is the poaching. In 2010, the district administration undertook measures to save the lake by building a waste water treatment facility and preventing unlawful water usage from the creek.

As a result, the Ugandan government was deposed and replaced by a new one under NRA leader Yoweri Museveni. In 1981 Museveni initiated an insurgency in Uganda against the government, which was controlled by the Uganda National Liberation Front (UNLF). He soon joined the nascent National Resistance Movement (NRM) and took control of its armed wing, the NRA. In 1985 the NRA inflicted several key defeats on the UNLF's armed wing, the UNLA, leaving the Ugandan capital, Kampala, vulnerable to attack. Feeling pressured, the UNLF government led by President Tito Okello pursued negotiations with the NRM. The resulting peace agreement failed to end the conflict, and Okello amassed a large force of UNLA troops and allied militias to garrison Kampala in preparation for an attack, though its effectiveness was weakened by low morale, internal friction, and subterfuge. On 17 January 1986 the NRA began advancing on Kampala. They managed to occupy territory around the city, but the UNLA stemmed their advance by placing an artillery battery at a strategic roundabout. On 24 January the UNLA withdrew its battery, and the NRA began its main attack. On the following day the NRA besieged several UNLA installations in Kampala, and by evening had secured Republic House, the UNLA headquarters. On 26 January the NRA captured Radio Uganda, but 1,000 UNLA troops from Entebbe broke through a roadblock and began advancing towards the city. Museveni and his chief of staff, Salim Saleh, redeployed their forces to counter the threat, in the process opening a gap in their cordon around Kampala and allowing many UNLA troops to escape. Okello fled in a helicopter and flew to Sudan. In the evening an NRA battalion ambushed the UNLA troops advancing from Entebbe while a company moved to attack their rear, forcing them to capitulate and ending the battle. On 29 January Museveni was sworn in as President of Uganda. The UNLA attempted to regroup in northern Uganda, but collapsed in the following months after being subject to further NRA attacks.  Background  In April 1979 Tanzanian forces and the Uganda National Liberation Army (UNLA), a coalition of armed rebel groups united under the Uganda National Liberation Front (UNLF), deposed the President of Uganda, Idi Amin. A new UNLF government was installed, but it was weak and exercised little control over the country. This was in part due to the UNLF's and its army's own internal divisions. The several-hundred strong Kikosi Maalum group was loyal to Milton Obote, who had served as President before Amin took power. Yoweri Museveni controlled the Front for National Salvation, which had about 3,000 members. Over time power shifted to pro-Obote elements in the government and the army. Obote assumed power in 1980 through a disputed election, and ruled through repressive methods, including the incarceration and killing of dissidents. In February 1981 Museveni and a small band of rebels began attacking UNLA forces, initiating the Ugandan Bush War. Shortly thereafter a new rebel coalition was organised as the National Resistance Movement (NRM). Museveni was made Vice-Chairman of the National Resistance Council, the group's political body, and Chairman of the High Command of the National Resistance Army (NRA), the Movement's armed organ. By July 1985 the NRA had been largely defeated and pushed out of its strongholds, and Museveni retired to Sweden. On 27 July, several officers of the UNLA launched a coup which overthrew President Obote. General Tito Okello assumed power in his place. The new regime was weak and unstable, and Okello made overtures to anti-Obote rebel groups to form a coalition government and end the fighting. The coup upset many Lango soldiers, which constituted the second-largest ethnic group in the UNLA and were loyal to Obote. The NRM was highly critical of the new government and accused the UNLA of committing atrocities. The UNLF, conscious of its weakening political position, nevertheless pursued negotiations with the NRM. Museveni took advantage of the disruption caused by the coup to return to East Africa and rebuild the NRA. In August the NRA launched a series of co-ordinated attacks that resulted in the capture of significant amounts of territory in central and western Uganda. In late September, the NRA laid siege to the UNLA troops in the provincial centre of Masaka and, soon thereafter, the town of Mbarara, both key urban areas in southern Uganda. In October Museveni warned that, in the event of the failure negotiations ongoing between the NRM and the UNLF in Nairobi, \\"the NRA would take Kampala by force\\". On 3 December Okello's government released a document allegedly seized from the NRA which carried an order from Museveni to the NRA Chief of Staff, Salim Saleh, to prepare to attack the Ugandan capital, Kampala, if a peace agreement did not materialise. The NRM did not comment on the disclosure. On 10 December Masaka's garrison surrendered to the NRA. On 17 December the UNLF and NRM concluded talks and signed the Nairobi Peace Agreement. The accord nominally ended the war and declared Okello and Museveni President and Vice President of Uganda, respectively, and required the demilitarisation of Kampala until a new army could be established. It also carried a provision which stipulated that one belligerent could disregard the agreement if the other was found to be violating human rights. The NRM accused the UNLA of failing to respect Ugandans' rights, and the NRA continued fighting. On 31 December the UNLF government accused the NRA of failing to uphold its terms of the peace agreement by launching attacks, impeding the flow of food to the Mbarara garrison, and refraining from nominating representatives to coordinate further peace measures with the government. The UNLA forces at Mbarara capitulated soon thereafter.  Prelude  Following their victories, the NRA was able to greatly expand its manpower, and gained access to important military equipment. In contrast, the UNLA's remaining forces were increasingly suffering from defections, low morale, and internal divisions along ethnic lines. The NRA's success at Masaka and Mbarara also solidified their control of the centre and south-western sections of the country and left Kampala vulnerable to attack. To take advantage of its improving military situation, the NRA High Command decided to launch an offensive to capture the city. Saleh drew up the plans of attack. About 9,600 fighters were allocated for this operation, many of which were UNLA defectors from the Masaka garrison. At the same time, the NRA's 9th and 19th Battalions blocked the Masinda‚ÄìHoima Road, so that UNLA units which were still active in northern Uganda could not reinforce Kampala. Realising that the rebels would launch an attack on the capital, President Okello attempted to bolster Kampala's garrison by enlisting the aid of anti-NRA militias, including the Former Uganda National Army (FUNA) and the Uganda Freedom Army. In truth, many of these alleged anti-NRA fighters were NRA spies and acted as a fifth column. The entire Uganda Freedom Army was probably a front organisation of the NRA. In addition, FUNA suffered from extensive indiscipline, and harassed civilians in the capital despite denials by its commander Isaac Lumago. Kampala's garrison was at least 12,000-strong. The UNLA also established a battery at Summit View on Kololo, a hill overlooking Kampala. Troops were deployed to strategic locations, including the Radio Uganda building, the Uganda Television building, the Nile Mansions, the Uganda International Conference Centre, and the Parliament building. UNLA forces also garrisoned the State House in Entebbe to the south-east.  Battle  Suspected to harbour NRA fighters, Rubaga Cathedral was targeted by UNLA artillery on 20 January. On 17 January 1986 the NRA began advancing on Kampala. The NRA's 1st, 3rd, 5th and 11th Battalions moved along the main axis of attack from Masaka, while the 7th Battalion travelled down Hoima Road towards the city. UNLA troops were sent to intercept them south-west of the city, but they withdrew and ignored their officers' orders for them to return. On 20 January the UNLA's battery began shelling western Kampala. The bombardment targeted the Rubaga Cathedral, which the UNLA suspected had been infiltrated by the NRA. By 22 January the NRA's 7th Battalion had occupied Nansana, while the 1st, 3rd, 5th and 11th Battalions had taken up position on Mutundwe, another hill overlooking Kampala. UNLA and FUNA troops blocked their advance by placing artillery‚Äîincluding anti-aircraft guns‚Äî at the Busega roundabout, where the Masaka and Fort Portal roads entered the capital. The commander of the NRA's 1st Battalion, Pecos Kutesa, in a fit of anxiety claimed he was ill; Museveni ordered him to remain at the local NRA headquarters while his second-in-command, Fred Mugisha took charge of the unit on the front lines. On 24 January the UNLA withdrew from the Busega roundabout. A band of NRA soldiers led by Kasirye Gwanga reconnoitred the area, and, discovering that it had been abandoned, radioed a message to their headquarters. Saleh and Museveni subsequently ordered their forces to attack. The 1st Battalion and 3rd Battalion were given the responsibility of conducting the main thrust into Kampala and equipped with most of the NRA's support weapons. The former pressed forward with the latter in support, and by nightfall had secured Rubaga. The 11th Battalion moved in behind them, while the 7th Battalion seized Ndeeba. Upon hearing that his troops had entered Kampala, Museveni relocated his headquarters from Mpigi to Trinity College Nabbingo. Meanwhile, three young NRA guerrillas reconnoitred UNLA defences on Kololo under the guise of playing football. For the most part, the UNLA and FUNA soldiers defending the city were demotivated and poorly led; many deserted or outright defected to the NRA. On 25 January the NRA's 7th Battalion attacked the UNLA barracks at Makindye and the 3rd Battalion assaulted the Lubiri barracks, while the 1st Battalion acted as a reserve. NRA artillery positioned on Mutundwe traded fire with the UNLA battery at Summit View. Fighting at Lubiri was severe; the UNLA garrison successfully blunted an attempt by NRA troops to scale the barracks wall, so the latter resorted to besieging the installation with grenades and machine guns. All foreign missions in the city closed their facilities. The governments of the United States and the United Kingdom advised their nationals in the capital to seek shelter indoors. Radio Uganda broadcast a request from Okello to the NRA for a ceasefire and for the implementation of the Nairobi Peace Agreement. In the afternoon NRA artillery struck an armoury near the UNLA's headquarters, Republic House, causing a large series of explosions. Republic House was captured early in the evening by the 1st and 3rd Battalions. At about 21:00 a platoon of the 3rd Battalion managed to successfully climb over the wall at the Lubiri barracks, finding the location to have been abandoned by UNLA forces. Saleh moved to join his troops at the front line and encamped at Natete. One of the NRA's BTR-60 armoured personnel carriers (example pictured) was destroyed during the battle. On 26 January Museveni went to Republic House, moving his command post to its canteen. He was greeted by Saleh, who briefed him on the status of the battle. The NRA's 1st Battalion was subsequently ordered to secure the city centre. Along Parliament Avenue an NRA BTR-60 armoured personnel carrier (APC) was struck by a UNLA rocket-propelled grenade (RPG). The APC attempted to reverse to evade further fire but collided with a lorry which was hauling a 37 mm anti-aircraft gun. UNLA troops subsequently set both vehicles ablaze, and Radio Uganda‚Äîwhich had been broadcasting UNLA propaganda throughout the battle‚Äîdeclared that an NRA tank had been destroyed. Soldiers of the 1st Battalion and 3rd Battalion led by Mugisha and Patrick Lumumba employed RPGs to eliminate UNLA anti-armour defences around Radio Uganda. By 15:00 the NRA had secured the Radio Uganda station, killing a UNLA officer and capturing three soldiers. Meanwhile, the 11th Battalion under Chefe Ali captured Nakulabye, Makerere, and Kamwokya. The unit then rushed the UNLA position at Summit View, forcing the troops manning the artillery to surrender and forcing others‚Äîincluding their commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Eric Odwar‚Äîto retreat. Telecommunications running out of the country were severed. By the afternoon, UNLA troops still held out at the Nile Mansions, and the Parliament building. While the 7th Battalion continued to battle the Makindye garrison, a UNLA force of about 1,000 men penetrated the NRA's 5th Battalion's roadblock along the Entebbe road, causing Museveni deep consternation. As the 1st Battalion was engaged near the Jinja road and the 11th Battalion was mopping up the UNLA presence on Kololo, he deployed his reserve‚Äîtwo companies of the 3rd Battalion‚Äîto stop the advance from Entebbe. Saleh ordered the NRA's 500-strong Special Force under Jet Mwebaze to redeploy from a roadblock on the Jinja road to assist Ivan Koreta's 13th Battalion in the northern section of the city near the Gulu road. After some fighting, the battalion reached and secured Kawempe. With the removal of the roadblock on the Jinja road, UNLA forces began retreating from Kampala, taking their families with them. Saleh accompanied the 3rd Battalion companies to Namasuba valley where they linked up with a company of the 5th Battalion and took up positions along the Entebbe road. Early in the evening the 7th Battalion captured the Makindye barracks, and Museveni sent them to the Kisubi roundabout to act as a reserve for the forces guarding the Entebbe route. As dusk fell, the 1,000 UNLA troops entered the Namasuba valley and were ambushed. They retreated, and the NRA forces advanced and occupied Zana hill. Another NRA company stationed at Kisubi began moving towards the UNLA force's rear. Fearing that they were about to be subject to a pincer attack, the UNLA men dispatched an emissary to Zana to offer their surrender. Saleh accepted, and at around 22:00 radioed news of the capitulation to Museveni. By the end of the day the NRA had secured Kampala. Saleh went to Radio Uganda link up with the 1st Battalion and sleep. Three high-ranking UNLA commanders surrendered when the city fell to the NRA; namely chief of staff Lieutenant General Zeddy Maruru, Brigadier Fred Okecho, and Colonel Samuel Nanyumba. Okello fled via helicopter to Sudan with several members of his staff. FUNA commander Isaac Lumago went into exile in Zaire.  Aftermath  = Analyses = The Battle of Kampala was the largest battle the NRA had partaken in since its inception. Researcher Richard J. Reid described the UNLA's defense of Kampala as \\"brief but ferocious\\". Unlike previous, drawn-out engagements in the Ugandan Bush War, the NRA had won the battle through overwhelming force and direct attack. The removal of the NRA roadblock on the route to Jinja allowed many UNLA troops to escape the city and reorganise to launch a new rebellion eight months later. Saleh maintained that he had ordered the roadblock's removal in consideration of \\"humanitarian reasons\\", as there could have been \\"a blood bath and [UNLA troops'] families would perish in the fighting\\". In contrast, historians Tom Cooper and Adrien Fontanellaz regarded the roadblock's removal as the result of \\"a faulty order\\". = Course of the war = NRA leader Yoweri Museveni (pictured in 1987) was sworn in as President of Uganda following the Battle of Kampala. Overall, about 20 NRA and 80 UNLA/FUNA soldiers were killed in the fighting, while nearly 3,000 UNLA troops were captured. Most of the UNLA casualties were incurred as troops were shot while attempting to abandon their positions at Radio Uganda and Uganda Television and flee towards Kololo. About 9,000 UNLA soldiers and their families managed to escape from Kampala. Many of these troops retreated towards Jinja and Gulu, looting as they fled. Buildings along Kampala Avenue, the main road in the city, were left heavily damaged by the battle. Unlike previous military takeovers in Kampala, the NRA soldiers did not loot in the city. Following the battle, the NRA's 5th Battalion and one platoon from the 3rd Battalion captured Entebbe. On 29 January Museveni was sworn in as President of Uganda in front of the Parliament building with a crowd of tens of thousands in attendance. In his inaugural address, he promised to support national unity, public security, and democracy, pledging that his government would schedule elections as soon as possible. His appointed cabinet consisted mostly of NRM members and civil servants. Despite Museveni's promises, many northerners in Kampala‚Äîviewed as beneficiaries of the Obote and Okello regimes‚Äîespecially Acholi and Lango people, were subject to abuse and discrimination following the NRA's takeover; some were killed in the streets or forced out of their jobs or homes. Several NRA soldiers stole automobiles from them. Other northerners fled from the repression to their lands of origin. Museveni condemned the violence. Museveni's government sent an emissary to Sudan to entreat Okello to order the remaining UNLA forces to surrender, but he stated that he no longer controlled them. The NRA subsequently attacked Jinja, capturing it by late January, followed by Tororo in early February. At this point, UNLA attempted one last time to stem the rebel advance by launching a counter-attack against Tororo and fortifying the crossings of the Nile to prevent the NRA from advancing into northern Uganda. Nevertheless, Museveni's forces inflicted further defeats on the UNLA in late February and early March, resulting in the complete collapse of the latter. A presidential election was not held in the country until 1996; Museveni won by a large margin.

The anthem is a setting of the first verse of Psalm 102 in the version of the Book of Common Prayer. Purcell composed it c. 1682 at the beginning of his tenure as Organist and Master of the Choristers for Westminster Abbey.  History and music  The composition is thought to have been intended to be part of a longer work, indicated by several blank pages following it in the autograph, which is held by the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. The lyrics of the extant music are the first verse of Psalm 102: \\"Hear my prayer, O Lord, and let my crying come unto thee.\\" (). Purcell set it for an a cappella choir consisting of eight voice parts: two soprano parts, two altos, two tenors and two basses (SSAATTBB). The anthem is 34 measures long, and is written in the key of C minor. Some arrangements include a continuo instrumental accompaniment. Musicologist and historian Franklin B. Zimmerman designated the anthem as \\"Z. 15\\" in his catalogue of Purcell's works. The duration of performances and recordings of this work varies considerably, from about two minutes to over three minutes in length. Purcell begins the composition with a simple setting of the first line on one tone, with only one exception, a minor third up on the word \\"O\\". After the first phrases, Purcell employs six to eight parts, in complex \\"pungent\\" harmonies which build to what the conductor Robert King calls \\"an inexorable vocal crescendo lasting over three minutes, culminating on a monumental discord on the last repetition of 'come. Musicologist Timothy Dickey notes that Purcell \\"gradually amplified the vocal texture, and intensifies the harmonic complexity, until all eight voices combine in a towering dissonant tone cluster which desperately demands the final cadential resolution.\\" The anthem has been recorded many times, including a 1995 release by the Collegium Vocale Gent, conducted by Philippe Herreweghe, and one from 2006 by the Choir of Clare College Cambridge, conducted by Timothy Brown.  Legacy  The Swedish composer Sven-David Sandstr√∂m used this piece for a composition of the same name, wherein, just shortly before the final cadence, the pieces collapses and builds up again from small bits of melody from the original.

He was born at Hemingford Grey, Huntingdonshire and died at Milestown, Castlebellingham, County Louth, Ireland. His precise date of birth is not known. Thornhill was the son of George Thornhill, a Huntingdonshire landowner who became Member of Parliament for Huntingdonshire from 1837 to his death in 1852. He was educated at Eton College and Emmanuel College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, he played as a middle-order batsman, though it is not known if he was right- or left-handed. He appeared for Cambridge University in one or two matches each season from 1837 to 1840 and he made, by the standards of the time, some good scores: against the Cambridge Town Club in 1838, for instance, he top-scored with 32 out of a total of 99 in the first innings. But he was not picked for the Cambridge side in the University Match against Oxford University in any of his last three seasons, and therefore never won a Blue. Thornhill graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1841, and this converted to a Master of Arts in 1845. His post-Cambridge career is not clear: in the directory of Cambridge alumni, he is cited as formerly a captain in the 14th King's Light Dragoons, but it also states that after graduation, when that regiment was sent on a 20-year tour of duty in India, Thornhill was ordained into the Church of England as a deacon, serving as curate at Wark on Tyne in 1842 and 1843. At his death in 1881 in Ireland, he was noted in a newspaper as having been formerly the vicar of Burwell, Cambridgeshire. Several of his family were also cricketers: his brother George Thornhill played in first-class matches for Cambridge University, while another brother John appeared twice in first-class games for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC); other brothers, and George's three sons, played in minor matches.

In 1835, some Druze clans of Mount Lebanon rose in another revolt. Timeline In parallel to the Peasant uprising in Palestine and Transjordan (south of the Damascus Eyalet), Galilee- based rebels captured Safad and Tiberias in the eastern Galilee. The Hauran was also encompassed by the rebellion. The most severe events took place in Galilee, climaxing with the 1834 looting of Safed which was mostly an attack against the Jewish community of the city, which began on Sunday 15 June 1834, and lasted for the next 33 days.Bloch, Abraham P. One a day: an anthology of Jewish historical anniversaries, 1987. pg. 168. Rabbi Isaac b. Solomon Farhi records that the pillage continued for 24 days. The governor of Safed and thirteen of the ringleaders were taken captive, summarily tried, and put to death. The district governor tried to quell the violent outbreak, but failed to do so and fled. Upon arrival of Muhammad Ali was in Damascus Eyalet, he requested military assistance from Emir Bashir Shihab II of Mount Lebanon, via an emissary, Emir Shihab's son Amin. The arrival of Bashir's Druze troops followed intervention of foreign consuls. In late July 1834, Emir Bashir led his forces toward Galilee, but before advancing further southward, he made a number of proclamations advising that the rebels of Safad surrender. The rebel leadership in Safad agreed to negotiate and sent Sheikh Salih al-Tarshihi as an emissary to Bashir to arrange a meeting. Bashir invited the leaders of Safad to the village of Bint Jbeil where they agreed to surrender and submit to Egyptian authority. Afterward, Bashir arrived in Safad where he arranged for rebel leaders from nearby areas to surrender as well. Bashir's Druze forces under the command of his son Amin,Farah 2000, p. 22. entered Safad without resistance on 18 July 1834, making way for the displaced residents from its Jewish quarter to return. The instigators were arrested and later executed in Acre. In 1835, some Druze clans of Mount Lebanon rose up in another revolt.

History  The station is the terminal station of the old abolished line 64 (Ypres ‚Äì Roeselare) and the also abolished line 65 (Roeselare ‚Äì Menen ‚Äì French frontier). The station is situated on walking distance from the city centre. Each quarter of an hour, a train stops in Roeselare, among which L-trains to Bruges and Kortrijk, and the IC-trains to Bruges-Ostend (Brugge-Oostende) and Kortrijk-Lille or Brussels. Outside, there is a busstation with 11 platforms where you can take a town-bus or regional bus.  Infrastructure  The station lies on a raising verge. There is a big yellow metal roof above the platforms. Because of the open roof construction, there are almost no walls around the platforms but some shelters protect the travellers against the wind. There are 3 tracks and 2 platforms. On the upper storey, there are a few offices. Formerly, signal-station 'Bloc 10' regulated the railway-traffic in the station. The platforms can be reached by stairs, escalators or by lift. Downstairs there are a ticket office and several shops.  Renovation  The railway station from 1977 doesn‚Äôt meet certain modern requirements concerning comfort, customer friendliness and reaching. When the station was built in 1976-1979, it looked modern at the time with a raising railway that replaced four level crossings. At the end of 2007, the municipality and several partners of public transport organizations decided to modernize the neighbourhood of the station. Together they invested 35 million euro. The work was planned to be done in 2012 but they worked on the new railway-station till the summer of 2018. Meanwhile, the construction of the underground parking and the new busstation have been completed. Thanks to this renovation, the railway station has turned into a transferring point between different parts of town.

Bartsch (1915), Report on the Turton collection of South African marine mollusks, with additional notes on other South African shells contained in the United States National Museum; Bulletin of the United States National Museum v. 91 (1915) This is a taxon inquirendum. Description The length of the shell attains 12.4 mm, its diameter 4 mm. (Original description) The slender shell has an elongate-conic shape. It is white with narrow brown bands. The type specimen contains 9 whorls forming an elevated spire. The protoconch consists of 2¬Ω whorls, dextral, strongly rounded and smooth, The subsequent whorls show a strong shoulder one-third of the distance between the sutures anterior to the summit, the rest well rounded. They are marked by strong, narrow, sinuous, slightly protractive, axial ribs, of which 10 occur upon the first, 12 upon the second and third, 14 upon the fourth and fifth, and 16 upon the penultimate whorl. The intercostal spaces are about three times as wide as the ribs. The spiral sculpture consists of moderately broad, low, flattened spiral lirations, separated by channels a little less in width than the lirations. These lirations grow gradually wider from the summit to the periphery. There are 14 of them between the sutures on the penultimate whorl. The base of the shell is attenuated, marked by the continuations of the axial ribs and about 14 spiral lirations. Those of the outer half where the ribs are absent are much stronger than the rest. The aperture is almost oval, decidedly expanded at the posterior angle, where the outer lip is somewhat reflected by the shallow channel. The middle of the outer lip is slightly inbent and thin. The columella is sinuous and somewhat twisted. It is covered by a thin callus which extends up on the parietal wall. Distribution This marine species occurs off Port Alfred, South Africa.

Thesis: The History of Nusayris ('Alawis) in Ottoman Syria, 1831-1876. University of Arkansas. 2013. was one of the arenas of the Syrian Peasant Revolt (1834‚Äì35). Between 1834 and 1835, the Alawites (Nusayris) rose up against Egyptian rule of the region, while pro-Egyptian governor of Homs Salim Beg and the forces of Emir Bashir Shihab II of the Mount Lebanon Emirate, commanded by Khalil and his relatives, participated in the suppression of revolts in Akkar, Safita, the Krak des Chevaliers and an Alawite revolt in the mountainous region of Latakia. Background The Ottoman Empire oppressed the Alawites, attempting to convert them to Sunni Islam.Seale, Patrick. Asad of Syria: The Struggle for the Middle East. With the assistance of Maureen McConville. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1989, c1988.

His son, Ibrahim Pacha, has again the title of Sheikh and Harem of Mekka, and the district of Jedda; and farther, I have acquiesced in his request to have the district of Adana ruled by the Treasury of Taurus, with the title of Mohassil.\\"The Syrian Question, 1841 The policy of disarmament and the call for mass conscription by Muhammad Ali of Egypt caused many revolts in different part of Syria, such as Aleppo, Damascus, Tripoli, Beirut, Antioch, and Kilis. The main revolts occurred in three places; Jerusalem, mainly in Jabal Nablus in May 1834; among the Nusayris in Latakia and the Nusayri Mountains in September 1834; and among the Druzes in Mount Lebanon in 1835. According to Tilhamy, the Alawites were still loyal to the central Ottoman rule, and refrained from the Egyptian rule.Talhamy, ‚ÄúThe Nusayri and Druze Minorities in Syria in the Nineteenth Century: The Revolt against the Egyptian Occupation as a Case Study,‚Äù 983. Timeline The first offensive attack of the Nusayris upon the Egyptians took place in 1834, when 4,000 Alawite militants attacked Egyptian soldiers who were marching from Aleppo to Latakia. The attack caused the loss of half of the Egyptian soldiers and forced them to retreat to Latakia. The Nusayris then attacked Latakia and destroyed government buildings, laid siege to the house of the Mutasallim Antepli Said Agha, captured the land tax money, the houses of the Mutasallim and some belongings of the soldiers, while freeing Nusayri prisoners. In the meanwhile, the conscription and disarmanent policies of the Egyptian viceroy were applied to the area of Tripoli by the governor of Homs and commander of the Egyptian artillery corps Salim Beg. Having a partial success in policy implementation due to withdrawal of many armed Alawite men to the mountains, Salim Beg discovered the hiding place of the Nusayri rebels the help of his agents, and attacked them. This attack led to the defeat of the Nusayri rebels and at the end of the raid, many weapons and flocks of sheep were captured, the Nusayri leaders were executed, several Nusayri rebels were captured and later conscripted, and the villages of the Nusayris burnt to punish the entire people and discourage other Nusayris from resisting. When Ibrahim Pasha was informed about the Nusayri attacks on his troops in Latakia, he ordered Salim Beg to move from Tripoli to the region. As soon as the rebels heard of the arrival of Salim Beg‚Äôs forces, they fled Latakia towards the Nusayri Mountains. Many of them were killed by the Egyptians and five leaders of the community were taken to prison. Salim Beg attacked al-Mreqib and the contiguous villages, including al-Khawabi, Qadmus, and Sultan Ibrahim where many weapons were obtained. However the Egyptians did not gain total control of the mountains. Then, Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt asked his allies in the region to provide him with more soldiers that were skilled in fighting in the rocky mountains. Significant forces were sent to the Nusayri mountains under the leadership Amir Khalil, son of Emir Bashir Shihab II, Mehmed Ali‚Äôs ally in Syria. With the arrival of Khalil's troops, the size of the Egyptian army reached 10,000 soldiers. Initially, the Egyptian campaign began with a disaster - the Nusayris captured five hundred Druzes who had been sent to the region and killed all of them near al-Murayqib. However, with the help of the new troops, Salim Beg subjugated the region within a week, and forced the Nusayris of the northern part of the mountain to accept his authority after disarming them and destroying several of their villages. The Nusayri uprising lasted until mid-April 1835, as the Ottomans neither came to help nor sent sufficient material to strengthen the Nusayri resistance against the Egyptian rule. After eight months of continuous conflict, the Nusayris were disarmed and conscripted. Aftermath After subduing the rebellion, Ibrahim Pasha ordered the arrest of every Nusayri rebel in order to control their suitability for the army, and to collect their weapons - around 4,000 Nusayris were conscripted and many of them were forced to leave the mountains. In addition, the Egyptians destroyed their villages and wells, cut down fruit trees and pillaged.A. L. Tibawi, A Modern History of Syria. (McMillan: St. Martin Press, 1969), 74. Talhamy states that during the uprising, the Egyptian soldiers enslaved some Nusayri women although enslavement is prohibited by Islam. They adopted the fatwa of al-Mugrabi that was issued in 1820s that allowed the enslavement of the Nusayris.Talhamy, ‚ÄúThe fatwas and the Nusayri/Alawi of Syria,‚Äù 183., Samuel Lyde, The Asian Mystery: Illustrated in the History, Religion, and Present State of the Ansaireeh or Nusairis of Syria, 196 During the late Ottoman era, between 1840 and 1880, tensions between the authorities and the Alawite tribes of the coastal mountains increased sharply. In 1854 the Ottoman governor of the Latakia Sanjak (\\"Latakia District\\") was killed in armed confrontation between the authorities and members of the Qardaha-based tribe. This emboldened the Kalbiyya fighters, who proceeded to launch more raids against Ottoman positions, which the authorities responded to harshly.

Forming the eastern section of the South Wales Main Line, it shortened the distance between South Wales and London for heavy mineral traffic and for express passenger trains, and relieved congestion on the line through Bath. It was engineered to high standards with gentle gradients and large radius curves, and was correspondingly expensive to construct. It is about 30 miles in length. The line is part of the principal route between South Wales and London, and today carries a heavy main line passenger service. All intermediate stations were closed in the 1960s, but in 1971 Bristol Parkway station was opened, and remains the only passenger station on the line. Electrification of the line is (2017) in progress. Before the Badminton line Map of the Badminton lineOn 30 June 1841 the Great Western Railway company opened its first main line between London and Bristol.Robertson and Abbott give 31 May 1841 but this must be a mistake.Christiansen consistently refers to the GWR main line as \\"the L&B; line\\", for \\"London and Bristol\\".E T MacDermot, History of the Great Western Railway: volume I: 1833 - 1863, part 1, published by the Great Western Railway, London, 1927, page 131Rex Christiansen, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain - volume 13 - Thames and Severn, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1981, By this means the capital and one of the most important seaports were connected by a trunk railway line. The line was well laid out, passing through Reading and Bath. Its engineer was Isambard Kingdom Brunel.Kevin Robertson and David Abbott, GWR The Badminton Line: A Portrait of a Railway, Alan Sutton Publishing Limited, 1988 reprinted 1997, Vic Mitchell and Keith Smith, Swindon to Newport, Middleton Press, Midhurst, 2004, At the early date when the design of the line was being finalised, Brunel was not confident of the ability of the steam engines of the day to ascend significant gradients pulling a load, and the solution appeared to be to concentrate the stiffest climb in a limited distance, and to make the remainder of the route as near to constantly level as possible. The short, steep sections could, he believed, be worked with stationary steam engines hauling the trains up by rope. Accordingly, Brunel designed the main line with two such inclines, in Box Tunnel and at Wootton Bassett.Wootton Bassett was retitled Royal Wootton Bassett in 2009.MacDermot, volume I, part 1, page 23 In fact by the time the railway was being built, the capacity and reliability of steam engines had advanced considerably, and the stationary steam engines were never installed, but the legacy of the two steep inclines remained. Even as the Great Western Railway main line was being built, the momentum of building railway lines in connection with it was building up. The Cheltenham and Great Western Union Railway was promoted to build a line from Swindon to Gloucester and Cheltenham,MacDermot, volume I, part 1, page 163 onwards and the South Wales Railway was formed to build on from near Gloucester to Milford Haven. This was with a view to capturing the transatlantic maritime trade as well as communication with Ireland.E T MacDermot, History of the Great Western Railway: volume I: 1833 - 1863, part 2, published by the Great Western Railway, London, 1927, page 556 onwards The Cheltenham and Great Western Union Railway was absorbed by the Great Western Railway before the line was opened, and the South Wales Railway amalgamated with the GWR in 1863. The network was built on the broad gauge, and this led to difficulty in competing for coal traffic from South Wales to London and the South Coast of England, as most of the coal was extracted in the South Wales Valleys, which were generally connected by narrow (standard) gauge railways.The principal exception was the Vale of Neath Railway. The physical transshipment of the mineral was laborious and expensive, and many producers preferred to use coastal shipping instead.MacDermot, volume I, part 1, pages 580 - 582 When the Taff Vale Extension line of the Newport, Abergavenny and Hereford Railway was fully operational, and then taken over by the GWR, coal could be transferred on narrow (standard) gauge track to London and Southampton via Hereford.D S M Barrie revised Peter Baughan, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 12: South Wales, David St John Thomas, Nairn, second edition 1994, As the South Wales coal business increased exponentially, there was thus a residual hostility to the Great Western Railway, and this continued after conversion of the track gauge in 1873, when at last the GWR could freely convey coal on the most direct routes available.D S M Barrie, The Taff Vale Railway, Oakwood Press, Tisbury, second edition 1950 reprinted 1982 The Severn Tunnel It was not until 1886 that the Severn Tunnel was operational, on 1 September 1886 for goods and on 1 December 1886 for passenger trains.An experimental mineral train had passed through the tunnel on 9 January 1886. Before that date the shortest route for minerals and passengers from South Wales was via Gloucester and Swindon. Now that the Severn Tunnel was available, that traffic could run via Bristol (or the short avoiding line known as Dr Days Curve) and Bath. This was a considerable improvement, but the route through Bath became heavily congested, now carrying much of the South Wales traffic and all of the Bristol and West of England traffic.MacDermot volume II, page 362MacDermot, volume II, page 410 London and South Wales Railway In South Wales, dissatisfaction with the Great Western Railway continued to be a factor. It was effectively a monopoly for the trunk haulage of coal to London and Southampton (as far as Salisbury; Southampton was an important bunkering port for the transatlantic shipping trade, and Portsmouth was a major home port for the Royal Navy.) The Barry Railway Company had been exceptionally successful in South Wales in building ambitious and well-laid- out lines to its modern and well-equipped port. this emboldened those associated with it, and with coalowners who used it and were pleased with the alternatives it offered, to put together a scheme for a London and South Wales Railway. This was announced in November 1895. It was to build a new line from Cogan via Cardiff and skirting Newport on the north side, crossing the River Severn at Beachley by a new 3,300 yard bridge, then via Thornbury, Malmesbury and Lechlade, to make a junction with the Metropolitan Railway near Great Missenden. At 163 miles in length, the scheme was costed at ¬£5,688,252. At the same time, the Vale of Glamorgan Railway promoted a Bill for a new line westward from Ewenny via Porthcawl and Port Talbot to join the Rhondda and Swansea Bay Railway at Aberavon.B G Wilson, The London & South Wales Railway, in the Railway Magazine, October 1956D S Barrie, The Barry Railway, Oakwood Press, Usk, reprinted 1983, For at least a decade, the Great Western Railway had indicated that it might build a cut-off line to shorten the route from the Severn Tunnel to London, but it had not done so. Barrie says, \\"Beyond all reasonable doubt, the real object of the London & South Wales promoters was to force the Great Western Railway to carry out its South Wales Direct Line, and to make certain concessions to the South Wales coal trade.\\"D S Barrie, The Barry Railway, Oakwood Press, Usk, reprinted 1983, Now the GWR saw the real possibility of a competing line being build, and hastily put together a Parliamentary Bill for its own direct line. Both schemes were submitted for the 1886 Parliamentary session. The promoters of the London and South Wales Railway, no doubt seeing that their objective had been achieved, withdrew their Bill. The GWR Bill Accordingly, the Great Western Railway promoted a Bill in the 1896 session for a line from Wootton Bassett to Patchway. At 30 miles in length the line would reduce the South Wales to London journey by ten miles. It would also by-pass the Box and Wootton Bassett inclines, and relieve the heavy congestion between Bathampton and Bristol. This last was so difficult that quadrupling the line had been considered, \\"an impossibly costly proceeding\\" according to MacDermot. The Act for the South Wales and Bristol Direct Railway was passed on 23 July 1896.Robertson and Abbott say 7 August 1896. MacDermot simply says 1896. Construction A contract for the main part of the construction was let to Pearson & Son Limited on 21 October 1897, in the amount of ¬£986,000.Frederick J Husband, The South Wales and Bristol Direct Railway: II, in the Railway Magazine, April 1902 The major work was the Sodbury tunnel, which was constructed from seven vertical shafts as access to the sites of the ends of the tunnels had not been excavated at first. The contractor used a remarkable number of steam locomotives in the work: 50 were in use at one time or another (but not simultaneously), reflecting the volume of earth that was moved. Excavated material amounted to five million cubic yards.Frederick J Husband, The South Wales and Bristol Direct Railway, in the Railway Magazine, March 1902 Opening The first section of the line was opened to goods traffic on 1 January 1903, and from Badminton to Patchway and Filton, also for goods traffic, on 1 May 1903. On 26 June 1903 Colonel H. A. Yorke of the Board of Trade made an inspection of the line over two days; BoT approval was a requirement before the operation of passenger trains was permitted. Yorke approved the line but insisted on a general speed restriction of for three months. Use of the Westerleigh loops by passenger trains was refused for the time being as the junctions were not ready. The entire route of was opened to passenger traffic on 1 July 1903.Rex Christiansen, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain - volume 13 - Thames and Severn, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1981, A large marshalling yard was built at Stoke Gifford, with ten sidings capable of holding 500 wagons. From Stoke Gifford a spur ran to Filton, towards Bristol. Intending that the line should be suitable for heavy mineral traffic from South Wales as well as express passenger trains, the steepest gradient was made at 1 in 300, and no curve of less radius than one mile; this was achieved by some heavy earthworks as well as four large viaducts, one near Somerford over the Avon and the Malmesbury Branch, and three near Winterbourne. The Chipping Sodbury Tunnel () was built under the ridge of the Cotswolds between Badminton and Chipping Sodbury, and the Alderton Tunnel () at Alderton east of Badminton.Cooke gives the length of Sodbury Tunnel as . Stations were built at , , , , , , and , and water troughs laid near Chipping Sodbury.MacDermot, volume II, pages 425 and 426 The stations at Little Somerford, Badminton, Chipping Sodbury and Coalpit Heath were constructed with four tracks, with platforms on the outer two, to enable through fast trains to overtake slower trains.The Great Western Railway's New Route to South Wales, in the Railway Magazine, May 1903 The new line shortened the distance between London and South Wales by ten miles and was considerably easier to work over, enabling an acceleration of the express trains by 25 minutes, and allowing much greater loads to be carried by the coal trains from Stoke Gifford. (The gradients in the Severn Tunnel remained the limiting factor there.) The original Parliamentary Bill for the line proposed a branch to the Severn and Wye Joint Railway, which would have run more or less parallel with the Bristol and Gloucester line of the Midland Railway. The proposal was withdrawn by arrangement with the Midland Railway, and it was agreed that a short spur connection could be made at and another south of , to connect it with the joint railway, and exercise their old running powers from 1846 and 1848 over the intervening of the Midland line. The two spurs referred to opened for goods traffic on 9 March 1908. On 1 July 1903, four South Wales expresses each way were altered to use the Badminton Line: the best of these reached Newport in 2 hours 33 minutes compared with 2 hours 57 minutes formerly. On 4 August 1903 a first part of the old Up Flying Dutchman from Bristol was altered to leave Temple Meads at noon and run over the Badminton line to arrive at Paddington at 2 o'clock, the speed for the being . This was the first regular two-hour train between London and Bristol. Mineral railways at Coalpit Heath From 1832 a horse-operated tramway, part of the Bristol and Gloucestershire Railway, was constructed to connect coal pits in the vicinity of Coalpit Heath with the River Avon near Keynsham. By the time of the construction of the Badminton line the tramway had been converted to a standard gauge railway, and the Badminton line passed over it by a bridge. A siding connection was made to Coalpit Heath station. Westerleigh loops The loops at Westerleigh, connecting the Badminton line with the Midland Railway at Yate, had been opened to goods trains concurrently with the Badminton main line itself. The GWR wished to use the loops to operate an independent service between Bristol and Gloucester, using running powers over the Midland Railway. However the Midland argued that the running powers, so far as the Westerleigh and Yate connections were concerned, only applied to traffic for the Severn and Wye line. They insisted that any Bristol to Gloucester through trains should use their Mangotsfield line from Bristol, incurring higher charges for use of the line. The issue went to arbitration and then to litigation, but the loop lines were out of use while the dispute continued. It was finally resolved in 1908 when they were reopened for goods trains, on 9 March. On 20 October they were inspected for passenger operation by Colonel Yorke and on 2 November 1908 the first use by a through passenger train took place. During World War I the east loop was closed to save staff, from 18 December 1916 to 18 February 1919. Traffic on the east curve was never heavy, and it was closed from 10 July 1927. However, during World War II there were concerns that main routes might be blocked by enemy action, and the curve was reopened as an emergency alternative route. This included the provision of a new Westerleigh East Junction signal box; the curve was available from 16 August 1942 until final closure on 4 January 1950. Badminton station A covenant was signed between the Duke of Beaufort and the Great Western Railway undertaking that four passenger trains would make calls at Badminton station every day, and in addition any train must stop there if a first class passenger desired to alight. Avonmouth The Stoke Gifford direct line from Avonmouth was opened on 9 May 1910, running from Holesmouth Junction at Avonmouth to Stoke Gifford. This gave direct access for industrial mineral traffic to the West Midlands via Honeybourne.Christiansen, page 41 Malmesbury branch The Malmesbury branch had opened on 17 December 1877, running from Dauntsey station on the Great Western Railway main line. When the Badminton line was built, it crossed over the Malmesbury branch a short distance west of Little Somerford. In 1932 the branch was altered to run into Little Somerford station instead of Dauntsey. The branch connection ran alongside the Badminton line for some distance to reach the station. The altered passenger service started on 17 July 1933. The original route to Dauntsey was closed, but part of it was retained as a stub for wagon storage for some years. Bristol to Gloucester route modified By the 1960s the route for the majority of through passenger trains between Bristol and Gloucester was the former Midland Railway route through Fishponds. Very few through passenger trains used the former GWR alternative, through Filton and Westerleigh, except during busy periods at summer weekends. However it was decided to close the Fishponds line and divert all such traffic on to the Filton route, and this was done on 3 January 1970, from which date all such trains used the part of the Badminton line between Filton and Yate. Bristol Parkway station All the South Wales to London trains and all the Bristol to Birmingham trains now passed through Stoke Gifford, and it was proposed to build a new station there. As an out-of-town location, it would be attractive to motorists in the Greater Bristol area, who might drive to the station and park, continuing by rail. Accordingly, the station was known as Bristol Parkway, opening on 1 May 1972.Robertson and Abbot give 1 July 1972; this may have been a formal or ceremonial opening. Parking was free for some years.M E Quick, Railway Passenger Stations in England Scotland and Wales‚ÄîA Chronology, The Railway and Canal Historical Society, 2002 Line closure for upgrade The line between Wootton Bassett Junction and Westerleigh Junction was closed from 5 May to 6 October 1986 to enable extensive upgrading of the infrastructure. Slip coaches From May 1923, two down Fishguard trains slipped coaches for Temple Meads at Stoke Gifford. There was no passenger station there, and the slipped vehicles were taken on to Temple Meads by a train specially run to Stoke Gifford for the purpose. The trains concerned were the 8.45 am and the 8.0 pm from Paddington to Fishguard, and the slipped portions reached Temple Meads at 11.3 am and 10.20 pm respectively.C E J Fryer, A History of Slipping and Slip Carriages, Oakwood Press, Headington, 1997, In Table 10, Fryer shows one slip at Stoke Gifford in 1932 for Bristol Temple Meads; and two in 1938, one of which continued to Taunton and the other to Weston-super-Mare. The Bristolian To mark the centenary of the Great Western Railway, the company inaugurated an express train named The Bristolian in 1935. The westward route from London to Bristol was conventionally via Bath, but the return journey was over the Badminton line. The timing was 105 minutes each way non-stop.Keith Farr, Castles of the West, in the Railway Magazine, August 1998 Station closures The area served by the line was sparsely populated, and after World War II patronage of the intermediate stations fell away. On 3 April 1961 they were closed to passenger trains, with the exception of Badminton. Most of the intermediate goods services were withdrawn in the period from 1963 to 1965. The closure of Badminton station was delayed by the undertaking given to the Duke of Beaufort when the line was authorised, that four trains would call daily, but closure finally took place on 3 June 1968. Stoke Gifford yards were closed on 4 October 1971. Topography =Gradients= From Wootton Bassett Junction the line fell generally at 1 in 300 to Little Somerford, then climbing at the same gradient to Badminton.

It is considered to be the largest cellar complex in the country. The complex as a whole started as an underground limestone quarry in a wine-growing area of present-day K≈ëb√°nya in the Middle Ages. Later wineries and beer breweries were established on the premises and they continued to use some of the underground spaces. During the Second World War, the dimensions of the complex enabled it to be used as a covert aircraft engine assembly plant and a civilian hideout. Since 2008, K≈ëb√°nya Asset Manager Jsc. organizes free guided tours annually (during Saint L√°szl√≥ Days), which introduce visitors to both the complex and the Havas Villa (erroneously also known as the Dreher Villa), one of the most notable properties connected to it. The underground complex is one of the locations that are participating in the European Heritage Days. The floor area of the complex is variously estimated to be somewhere between and the combined length of the tunnels is estimated to be around . Corridors wide and halls high are common in it. The deepest part is approximately under the ground surface. The nature of limestone makes the spaces of the complex moist and moldy, and some parts are actually heavily flooded by groundwater. Currently the bulk of the tunnel system is the property of the K≈ëb√°nya district government (through its company K≈ëb√°nya Asset Manager Jsc., K≈ëb√°nyai Vagyonkezel≈ë Zrt.), a small portion is still owned by the Dreher Beer Breweries, who still actively uses some of the cellar spaces, and other small areas are in use by wineries. As of 2007, the K≈ëb√°nya tunnel system was not under architectural protection. The complex is sometimes referred to as an \\"underground city\\" or as an \\"underground world\\".  Name  In Hungarian, the tunnel complex is known only as the circumlocutions k≈ëb√°nyai pincerendszer (cellar system of K≈ëb√°nya), or k≈ëb√°nyai alag√∫trendszer (tunnel system of K≈ëb√°nya), using no capitalization as per established orthography rules. The complex is also often metonymically referred to as the \\"Dreher cellars\\", the \\"Dreher cellar system\\", or the \\"brewery/beer cellars of K≈ëb√°nya\\", by association with the Dreher Beer Breweries which was a main user of it. This is an example of pars pro toto, as the brewery never came close to using the full extent of the complex. The otherwise unnamed limestone quarry sites which formed the network of tunnels gave the later municipal district, K≈ëb√°nya, its name, and k≈ëb√°nya is in fact the sole Hungarian word for \\"quarry\\". Non-Hungarian individuals (especially divers) or media sometimes call the cellar system the \\"K≈ëb√°nya Mine\\", the \\"Kobanya Mine\\" or even the \\"Kobayna Mine\\" (a clear misspelling), as if this was the actual name of the mining sites, but technically speaking this is a misnomer (and a case of totum pro parte), as the sites never had K≈ëb√°nya as a formal name in any manner, and so the capitalized noun K≈ëb√°nya can only refer to the 10th district of Budapest in Hungarian. The only semantically correct way to refer to the K≈ëb√°nya quarry sites is to use the redundant form k≈ëb√°nyai k≈ëb√°ny√°k (literally, \\"the quarries of Quarry\\").  History  = Limestone mining = The tunnel system originated as an underground limestone quarry in an area which was known as K≈ë√©r (roughly \\"Stone Vein\\") in present-day K≈ëb√°nya. The area's name appears as Kewer (or K≈ë√©r in modern Hungarian orthography) in a royal charter written by B√©la IV (in which he donated a piece of land to the city of Pest), a name of a high hill. This evidence suggests that the area was used as a source of limestone from at least the 13th century, but it is likely that the area provided limestone even in the Antiquity. The exact variant is known as Sarmatian limestone, which was formed from the deposits of the Pannonian Sea in the Central European Sarmatian stage of the upper-middle Miocene era, approximately 11.6‚Äì12.7 million years ago. Anton Dreher Sr. (id. Dr√©her Antal), one of the first prominent users of the tunnel complex The K≈ë√©r quarry's activity have risen significantly in the early 17th century, and then experienced even more heightened output in the 19th century, as it provided limestone for the construction (or renovation) of some of the most prominent buildings in present-day Budapest; * the Parliament, * the Sz√©chenyi Chain Bridge, * the Citadella, * the Fisherman's Bastion, * the Matthias Church, * the State Opera House, * the Hungarian Academy of Sciences's building, * the Margaret Bridge, * ELTE's University Library and Archive, * the Royal Hungarian Ludovica Home Defense Academy's main building, and * the Castle Hill Tunnel's fa√ßades. The quarry served as a material source for many of the buildings of Pest which were built after the devastating flood of 1834, as well as for many of the villas of Andr√°ssy Avenue. It is likely that the name of Feh√©r √∫t (White Road) was the result of the presence of white limestone dust, as the road was the main route of transportation from the quarry sites to the Pest construction sites. = Winemaking and beer brewing = Even when the quarry was still in active production, routine mining practices, cave-ins (due to the inadequate mining techniques used) as well as the groundwater penetration caused parts of it to be abandoned continuously. Above the quarry there were large vineyards from the 17th century on, and so wineries and wine merchants started to use the abandoned sections, making them more akin to purpose-built wine cellars. Postcard from 1928, showing the Dreher Brewery Combine which used groundwater from under the tunnels While winemaking ceased in the area because of the large-scale European \\"phylloxera plague\\" of the second half of the 19th century, beer breweries also settled in the area to exploit the tunnels. P√©ter Schmiedt was the first to establish his K≈ëb√°nya Beer House Company (K≈ëb√°nyai Serh√°z T√°rsas√°g) on the premises in 1844. The company continued to use some of the underground spaces as fermentation cellars, and drilled deep wells to exploit the limestone-filtered, clean groundwater under the quarry tunnels for beer production. The Austrian businessman and brewer Anton Dreher Sr. (known in Hungary as Antal Dr√©her) bought Schmiedt's company and its related assets in 1862 to eliminate competition and to expand his Austrian brewery company, Klein-Schwechat Brewing House (Klein-Schwechater Brauhaus), and continued to use portions of the underground spaces as cellars. The brewery site became known simply as the Steinbruch Brewery (Brauerei Steinbruch), reflecting the German name of K≈ëb√°nya. In the following years, Dreher's son, Anton Jr. bought up and integrated the neighboring rival breweries that were also settled in the vicinity. In 1907, this K≈ëb√°nya site became an independent company, led by Dreher's youngest grandson, Eugene (Jen≈ë) Dreher, as Antal Dreher's K≈ëb√°nya Beer Brewery (Dreher Antal K≈ëb√°nyai Serf≈ëzd√©je). The Dreher family's companies were the most significant developer and producer of pale lager beer up until World War I. In the 1920s, the brewery controlled 70% of the beer market in Hungary. In the 1930s, the Dreher Brewery Combine have already acquired almost all of the neighboring breweries: the Haggenmacher Brewery, the First Hungarian Stock Brewery, and the Capital City Brewery, leaving only the Civic Brewery independent. Meanwhile, due to the general instability of the tunnel system, limestone mining was officially banned in 1890, although the system was still used for acquiring limestone as late as 1911 to repair the Reformed Church of Kecskem√©t, which was damaged in a 5.6 Mw earthquake the same year. = World War II = An area of the complex showing vertical ground separation (the pipe was for the transportation of barley used in the malting process) During the Second World War, due to fears of Allied bombing campaigns, parts of the complex were used as a covert aircraft engine assembly plant most likely by the Danubian Aircraft Factory (Dunai Rep√ºl≈ëg√©pgy√°r), the enterprise responsible for the domestic license production of the Messerschmitt Me 210C heavy fighter (designated as Me 210Ca-1 in the Luftwaffe), which were to be either delivered to or fully assembled in Germany. The workers were able to produce more than 200 engines until production was relocated into Germany as Red Army troops came close to Budapest. Other, smaller aircraft factories also used the complex during the war. Throughout the war, especially during the Siege of Budapest, the complex also acted as a shelter for civilians. At least one specific hall, which was referred to as a \\"chapel\\" (k√°polna) by the miners, served as a place of worship to hold Sunday masses during the siege. = Postwar abandonment and cave-ins = All of the abandoned tunnel system of the quarry and the Dreher Brewery cellar system (along with the Dreher family's company) was nationalized in March 1948. In the next year, the brewery was united with other nationalized companies as well as being renamed, and the premises became known as Site No. 1 of the K≈ëb√°nya Beer Brewery (K≈ëb√°nyai S√∂rgy√°r 1. sz√°m√∫ telephely) in the communist era. After the transition to market economy, in 1992, the now-private company acquired the rights from the Austrian legal successor of the original Dreher company to use the Dreher name again, and became Dreher Beer Breweries (Dreher S√∂rgy√°rak). Between the 1950s and the early 1970s the mining tunnels and the central mine courtyards (m√©lyudvar) of the √ìhegy area were filled with construction debris, meters of communal waste, and earth to rehabilitate land, which then gave place to the Hungarian-Soviet Friendship Park, today's √ìhegy Park. In the evening hours of 6 June 2004, a cave-in occurred in the park, killing a 62-year-old man; the victim had fallen into the wide and or deep pit that formed under him. The victim died because of the toxic gases of the rotting waste, not from the fall. This caused a roughly one hectare part of the park to be fenced off citing soil stability issues. Even before this incident, the park had at least two minor cave-ins. The problem was finally mitigated in 2012 (involving the help of a GHH LF 4.1 mine front loader), costing the district government 90 million forints ( US dollars), and on 5 December 2012 the fence was removed and the area was restored to the public. = Rediscovery and reappropriation = Currently the bulk of the tunnel system is the property of the K≈ëb√°nya district government (through its company K≈ëb√°nya Asset Manager Jsc., K≈ëb√°nyai Vagyonkezel≈ë Zrt.), a small portion is still owned by the Dreher Beer Breweries, which still actively uses some of the cellar spaces. Other small areas of the complex are in use by wineries. The most prominent human activity in the past decades within the tunnel complex was the commercial growing of edible mushrooms in some sections, generally in corridors and smaller halls. However this practice was outlawed by European Union regulations and so mushroom production ceased in the latter parts of the 2000s. Starting from 2007, the complex hosts guided walking tours as well as diving tours, cycling and running competitions and other recreational events. In 2012, the complex was used as testing grounds for the capabilities of the portable REGARD Muontomograph by a group of Hungarian scientists and engineers from E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University, the Wigner Research Center for Physics, and the Budapest University of Technology and Economics, to demonstrate the use of muon tomography in geophysical surveying of underground structures. On 21 February 2014, a physical geocache was hidden in the tunnel complex. In March 2015, the Hamburg Fire and Rescue Service visited the complex as part of their \\"4. LLG 2.1\\" training course, in the EU's Exchange of Experts initiative. In 2015, the record-holder Austrian freediver Christian Redl dived in the flooded parts of the complex for a GoPro promotional video. = The S1 Project and future plans = In the past decades, the K≈ëb√°nya district government developed ideas about the future use of the Dreher Brewery premises and the tunnel complex under it, such as operating a dark ride in the tunnels. In 2005, the district government has envisioned a project which would turn the premises into a cultural and entertainment venue with a theme park, this became known as the S1 Project. The code \\"S1\\" refers to the historical brewery premises; as \\"beer brewery\\" is s√∂rgy√°r or s√∂rf≈ëzde, and the premises were known as the no. 1 production site of the brewery. The project anticipates that the premises would contain a musical stage, an event hall, galleries, studios, clubs, coffee houses, restaurants, a beer museum, a mass transit stop, and hotels among other things. The concept also calls for the construction of apartment buildings in the area which would provide thousands of apartments. The development of the project would involve using the tunnel system in some form, possibly being opened up by artificial ravines. The K≈ëb√°nya Asset Manager Jsc. was in talks with Austrian historian G√ºnter Bischof, whose involvement resulted in three project plans submitted by four architectural firms; Erick van Egeraat Architects (EEA), Zoboki Design & Architecture (ZDA), Sporaarchitects, and Naos Architecture. The preparation of the S1 Project is being done by the K≈ëb√°nya Asset Manager Jsc. in the framework of Budapest's medium-term development program, the Podmaniczky Program, with the financial support of the EU. The project was a part of the EU's brownfield rehabilitation program MISTER (Military and Industrial SiTEs Reuse) as well as the Interreg III B-level CADSES (Central European‚ÄìAdriatic‚ÄìDanubian‚ÄìSouth-Eastern European Space) cooperation, but did not gather enough interest from potential investors. In 2009, the cost of the realization was estimated at 120 billion forints ( US dollars), while the S1 Project area was valued at 5 billion forints ( dollars). In 2012, more than two-thirds of the involved real estate was the property of the district government, with the remainder being the property of a few private companies. Administering the complex costs the K≈ëb√°nya district government around 70‚Äì80 million forints (‚Äì dollars) annually.  Structure  One of the halls = General characteristics = While intricate, the K≈ëb√°nya complex can be divided into two general, interconnected areas: a larger, somewhat more mine- like part which is in district ownership, and a smaller, more cellar-like part which is in private ownership, although usually these are considered as one single entity in public discourse, since they had the same origins. The tunnel system was originally a slope mine with gentle inclinations, which used the room and pillar method for the limestone production. The shape of the passages and excavation halls has a comb-like pattern. The complex has multiple levels within, and (due to cave-ins, tunnel closures and floodings, along with the poor mining documentation) its full extent is not fully surveyed or mapped. Even so, it is considered to be the largest cellar complex in Hungary. The floor area of the complex is estimated to be either around , or . The combined length of the tunnels is estimated to be or , according to different sources and estimations. Corridors wide and \\"church-like\\" halls high are common in it, with some of the halls reaching sizes of in height and in width. Some of the taller halls were later divided into two levels with reinforced concrete slabs. There is at least three halls there are referred to as \\"chapels\\" (k√°polna), these are named after major world religions. One such chapel hall was originally an open mine court which was covered with brick arches. The average depth of the tunnels under the ground surface is around . The deepest part of any tunnel or hall is approximately , measured from the ground surface above it to the bottom surface of the tunnel. However, one of the flooded machinery halls of the Dreher Brewery reaches into a depth of roughly , but it is unclear if it could be considered as part of the tunnel complex. There are ventilation shafts above some of the tunnels, these are in diameter and generally long. The average density of rock around the complex is . The air temperature is around (according to other sources, , or ) throughout the complex. The complex originally had dozens of entry locations, some of them are: * B√°nya Street entry (B√°nya Street 35‚Äì37), the current main entry point * Halom Street entry * Havas Villa (aka Dreher Villa) Despite being abandoned, the complex still has working lighting, including some underwater floodlights installed in flooded areas to enhance diving. = Subnetworks = The whole complex that is often referred to as the \\"K≈ëb√°nya cellar system\\" is in fact a grouping of one large, intricate tunnel network with two main parts, and a few isolated, smaller tunnel systems. These are largely under three well-defined areas of K≈ëb√°nya: √ìhegy (Old Hill), √öjhegy (New Hill), and the Dreher Brewery premises, now known as the \\"S1 Project area\\" or just \\"S1 area\\". The main subnetwork, the Dreher/S1 Project network, starts at the intersection of K≈ër√∂si Csoma Road, Kolozsv√°ri Street and J√°szber√©nyi Road (known as the \\"Tight Corner\\"; √âles-sarok), and continues along J√°szber√©nyi Road and Magl√≥di Road as far as T√©glavet≈ë Street. This part of the subnetwork is more than long, and it is connected to the other part under the vicinity of the Vineyard Guard Tower (Cs≈ësztorony) next to √ìhegy Park. The second part is surrounded by Harmat Street, Ih√°sz Street, Halom Street, Bebek Road and Halom End. The cellar floor area under the Dreher premises is around , with a combined passage length of . The depth from surface to the cellar grounds is about . According to different sources, the temperature is about or . One of the biggest isolated tunnel systems is the one which is under √ìhegy Park (the former Hungarian-Soviet Friendship Park), along Szl√°vy Street, facing the end of Sz√°raz Street. Some of it were filled with construction debris, meters of communal waste, and earth to rehabilitate land. This network is almost long and deep. It was roughly long before the cave-in mitigation works done in 2012. Sources also give the following post-mitigation characteristics: the tunnel system has a floor area of , with tunnels wide and high; the thickness of rock and soil above the tunnels is between . The air temperature is around . The √ìhegy tunnels were continuously reinforced since 1996. Two, way smaller tunnel \\"systems\\" are located alongside Algy√≥gyi Street and Kocka Street, as well as at the intersection of K≈ë√©r Street and Petr≈ëczy Street. = Flooded areas and wells = Pit water is a permanent feature of the tunnels Due to the hygroscopic (water absorbing) nature of limestone and the presence of groundwater, some of the deeper parts of the complex are permanently flooded, and even the unflooded parts have moist, moldy walls and flowing or pooling pit water. The flooding is generally present around the wells that were used by the Dreher Brewery. Some flooded areas are deeper than from the surface of the water, these could only be accessed by technical, cave, or wreck divers. There are four areas of flooding and 5 diving spots within, of which one does not require technical/cave/wreck diving qualifications and can be dived with only OWD qualifications. The flood areas as identified by their original Dreher well (k√∫t) names: * Cs√≠r√°ztat√≥ k√∫t (Sprouter Well), approximate depth: * Kert k√∫t (Garden Well), approximate depth: * Lyukas k√∫t (Hole Well), approximate depth: * Park k√∫t (Park Well), approximate depth: ‚Äì one of the two diving spots requires only OWD qualifications Other, unflooded wells include Champagne k√∫t (Champagne Well) and Hip√≥ k√∫t (Hypo Well). The water temperature is around , or according to other sources,, or , and it is generally very clean and clear (aside from small floating debris from decaying equipment and considerable silt deposits in some halls), providing good visibility for navigating around with flashlights.  Current uses  Partial map of the complex with designated running paths and temporary facilities marked From time to time, the complex or the Dreher brewery buildings are used by filmmakers and other artists for their projects, including music videos and commercials. The most notable examples are the 2015 American action comedy film Spy, which had its opening scenes shot in the complex, and the 1989 Hungarian art film Meteo, which features the subterranean spaces in a post- apocalyptic manner in some scenes. The complex hosts or hosted sporting and recreational events such as: * guided visitor tours ** public tours organized by K≈ëb√°nya Asset Manager Jsc. (annually since 2008, during Saint L√°szl√≥ Days in June) ** private tours organized by the urban exploration and urban architecture blog Falanszter (roughly monthly) * the MOF√âM Underworld Kupa (MOF√âM Underworld Cup) bicycle competition, part of the Mountainbike Challenge organized by Merkapt Maraton Sport Center (annually since 2010) * the BBU F√∂ld Alatti Fut√°s (BBU Underground Run) and the Halloween Run events organized by BBU Organizing Bureau (2015) * organized diving tours, with both open-water (with OWD or AOWD qualifications) and penetration/overhead diving, organized by Tit√°n Diver Club and School (TBK Divers), Aquanaut, and Paprika Divers  Portrayal and study  Multiple television and webcast documentaries have featured the cellar complex, such as: * Segye Tema Gihaeng: Heonggali (World Theme Travel: Hungary; with Hangul: ÏÑ∏Í≥ÑÌÖåÎßàÍ∏∞Ìñâ - ÌóùÍ∞ÄÎ¶¨) with Han Soo-yeon, a 4-episode South Korean travel documentary by EBS * L√°thatatlan Budapest (Invisible Budapest), a Hungarian webcast series by Heti V√°lasz (in season 1, episode 7, Egy kisebb v√°rost is el lehetne rejteni K≈ëb√°nya alatt) * Budapest Underground, a two-part Hungarian TV documentary by Filmdzsungel (in part 1) * the Hungarian BudapestScenes webcast series (in the episodes titled Az 1944-es k≈ëb√°nyai f√∂ld alatti rep√ºl≈ëg√©pgy√°rt√°s √©s annak √©l≈ë szemtan√∫ja, Rezs≈ë b√°csi and A k≈ëb√°nyai pincerendszer, mint √≥v√≥hely) Katalin Zsoldi, a doctoral student of ELTE's Department of Cartography and Geoinformatics made a 3D visualization of various underground structures in Budapest, including the cellar complex.

He has been credited with flying the final combat mission of World War II in a North American P-51 Mustang against a military airfield near Tokyo on August 14, 1945 (August 15, 1945 local time in Tokyo). In his later years, he became well known for his reconciliation with the Japanese and for his work in helping veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). He was the author of four books, including Of War and Weddings, an autobiography. On January 29, 2014, Texas Governor Rick Perry honored Yellin's military service and commitment to help veterans by making him an honorary Texan. Early career Jerome Yellin was born in Newark, New Jersey, the son of a real estate developer. His family was Jewish. After graduating from high school in Hillside, New Jersey, he worked night shift at a steel mill, saving money before starting college. On December 7, 1941 the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. Two months later, on his 18th birthday, Yellin enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces. World War II Experience Yellin started his aviation training at Thunderbird Field II in Scottsdale, Arizona and later graduated from Luke Field, Arizona as a fighter pilot in August 1943. Flying P-40 and P 47 Thunderbolt fighter planes, his training continued based out of Hawaii. On March 10, 1944, 15 miles off the coast of Haleiwa, Oahu, Yellin parachuted out of his P-40 at 5,000 feet after the engine failed and he spent 9 hours in a life raft before being rescued. He was assigned to the 78th Fighter Squadron, 15th Fighter Group. President Franklin D. Roosevelt met with General MacArthur in Hawaii in July 1944 and Yellin was chosen by his commanding officer, Jim Tapp, to fly with him in an aerial show for the President. On March 7, 1945 he landed his P-51 on Iwo Jima after the first of three airfields was secured. For the remainder of the battle for the island, Yellin flew strafing and bombing combat missions in support of the Marines who were fighting the well-entrenched Japanese soldiers. Additionally, he led his squadron on combat missions against Japanese forces on the nearby island of Chichijima. On April 7, 1945, he participated in the first land based fighter mission over Japan. In all, Yellin flew 19 dangerous very long range (VLR) missions from Iwo Jima attacking the Japanese mainland and providing air cover to B-29s on bombing missions. He was co-credited with shooting down a Mitsubishi A6M Zero, along with his wingman, 2nd Lieutenant Daniel Mathis, with probably destroying another Zero, and with damaging an Aichi E13A (Jake). He was an exceptional pilot who flew over one thousand hours of missions in various aircraft. Yellin was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross with an Oak Leaf cluster and the Air Medal with four Oak Leaf clusters. Here is an interview with Lt. Col. Scott Weaver, author of \\"The Pilots of Thunderbird Field\\", and Captain Jerry Yellin and about his training at Thunderbird Field. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcILdeXNFfs Final World War II flight Yellin's final combat mission was executed five days after the U.S. Army Air Forces Boeing B-29 Superfortress Bockscar had dropped a second American nuclear weapon on Japan, on the city of Nagasaki. Yellin flew along with another pilot, First Lieutenant Phillip Schlamberg, who was piloting a second P-51 as Yellin's wingman.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nTkkNdMZ7o Department of Defense Video interview of Captain Jerry Yellin on Iwo Jima, March 21, 2015 The two men were executing their mission against the airfield at or about the time that Emperor Hirohito announced Japan's acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration, wherein Japan would accept allied terms for unconditional surrender. Yellin and Schlamberg did not hear the military's attempted radio broadcast alerting them that the war had ended. Immediately after carrying out their mission against the airfield, Yellin and Schlamberg banked steeply into a cloud cover. Yellin emerged from the cloud cover, but Schlamberg had disappeared, apparently shot down, and became the final known combat death of World War II. Schlamberg's body was never recovered. Short on fuel, Yellin began his four-hour flight back to his home base on Iwo Jima, where he learned that the war had ended. Actually, other missions returned the day after Yellin's including a B-29 bomb wing based in the Marianas, the combined US and British Pacific Fleet aircraft carriers, and Japanese interceptions of B-32 Dominator reconnaissance aircraft over Japan up to the 17th. However, Yellin's mission may have been the last flown by VII Fighter Command from Iwo Jima, and the last mission of the war itself. In an effort to place the final days of the War in an accurate historical context, it should be pointed out that Yellin and Schlamberg took off for their historic mission from Iwo Jima on the morning of August 14, 1945, hours before Emperor Hirohito took to the airways to announce Japan's surrender. The emperor's famous \\"Jewel Voice Broadcast,\\" occurred about the time that the two P-51 pilots were carrying out their final military mission, making their mission, apparently, the final mission of the war. Other post-war military skirmishes occurred in the days after the Jewel Voice Broadcast. But the war effectively ended on August 14, 1945 [August 15 in Japan], when the Emperor announced the Japanese government's acceptance of the Potsdam Accords, making Yellin's mission the last known combat mission of the war. In fact, August 14, 1945 [August 15 in Japan] is recognized as Victory over Japan Day, or \\"V-J\\" day, in recognition that World War II effectively ended that day. At 703 PM, August 14, 1945, just hours after Yellin's final mission, President Truman announced Japan's surrender to the nation, setting off celebrations all over the United States, including in New York's Times Square. Although a handful of military skirmishes took place after Japan announced unconditional surrender to the world, those skirmishes technically took place after the war had effectively ended. World War II officially ended on September 2, 1945, with the Allies accepting Japan's formal written surrender documents on the decks of the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay. The Last Fighter Pilot The story of Yellin's final flight is told in the book The Last Fighter Pilot: The True Story of the Final Combat Mission of World War II, by author Don Brown, published on July 31, 2017. Yellin was a contributor and wrote the foreword for the book. Don Brown & Yellin discuss the book The Last Fighter Pilot at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library, August 3, 2017. Yellin and Brown appeared together to promote the book's release and to discuss Yellin's final, historic mission at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library on August 1, 2017. They appeared again together on August 3, 2017, at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum in Yorba Linda, California to discuss the book and Yellin's experiences in the war. On June 11, 2018, the popular magazine and website Townhall named Last Fighter Pilot as one of \\"10 World War II Books Every American Should Read.\\" Reconciliation On a business trip to Tokyo in early 1980, Yellin described seeing the Japanese as other than the enemy for the first time. In 1984, Yellin's younger son moved to Japan in what would be a life changing event for father and son. The younger Yellin settled in Japan, married a Japanese woman, and bore Jerry three Japanese-American grandchildren. The children's other grandfather had been assigned to a kamikaze squadron in the last days of the war and initially rejected the wedding of his daughter to the younger Yellin. But after learning that Jerry was a P-51 fighter pilot and had flown combat missions on Iwo Jima and against Japan, he told his wife to arrange the marriage so that the blood of a brave man could flow in the veins of his grandchildren. The two older men became friends for the remainder of their lives, and through the bonds of family, Yellin went \\"from hatred to love\\" of the Japanese. He traveled extensively to talk about peace and reconciliation and his autobiography is entitled Of War and Weddings. In 2010, Yellin returned to Iwo Jima for the first time as a civilian to participate in the joint Japanese-United States Reunion of Honor ceremony commemorating the soldiers from both countries who fought in the historic battle. He also traveled to Iwo Jima in 2015 and 2016 to participate in the commemorative ceremony. Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Yellin was honorably discharged from the Army Air Forces on December 19, 1945. He returned home suffering from restlessness, depression, and suicidal thoughts due to Posttraumatic stress disorder, though the affliction would not be recognized as a medical entity until 1980. In 1975, at the urging of his wife, Helene, Yellin learned Transcendental Meditation (TM) which helped to alleviate his PTSD symptoms. He became an advocate for TM as treatment for PTSD and founded Operation Warrior Wellness as part of the David Lynch Foundation to teach TM to veterans suffering with the illness. The David Lynch Foundation has established the Jerry Yellin Resilient Warrior Fund to honor Yellin and to raise scholarship funds to teach TM to soldiers and first responders suffering from PTSD. He also co-founded Operation Warrior Shield with CMSgt(ret) Edward W Schloeman to teach TM to veterans and first responders. He traveled throughout the United States to talk about his experiences with PTSD and TM. Books by Yellin In addition to his autobiography, Of War and Weddings and The Last Fighter Pilot: The True Story of the Final Combat Mission of World War II, Yellin published three other books: The Blackened Canteen is a work of historical fiction based on a true event that occurred on June 20, 1945 when two American bombers collided in mid-air on a bombing mission over Shizuoka, Japan, killing all 23 airmen on the planes. At great personal risk, the remains of the American airmen were buried by a Japanese farmer who subsequently erected a shrine to honor both the American and Japanese killed in the raid. Many years later, in 1971, a Shizuoka citizen learned of the raid and the memorial erected in 1945 and began an annual ceremonial service for the dead Americans and Japanese that continues to this day (citation). Yoko Ono wrote that \\"having campaigned for peace for many years, this beautiful story strikes a deep chord with me. I hope it will become more widely known around the world and inspire other people, too.\\" The Resilient Warrior is a book describing Yellin's struggle with PTSD for many years after returning home from the battle field in 1945, how learning TM in 1975 saved his life, and how TM can help others suffering with PTSD. The Letter is a novel about the divisiveness of religion and politics. Actor Troy Evans (actor) wrote about the book, \\"As a WW II fighter pilot Jerry Yellin knows a few things about threats to humanity, and this nation. In The Letter he uses his considerable insight to strike a major blow against religious bigotry, hatred, and intolerance. If you are not concerned about the invasion of American politics by religious extremists, you will be when you finish this intriguing novel. I love this book!\\" Yellin is also featured in The Last Veterans of World War II: Portraits and Memories by Richard Bell. Spirit of '45 and The Iwo Jima Association of America In 2010, Yellin worked with actor Ernest Borgnine and U.S. Senators Daniel K. Inouye and Frank Lautenberg to get Congress to unanimously vote for Spirit of '45 Day, honoring the men and women of the WWII generation, which is observed during the second weekend in August and coinciding with the anniversary of the end of the war and Yellin's final combat flight. As the national spokesman for Spirit of '45, Yellin traveled the country, speaking in support of Spirit of '45 Day and veterans. He appeared with Scarlett Johansson, the grandniece of Phillip Schlamberg, to promote the Spirit of '45 mission. Yellin was a member of the Iwo Jima Association of America. In 2018, he was posthumously awarded The Major General Fred Haynes USMC Legacy Award to honor his \\"many years of service educating thousands on the Battle of Iwo Jima‚Ä¶ensuring future generations of Americans will remember the legacy of what happened on that small volcanic island known as Iwo Jima.\\" Personal life Yellin married Helene Schulman in 1949 and the couple were together for 66 years. Helene Yellin died in 2015. They had four sons, David Yellin, Steven Yellin, Michael Yellin, and Robert Yellin, and four grandchildren. Three of the grandchildren live in Japan and three live in the United States. Yellin was an amateur golf champion in New Jersey and was on the United States golf team in the 1965 Maccabiah Games in Israel, winning a silver medal. In the 1960s and 1970s, while living in Florida with his family he was a well known tennis umpire. He was a chair umpire for World Championship Tennis matches played in Hollywood and Aventura, as well as at the WCT finals in Dallas. Jerry also was an umpire at the 1969 US Open (tennis). Death Yellin died from lung cancer at the home of his son Steven in Orlando, Florida, on December 21, 2017, at the age of 93. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery on January 15, 2019.Jerry Yellin, fighter pilot in last combat mission of World War II, dies at 93 The Washington Post, December 21, 2017.
